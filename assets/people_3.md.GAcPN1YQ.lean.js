The musicians are up there with The Caledonia Soul Orchestra. Check out live performances on YouTube."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspired","review":"I had the unique opportunity to see Van at the Fleadh Festival in New York several years back for two consecutive nights. The songs from The Healing Game were the focus of these shows and, hearing them for the first time at those concerts, they literally blew me away. This album is on par with the sprirituality of Avalon Sunset and Enlightment, but with greater edge. As far as Van's studio albums go, these three are the best! I recommend this album highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fame Factor aka Great Set of Lungs...Great Set of Lungs","review":"Who is the Rasputin-like character in Van's camp who has himutterly convinced that Brian Kennedy's voice is akin that of thebacking vocal ladies on Live in Belfast?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lean mean music machine","review":"Van runs the musical gamut from A to Z (also, his output can run the gamut from A+ to F). The 90s for him have been like the 80s for Joni Mitchell--creatively uneven but still always worth a try. Morrison comes out ahead in this comparison by virtue of his eye-popping prolificness - with him, more sticks to the wall because he throws so much of it.The Healing Game is a pivotal album in this cycle--it's tight, concise, with a crisp, understated sound. The songwriting is lean also--less visionary and more intimate. Most importantly, the album works as a whole, something that most of Van's more recent works have failed to do. This one's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van In Cool Mode","review":"While it's not up there with his best work, The Healing Game is a very enjoyable Van Morrison album. It's a more cool Van here - -which is a very good thing indeed. \\"Fire In The Belly\\" and \\"Buring Ground\\" are standouts here, but all the songs are good. If you are a casual Van fan, then this is a good album to pick up to experience his unique brand of Celtic wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van","review":"Really???

Buy this instead of \\"Magic Time\\" or anything else since 1997. At least Van still has the \\"Fire in the Belly\\" on this one. Best track: \\"Rough God Goes Riding\\"...for the sheer passion that Van seems to lack these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Collection of Powerful Stories","review":"Fr James Feehan as an experienced preacher knows the value of powerful stories in the pulpit. 'Story Power' is his contribution to the preachers and teachers who look for such readymade stories for illustration. The book consists of 125 stories neatly organized under 25 headings. There is a wide variety among them from fables to personal witnesses. Most of these stories end with a humorous twist so much so one cannot help reflecting upon the truth presented. Anthony De Mello was wise when he said, 'A story is the shortest distance between a human being and truth'. The book is an excellent resource for preachers.Xavier Thelakkatt"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Mean It's Not Okay To Sleep With My Son's Fiance???","review":"The premise of this book is that if you're a cold locked-up-hearted middle aged man, sleeping with your own son's fiance is not the way to go about livening up your tired & frosty life. Well, OBVIOUSLY! It's a rather plain novel about people with no boundaries and the \\"damage\\" their impulsivity and lack of sense can cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"It have always wondered what goes on in a person's mind to make them suddenly derail their entire life. That is what attracted me to this book. It was interesting and so sad at the same time. Worth the kindle daily deal price. Not sure I would have felt the same way about full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"How shameful","review":"that I feel compiled to write a review for this exquisite work, with so few adequate words at my disposal. I purchased this novel as A Daily Deal, without the knowledge that it would consume a day and a half, straight through, with only brief pauses to honor the necessities of life! Beware. This is not an easy read, not emotionally or intellectually. It is poetry in novel form.....and so few of us have the abilities necessary to read poetry well. You will learn to, however, once this story takes hold of you. A true masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The disturbing fallout of passion","review":"The narrator of \\"Damage\\" sets the scene early on, showing the reader how so many aspects of his life were built upon the expectations of others. His work and family life are conventional but he feels removed from his own expectations and indeed from the happiness he feels is not part of his life.When the narrator meets his son's latest girlfriend, she ignites in him a feeling of extreme connection that makes him feel part of the world again. The ensuing moral dilemma, and its tragic consequences, provide the framework for \\"Damage.\\" The book is deceptively short, but I found myself pausing at the end of chapters to digest what had been presented. While disturbing, the book is also profoundly sad. The narrator regrets the consequences of his actions but believes that his connection with Anna transcended the limitations of his world.A thought-provoking read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damage","review":"This book is very disturbing. It is written without emotion and very depressing. I really cannot recommend this book for at least in my opinion it is not something that I would have chosen to read had I totally realized how dark it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!!","review":"This book is a very slow read and it was really boring. I didn't care at all the way it was narrated either. The only good part of the book is that it finally eneded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is simplicity powerful or dull in this book?","review":"The story of Damage is a great story, but it was fairly predictable. However, I still like the ending, how the protagonist fades into bright white seclusion. The story is powerful but without sophistication of writing style and is sometimes even a little dull. Whether it's intentional or not I cannot decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"big mistake","review":"I mistakenly bought this book through the Kindle Daily Deal - I mistook it for another novel with the same name. It was depressing. I guess maybe that I could give the writer an extra star for making me feel as crappy as all of the characters felt in the book, but that was definitely a feeling I don't want to feel again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damage Control","review":"After seeing the movie, I had to read the book. The movie (with Jeremy Irons) was incredible and the book was even better! It is a very dark, twisted, controlled and emotional story. It is a love triangle in the strangest (and saddest) of ways... Josephine Hart writes a story that I couldn't put down and couldn't stop talking about for weeks! If you like out of the ordinary tales that make your heart pound and your mind spin, you will enjoy this book. I also recommend her second book, \\"Sin\\" which is equally compelling and hypnotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and disturbing, but fascinating","review":"When I read this novel, I was mesmerized by it until the end. A terrific story of a dangerous obsession that will both haunt and disturb its readers. Even though the conclusion is inevitable, the manner in which the affair is discovered and its aftermath comes as a shock! Extremely well written, (especially considering the female author tells the tale from the father's perspective) this novel was utterly fascinating. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mapping The Internal Landscape","review":"Damage is about truth. Damage is about love. Damage is about an honesty so revealing it's frightening. Josephine Hart examines an english man's search for fulfilling the 'internal landscape' of one's soul, and the need to fill an emptiness through another; no matter how selfish the need becomes. Damage is about stripping away the outside facade and exposing the bare reality of that fulfillment. Damage is about the courage to see beyond society and tradition, and in doing so, the painful reality of those actions"},{"rating":"1","title":"At least its better than her other so-called novels.","review":"Hart's clipped,stark call it what you will style is interesting...for the first few pages. It becomes increasingly obvious that this is not an artistic choice but a choice of necessity. Poor Ms.Hart has precious little to say or add to give her main character the breath of life (called depth by others). That said this is a novel full of promise which having perused her other efforts is never realised...it seems Hart is unaware of her strengths as a writer, for there are strong passages in this book but it is clear that she lacks self-awareness and maturity as a novelist. If you liked this novel do not read her other work or it will open your eyes to the limitations of her style and her intentions as a novelist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Erotic","review":"Ms. Hart knows how to spin a tale from everyday situations. There is the politician - well his settled with his picture perfect family until the arrival of a woman - the woman who his son loves..he falls for her and then begins the destruction...Quoting one of the lines in the book, \\"damaged people know how to survive\\". This is the thread of this richly deep poignant tale of love, lust and destruction.I read this book at a stage of depression so I really could not relate to it as it makes you feel all the more vulnerable and bare. This book tells things like it is. Well done Ms. Hart!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some People Do Not Understand","review":"I must say that I read this book when I was 15 years old. I appreciated the depth of it then, and I do feel bad for those that do not grasp what the author is getting at. One person called it 'plain', but she is telling a plain story and making the emotions and and circumstaces real to you. And to David: I have also read The Secret History by Donna Tart. I enjoyed it and found that it parallels with Damage. I found myself thinking that Josephine Hart and Donna Tart must be the same person. I can't imagine that you would see the amazingness in one and not the other. Now 17, I am very grateful that I was able to see the depth of both of these novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Genius","review":"Clever in everyway possible ! completely worth the money and more !

They are doing it as a goof. I'm a rock guy and will not like Carpenter tunes whether they are amped up or not.If Metalica did a Streisand cover, does that make it good?

The thing starts off badly with \\"Goodbye to Love\\" sung like an acid trip dirge, then gets worse with an Asian pidgin-English sendup of \\"Top of the World\\" that sounds like the seventies flop group \\"Pink Lady\\" attempting a comeback. The rest of the album is as bad or nearly so, with only the Michael Sweet rendition of \\"Let Me Be the One\\" earning a passing grade.

This is a great story, although I do not like the Mom and Grandpa in the movie, as well as those in the series, but still a classic. This is ever the more valuable in that, this original movie is rarely shown on television anymore. Earl Hamner rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas DVD","review":"A family tradition every year, switched from an old VCR tape to a new DVD. I am loving it will last our family many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Christmas Story From The Great Depression!","review":"I've been doing a study of the Great Depression. Part of it includes watching The Waltons to put faces on those tough times. I also watched Spencer's Mountain, the movie that preceded the series.Coming into this, I wasn't really sure that I wanted to see different actors portraying these family members that I've grown to love. I didn't know if it would spoil the series for me or not. It didn't. I enjoyed just spending time with this family, as always.The story takes place on Christmas Eve in 1933. It has 'hints' of what is to come in the series that so many of us enjoyed for years. It's a great feel-good movie. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"waltons christmas homecoming","review":"We enjoyed watching this movie that we had never seen before andenjoyed comparing the characters to the ones in the walton tv series.Amazon is a great place to find your needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent Christmas classic.","review":"For those you would like to know how Christmas was celebrated during the depression see this movie. The story or writing isn't the only great thing about this fillm. The acting to this film, the prequel to the Walton TV show is outstanding in every role. Film was Patricia Neal's comeback after suffering a stroke."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Family Christmas Treat","review":"This is a much more relevant precursor to THE WALTONS than SPENCER'S MOUNTAIN. It's a good story and an enjoyable introduction to the TV series. All of the characters from the series are present though the adults are mostly played by different people.The time is Christmas of 1929. The country is in the grips of the great depression. John Walton has had to take work out of town in order to support his family in the Blue Ridge Mountains. He is trying to get home for Christmas and is overdue. There is a blizzard and the radio tells of a bus crash. All are worried as they await the return of the father. The oldest son, John-boy, is sent out to try and find him, having several adventures along the way.There is nothing particularly exciting but it is wholesome, enjoyable and worth watching. The family comes together to take care of its own and do the best they can in trying circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family movie","review":"This is a great family movie, to share at Christmas and through out the year, very kid friendly as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Moive","review":"Love this moive watched it every christmas reminds me of when i was a kid watching this with my family lots of memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Homecoming","review":"Not able to review this item as sadly the disc will not play in my DVD player.

I had not seen it & expected it to be different but was thoroughly disappointed. The parents just DID NOT suit the rest of the family.The mother had a smoker's voice which was rather comical considering the wholesome family values she was supposed to stand for. She looked to be simply a Holywood actor without an ounce of motherliness to her. Her husband fitted about as ill in his role.This is certainly not one we will bother to keep on our shelves let alone watch again for pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to a Simpler Time","review":"The Homecoming is a wonderful movie.

Was bought for ergonomic reasons; the touchpad has helped alleviate elbow and shoulder problems.I recently gave this keyboard to my wife, as her laptop keyboard and touchpad had stopped responding. She loves it, and I miss it! I will probably buy a replacement.Highly recommended, with some small reservations as listed below.Positives:- great touchpad.- after getting used to it, good key feel with positive feedback (short key travel)- good size, and good ergonimics- replaces two wires (mouse and keyboard) with one usb connector- no special drivers required; just plug it in and it worksNegatives:- Key placement took some getting used to (insert / delete / page up / page down).- Initially had some problems with repeating keys (debounce), but this went away with use- stiff left and right mouse keys (but they are hardly needed as the touchpad itself handles left and right click)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, poor quality","review":"I bought one of these keyboards some time ago. Its good points are its small size and the integrated trackpad which eliminates the need for a separate mouse.Unfortunately, the mouse tends to suddenly receive focus while you're typing. It has happened to multiple people with this keyboard, so it isn't a matter of accidentally hitting the trackpad while I type.Now, however, that is no longer a problem since the trackpad has failed completely. I am able to use a separate mouse, but that begs the question of why I bought a keyboard with integrated trackpad in the first place. I am buying another keyboard with integrated trackpad, but I will avoid Adesso. Read Adesso's reviews, not only on Amazon but on other sites. They have a terrible track record for customer service as well as a poor quality product.In sum, this keyboard is a great idea. I just wish it worked as designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revival in America","review":"I study the First and Second Great Awakenings and this was a good translated primary source. The introductory biography was helpful atlthough a detailed index would be a great addition to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"IRREVERENCE AT ITS BEST","review":"I thought I was a wiseass, but once I read this New York kid's views and opinions on the city he lives in, I realized I am not even close. His witticisms can get a bid on the \\"edgey\\" side, but in the grand scheme of the work, the author's writing comes through with flying colors. A+. I am looking forward to his future works."},{"rating":"2","title":"outrageous","review":"I'm glad to see somebody finally has the cojones to tell it like it is about New York. Dave Frattini doesn't pull any punches, and his unique writing style conveys a message in the one-of-a-kind GENERATION X savior faire."},{"rating":"1","title":"In over his head","review":"I bought this guide a few years ago, when I moved to New York City. I expected a studious, serious guide to all the subway stations. What I got instead was a lazy recount, as some reviewers have mentioned earlier, that's heavy on cutesy-schmaltzy and light on the exploration.You'd think that Fratini would worry about actual addresses for recommended food spots (some stations, when Italian fare is seemingly unavailable, have a KFC or a C-Town as recommended grub spots).Not even the decor, which the author dedicates intense treatment, gets a factual overview. We know it's some coat of arms, but we don't know by whom.Quite a disappointment. You can try to be snarky, but then you'd have to get at least some facts straight and do some research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant and Brilliant","review":"Rarely does a movie handle death so smoothly. Moonlight Mile shines as we see all the stages of grief without dwelling on the grief itself. Jake Gyllenhall, one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, is both vulnerable and strong, reeling us in. Hoffman and Sarandon display their usual brilliance. This is seriously the greatest movie of all time. It has something for everyone: drama, humor, romance, and suspense, and above all it shows that losing a loved one doesn't have to end one's own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful movie","review":"I agree with the other poster, this should have gained a better recognition. I had never heard of it until today, I happened to catch it on tv, unfortunate because I had to deal with commercials. A sad movie but excellent acting, a lot of familiar faces and a wonderful story. Will own this soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long mile to go","review":"Good premise and story line, for the most part a decent dialog, outstanding acting (except for the sleepwalking Gyllenhaal), so what's missing? What's missing is plausibility. A movie about grief doesn't have to dwell on it, but it MUST show early on that the grief is there. If this is done properly, the viewer will accept even the most outlandish behavior as a character's way of dealing with that grief. Kasdan did it brilliantly in 'The Big Chill,' with a mere thirty seconds of Glenn Close sobbing in the shower. Silbering failed to do anything like that in \`Moonlight Mile,' so the eccentric parents and the goofy fiance seem uncaring and preoccupied only with themselves. I couldn't overcome it, even though I tried for a good while. By the time Gyllenhaal bares his soul in court it's way too late; what might otherwise have been quite affecting seems only outlandish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, But Beautiful","review":"There are some wonderful things about \\"Moonlight Mile\\", director Brad Silberling's semi-autobiographical new film. In presenting the grief of losing a loved one in a violent and sudden manner, it's nearly flawless. The moments of quiet humor piercing the claustrophobic clouds of grief felt so genuine; I found myself often thinking, \\"That's really what it's like!\\" The bewilderment, aimlessness, and absolute confusion in the face of tragedy are brought vividly to life by the wonderful acting of Susan Sarandon and Dustin Hoffman, as the parents of a murdered girl, and by Jake Gyllenhaal, the fiance. These performances are absolutely outstanding in their juxtaposition of pain, anger, sorrow, helplessness, and the desire to carry on. While the film occasionally seemed melodramatic and patchy in a way that I can't yet really identify, it was still very affecting. \\"Moonlight Mile\\" is well worth experiencing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Moonlight Mile has a great story (and script) and superb acting from everyone. It's a change from Silberling's Casper, but like the friendly ghost movie, it too is a well done and enjoyable film."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated and corny","review":"I hardly ever give a movie one star, but this movie was just so overrated. I really wanted to like it. Three powerhouse actors, and what seemed like a good story. But the director uses so many corny devices that it is almost painful to watch. For example that seen where Jake is being dragged around the post office by his dog. There were numerous others. I am sorry but this movie is one of the years disappointments. The acting was good, very good. But even the talent and effort of these magnificent actors couldnt save this cheesy, cornball drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable and Implausible","review":"Great actors aside, this movie seemed implausible and made me feel so uncomfortable, not from grief but from implausibility. The couple that lost their daughter uses the to-be son-in-law, over and over through various things that they ask him to do, we see him be used. No regard for his grief, which we can only guess he must feel.It was painful to watch this. Then to add pain to the \\"using\\" and total disregard for this man, we see him being attracted to a girl he just met. This is 4 days after the death. Absolute nonsense. It wouldnt happen. No man who was in love and about to be married and had his fiance die, would do it. Implausible, ridiculous.There is another scene that is implausible and so uncomfortable. One of the dead girls close freinds flirts with the fiance. Too much.At this point, I left. Waste of time, no point, uncomfortable \\"non standing up for himself\\", people \\"using him\\" and implausible. Dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only watchable because of Jake Gyllenhaal","review":"This movie is only watchable because it stars Jake Gyllenhaal. I will watch anything he's in, lol. This movie is very unrealistic and slow. Jake Gyllenhaal barely talks throughout the whole thing, and as another reviewer called him \\"sleepwalking Gyllenhaal\\", it's so true. It's like he is sleepwalking throughout the whole film. He is like this in many of his films, but he's so attractive that I couldn't care less. I also got annoyed looking at Ellen Pompeo throughout the whole film. Her face annoys me and she looks way older than Jake. Also, Jake and Ellen had sex when they barely knew each other........and just days after his Fiancee died. So unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painful Experience","review":"This could easily be the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life. I have seen THOUSANDS of films in my lifetime, and none of them approach the absolute insanity of this film. The diologue was worse than an awful dub of a Chinese film. The entire theatre burst out laughing when Dustin Hoffman yelled, \\"Why don't you fix the window!\\" I've been told Siberling wrote to get over a tragedy that happened in his life, and maybe that clouded his judgement and kept him from realizing he wrote a turkey. I cannot warn you enough. Do not go see this film. Do not rent this film. Do not purchase this film. If so you will realize why Sarandon has stayed with Hoffman all these years, and I can imagine you will have to struggle to keep your lunch down. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moonlight Mile","review":"I watched it just to see Ellen. It was a bit shallow. Ellen acted just as if she was Meridth in GA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moonlight Mile","review":"I really did not like this movie at all. The reasons for the characters doing the odd, or on the verge of stupid things, were all because of really dumb routes of logic that they used to evaluate their situation. I guess you could say that the movie was okay because the purpose is to get a reaction from the audience, but if these were real people I could not see being their friend because of how strange they are. More like they were not written as believable characters. The movie came in good condition as promised and i recommend buying from this seller, but I did not like the movie that I bought of my own rotten decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting people.","review":"Moonlight Mile starring Susan Sarandon, Dustin Hoffman, and Jake Gyllenhaal is a overwrought drama to say the least. The characters lack compassion and I just couldn't get into the static storyline. The only actor and character I felt was real and adorable was a pre-Grey's Anatomy star Ellen Pompeo. Pompeo was a bright shining star even back then, she nailed every scene - and why is Katherine Heigl getting all the attention, Pompeo is the real deal! This movie is stinker, the only saving grace is well you know who."},{"rating":"1","title":"hamper","review":"Although it was a beautiful hamper, I found that the wood broke after about 3 months but not before the lining for the hamper ripped.

I was quite surprised to hear some questionable language and behaviors on the game while my 6 year-old daughter was playing it. We have strict rules in our house about saying shut-up and/or stupid (or other put-downs). While she may know these words, she doesn't use them, and playing the game hasn't changed anything. There are many classic disney movies that say shut-up and use the terms stupid and idiot. Unfortunately, we can't keep our kids in a bubble and they are going to be exposed to this. I wish it wasn't in an educational game, but at least I have the opportunity to hear it and talk about it with my daughter.

Unfortunately, Billy Boyle was a big dissapointment to me. The plot was very slow-moving, the characters were somewhat stereotypical, the mystery was not very mysterious and the excitement level was tepid at best. The biggest mystery to me about this book is why I bothered to finish it. Do yourself a favor and don't be misled by the mostly favorable reviews about Billy Boyle on this site."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like Billy","review":"Billy Boyle is an unlikely hero. He isn't on Uncle Ike's team because he's that good or that brave. He's there because he took advantage of a distant relationship to avoid going to the front lines. Only to find out that friendly Uncle Ike isn't going to spend the war in DC like he thought.Boyle has to deal with his own prejudice against the English and his own doubts because he knows that he was promoted to a position a little beyond his abilities. But he keeps working at it, even when his superiors seem to be working against him, through sheer determination.Benn dragged me along for a fun ride. It's not my usual genre and it's full of cliches, but it also had engaging characters and an interesting plan of the war that was well used in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful fun","review":"i was surprised to find that I enjoyed myself.

It turned out to be just the medicine I needed for a day home with a cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book hobbled by technical issues","review":"This is a problem specific to the Kindle version, but it's a doozy.The Billy Boyle books have a strange font that I haven't seen in any other Kindle books. It's oversize, not as readable, and I had to go to the smallest font size to get the size I had set previously (the second-smallest for all other books). The typeface and line spacing options have greyed out (Kindle 3) on the font size menu. And trying to increase words per line just increases the margins.Two thumbs down on implementation, though the story itself is so far so good! But I'm glad I didn't pay full price for a broken file."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pffttt!!","review":"What a disappointment! I had come to greatly rely on Amazon reviews because I usually find them to be far more accurate than the blurb on the dust jacket. I had also come to trust Soho Press for publishing great atmospheric mysteries. This book is a hodge podge of stereotypical characters. We have an Irish Bostonian, a glamorous English woman (also the daughter of a Knight) and a Polish Baron. How hackneyed can you get? There is also this really irritating running joke where the Bostonian has to explain his slang to the Baron. Methinks this book would do very well in middle America but for the more worldly, I'd suggest you give it a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK Start to a Series","review":"This is the first of a proposed series and it gets off to a pretty good start. It is generally based on historical fact and the author appears to get the mood right for Spring 1942 England. The story is a mix of counterintelligence and crime told by a former Boston detective army officer who is just trying to stay out of harm's way for the duration. One point I didn't like was the main character had flashes of insight during his investigation but the author didn't fully share them with the reader. This is dirty pool. I like books set during WW II so I'll give the next installment a try also.I was sorry to see this book didn't go over well in the more worldly quarters of the Dahka, Bangladesh literati set(see below)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate Portrayal and Likeable Characters","review":"A good writer makes you care about the characters he or she creates. In the case of Billy Boyle I was, at first, a little indifferent to the fate of Billy as he came off as a little casual in his attitude to the war. however, I later realised that Billy's perspective was just a little more parochial than we've come to expect in modern times and was perfectly in tune with the times being portrayed.After a chapter or two I became engrossed with how the mystery was to be solved, but more than that, I was interested in how the characters reacted to the situations and, when something untoward happened to two of the main protaganists I realised that I cared about their fates. A mark of a good writer.I would certainly reccommend this book to others and am eager to read more from James Benn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Boyle WW2 Mystery","review":"Although the book was well written, I just could not get into it. I thought it was very boring and mundane. Perhaps men would enjoy this book more than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs work","review":"I loved the premise of the story of a relatively new detective from Boston who has used his family connections to rise rapidly in status in both the police department and in the Army and is forced to solve a murder in England. Unfortunately, the back-story was ultimately much more interesting than the plot. I think if he could have pulled it off, James Benn was really onto something. However, the author fails to generate either much suspense or interest in any of the characters except detective Boyle and even he starts to wear on the reader after a while with his seemingly random personality shifts between a naive, unsure investigator and a seasoned pro. This was a free download but it did not entice me to want to read more in the series.

This is a well written book that makes me look forward to more books about Billy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Boyle-A fresh,new perspective.","review":"I found the fictional relationship between Billy and \\"Uncle Ike\\" and the undercover assignments given to Billy very believable and thought-provoking. The personal relationships and situations could easily have happened during this period. I liked the book so much that I gifted it to my Grandson, a WW2 buff and have read three more in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting read","review":"Overall, I found Billy Boyle to be a quick paced, exciting read. Benn does a very good job weaving fictional characters into real life events, which is the crux of the matter with good historical fiction.I would have given Billy Boyle a 5 star rating, but I did find Billy's \\"Just call me Billy\\" attitude to be a bit overdone- yes, that sort of thing would be considered a bit unusual in the UK, but I've seen/read this kind of persona in so many other stories that it's gotten a bit stale for me. \\"OOoo, the brash Yank is making the stodgy Brits uncomfortable with his directness!\\" Please.I have to add that, despite this minor irritant, I found Bill Boyle to be an enjoyable read that is enhanced by being woven into historical fact so deftly. I ecommend it to anyone who enjoys historical mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Boyle has it all!","review":"Billy Boyle is a WW2 Mystery Series, historically set in 1942 London.I loved it, Billy Boyle has it all!I found Billy Boyle to be intriguing and a very good read.This mystery includes not only an Irish detective, but also Eisenhower, traitors, treason and murder, a spy, and even a little romance and humor.I found Billy Boyle to be well written, the characters take on life and the book is filled with adventure, history and action. It is a wonderful mystery based on true facts from the war (which are well researched).Thanks Goodreads!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading and very enjoyable","review":"not only is the book well written, but it has a little something for everyone - mystery, history, intrigue, and romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't what I expected!","review":"First of all the cd had only 4 songs on it.

Anyone who thinks that they can come in cold, buy a book and have all the answers to pass the test is an idiot. If you don't do the hands on work you will not pass. If you combine this book with some hands-on real world experience you should have no problem passing the exam.

An easy paced collection from all that moody blues have played for their audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent compilation","review":"Although this is anexcellent compilation, I was somewhat disappointed with it. This is a Moody Blues box set and should be confined to the Moody Blues. There are a number of beautiful songs by Ray, as there were by Mike, which could have been included in the box set. The solo efforts of Justin and John from the Blue Jays LP could have been omitted. I feel there was too much focus on Justin and John and not enough credit given to Ray, Mike, and Graeme. I thought the bonus CD was excellent, especially A Legend Of A Mind. The live version sounded to me like a battle of the bands, definately a kick butt version. In my opinion, the bonus disc made up for my disappointment. Another awesome song not included on the Keys of the Kingdom CD was Highway. This is an excellent song which I crank everytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"great disk set!","review":"Bought this for my husband for christmas and We are very pleased to have alot of our favorite songs.

It's your typical formula with father gambles away daughter in a card game. Abigail was given to The Doctor aka Lucien. There isn't really much to the plot other than both characters growing sexually. This book contains strong sex, bondage as well as the sexual language was very strong. I like this book it's not bad it takes you on a sexual journey of 2 people it might be a little too hard core for some people though.*******************"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This book was an enjoyable read.

It's obvious that Bowie gave his seal of approval by writing the foreword, and then you are just left alone to enjoy the art. I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I bought this book, but it has become one of my favorite photo books I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arty or out of focus?","review":"I have to say that after all the hype I was very disappointed when I got my copy of this book. I have expected a fascinating glimpse of Bowie backstage. Instead I got a book with a load of out of focus pictures which, as an amateur photgrapher myself, I would have been too embarassed to publish. Maybe they are supposed to be arty, but they do nothing whatsoever for me. Come to think of it, if I got together all the out of focus shots I've taken of Bowie I might have a book of my own to publish. Anyone interested?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pics are great, text is sorely lacking","review":"I was VERY disappointed by this book. Yes, the pics are great, but it would've been nice to have some text to go along with them (i.e. background stories, behind-the-scenes anecdotes, interviews...)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cliche ridden ...","review":"I like Dennis Hopper and love Frederick Forrest. Neither of them are bad considering the atrocious dialogue and tired premise that they have to work with. They seem to be rolling their eyes at each other as they speak their lines.

Then I read On the Far Side of the Mountain and I thought that was better than the first. Then finally I read Frightful's Flight and I learned so much. I learned a lot about falcons and how to take care if them. I enjoyed this book and I thought it was a lot better than the first two. But I still think that this book is better to read when you're really bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good... but not as good as the first","review":"I really liked this book, but I have to say, it is not as good as the first book. This book is about Frightful becoming a mother, and pretty much most of her life. I liked this book alot, even though I didn't like it as much as the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Informative","review":"Having read the first two books about Frightful, My Side of the Mountain and The Far Side of the Mountain, I was anxious to read Frightful's Mountain. As in her other books, George weaves in important information related to environmental issues. While informative, the narrative is entertaining and suspenseful. The forward by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is a testament to how George's books have influenced many young people's lives over the years. Sam Gribley's care for the environment is an example we should all follow. Anyone who has ever lost, or had to give up, a beloved pet will be able to identify with this touching story."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too many","review":"I read \\"My Side of the Mountain\\" as a child. It remained one of the few children's books that I reread once a decade or so. Then I read the second book. Not as good, but sequels seldom are. Then I read this piece of excrement. Thankfully, I borrowed it from the library and didn't pay any money for it.Mrs. George takes her wonderful tale and turns it into this tiresome ham-fisted tirade against business and government. There's an awkward screed against one group or another in every chapter - with only a few of the \\"enlightened\\" not tarred and feathered.I used to be a fan. Now, I doubt I'll give my niece and nephew any of her books for fear they might read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for nature lovers.","review":"I liked this book a lot. In order to like it you have got to read My Side of the Mountain and then On the Far Side of the Mountain. The book starts with Sam Gribley releasing his falcon because he figured out that it is illegal to harbor falcons. This book is about how Sam's falcon, Frightful learns to survive in the wild and this book also has background on falcons.

I could tell that it was not going to lasat forever the first time I plugged my XACT unit into it. pushing the buttons on the unit or hitting bumps in your car puts pressure on the audio, antenna and power conections. The base lasted me 10 months, which is longer than I expected. I started getting cut-outs and garbled reception and plugging into a brand new base fixed the problem immediately. Since the base is the only way to power the unit or make it communicate with a stereo, I recommend finding the XACT unit with the car kit, instead of the universal kit or buying the XTR2CK, which looks like it comes with a much superior mounting device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howard Stern now available","review":"We had some issues with a lost shipment.

Originally a German sociological work from the 60's, it still holds up. The origin of the mafioso and how he differs from various \\"other state actors\\" is the most compelling part. Hess delivers his work without moralizing the mafioso, but changes a little as the book goes on. I don't know if he is trying to be objective or if he suffers from literary Stockholm syndrome. A very unique read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, light weight, good pair of shorts.","review":"I just recieved these shorts in the mail ahead of schedule. They are comfortable and light weight. However, be aware that they do not have pockets. These shorts are good for the price.

Otherwise, I am happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright","review":"I go to high school and my class color is purple.

I had some reservations about some of the advice about the 1st (attachment) stage. There is better info. in the Baby Book by Sears. But the description of the later stages was right-on.

I was excited to finally find a book with that didn't use eggs, casein, or gluten and ready to make something edible. Every baking recipe uses barley or spelt flour (which contain gluten). I should have never assumed that Wheat Free meant Gluten Free. My mistake! Live and learn i guess. I now have to look for gluten free vegan books to find recipes that my son can eat. The gluten free vegan is a good book, and I am really excited about BabyCakes Covers the Classics! It is a gluten free vegan baking book that uses mostly Bob's red mill mixes, because it is a pain in the butt (and really expensive) to have to buy 20 different flours and mix them together to make something that isn't even edible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent and tasteful..","review":"This is a great cookbook for the whole family. At first I had a hard time finding ingredients in the stores in my area and was very frustrated.I started ordering things on line and the more things that I baked and cooked from this book, it became the bible in my kitchen. Now I have found a health food store in my area that carry almost everything.My 1 year old (that has multiple food allergies) had his first bread (muffin) and loved every bite! He also LOVES the meat loaf recipe...I made it with ground turkey instead of chopped and it turned out fine.I usually make my own tomato sauce, but when I made the lady's red sauce..my family thought it was the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a true food allergy cookbook!","review":"As a mom of a child with severe multiple food allergies to wheat, egg, dairy, tree nuts, peanuts, and fish, I am truly grateful for this book. I own almost every food allergy cookbook published. But Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook is by far my favorite!! Most cookbooks labeled allergen free are written for the gluten free diets with subsitutions at the bottom. All the recipes in this book are truly written allergen free! There are great recipes that our whole family enjoys. Most of the time I have to cook seperate recipes to appeal to everyone--not anymore! These recipes are appetizing to my 6 yr. old and my husband who doesn't even realize he is eating healthy with these recipes. These recipes make meal time truly a family experience again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This book is very helpful in getting meal together that is allergen free. Sometimes you just need some dinnertime inspiration and it's nice to pick up a book and find that it is free of the offending foods for my family. I also like the chapter on snacks and afterschool foods. The corn muffin jammy suprises came out really well even with adding some cooked amaranth to up the fiber content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful if you're looking for gluten-free baking or easy dishes for kids","review":"*Be sure to check out sample recipe before you purchase this book.* I'm most disappointed with the baking recipes. My son has multiple food allergies and the most challenge I have is baking with no gluten, eggs or dairy. This book avoids wheat, but uses barley flour, spelt flour instead, both of those contain gluten. Also, if you're looking for recipe to cook for your toddlers/young children with multiple food allergies, this may not be the book for you. The recipes use many ingredients and most of them are not so easy. With an active toddler and food allergies, I don't have time to cook these complicated food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cookbook ever!","review":"This is my favorite cookbook of all time! The recipes can be a little time consuming (esp. if you have small children like me) but they are well worth the time spent. I have made the corn chowder--which my 18 month old couldn't get enough of--and the Greek salad dressing which tastes extremely authentic! I love her other salad dressings as well. The recipes use wholesome, healthy foods that are good for the whole family and you can generally substitute items that work for you (i.e. if you don't have a wheat allergy, you can use white flour, etc). My husband thinks I'm truly gourmet after making several of these recipes and I have passed the info on to all of my friends whose children have allergies. My 18 month old daughter has peanut, soy and chocolate allergies that left us wondering what we could actually feed her and this cookbook has given us the answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Wheat-Free!!!","review":"ughh..I suffer from wheat and nut allergies. many of the baking items include SPELT. I tried her suggested alternatives, but my batches came out so gross...my kids spit them out! the other baking items looked ok, but tasted like cardboard. also, i found only 2-3 kid-friendly dinner recipes...i am not sure what children are keen on chopped livers (or adults for that matter?) perhaps it is good if you don't have severe or multiple allergies, but do to my severe wheat and nut allergies, so many recipes are useless to me...maybe if your only allergies are dairy or soy, or eggs, this could be ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Allergy info","review":"This book is a God-send....It is simply written and products are readily found.

I recommend this for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really for food allergies///","review":"Can't tell you how disappointed I was when I opened the first page of this book and the recipe was full of items I am allergic to. I am gluten intolerant (nothing weird) and there seems to be barley in everything. Feel like this person was just taking advantage of the buzz on food allergies to publish a regular cookbook. Wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Allergy Cookbook on the Market","review":"Our family avoids milk, egg, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish due to my son's food allergies. The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook has recipes that avoid these 7 allergens plus wheat. One thing that I especially like about this cookbook is that Ms. Pascal explains how to add wheat back in to the recipes if you can use it. I have not found any other \\"wheat-free\\" allergy cookbooks on the market that do this.Many of the recipes have been loved by our entire family (including a toddler and a very picky eater). The Apple Pancakes (and its variations) are the best allergy-free pancakes that I have found. The Orange Zucchinni Bread and Banana Cupcakes were very tasty and original. I consider the Rigatoni with Italian Sausage, Peppers, and Onions and the Pasta Salad to be restaurant-quality. Very, very good.I would highly reccommend this cookbook to anyone with allergies similar to ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this for my nephew who is allergic to gluten","review":"My sister has reported to me that she has tried many recipes in this cookbook. Her son who is a very picky eater has enjoyed every dish. He especially liked the chicken nuggets.Thank you to the author for such a helpful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING This book may be dangerous for allergic people","review":"While the intentions of this book may be sincerely well meant, this book could be extremely dangerous to those with sensitive allergies. Many of the products are cross-contaminated and could be very dangerous to allergic people. My son has reacted to some of her recommendations due to the cross-contaminations. The book should of been reviewed in detail for medical accuracy since allergies can be life threatening. With all of the confusion due to the differing severity of allergic reactions this book misleads as to the safety of these products and recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best By Far","review":"In our family, we have one member who must avoid wheat and dairy, and another with multiple food allergies. While meeting these challenges, we like to eat well, using whole foods as often as possible. This is the perfect book for us. The recipes are easy and the directions simple.

I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not O.K. for Multiple Food Allergies","review":"Bought this book hoping I could stop making 2 menus for each meal because of my sons multiple food allergies. Some of the recipes are really good. However just about every one of them calls for either Spelt flour, Oat Flour, Oat Milk or Barley Flour.... and my son is allergic to these. So about half of the recipes I tried turn out horrible because I tried substituting on my own for these ingredients. Plus a lot of these \\"speciality\\" ingredients that the author suggests you keep in your pantry are realllly expensive.There's probably a better book out there. P.s. The recipes are not gluten free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Cookbook, A Life Saver for the Allergic Person!","review":"I just purchased this book a few weeks ago and I love it.

I got a bunch of cookbooks out the library that were \\"allergen\\" free, but this is the only one I have found that is free of all the most common allergies AND most importantly, is a great cookbook. I was surprised at how tasty all Pascal's recipes were, and her writing style is lovely, too. She loves food, it's clear, and loves eating and living in a healthy way, without it becoming boring or burdensome.I can't say enough about how great this book is. Very worth owning it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so helpful...","review":"I was dissapointed as the baking recipies all need egg replacer.

I need no gluten, no dairy, no corn, no vinegar. My husband needs also to have no eggs. There are 3 or 4 recipes (out of 200!)in this cookbook that I found useful. There are increasing numbers of people and their health practitioners who are realizing the vast problem of yeast in our typical diets, and this requires the elimination of all yeast, sugar and vinegar-containing products. These people are also realizing the overdose of corn we are all getting from corn syrup being in almost every product on grocery store shelves (seriously, other than the produce section try finding 10 products without corn syrup in a standard grocery store!) and thus many people now have sensitivities to corn and most of us should be cutting back on corn products anyway. Also, most corn now is GMO or contaminated by GMO which is a huge concern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Allergen-Free. Deceived once again.","review":"Deceived once again.This book is not allergen-free. There are many recipes that include spelt. On a wheat-free diet, spelt was on the first \\"forbidden food\\" list I ever received.The book, like many others claiming to be allergen-free, suggests substitutes. But if the substitutes taste as good, why include the wheat? (Because obviously the substitutes aren't as good.) But conveniently, the book advertises itself as allergen free, to get people to buy it.To falsely advertise a book as one thing, when it is something else, is just plain wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"The whole food allergy cookbook","review":"Ill conceived twaddle.

She does make a statement in the book that states \\"This cookbook avoids foods that cause food allergies, but does not address food intolerances.\\" I would not have bought this book had this been posted somewhere on this website.

Perhaps this work lost something vital in translation, but I found it dry and academic, lacking flow...the sort of thing about which Solomon said, \\"Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.\\" I don't give up easily, but when I asked myself \\"What does this paragraph mean? What is he trying to say?\\" for the 50th time, the answer was \\"I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!\\" Maybe I'll try again later, but life is short...

The good news is that it's finally being released on USA format soon.From what I've heard, detective Strachey (the terrific Chad Allen) & his partner Tim (the equally terrific Sebastian Spence) get in way over their heads on a high-profile case.

Julie Nisargand paints a beautiful mental picture with every page and brings you as close to the main characters as any novel I've ever read. I highly recommend this to anyone in their 20's and 30's struggling to find their place in love and in life. This is a book to read and pass on to someone you care about.

Then when she switched to a cheaper shampoo I noticed my hair did not feel as soft. My hair actually felt hard. Then I asked her what had she been using and she told me it was expensive. I will not use anything else on my hair. It really works for me. My hair have never felt this soft and it has so much life. I use the conditioner as well. Amazon has the best prices for this shampoo. It can be over prices at other places."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME PRODUCT!!!!!!!","review":"This product did an awesome job on my hair!!! My hair is coarse, dry, and thick. My desire for my hair style is straight. I used the caviar moisture shampoo and hemp straight conditioner(directions said leave in three to five minutes but I left it in for fifteen mins. because my hair is thick- then rinse) along with a little hemp straight balm (a little goes along way!). All three of the products have made my hair silky,soft,shiny,and moveable. Alterna hair care products are for all hair types including ethnic and chemical treated hair.

If I shampoo and conditioner with Redken or any other mid-priced hair care line my hair requires me to both blow dry and then straighten it to not have any frizzes or waves. With the Caviar line I can skip the straightening and just blow dry my hair and still get gorgeous results. Also, I have been growing out my hair for quite some time now and I am way passed my recommended hair cut date, but my hair still looks fine without many split ends.I would recommend this for people that are growing out their hair, live in a humid climate, or have naturally frizzy/wavy hair and like the sleek, straight look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds better now than in 1996","review":"I remember being somewhat disappointed when MF came out back in 1996, but mainly because it was being compared agaisnt none other than Ten Summoner's Tales.Now listening to it you can tell there is great quality and spirit behind the songs, great musicianship with real drums, real pianos, saxophones, cello's etc, and Sting's voice is in top form. The subject matter is sort of wintry, but in a nice way. I consider this Sting's last solo album, what came after was just a marketing move to sell more records, but in the process losing what was good about his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"As an educated musician and a music lover, I cannot understand some of the bad reviews given to this album. It certainly is a great recording. Sting's songwriting, is as always, excellent, and the song structures breathe maturity. The odd time phrasing of \\"I Hung My Head\\" is certainly a highlight. Some of Sting's most heartfelt and sad lyrics can be found on \\"I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying,\\" and some of his most earnest vocals on \\"You Still Touch Me.\\" As a drummer, I certainly am amazed by Vinnie Coliouta's expressive groove. This is amazing music, as is most of Sting's repetoire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and unsafe","review":"It took a considerable amount of time to receive this CD AND it was shipped in a thin plastic wrapping without any padding.

Sorry!","review":"This is by far Sting's worst album. No wonder it flopped: There are no good songs on this album and it's a shame considering how he came off with the dynamite \\"Ten Sumner's Tales\\" from three years earlier. \\"I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying\\" is just drab and without wit. The same can be said about the rest of this album. Sorry Sting! He is a great musician but this wasn't his year. HOwever his next two albums since then are absolutely phenomenal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A POETIC AND MELODIC TRIBUTE TO WINTER","review":"This is possibly my favorite album of Sting's. As a writer, I'd have to compare him to Wordsworth. \\"I Was Brought to My Senses\\" and \\"La Belle Dame Sans Regrets\\" show his awareness of the physical world and its effect upon the person. I also enjoy \\"The Hounds of Winter\\", \\"I Hung My Head\\", and \\"Mercury Falling\\". Sting manages to use double entendres in these songs that create irony and feeling for the listener towards his compelling characters. He has grown and matured from his angry days with The Police from songs like \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" and \\"Every Breath You Take\\", but he retains the creative tapestry of words like in \\"Fields of Gold\\" and \\"Shape of My Heart\\". Any true fan of Sting should enjoy and treasure this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album, far too underated.","review":"Sting is a wonderful singer/songwriter/musician. He has a knack of writing songs of incredible depth and variety. Capable of mixing different genres of music and making a whole, he is truly unique. And this album is a real masterpiece, no matter what it's detractors say. Each listening brings something new. Don't just listen to the vocals, but the instrumentation too. Branford Marsalis' sax, B.J.Cole's peddle steel and Kathryn Tickell's Northumbrian pipes and fiddle are worth listening out for. And the 12 page booklet contains all lyrics and some photos of Sting. This is an album which really does deserve to be listened to, and listened to more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sting's worst","review":"I've always been a BIG Sting fan but this one is his worst. 1985's Dream of the Blue Turtles has powerful songs as does 1987's Nothing but the Sun. They both have songs about all kinds of subject matter. Sting himself, on MTV's unplugged, even said he likes to take his music from every subject. 1991's Soul Cages even shows that. 1995's Ten summoner's Tales is even really good. But unfortunately, this one is a flop. Most of the songs are about lost loves. I've heard of artist's selling out to pop, but he has sold out to crap this time. I hope to see him get creative again in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sting is a gifted poet","review":"Sting has done it again. He has moved me in such a way! The song I hung my head is so descriptive that you visulaize it and feel for him. Sting has an amazing gift to us all. He is a very gifted poet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence as usual","review":"Sting is getting very predictable. Everytime he makes an album it tends to be very good. Mercury Falling is no exception, although it's a little more brainless than his other efforts. This is Sting just having fun. There's nothing innovative here. Irish lilts, motown funk, prog rock, even country and western. We've heard it all before. But it's entertaining, well crafted, cute and.. well ...it's Sting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've only listened to it twice","review":"Now Sting is one of my favorite singers and I've worn most of his CD's and tapes out. But this piece of mess was so bad, I've only listened to it twice. I've given it 2 stars because I like \\"Brought to my Senses\\" and \\"When We Dance\\" (which sounds a LOT like \\"They Dance Alone/Ceuca Solo\\"). Otherwise, the rest of the songs are completely unmemorable. Really, I can't remember any other songs on the CD. I've half a mind to use the CD as a coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy With This Product","review":"I gave this as a gift to my parents and they loved it. No complaints. They enjoy reminiscing and really loved Roy Rogers and Dale Evans so they get a real kick out of getting to see these shows again in their entirety, just the way they were back so many years ago. There are several shows included so they don't have to watch it all at once but can watch several espisodes, or just one. It made a great gift for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for those wanting more out of the backcountry!","review":"Great book with useful information for those wanting a little more out of their trips in backcountry of CA. Most of the book concentrates on The Sierras, which for me is a good thing. This book gives all the usefull information needed for making you trips a success. The book covers all the basics, but also touches upon going light, and proper nutrition which most guide books don't touch upon. Alot of the treks in this book has cross-country variations as well as side trips that will make your trips more interesting than the average trail type trek. The photos in this book are outstanding, and the easy nature that Paul writes makes the book very enjoyable to read.

I highly recommend it to other people who like to use books on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably Sting's worst","review":"I know this is contrary to what the reviewers are saying, but I didn't like the direction Sting took on this record. Most of the songs are slow, boring pop, with none of the jazz, raggae or new wave influences that made his earlier work interesting. The whole album is made very unpleasant by the chromatic harmonica that is laced troughout most of the songs. Maybe some people like the sound, but I found it to be awfully annoying.There are two good songs on this CD, but they aren't the two hits. If you think that the song \\"If Ever I Lose My Faith In You' is a great song, then this is the CD for you. Most of the rest of the material is along those same lines. Otherwise, stick to the earlier ablum like \\"Dream of The Blue Turtles\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imposible to watch","review":"This DTS Edition is not possible to see in any of my DVD players or Home Theatre......, its a shame but I feel like I waste my money here....Be sure before u purchase this kind of products that your stuff at home are ready for these technology...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"Sting's \\"Ten Summoner's Tales\\" in DTS format takes one of my favorite albums and makes it better than ever. I've had the original CD for years and was excited to see it in this new format. I've used my DVD player for movies for quite some time and love it but this is my first audio only product and...WOW! This CD makes all the money you've spent on speakers and elecrtonics worth it. Sit back, close your eyes and be enveloped in a musical cacoon. I love it, all music should be done this way. Crisp, clear and wonderful, A great album made even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Sting album","review":"This CD is probably not Sting's best, but it's definitely a great one! Fans looking for the rhythm in \\"The Dream of the Blue Turtles\\" or the textures and mixed feelings in \\"The Soul Cages\\", will not find it here, as this album is a paradigm shift in Sting's material.You will experience new rhythms and themes, not \\"usual\\" in a Sting album. The jazzy feeling and good humor however, are still present. Songs like \\"Shape of my Heart\\", \\"If I Ever Lose my Faith in You\\", \\"Heavy Cloud No Rain\\", \\"Seven Days\\" and \\"Fields of Gold\\" are probably the best ones this album. Not all of them are hits, but they are definitely worth the buy!Would've been 5 stars had they included the version with Eric Clapton of \\"It's Probably Me\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !!","review":"This is one of my favorite CD by sting. There isn't one song I do not like on this. There are 4 or 5 hits and most did not get alot of airplay back in the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Sting album","review":"For me, the thing that seperates very good albums from great albums is consistency -- can I listen to the entire album without wanting to skip any tracks? I've found only a few albums like that, but this is one of them.Despite the title, there are actually 11 tracks here, each one quite different from the last. But the album works, and is very consistent. I can't name a favorite track because they're all very good, though my least favorite would have to be \\"It's Probably Me\\" -- though I don't dislike it enough to skip over it.If you're new to Sting, this is the album I would recommend picking up first. Not only is it my favorite Sting album, but one of my favorite albums, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold on for some great ones","review":"Sting's album ten summoners tale's hits some high notes....quite literally.It includes the super hit Fields of Gold which is a timeless beautiful song, and the uplifting If I ever loose my faith in you- which is quite fun to listen to. It also includes the slow dramatic shape of my heart.Shape of my heart's music has since been borrowed by both Monica and Craig David.The CD has a lot of flow, and versatillity and prooves why even though we can't have the Police anymore, why we're glad Sting is a solo act. He can carry the show on his own as he prooves his with his deep mellow voice, and interesting ground breaking sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"11 Tales","review":"For any artist that could bring the still fantasy into a vivid tale of experiences, Sting has done so with Ten Summoner's Tales. Relationships could take the lyrics with titles like \\"If I Ever Lose My Faith In You\\". There are promises of the world that a significant other could bring in \\"Fields Of Gold\\", as it seem torn out of religious texts. The off-beat ultimatum of \\"Seven Days\\" as one man knows of his decision of destiny as he takes on the responsibility of protecting and tribulations on \\"It's Probably Me\\". Sting defines his feelings, his person and beliefs on \\"Shape Of My Heart\\". As compared to a card game, this tear jerker is the very depths of reason and an identity of oneself. This album is deeply rich with feelings and this above all other reasons frees one spirit for enlightment. The soul searching for Sting's project is enough for a book or movie as a journey through life and its mysteries of the pendulum."},{"rating":"2","title":"You might Want to reconsider","review":"Back in the day, I was a huge Police fan. When Sting went solo I followed right behind. But by the time Soul Cages was released I no longer felt the commitment that I once had. I would listen to friend's copies of Sting's latest releases, but never found it important to spend my own money. Then one day I listened to an old copy of The Dream of the Blue Turtles, and I realized all over again how much I loved his music. I went back and bought everything after Nothing like the Sun, and I have to say, Ten Summoner's Tales is one of those wonderful gems that too often get overlooked. I'm not ashamed to say it: \\"I was wrong!\\" If you were like me and thought you outgrew Sting, snag yourself a copy of this CD and prepare to reconsider. To say it is beautiful music is an understatement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I skimmed through the book in a bookstore.

Still listening to it, just as much as all his previous recordings, I am still moved by the song \\"I Was Brought to My Senses\\", time-signiature and Branford's solo; \\" I hung my Head\\" is a lesson in 9/8 time mastered perfectly by Caliutta; and perhaps one of the most moving and masterly-crafted piano solos ever in a Sting song (this, being said by a professional pianist) the late (too soon) Kenny Kirkland shines on \\"Le Belle...\\" I still think I listen to \\"Ten Summoner's Tales\\" and \\"...nothing like the sun\\" more often, simply because of every song on those are remenisent of an \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"Sgt.

Looking forward to his new one this Fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid performance and plenty bright","review":"Bought this to replace my 17\\" flat CRT monitor and it worked fine out of the box. It's really bright, and if you have ambient light issues with your monitor location, this will do the trick - I have it set at minimum brightness most of the time. My only complaint is that the darker colors seem a little washed out, but that may be because of its contrast ratio being a little bit on the low side (350:1) for what's available in today's monitors. I've never played games on LCD monitors, so I don't know if the 8 ms response time is making a big difference or not. One more thing - make sure you set the display to \\"clear\\" type vs \\"standard\\" type, because text appeared fuzzy before I discovered this setting in the display properties/appearance/effects menu. Without knowing about that adjustment, I would have returned the monitor thinking something was wrong with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC","review":"He's Freddie Jackson, one of the last of the true singers.

He puts this into perspective in a very unique way and makes it instructive for the way we need to share God's love with one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and uplifting Treatise","review":"Kreeft's volume is wonderful.He gave me a lot to think about as far as God's love is concerned.Importantly he outlines a profound and spiritually moving argument for the doctrine of the Trinity.I am always happy with Kreeft's insights on the usually complex subjects he writes about.I think that I will have to read the book several times over in order to properly digest its contents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skinamax","review":"This is a softcore video.

You enter the jounery with them. You hear the wisdom of the spirtiually elders and long with the creaking of the doors and beatiful pow-wow/drumming in the background. You get a great opportunity to hear the calling of the eagle out of the sky at wounded knee that was prayered out of the sky by Frank Fools Crow. The best part that makes me laugh is when Steve Wall and Harvey Arden go and see one of the elders. Steve doesn't have a chance to go into his spell when the elder tells them I know why you are here you lost your orginial instructations. Also when they go and see charlie Knight and he asks them each time when Ya Leavein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clutch continues with another great album to their growing catalog of albums.","review":"Clutch is a band you like or not. But to all the Clutch fans out there, Robot Hive/Exodus does not disappoint. It kinda picks up where Blast Tyrant left off. They've added a good deal of organ and keyboards but it only adds to their musical spectrum. The lyrics on this album are totally awesome, one of my favorite parts of a Clutch album. Neil Fallon always thinks up the most bizarre situtations to sing about, which makes Clutch such a great musical trip. Delware Destroyers, rocking with Dokken!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Cowbell!","review":"One of my favorite things is when a Band changes things up a bit while still remaining true to themselves. Clutch has a storied history of this, the departure of Elephant Riders from the bombastic rock of its predecessor.Here Clutch explores the \\"jam band\\" territory a bit with songs focusing on solid grooves and traditionally abstract lyrics. The result is something new from Clutch that takes its place in the pantheon of Clutch brilliance. They managed to combine groove driven elecric rock with a kick of southern rock while stirring it up with a lyrical acid trip.My perosnal faves are \\"The Incomparable Mr. Flannery\\" pure southern rock flavor, \\"10001110101\\" genius for its lyrics and blending of tempos withing one song, \\"Circus Maximus\\" for the same reasons- try to compare that with anything released today, and \\"10,000 witnesses\\" which comes as close as anyone has come recently in reviving while redefining the definition of pure southern rock fury. Plus, it has cowbell."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"great album,perhaps my favorite CLUTCH release,bonus live tracks are cool too.what i like most about these guys is they are constantly changing it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I've listened to this thing about 5 or 6 times today. Great stuff. My favorite song is easily \\"Gullah\\", a song they opened their Asheville, NC show with (even better live). Amazing how these guys continue to put out great stuff on their own terms, not to mention how much they tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking New Ground","review":"These guys have no two albums alike. The newest is no different. They've expanded their ranks to include an organ player, and written an album that is both heavier and stranger than Blast Tyrant, while also being more blues-influenced. I think these guys have been listening to their latest live album and learning from the sound on there, as this album has less guitar overdubs and layered vocals than previous records. They really break new ground on here with several songs, as well as rocking out as well as they have been since 1991. A perfect recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clutch impresses again and again","review":"\\"Tasty\\". That is how I would describe this album in one word, \\"Tasty\\". What is not to like about these groove heavy songs that clutch has been renowned for over the last 15 years. Neil tells the best stories with the best changes in inflection for effect. Dan and Jean-Paul rock one of the tightest rythm sections in the entire rock world. Last but certainly not least, Tim lays down some of the best guitar grooves I've ever heard. These guys are masters at their craft and it shows on every song that they put out. I also, really enjoyed the addition of the keyboards in this album. It gives the music an added classic feel at just the right spots.As an earlier reviewer put it, these guys deserve some much deserved credit for the quality of work they have produced, as well as the great live shows that they perform.I hope to enjoy new music from these guys for many more years to come. Long live Clutch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very cool","review":"Robot Hive is cool and intelligent with some great in-your-face guitar work. Definitely rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for listenable Clutch music","review":"If you're looking for an album that you can get on the first listen, forget Robot Hive. From the standpoint of listenability, this album is lacking. Where Blast Tyrant grabs you and takes you for a ride, this album bores you and makes you want to get off at the next stop. If this is your first Clutch purchase, you best choose \\"Clutch\\", \\"Blast Tyrant\\" or even the \\"Impetus EP\\". Hard rock and metal are supposed to make you proud to crank it up in the car. Not make you sink low in the seat and hide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. This is really horrible.","review":"A friend gave me this CD because he got it for free and hated it. I also hated it and threw it away. I think my friend is a total jerk for giving me crap like this. I guess this would be okay if you drive a Camero and wear a backwards baseball hat and a shell necklace. This type of music is a cultural dead-end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Clutch Album","review":"I started listening to Clutch when Transnational came out. I loved that album. When self titled came out, I almost gave up on them. It was such a departure from speedway league that I thought it wasnt the same band. Little did I know, they would evolve on each album. They improve their sound for each album, and you know what - IT WORKS. My favorite songs are still the earlier heavy ones like Far country, Shogun, Binge and Purge and Impetus, but as I have gotten older I appreciate all of their songs now. When you see songs like Burning Beard, Mice and Gods and 10001110101 live you will understand what I mean. Even though I love all Clutch albums, this has become my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"One more lager....","review":"Ok...Lets say your one of these Rock is dead types...from the seventies...or even the ninties from when Nirvana stormed onto the scene with the angst of ages. Ever hear of this band?Clutch is the End all be all of what can be called \\"modern pure Rock\\" when I say \\"clutch ROCKS\\" they effin' ROCK!!! They aren't even a Metal band and are worthy to bare the Horns!\\\\m/ >.< \\\\m/I LOVE this album...sure they had an album called \\"Pure Rock Fury\\"but they ARE! They SO are...recomended to those who simply love a kick ass rock band with no Image in mind. Find their web page and actually take a look at these guys... You'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album yet","review":"These guys are probably the most underrated band around. This album is a little heavier than the last few but at the same time also more technical. The keyboards are very prominent now, and I think they bring that extra element to the sound. I highly recommend this album.One of the great things about Clutch is that they work harder than any other band I can thnk of. They seem to put out a new album every 18 months or so despite the fact that they are touring like 250 days a year. And they are all quality albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deal with the Devil?","review":"This is an absolute masterpiece. There has not been a rock album of this magnitude in the past five years...period."},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as it gets","review":"Robt Hive/Exodus could be argued to be Clutch's best album. The band never ceases to amaze, as they reinvent their sound on every new album, taking songs to new levels, yet maintaing their signature sound throughout. There isn't a bad song on the album. Every one is on point. Some heavy, some groovy, some strange, all quality. Musically outstanding, lyrically genius as usual. Clutch is, in my opinion, one of the best bands currently touring in the world. If you have any of Clutch's other albums, this is simply a must-buy, no doubt about it. Get your evolution on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I thought this was a Kindle book and have no use for this. It is nothing I would be interested in.

It is very delicious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Approachable and mysterious","review":"I really love this album. My tastes run the gamut from Madonna to Van Halen to Mahler (you name it, pretty much). What I listen to most of the time is more current stuff, from dance/club stuff to college radio stuff and Bent, through this record in particular, seem to have this amazing balance that I don't have to be in any particular mood to enjoy. I've listened to it on and off over the last 5 years...it's so soothing, and still growing on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Recently I realized how often I listened to Bent's first album, so I bought Everlasting Blink. What a disappointment, gone were the sensuous vocals, cool riffs, and vibey flow of the first album. I just think Everlasting Blink is a bit of a bore, nothing jumped out at me, sounded very much like generic electronica muzak. Bummer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to stop reading once you have started with it","review":"Wow, what a life! Let's be thankful that there were people who kept insisting that Susan Travers' story be written while she was still alive. And thanks to Wendy Holden that story makes such fascinating reading that you find it hard to believe this is the story of a real life. I did not know much about the events of the Second World War that took place in Africa. So, while having been interested in the personal story of this fascinating woman, I got quite a bit more insight into the political events of that time as well. This part is definitely Wendy Holden's second major contribution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and self-aggrandizing","review":"I see that other reviewers have been impressed by this memoir, but I found it lacking on several fronts. The tedious details of hardships and battles failed to engage me. The author's poorly veiled pride in her many sexual exploits (for example with \\"her Pierre\\") seem to me unnecessary and in bad taste. I rolled my eyes at her failure to accept any responsibility for her own situation during the trial of being left with two \\"demanding\\" children (I think she called her sons this three times within two pages) and domestic help. Her many recollections of being warmly welcomed and sought after all over the world, as well as constant name dropping, reveal the author's humility as false.I didn't enjoy this memoir and wouldn't recommend it to others unless they have a special interest in WWII or the Foreign Legion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating look at French participation in the war in North Africa","review":"A great read, almost as much about love as about war. The book does illuminate a few things that I had not grasped before. That bad feelings between the Free French and Vichy forces lasted so long and were so strong, most of what I read just glossed over the issue after the Syrian campaign. That her eventual marriage to a NCO when she was a Warrant Officer so completely alienated from both groups, even from her friends was a surprising since most members of both groups were happy or at least willing to accept her before. As whole the book comes across as authentic and moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Only Takes a Moment","review":"Driven from his own country by a European anti-royalty faction after his father's death, Prince Lucien is running from Livorno for his protection. He slips away to an associate's cabin in the remote mountains of West Virginia. Gwendolyn Bennet arrives after Luc, entering her grandfather's retreat to greet a frightened man who believes she's an intruder. Their first rough contact sparks physical awareness at turns to sizzling passion. In this excellent Cinderella tale, McMinn weaves the outside threat of stalkers with the inside embrace of life.

Lots of unstable camera work. Much of the video was from the same few games.Audio: Narration was annoying. The same phrases were repeated word-for-word for the same player and for multiple players. It sounded like some sort of promotional video for NFL scouts.There was very little video from the better known names advertized for the DVD. Stabler - 3 to 4 plays. Newsome - 4 or 5.

I quickly learned that the author has very limited taste. If you purchase this book in order to help you decide what recordings to purchase you will miss great white jazz artists such as: Jimmy Knepper, Jimmy Raney, Bob Brookmeyer, Stan Getz, Bud Shank, Zoot Sims, Tal Farlow, Chet Baker, Pepper Adams, Warne Marsh, Lee Konitz, Lennie Tristano, Phil Woods, and on and on. Apparently as far as the author is concerned the accomplishments these and other great white musicians achieved either did not amount to much, or, perhaps, he has never heard of them. I recently turned my copy over to the folks at Half-Price Books. It was either that or the trash can for this opinionated piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"the tourist point of view","review":"In any books such as these, there will always be disagreements on ommissions and inclusions. I will not debate this.That being said, it is quite clear that Piazza has a weak grasp of the fundamentals of the music. He is a tourist, not a scholar. So what if you want to see the other sights?Piazza also practices an odious brand of Political Correctness. In his world, if you listen to the avant garde, that means you want African Americans to be noble savages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really dreadful guide to compact discs...","review":"This book is enthusiastic and full of cliches.

The title of the book does not cover the military industrial establishment or tease out how real WWII combat vets feel about our current politico-military juggernaut. While reading I couldn't help but think this is an English Prof showing me how conscious she is of her own consciousness. Unfortunately the book is a big digresson about the holocaust and Adolf Eichman's role as person who was a functionary and organized the logistics of killing millions Jews. R.J. Lifton has already clearly described bureaucratic distancing from killing in modern techno-war. So what's new? The book does not contain any information about the current military industrial establishment and its influence on U.S, politics and the relationship to the war in Iraq if there is one. Go to a book store and read the brief conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"Unfortunately, this \\"book\\" is not a very enlightening read !!.

Was I disappointed! 3-1/2 hours later I finished the book.The book has 270 pages. I had not read the 3 books preceeding it. I don't know who the characters on the cover are supposed to be - they certainly aren't the twin children, and their colouring and age don't match the description of the parents. The story was simple, with no complexity - for example, there was only one bad person - others were hinted at, but never appeared. And the otter was just plain silly - by the end of the book I was just skimming his \\"dialog.\\"I am not familiar with Elizabeth Ann Scarborough, but I have read everything Anne McCaffrey has written. I expected more of McCaffery, especially since her name is listed first, than what I got.I recommend that you wait till this book is a $5.95 paperback, not a $19.95 hardback, before buying it. And don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"I have a Sony computer, and was excited when I found this product. One of the biggest problems I have is whenever I record a show, I have to either watch it on the computer or burn onto a DVD to watch on a regular TV. It's a hassle. I didn't want even more wires running across the floor, so I was thrilled to learn this reciever would work wirelessly. Unfortunately that didn't happen. It's wireless ability simply did not exist, nor did the costumer support at Sony. It work fine when it was wired with real cable (not wirelessly). Needless to say, I've since returned the product for a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT","review":"WOW! WHAT A GREAT READ.

This novel is superb in every respect. The story, the subplots, the characterisation, the humour all combine to create a novel that will endure through time. It captures the Auatralian way of life and the landscape in a way the Steinbeck captured the American spirit in The Grapes of Wrath. I will definitely come back and read Cloudstreet again. I feel richer for having discovered this amazing work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crowded House","review":"In this decades spanning meditation on luck and fate, two families who share a rambling house discover the ties that bind. Winton writes in a slang-filled idiom that captures the resilience of Australians, their uncanny ability to dust themselves off and spit in the face of misfortune. The Lambs lose a son to retardation, Dolly Pickles loses her looks to time and the bottle, and her husband, reduced to five good fingers, loses over and over at the track. Somehow they endure. The younger generation, represented by the memorable Rose Pickles and Quick Lamb, fly from a messy nest only to feel the undeniable pull of the familiar and family. Winton's survivors win your heart and his evocation of Perth, surrounded by sea and sand, takes you to a town on the edge of the earth. Fair dinkum."},{"rating":"2","title":"The great Australian novel?","review":"If there was a competition for the greatest Australian novel of the Twentieth Century, Cloudstreet would be in the running for the top prize. It is an indictment of the American publishing industry that it appears to be out of print. Although Winton was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for his later book, The Riders, Cloudstreet is the one that should have won it. Happily, the dramatization of Cloudstreet has endeared it to a new audience, but it it still worth saying: Wake up world, this is a classic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"un-involving story","review":"I read this based on so many glowing reviews. Although I liked some of Wintons wording, the story as a whole falls rather short. I never really fell in love with any of the characters. The plot takes turns that arent that interesting, and the extensive metaphors seemed either obvious or so far removed that one would never tie them all together. Slow read, so so character development, jumpy plot, but interesting wording by Winton made this readable but not one I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the fuss about?","review":"I am sorry - I do not like it, I tried for 50% of the Kindle copy but found it too boring to be interested any longer.

It's generally pointless trying to capture the quality of this book and others have made a better effort of it than I might, but one has to be deeply heartened by the author's humanity and love of his characters, even those with considerable personality disorders. It's a thread that runs through all his fiction and I admire him greatly for it. Add to that a dynamic imagination, a respect for his native vernacular and a sense of hope, and we've seen the tip of the iceberg. Winton is a masterful writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vast landscape with perfect details","review":"I really can't recommend this novel more.

Cloudstreet stayed with me for a long time after I finished it. This has to be one of my favourite novels of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best written book ever.","review":"I re-read Cloudstreet every few years and still love it. The characters are very well developed and you feel during the book how you get to know them and become familiar with them. As if they are your neighbours or a guy you sit next to on the train to work. The book is very well written. Many times I wonder where Tim Winton got a description from. A word here, sentence there that shows he is one of the best writers around. I obviously admire his writing greatly and would just enjoy the book for the mastery of words and sentences. The story wraps you in an atmosphere of early years Perth, WA. I have lived in the area, Subiaco, and loved reading the books because they reminded me so much of the area, eventhough the book is set in the early fifties and I lived there in the ninetees. I could just feel the hot and dry summers of Perth back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful, lovely story.","review":"I loved this book. It's the story of two working class families in Perth, Australia, over twenty years time during the 40s/50s/60s. It's really fantastic.

I was sad to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Australian book I've ever read","review":"I couldn't put it down, I felt I was actually present in the story.

In CLOUDSTREET two families are thrown together. One family, whose lives are complicated by addictions, own a large dwelling half of which they have rented to the other family. The lodgers endeavour to make the most of their situation and show initiative in the way that they use their allocated space both indoors and out.

In my view Tim Winton is the greatest living Australian writer and this is his best, most moving work so far.

I was like reading something in Olde English. I gave up trying after about 40% of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating at every point","review":"Winton seemed to capture the spirit of the place of Perth. Having lived there for three years myself, I felt that he did a good job. Perth is isolated, a town trying to be a city and searching for identity, like Australia in microcosm. As each individual searches for purpose, it becomes apparent that it was there all the time. It was them together, and in a peculiar way, it was Fish Lamb, the nexus of the two families who symbolised this. Although he was recessed deep within his soul, he bound the familys together and defined who they were, a kind of guardian angel in disguise."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be nice if this book was based on facts...","review":"Dr. O'Callaghan forces his own unbalanced opinions upon the reader. Hopefully, anyone reading this book will also take the time to read information based upon facts and widely accepted viewpoints and theories, not just one person's beliefs.

The only minor drawbacks I can claim have been mentioned by others: noise during operation (quiet when in sleep mode) and first print warm-up of about 30 seconds (actually quite good for printers in this range, but slower than some inkjets). I also had problems with feeding very thick cardstock without having the paper slip in the roller and print slightly askew. But despite that difficulty, the paper feed options are still above average for this class of printer.All in all, this is an excellent choice for anyone looking for economical, high quality B&W home printing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good printer, toner costs are actually not high!","review":"An earlier reviewer complaining about toner costs missed a point about the Samsung. The Samsung toner cart is a combined toner/drum cartridge. The Brother printers have seperate toners and drums. From experience, you need to replace the Brother drum after about 15k pages, not the 20k they rate the drums at. So every 4-5 cartridges, you need a new drum too. The combined Samsung cart is about 50% more than the equiv Brother, but if you get the Brother, you will spend the \\"savings\\" on a drum later. That said, both the Samsung and equiv Brother are great printers, just make sure your Brother drum doesn't run out during a project, or your local office supply chain store will charge about 50% more for the drum than Amazon (about as much as 2 Samsung carts)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Laser Printer","review":"This is truly a fantastic investment. The picture quality is very sharp. It prints amazingly fast. Can do almost everything a professional quality printer could. It's so small it fits perfectly in my desk. It also goes into sleep mode to preserve the toner. Get this printer. The 1750, this one, is the newest model from samsung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toner too expensive","review":"In interests of full disclosure, I chose not to buy this printer due to toner costs. Just check those costs before you buy. A 3000 page toner costs $79, versus $54 for the toner of an equivalent Brother (say the HL1440 which I have owned) or $70 for a 6000 page Brother toner. I think Samsung is known to do this \\"make the profit in the refills\\" for this printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"my review","review":"In this first book of the series on Josephine, be are introduced to a shy girl of 14 living in the Island of Martinico (later know as Haiti). She is however given a glimpse of her future by a very old voodoo woman. Does she believe her? it seems impossible she could become queen living in almost near poverty! how strange life is.The author is using Josephine's journals as well as accounts of all the people Josephine came in contact with. She has achieved a remarkably well written \\"autobiography\\". You do feel as if you are reading Josephine's thoughts and emotions and living alongside her all the many things, good and bad, that happen to her.If you love historical novels, this is a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely historical novel...","review":"The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B. is an interesting and entertaining historical novel. Sandra Gulland has a wonderful and engaging gift for storytelling. It's told in diary form, starting when Josephine (then called Rose) was a precocious fourteen-year-old. The story of this compelling woman begins when a fortune teller predicts that Rose will be \\"queen.\\" She longs to leave her home in Haiti and travel to Paris. The opportunity soon presents itself and she begins an adventurous, remarkable life while at the same time enduring difficult times during the French revolution. Josephine is a survivor and her story is interesting and appealing. The language is beautiful and riveting. This novel is an excellent example of what makes historical fiction so irresistible to me. I'm a sucker for the same and I couldn't put this book down. Highly recommended..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent glimpse into a little known past...","review":"I began this book with less-than-enthusiastic ideas. I thought it would be dull, and trite. However, I loved this book, like I have loved few, in recent reads. It has a stunning read-ability. It is a treasure that is filled with historical information. I couldn't wait to discuss certain facts with my French stepfather, whom, I knew, would be impressed. The book is a quaint reminder that the French Revolution was not an entirely just event, and that one can read both sides of a story, and find equally poignant information in both.I recommend this book wholeheartedly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff","review":"I was disappointed in this book. There wasn't any depth to the novel; too much light commentary. I felt like I was just skipping on the surface of her life- there wasn't any 'meat' to her diary entries. I would love to see Margaret George write a 'novelized' bio of Josephine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding piece of historical fiction","review":"This trilogy, written in diary form, is in many ways a remarkable achievement. It steers clear of the pitfalls of historical fantasy, yet brings history vividly to life. Gullard traces the highly improbable destiny of this girl from the colonies who astonishly became an Empress. Josephine was a tough woman who survived a miserable first marriage and the horrors of the French revolution, in which she was imprisoned and nearly beheaded. A pragmatist, she made her way up again by becoming a politician's mistress, and then married the young Bonaparte to get security and respectability. The books sheds real light on the influence that women have in political and historical events even when kept behind the scenes. This is not a sentimental book but it is well enough written and full of the pleasures of political intrigue."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I liked the story line, but wasn't expecting all the political text.

I know, that Josephine was to lazy to write a diary, she was even to lazy in writing letters - so I cannot appreciate the books of Mrs.Gulland. Her idea of a Rose-Josephine diary is sooo wrong.

I enjoy historical fiction especially in the times of the french revolution and this book delivers on that, however I did find it a bit repetitive in parts and a bit slow in the middle.

It is some very good reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone","review":"Although this book has some fine moments where I think the author really speaks to the readers and lets them know what Josephine's interior life might of been like, these moments do not make up for the failings of the book.The author seems so pleased with herself for the research she did it is as if she cannot stop reminding the reader of all that she learned. I found the footnotes to be insulting and many times writen as if the reader had no knowledge whatsoever of the time period or of Josephine's actual life. The author was so intent on proving that she had throughly researched her subject that she let it disrupt the flow of her novel.I was impressed with all that she knew about Josephine and France, however I wish she would have incorporated that knowledge into the body of the novel instead of endlessly intrupting her often engaging prose with footnotes.Overall not a bad book and I did learn some new things but I wish that her style was less self-conscious."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY This Book!!!","review":"Wow!!!

The diary format works like a charm!!!I could not put it down . . .My only adive besides buying the book is to wait until @ least the 2nd volume comes out - then you won't be suffering like I am waiting for the 2nd volume to come out and the 3rd?

Besides being great to read it would make a wonderful reference book for someone writing a report, or learning about the French Revolution. The author gives you a true insight into who, what, when, where and why.

I actually had bad dreams from reading this book.Where's the insight, strength, and hope for the reader to connect to the author? Where's the connection for the reader to care about this story and how does it inspire the reader in life? Frankly, a recantation of years of a tragically painful life and a few slogans from AA just don't make a story inspirational.I wish I had passed on reading this monolithic listing of life tragedies, which seems to have no happy ending, even philosophically.

Some of the mental/emotional instability issues seem to me to make it difficult to recall her in a more objective sense. I have absolutely no prejudice against mental illness and am not saying that gives her less credibility.

The Artist's Way is a great book, but this one suffers from too much information, a lot of self-absorption and ego, and too little self-reflection or understanding. She is probably too famous and too beloved by others to be able to think clearly about herself or her situation. The story presented here is at times truly bizarre, though often boring.

Rather than condemn her mental illness and addiction, I believe she's actually a marvel: she's been able to carve out an artistic life AND yield tremendous influence while making frequent junkets to hell and back.

As I combed the cat, 3 out of 4 times, a flea, even a dead one, would pass right through this comb.

If you're a Mac OS X user, forget anything beyond very basic printing. The drivers are no more than Beta versions. There is absolutely no support for manual feed (one of the reasons I bought this printer was to print envelopes, which is impossible without manual feed). Other features are missing from the driver.

He dies as a result of his misuse of the holy texts of the Kabbalah. His soul invades the body of his intended bride, as a Dybbuk - which is a spirit in Jewish mythology that invades other people's bodies. When he is exorcised from Leah's body, she makes a pact with her beloved to unite her soul with his spirit, and so she departs the earth too- so strong was the love of Leah and Channon that their spirits would not be kept from each other even in death.This volume contains some of the richest treasures of old Yiddish mythology and literature , much of it involving rich Chassidic mysticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love cracker ... most of them were broken","review":"Over half the crackers in each of all six boxes were broken.

I have looked at several books, and while they may be very good and detailed, they usually assume that the reader has has previous experiece with SAN servers. In essence they describe their speciality and not how the system works as a whole. You could say that they describe a tree or particular plant and not the ecology of the whole forest.This book begins at a high level explaining how the system works as a whole and then works down to the detail level with examples of installing switches and servers, with command line entry examples.If you are getting started in system adminiatration and storage servers, I highly recommend this book as one of your first reads. This books covers using both Windows and UNIX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too outdated to be much use.","review":"Considering the second edition was released in January 2009, it is appalling how little iSCSI is mentioned. According to the index iSCSI is referenced on fewer than 15 of the book's 437 pages. Two SAN vendors have earned a living doing only iSCSI for over eight years and nearly all the rest offer both iSCSI and FC, so to treat this important SAN technology so lightly in 2008 when this book was going into its second edition was a fatal error to my mind. The author needs to rewrite this book quickly to address not only iSCSI, but also storage virtualization (11 pages), tiering of storage (0 pages), serial attached SCSI (SAS) (0 pages), solid-state drives (0 pages), SATA (2 pages), and thin provisioning (0 pages), to name a few.

If you or someone you know loves adventure and action mixed with accurate historical detail,this book and the entire series is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adventure","review":"I love historical military fiction. Although I'm more interested in novels about recent history like THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, or FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, a friend recommended the Kent novels, which I began reading with SLOOP OF WAR. It was fascinating, a vivid trip back in time to the days of the great Men-of-war of the Royal Navy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another in the series that follows Bolitho - just great reading","review":"I like the historical aspect of the book and the way the author describes the details in operating a sailng vessel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of small child entertainment","review":"This book has lots of little windows that open to show what's going on behind them. It has been great entertainment throughout the first two years of my daughter's life and probably for at least two more! When she was very small she enjoyed touching the flaps and watching me open them. Now she can open them by herself and fold the book out into a town."},{"rating":"1","title":"PSP Grip Dock: Bad Choice!","review":"I purchased this item because I play a lot of PSP games and my hands and wrists hurts for a long period of time playing. The grip itself helps prevent and keeps the pain I'm having playing PSP.The unit itself is BAD. Cooling fan is noisy and the speaker are distorted(meaning sound quality is very poor). Also, the most heviest grip of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great PS-1000 docking station","review":"The only thing about this docking station I would recommend is that when you get it, use new rechargeable batteries. The ones they give you don't work. It won't hold a charge unless you use your own. Besides that, it works great for the PS-1000."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written","review":"As In remember, this volume includes an account of the Jewish faith and philosophers. This volume is part of Durant's 8 volume set covering the intellectual and religious history of the world.Since this volume covers about 1000 years, it will necessarily be sketchy, but Will Durant is outstanding in that he has no axe to grind - an objectivity that is refreshing in this current era of career \\"academicians.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Eroticism","review":"Spirits of the past with sexual appetites want to pass over. Trapped on the property of a former whorehouse. Erotic writing was a little on the SM side, and conversations/personalities in the story were not very believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent camera once you get the right settings","review":"Easy to use, good pix. But some of the settings were a problem: using autofocus makes this camera very very slow. Manual focus works fine except for stuff closer than one meter, so I set it permanently on MF. Now it's fast.Tons of features, most of which I won't ever use. (The 3-D photo thing is a weird gimmick...) But there are plenty of things to like, such as the color filters and the (rather crude) in-camera image cropping.Overall, very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Using the Pentax 430rs","review":"I really like this camera. I have been using digital cameras for several years now and this one is easy to use and takes great pictures. The most important thing for me was size - I found that unless I could put the camera in my shirt pocket I rarely took it with me. This on is only slightly bigger than a pack of cigerettes. You need to buy a compact flash memory for it if you are going to take high resolution pic's as you can only get something like 8 of the highest res pictures. The battery is a strong one and will run for a long time, and one ought to have a extra - but finding one of these new lithium ion batteries has not been easy. You can even zoom in on a picture you have taken while reviewing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prone to just \\"dying\\"","review":"I'm on my third one, and this one just died. I seriously don't mistreat them at all, I even keep it in a hardshell case when travelling. But invariably, every six months, it goes dead, I call Pentax, they take it in, send it back to me with \\"a board replaced\\" and I wait six months for it to die. If it wasn't for the chronic death syndrome - it's be a great 4 star camera - it's fairly quick, has a good flash, good depth of field and really great image quality. But i'm tired of returning for repair."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soul of old Hawaii, made modern","review":"This album is astoundingly beautiful, and a refreshing change to 'classic' hawai'ian music. I am not normally a fan of hip-hop, but I can listen to this album over and over. The band does advocate for native sovereignty (hence the angry tags someone has added to this album) but that doesn't make them anti-american. It makes them hawai'ian patriots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother of a 4 year old","review":"Overall, this is a great product to have because of its multiple uses on the track. The two tunnels on the side are made of fabric and can connect together, or on either side of the main center toy. My son loves to change it up a bit when we change the track around. The only down side to this toy is that we have noticed the trains getting stuck in the tunnels because the trains hit the fabric which stops the train from proceeding through. That is the only thing I found wrong with this product. Other than that, it is great to have because of the flexibility in changing it around."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Gasket Included","review":"The part works fine, but did not include a gasket. It would be nice to know that before ordering, which is the only reason for 4/5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Educational, but not fun","review":"This game has lots of facts and could help you learn more about the world. If you are looking for an educational experience, I think it could be great for a classroom setting in elementary school. The downside to the game is that it is not that fun for adults. Game play is slow and then the game can be over before it starts if someone recognizes a picture. if you are an elementary of middle school teacher I recommend this game, if you are looking for a fun family game, I don't think this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pan flute done right","review":"Hypnothic pulses of the pan flute, accompanied by an slow rythmn of multiple guitars. On track 9 there are some nice vocals. This recording combines creative musicianship with ethnic references. This must be is what the Andes sounds like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful, humble, and honest","review":"This book is a balm for the Christian who struggles to reconcile the uniqueness of Christ and the need for honest dialog with other faiths. Hughes shows how the Christian message supports openness and honest exchange. Christianity teaches humility (all have sinned...), the value of paradox (Christ as God and human at the same time), and love for others, including really listening to the others' point of view. The book is a gentle treatment of the subject, modeling the kindness and humility that Hughes promotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for younger kids","review":"We purchased this for our children to view as a group, but my four year old was the only one who stayed interested. The story is really good, the characters are entertaining and the music is awesome. I think the bloopers are hilarious and Kurt Warner's little girl as narrator is the star of the show. I would recommend this to all- just be advised it is more suited to younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"My sons (1 & 5) and I watched this for the first time in a couple years... my 5 year old wanted to watch it again right away -- he was very into the plot line! My 1 year old was captivated while the balls were bouncing and singing. If they're going to be watching tv, it might as well be something good for their heads AND their hearts!

There are a couple of (minor) problems with it, but I still give it 5 stars. Here is the break-down:Positives:Provides an easy and clean way for young kids to 'color,' and it actually comes out in color! Also small enough to fit in any diaper bag easily and not take up much room at all!Negatives:The pages bend easily, and don't stay 'colored' as long as the mat does.I like this aquadoodle set better than the basic floor mat that I bought because the mat doesn't 'color' in color, but only blue. The mat, however, is more durable, and a MUCH bigger size to 'color' on.

Some of Serge's fiction barely qualifies as such, written more as an essay than as a novel. Not so this. It does have an unusual structure, with each chapter focusing on a seperate character caught up in an absurd -- but utterly terrifying -- purge under Stalin. Yet each character is exquisitely drawn, with even the most despicable people rendered human and sympathetic in some way. The scenes, from a snowy Moscow night to a vast Siberian plain to a Spanish civil war hideaway, are stunningly evoked.This should be read with the best fiction of the last century, not consigned to the back shelves with cold war historical documents and Soviet oddities. Serge speaks to terror and freedom of thought, existential choices and the ability to reconcile oneself to imperfect realities. Utterly inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"It is a bad book.I dont like it.

(The real one!) Since that wasn't going to happen, this was the next best thing. This remote controlled space shuttle has been a great source of entertainment for him and the 2 year old. Only 2 options for movement..forward and rotate. Very easy for him to manuver especially since he seems to love watching it spin really fast in a circle. Doesn't go at all on the carpet and it gets hung up in the grout joints between the tile, but on a flat surface it really goes! The antena are pretty skinny and I worry about the kids destroying them, but I figure while it lasts they are getting pure enjoyment out of it and will still be entertained when they do destroy the wires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"My 3.5 year old loves space / solar + science.

I bought this for use on my Nikon D5000 camera. The TTL functionality worked fine, but the motor in the flash can be heard when you zoom in or out on your lens. The construction of this flash is sturdy, and the locking mechanism is sufficient in that the flash never wobbled or lost connection with the contacts. When I upgraded my camera body to the D7000, I purchased an SB-700 flash by Nikon. It shouldn't be any surprise, but the 700 was a lot brighter, and the batteries last a lot longer. You get what you pay for, which in this case, is a very nice entry level flash gun that does it's job for a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a strong magnet.","review":"This is ok for very thin, lightweight necklaces. The magnet is just not strong enough to trust with real or heavy custom jewelry. Very pretty and shiny but when you need a secure clasp, try the Clever Clasp ( As Seen On TV) right here on Amazon. I can't find it in stores. It has a strong magnet and a locking feature which twists on and off easily. I've tried them all as I am converting all my mom's necklaces for ease of use.

I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not as strong as they imply","review":"As others have said, these are only really good for very lightweight jewelery like a thin chain, as the magnet isn't very strong at all. All it takes is a light touch to detach the clasp, so it's generally not good for bracelets or anything else that'll be moving about or brushing against things.Since the description claims \\"These hold as securely as any normal type of clasp\\" and \\"The magnets are so strong...\\" it's difficult to not let this shortcoming weigh heavily on the review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to use jeweler","review":"Others I bought had a clasp you could hook yourself.

That being the negative as well since there's less specific advice on erotica than a review of the industry and process as a whole. Not the best book on writing I've read, but it's definitely on the short list and worth looking into. If you're looking specifically for a \\"how-to write a dirty story\\" however, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading and vague","review":"As a male, I purchased this book because I wanted to learn how to write very good erotica instead of porn. I was very disappointed in that the material in how to write erotica was limited.Subjects like publishing your story, finding an editor, and the history of erotica were covered well. However, I felt that these topics were better suited for another book instead of one that's supposed to teach you how to write.A positive aspect was the writing exercises that the author proposed. They were fun to work with and gave me more insight into writing \\"proper\\" erotica.I feel that this book is good for those people who just want to know what is involved in writing erotica. However, if you want an instructional, in-depth book on how to actually write erotica, you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to what i hoped it would be","review":"The first 100 pages or so are about the history of erotica and the evolution of a sexual revolution from the female perspective. the next 65 pages are supposed to be about writing erotica, but it is mostly filler. There are maybe five pages with anything useful on them. The last 100 or so pages is by far the most usefull, but has nothing to do with writing dirty stories. It is about the realities of the publishing world. I bought this hoping to improve my writing, but found nothing that anyone with a brain would not already know. I also thought it was quite funny that the author confesses to being a socialist, and then devotes the last third of the book to how to succeed in the marketplace. Maybe it is just me, but that's funny. I actually regret that the author will get a royalty payment for my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has she ever written any erotica?","review":"I find it interesting that the same woman who makes money off the writing of talented erotica authors now offers advice on how to write erotica.

Time Enough For Love was my first foray into Heinlein and it might be my last. This was one of the worst books I've ever read! A meandering piece of garbage! I would give it negative stars if I could. The incest really bothered me in this novel because I thought of Lazarus Long as a pervented grandfather type. The novel has some tender moments but it did not justify my time. If your looking for a novel about immortals/longevity I would suggest Zelazny's Lord of Light. Now Im hestitant to read any more of Heinlein's works - this one was so excreable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-serving drivel","review":"After a friend of mine went on about how great a writer Heinlein is, I tried out this book. What utter drivel! I actually read through the whole thing hoping that eventually there would be some point to it - I shouldn't have bothered - there isn't! It puts me off reading anything else by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've read in a long time!","review":"The life of Lazarus Long, the man who refused to die, is by far one of the best science fiction stories ever told.The Grand Master of Science Fiction himself proves to us again that he can captivate his readers with characters so believable you can't wait until the next time you get to see them.Heinlein throws out any pretext of following an organized plot, and instead fills this book with anecdotes, stories, letters that tell of this great man who most certainly had Time Enough For Love. I laughed, I cried, I made certain that I had read the last page of the book, hoping that maybe a couple pages were stuck together. But when I put the book down, I felt deeply satisfied and honored to know Lazarus Long. I will certainly be reading it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite old book","review":"I do not get near enough time to read this book as I did 40 years ago, it is a bit more wordy than I remember but I still enjoy reading it and it brought back memories of reading it at the beach in San Diego."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book, Poor Editing","review":"A wonderful book by a great author. The editor for the kindle version, if there even was one, is obviously a middle school dropout or dead. There are tons of spelling mistakes and incorrect formatting issues.

I am beginning to think that publishers are so lazy and greedy that they don't even bother to proofread kindle versions of books. For shame. Otherwise a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arguably, Heinlein's best work.","review":"This book contains several stories within the story. No way you'll get bored. Yes it's long, but not boring. It's a page turner ... one you'll want to stay up and finish reading in one night. If you are a Heinlein fan, this book is an obvious must. It is the story of the thousand-year long life of Lazarus Long, the reminiscences of a guy who's \\"seen it all.\\" Trust me, he's seen some very interesting things!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pocket Dictionary to Life:","review":"I'd say you have to be familiar with Robert Heinlan before reading this. He's got some pretty strarnge ideas, that I can't say I neccessarily agreed with. Untill I read this book. It all makes sense now. I thought Lazarus Long was fairly annoying. Until I read this book. But seriously, if you are willing to go along with a couple of hundreds of pages of a old man giving you his take on life, you will see that with age comes wizdom. The plot here is secondary to the point, but its worth every scandalous and insestuous page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dafuq did I just read?","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend. I would have titled it \\"Time Enough to Tell You About All of the Incestuous Relationships I've Been Involved In\\" because that's basically all it is. It may be entirely possible that the only thing Lazarus Long never tried was some restraint. Truly a one-dimensional character without charm or dignity."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of the \\"old school\\"","review":"I reread this for the first time in many, many years - and it reminded me again how good Heinlein was at his best. While his youth stories show their age, this one will be current for many many years. (How could it not be with Lazerath Long as the main character.)The Kindle version does have a few problems as noted in other reviews. However they are fairly minor, if annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"cerebral","review":"Never one to dislike a Heinlein story- but this one brings me as close as I ever have. Not that the writing isn't brilliant Heinlein, but if you're looking for an action story where things happen and characters face alot of interesting and heart-stopping adventures- this ain't it. Its really about the disjointed and romantice remincences of Lazarus Long, a very old man who's tired. There are aot of great quotes in the book and every third page, you'll read a great line and think \\"I have GOT to write that down!\\". But the story drags out. A loooong way out. And to me, it became more of a chore to read and finish just because its Heinlein, not because its a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The history of a life - the history of many lives","review":"Time Enough for Love is Science Fiction. But it is also adventure, romance and, above all, a way to show a philosophy of living. Lazarus Long is not only a character, he is the way the author found to express his beliefs about countless aspects of life: sex, marriage, politics, money, adventure, security, even practical (and often funny) advice. A book to be read many times. You may aggre with the author's point of view or not. But he will certainly make you think about the way you live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look beyond the \\"sex\\" and read a fabulous biography.","review":"We would all like to live for a couple of thousand years, but it's not going to happen. But Heinlein has crafted a picture of a world where it COULD happen (the original science is basic) and would'nt we love to be there!His views on sexuality were outspoken for his time but are in mostly irrelevant as they contribute only a small part to the old fashioned story - rare enough these days - he has produced, of a real hero, the tough man with a soft centre.The science fiction should be accepted, who knows, the science may not be so far away, and enjoy a story about a man who has enjoyed his life, something we all admire and envy him for. But, despite his good fortune relative to most of us, you cannot begrudge him anything, because you wish you were in his shoes!A truly superb read, and a great opportunity to throw away our normal cynicism!A lot of his work was very technical, but this is simply a great story, if you let yourself believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is great; Kindle version is not","review":"Is this the quality level that Kindle and Amazon are to be known for?

Why wasn't this proof read?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sci-fi story EVER","review":"I don't remember when I first read \\"Time Enough for Love\\", but suffice it to say I wore out 2 (and almost 3 now) paperbacks over the years rereading it at least a few times per year. It ties together all of his \\"Future History\\" stories, but it is far more than that. It is by far my favorite novel. Heinlein creates real characters with believable strengths and weaknesses, and his writing will make you think, make you laugh and make you cry. Lazarus Long is a loveable scoundrel with a heart of gold, and you fall in love with the other members of his family. I've been waiting for 2 years for it to be available in the Kindle version, so now I don't have to worry about the pages falling out as I read! \\"The Tale of the Adopted Daughter\\" could stand alone as a masterpiece, and it's just one part of the marvelous mosaic Heinlein has created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living forever!

But adventure on top of adventure - that is great. Go read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several Very Good Novellas Buried in a Much Longer Work","review":"Time Enough for Love, the capstone of Heinlein's future histories, is a frustrating work. Buried in this book are a couple of the better bits of short fiction Heinlein ever produced, such as \\"The Tale of the Adopted Daughter.\\" But the novel as a whole is far too long. Like most Heinlein books after 1960, it is drastically in need of an editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hienleins most meandering book.","review":"I read most of Heinleins books before reaching this one and was really looking forward to learning the life of a character i grew to love. Unfortunately, like some of his other books, such as, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and The Number of the Beast, this too got logged down in useless prattle that Heinlein occasionally drones on about. Some day i will pick it up and finish it. this book was definitely not worthy of Lazarus Long,"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought better of Robert Heinlien","review":"The story is mostly (but not all) about beautiful women who want to be screwed (to have a baby) by a 2,500 year old man.

Most of the story is to justify this."},{"rating":"1","title":"among worst books I have read","review":"I am a Sci. Fi. fan, but I don't like Heinlein very much. Idon't have any prejudice about sex, but if I buy sci. fi. book Iexpect it to contain something else beside sex. And I think that those who say that this book is about love don't know what love is. This is a not even a book about sex, its a book about egocentrism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time reading this book, you'll regret it.","review":"This is simply the worst book I ever read. In fact, I didn't even bother to finish it. I grew tired of waiting for an interesting plot to develop and threw the book into the trash after 250 pages.The other negative reviews nicely sum up why this book is so bad.

It's as great of a read now as it was the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Eugenics is Illegal","review":"I would have preferred more than just two vignettes of the various lives of Woodrow Wilson Smith, aka Lazarus Long. \\"Time Enough for Love\\" was premised on his reminiscing about his two-plus millenia of existence, but Mr. Heinlein never fully followed through with it, abandoning the effort in favor of Long being finally roped into a '60s-style free-love commune and culminating his life with an incestuous encounter with his mother. Much of Mr. Heinlein's anti-religious prejudices also came through, to the extent that one might suppose Lazarus was his alter-ego.However, the actual memoir portions are compelling. And if you can skip over the aforementioned nettlesome passages, \\"Time Enough for Love\\" is still worth the price and the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended, even to Heinlein fans","review":"RAH is responsible for some of the best and worst science fiction even written. This book is close to the bottom. Although Lazarus Long is a somewhat likeable character, the novel has little plot and eventually devolves into a deviant sexual fantasy. I'm embarassed for RAH and those who rave about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heinleins best work","review":"L. Long is a hero's hero, and as his book chronicles his history, Heinlein is able to comment on a vast array of subjects that affect society, all centered around the loves and life of the hero Lazarus. It takes a few pages as Heinlein sets up the story, but once the book starts rolling it is a nonstop page turner even though it is actually many stories wrapped in a story that spaces many many decades and cultures.Something of a futurist, Heinlein never loses sight of the fact that man is still man. Whether during world war two or in the future when he can fly to other worlds, man has to live, love, eat and work. This brillant work is my favorite Heinlein book and I while I highly recommend it, I'd perhaps recommend a reader that is new to Heinlein to start with \\"Stranger', 'Moon..' or even 'Friday' first, then come to this work with a little of his style under your skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Desert Island Book","review":"Like a favorite sweatshirt or couch or hat or . . . I re-read portions of this book whenever I get a chance. The philosophy on everything from aging to relationships to government is controversial and extremely thought-provoking.

It's one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seperates those who understand RAH and those who never will","review":"This was the first of RAH's books that I read. I was hooked. I have since read many others and know now that this is not the one to start with. I keep going back to it every time I feel as though I have found a deeper understanding of the author. The more I discover about RAH the more I get out of TEfL. I listen to all those who are obsessed with the sexuality in the book and realize that tunnel vision has kept many from real understanding. Bubble gum for the brain it is not - this one will make you think. I have never read a peice of literature that conjured up so many emotions (except maybe the Bible). Laughter, shock, anger, regret, saddness it all surfaces throughout the journey and it is quite a journey.

My attitude changed only when I listened to several of the new material here - and they sizzled! There are a few so-so cuts (Entre La Noche Y El Dia and Presencie Tu Amor) but the rest gets you up and moving.

I wanted to have something to wear under slinky spring/summer shirts. I was very dissapointed. I am a plus size, and it did very little to smooth or slim. It is very tight across the chest, way too short and is cut too big under the arms. It is so short that it rides up with every movement. You spend all day trying to find a way to discretely pull it back down. In my opinion, it is going to be too short on anyone who is over 5'3. I am 5'6 and it barely reaches my waist.For the cost of the item, I expected a whole lot more. It is definitely not worth the money.

Then he puts theory in action by teaching some very nice country and blues licks, then some Brazilian and a pop tune with altered chords. Just a very pleasant DVD, full of good info and nice tunes.

The picture quality is superb when it is set in 'BEST - ***' with Max pixel, otherwise the picture quality is no good. The flash range is very less.

So plunk the $$ ( $17 each on sale for me ) down and be noticed on the road !!! I run this light on my normal training / racing bike. I run two of them on my commuter bike, one on the seatpost and one on the saddle bags.

My wife could see me the whole way down no problem, and could see me unmistakably when I passed the end of the street a couple of times. Not as bright as a motorcycle's taillight but still obvious.Also note: It DOES come with a couple of seat-post connectors and a clip that goes on either (I had bought a bike-rack mount for this but ended up returning the superfluous mount). In fact the seat post connectors that came with it weren't the right size for my seat post, but that didn't matter, I swapped the clip for a reflector on the seat-post connector I already had (after a minor bit of drilling to make the old screw fit the new clip).Super happy with this, as I work late and particularly in the winter expect to be commuting home in the dark regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful light","review":"I go riding in the morning and want to be seen on the road - and this light is exactly what I need.

The lighting modes are also welcome and battery lifetime seems good (several months with perhaps 1 hour use per week day).The bad: Well, it's not properly sealed. Snow can creep into the base and short out the connections where the 'button' switch is. The light will then fail until opened up and dried out. It's embarrasing riding along and suddenly realizing the rear light has failed - fortunately I had a cheap backup which is less effective BUT waterproof.I have two of these (one for each bike) and they both display this problem. I haven't tried them in the rain yet but would not be surprised if this also causes issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with purchase.","review":"The reviews on this light did not lead me astray. The photo is misleading as I too was expecting a big clunker of a light. It is about an inch shorter than my ipod shuffle, if you remember what those look like, and only slightly wider, perfect size. The blink mode is definitely an attention grabber. Comes with a mount for the seat post and seat stay. Slides onto mount and has a security snap to keep it in position.

It's not the standard blink/strobe, so it really sticks out.My Blackburn Mars is a wee bit brighter, but the blink pattern on this is more noticeable. I think the two are fairly comparable.The only downside to this light is that it would be difficult to mount to a rack and the clip is diminutive and not practical for mounting the light securely to a bag or your helmet.

This light is so bright that when i'm riding home after my late class, i never worry. I've only had the light for a few months now, so i can't attest to the longevity, but this is one tough little blinky. Last night i was commuting home from my 7pm class and i got caught in the rain. Pretty nasty stuff, actually. I got soaked. My glasses were fogged up. My light stayed on, didn't fill up with water, didn't short out and kept blinking so that even though i was wearing dark jeans and a black hoodie (with a grey backpack....maybe i need to change these things a little bit) i was still visible.

Most of my low light riding is early spring and fall, when I often need full finger gloves. The switch is hard to use bare fingered, impossible with gloves on. It isn't really a switch, just a marked spot on the case. Which leads to, 2) I turned the light on yesterday when caught in light rain (wanted visibility), reached back to my bag and pressed the switch. Apparently that was enough to open the case, because when I went to turn it off after the rain, the light was gone, all that was left was the back and the clip. For $25 I expect much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Apart","review":"I bought this tail light because I do a lot of early morning riding in the dark and I got a new bike so I wanted a good tail light. Trouble is, the light part of it fell out of the white casing somewhere on one of my 15 mile rides only about a month after I bought it. On my older bike, I have a cheap tail light that I bought at Wal Mart about 4 years ago. Never had a problem with that one. Makes me think I wasted my money on this supposedly much better light. It's not going to do me any good if it falls apart while I am riding. In fact, it can be dangerous. I think I have a light to make me visible to traffic behind me ... and I don't! Would not recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flash pattern is ideal","review":"I have the \\"stealth\\" version of this light. Same light but with all clear housing. As a car driver and a bike commuter I know that there have been times I have been driving when I knew there was a flashing light somewhere in the area, but it took me a few seconds to localize it.. i.e., figure out exactly where it was coming from. This light is different.. the flash pattern consists of flash flash FLASH, with the third flash being provided by a brighter LED. The two dimmer flashes help ensure the light will be easy on batteries, while still helping drivers figure out where you are, especially in rain. The bright flash will catch their eye first, allowing teh dimmer flashes to let them home in on you.I have been considering buying a second one to leave on in the steady mode.. that way you'd have to be near blind to not see me at night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you need a rear bicycle light, look no farther","review":"I read the very positive reviews on Amazon before deciding to try the Planet Blinky Super Flash. I have several LED flashlights and I knew the 1/2 watt LED would be bright, but you have to see this to believe it. It is small and light and easy to install with several mounting options. I ride 4 times a week on public roads so I use this exclusively during the day on flashing mode. I don't think it is my imagination but cars give me a wider berth than before installing this light. My wife said she could see my flashing light over a mile ahead on a bright Arizona day. If you want to be really seen, then this is the only rear bicycle light to buy. I've had it for over two months and I'm still on the same batteries that came with the unit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Planet Bike Blinky Super Flash","review":"I've tried several rear lights and this is without a doubt the best light I've seen. It can be seen a long way away and I've received many comments by motorists when stopped at red lights regarding its brightness. I've used it about 60 hours so far and I'm still on the original batteries. Other so-called bright lights I've used have gone through batteries in a matter of a couple of rides but this one has not. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointed","review":"I know its only a blinking red tail light, but I'm really disappointed in two things: its not quite as bright as some other tail lights that Ive seen and probably more importantly, the on/off switch is almost impossible to work---it really takes a hard push in exactly the right place to turn the thing on or off. Might not seem like a big deal, but when you are riding and realize that you need to turn it on, because you forgot when you started the ride, you have to get off the bike and fiddle around with it. Just doesn't need to be that hard even it is just a stinking light."},{"rating":"2","title":"brightest tail lights you can get","review":"they are very bright so the idiots even in the police depRTMENT can seethem at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright, lightweight, easy to use bike light","review":"The Blinky is terrific.

Solid construction.Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it would have been nice to change the orientation of the light since I can't attach it on my backpack horizontally; it would point downward otherwise.Great light!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a MUST HAVE!","review":"the smallest brightest light ever..and half the price of REI. EVERY biker should have one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second only to the DiNotte.","review":"I have used the Superflash since it hit the market last year. Planet Bike has definitely hit a home run with this one. It's very affordable, cheaper than the much-vaunted Cateye LD-100, but it's brighter than everything but the DiNotte($150+). I use a Superflash on my seatbag, and one on the blinky strap on my Bell Metro helmet(another excellent product). Those two lights get me plenty of respect from motorists.If money is no object, buy the DiNotte. It's the best light available. 140 lumens of red flasher will get the job done. But using a couple of Superflashes is an excellent choice. Bright, attention getting, lightweight, affordable, and made by a company who gives money to bicycle charities. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bright light. insecure mounting","review":"This light has a very bright flash, but the mounting system is insecure and badly needs a redesign. The first time I used this light, I added some rubber bands to hold it more securely. The second time, I forgot the rubber bands, and the light bounced out of its mounting bracket somewhere on a stretch of rough road, and I lost it. There are other strobe lights that are every bit as bright as the Super Flash with a better mechanical design. Until Planet Bike redesigns the mounting bracket, I would give this light a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very visible and easy to maintain","review":"I ride 21 miles per day in the early morning hours before daylight and this tail light has been one of my favorites over the years. It is very visible from quite a distance and is easy to swap out the batteries. My last Blinky lasted about 3 years without a problem, which is pretty good considering the amount of use this gets year round. I would give the light 5 stars but the newer version comes with skimpier attachment hardware which required me to improvise with electrical tape to get it to fasten securely to the frame of my Trek carbon fiber bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very bright -- you WILL be seen","review":"This small unit packs a punch in terms of brightness and it's flashing pattern. Combined, it ensures that you will definitely be seen by cars approaching you from behind. I consider it a must-have for riding at dusk or night. My only small annoyance was that it comes with a mount for the seat post and another small mount, but no bracket to mount it to the rear of a bike rack. With so many bikes now having racks installed, would have been nice if they threw that in. Instead, I had to buy the bracket for $5 from another source. Nonetheless, this is one of the brightest -- maybe the brightest -- rear bike light/flasher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best light for the money currently on the market","review":"I recently replaced my broken Blackburn Mars light with the Blinky Superflash after hearing people rave about it. I am extremely happy with it. The alternating flash pattern really catches your attention.Although it's physically small, the light seems to come from a lot larger space.The only flaw I could see is that it doesn't appear to be very waterproof. The two plastic halves pressure-fit together without any type of gasket in-between. Bottom line though, if mine disappeared tomorrow I would buy another - at least until something better comes along, or I feel like I can justify spending $100 for the only product that may be better currently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down one of the brightest taillights out there right now.","review":"This thing is bright and well built.

The picture is worse than grainy, it is blotchy, the sound is extremely bad. Besides, the summary of the plot provided by Amazon is actually all wrong. Russel in this movie can not be Bronson's hero helper simply for the fact that in the movie he plays a boy of about 12-13 years! They are both much younger in the movie than the cover makes you think.The DVD that I got was only watchable till the middle of the movie, after that the picture started dissapearing or splittering on the screen.

We have two cars, a 96 Civic and a 02 Passat, and it works perfectly with both. Plus it works fine on my neighbors and and friends cars. It keeps all cars separate on the computer.It has saved us lots of money. I my opinion when the check engine (CE) light comes one, 90% of the time it's an unnecessary indicator, so it should be reset (turned off), without going to a mechanic. For example the 02 Passat's CE light comes on when it stalls in 1st gear, which is lame to me. Plus all the other reasons for CE lights I've seen are minor/temporary messages, but the light stays on. I have reset my CE light 3 times, plus other cars.I also like seeing all the driving details of all my trips.

I assumed that an officially licensed dvd of the game would be better quality than I could have recorded, but I was wrong. I can record and burn dvds of better quality than this on my dvr. The picture on this dvd looks like VHS. This is, by far, the worst dvd picture I have ever seen. Shame on ABC/ESPN for ever licensing this bootleg-quality product.This is the greatest game of the year, and one of the greatest of all time. It deserves better.

Really, really bad, but it's what's available. I guess they thought the fans would buy ANYTHING and, sadly, they are probably correct. So if you HAVE to have a copy (UT grads), buy it.

It's not sharp enough and doesn't cut well, no matter how I hold it and instead of cutting his nails, it crushes, cracks and splinters them. In addition, this is made very flimsy with the handles flexing and bending during use and the blade assembly flexing and not cutting straight. Judging by the way he squirmed and whined, it must hurt him too. (The professional scissor-type version wasn't any better either.) It might work better for a smaller dog, but not for a larger one.

The first time I used this on my cat's first claw, she actually yelped in agony.The explanation is simple: Look at the two photos I've loaded above, and examine the cutting head of each tool. I rubberbanded the handles on both tools closed so the cutting action can be observed.In the first photo of the older Lambert Kay trimmer (we finally found it), you'll see the two pieces of the cutting head are parallel and tight against each other. This allows for a clean cut of the claw.Now examine the second photo of the Safari trimmer: Note how the gap between the two pieces. The claw gets caught in that space, and instead of a clean cut, gets crushed.The original French guillotine was considered to be a device of terror, so this Safari trimmer is aptly named.

She did well with those. She didn't mind me cutting her nails at all. When she got big enough, I went to use this clipper and it was a whole different story. After two cuts, she went running. It got to the point that if I grabbed them, she would run to her crate. It was inexplicable that a pup I groomed to be OK with nail clipping all of a sudden reacted so poorly. She also was fine when a groomer used a guillotine clipper on her. All I can come up with is there's something wrong with these clippers.

Davies has been in several barely watchable SciFi movies of late, and this won't improve his resume. The movie means well and has some decent settings that made me want to watchLadyhawkeagain, but it just doesn't quite make it as a decent fantasy. You will probably enjoy the animatedFire and Iceover this one. This makes decent background if it's on the SciFi channel, but that's about all. If you enjoyed this movie, be sure to catchDragon Wars - D-War. I think you will be far more amused than what you got out of this movie. It annoys me I can see Vosloo in this far lesser effort on DVD, but not in the Veritas TV series in which he did a great job acting.CA Luster"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good low budget family movie","review":"Fire and Ice is a well done Dragon based fairy tale. The dragons, all CGI, are unique from other movies and add well to the low budget adventure. The cast is pretty good particularly Amy Acker (Angel seasons 3-5) as a rough and tumble princess. The scrip falls a bit short when developing her bravery, as the dragon attacks the village, and when only armed with a dagger, she gets beat down pretty easily. The movie is rated PG-13 which is probably right although I don't think too many of today's pre-teens would have issues with people being incinerated by dragon's breath, or stabbed through the heart with little to no blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Degrassi Season Four","review":"I was very pleased with this item.

Friends that have tried to make their own baby books from things found in other baby books have been amazed at the topics I suggest - directly from Baby Chronicles.

I also never forgot the name Demelza, and have used it as a screen name wherever I register, like on Amazon!I can't be objective writing a review for this show because I love it so much. But I had not seen it for 30 years and now my local PBS station has started to reshow it. Believing it may not have aged as well as I remembered, I started watching with trepidation. I was absolutely amazed at the first episode. The characters were just as charming as I remembered. The dialogue just as crisp, and the anticipation of the next episode just as excruciating as I remember. I finally did it, I bought a used copy of the series. I devoured it in just a few days. Now I await the second series coming to my doorstep.If you like period dramas at all, you will be swept away with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it but. . .","review":"I enjoyed this series when it first played on Masterpiece Theater and finally decided a year ago to try the books. After reading the first few, my husband and I began watching the videos. Here's the deal--the acting is wonderful, but the adaptation, especially in the first half of the first series, is infuriating. Many things were changed, all to make the story more melodramatic than in the books--changes that insult the viewer's intelligence. But hang with it--the adapters start to trust the original as they go, and Graham's story comes through intact. I'm not complaining on the mere basis of change--the first series covers about 1300 pages of novels, and changes had to be made. But the changes were stupid ones. . . And try the books. They are absolutely marvelous."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE RELEASE POLDARK S SERIES ON DVD!","review":"I had the VHS tapes of Poldark I and Poldark 2, but gave them away as I no longer have a VCR and I was sure they would be made available on DVD sooner or later.

Everyone got their just desserts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worth a light skim","review":"This book started out promising, but then it just seemed like the writer was hacking his way through the rest of the material. Characters continuously (aside from Chaz) seemed to make the most bizarre choices in what to do next and almost none of it was believable. I'm all for suspending my disbelief in books, but this strained the credulity of the universe Mr. Hiaasen created.I ended up skipping to the few last chapters and didn't feel like I missed a thing.

It starts off fast paced and good, but in my opinion the book slides downhill from beginning to end. Speaking of the end, what a major dissappointment the ending was. To think that I spent all that time wading through endless information about the Florida swamps and unrealistic happenings, just to find the very unsatisfactory ending. I was not impressed and will not read another Hiassen book, due to the fact that people are calling this his best.Dont' believe all the hype about the humor. I believe thaere was one time where I actually chuckled to myself, but other than that I consider this book a waste of time.Then ending reminded me of a bad television show that ending with.............\\"To be condluded next week.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"I hated everything about this book.

This is the first novel by Carl Hiaasen that I have had the pleasure of reading, and it won't be the last.It all starts on a romantic cruise vacation. A lovely couple on an anniversary trip out for a stroll on the deck at night. The night takes a turn for the worse when the husband pitches his wife overboard. He suspects that she will die instantly, but underestimates his wife greatly.She ends up barely alive on an island having been rescued by a fisherman at sea. The two of them set on a mission to prove that her husband planned to murder her, and also to find out why.There are a lot of twists and turns in this story. It was quite funny at times and engaging throughout.

Witty and smart.All of the characters including the not-so-likeable ones were great. They were so colorfully described.

I'm picking up other titles by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely not his best...","review":"This was my first and possibly last Hiaasen novel. I've heard so many great things about his writing and so maybe that hype deflated me but I really just didn't see this as being very funny. The beginning starts out great - and I love how Hiaasen can be economical with his descriptions - justifying the 2 stars... but the story falls flat to me because its sooooo incredibly predictable. Not to mention - the reasoning behind such outrageous behavior by the characters is just - well - not very interesting. I know Hiaasen had a parable to play out but this platform just didnt work. At least not this time. If I see something of his on sale - I might try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKINNY DUPED","review":"I am a big Carl Hiassen fan and have read nearly all his previous books, but this one left me cold. The problems are: total lack of sexual tension between two main characters, motives of Chaz the husband just too unbelievable, lack of character development and wooden dialog. Basically I just didn't care enough to read properly to the end and just skimmed the last half. I have never, repeat, never done that before with Hiassen. He is a talented individual and can write cutting dialog when he wants to but this one just seemed like churning out a book. TRY HARDER CARL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and depressing","review":"I did not enjoy reading this book - I found it to be much darker than expected. I'd read Hoot by Hiassen which I liked quite a bit, but this book, with its excessive and never-ending revenge-scheming really depressed me. OK, playing with your murdurous husband's mind is funny - to a point. After a while, each of the obsessive, shallow, amoral characters became very uninteresting, and I couldn't wait for the book to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, Fun Summer Read","review":"I am also a first time Hiassen reader and purchased this book based on the New York Times' positive review.

Oh yeah, releasing snakes into an environment where there's no natural predator is not a good thing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put it down at page 73","review":"This was strongly recommended by my friend, so I did not bother reading the reviews. I am really surprised that so many people - my friend included - found it entertaining.The writing is crude and the characters are shallow. Millionaires, attempted murder, adultery, con-men, ex-cops and ridiculous plots - all the makings of a trash novel. There is a notice at the beginning that the book is fictional, as if this could have ever take place in real world?I found myself rolling my eyes one too many times - the scene where she tells the ex-cop to let her cry, but don't you dare try to hold me or caress my hair or console me in any way... unless I ask you to! so please... leave me alone and then come back and do all of those things when I call you... Come on! This girl is dumb as dirt. I saw the word's \\"pussy mobile\\" and put the book down for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hiaasen's Best Yet","review":"This is the one in which Carl Hiaasen brings it all together: plot, characters, tone, humor and, as always, his campaign against the idiots and scumbags of south Florida. He even has a character named Tool, dangerous and wacko, who evolves in the course of things and the changes are handled with only a very little stretch of the reader's credulity. The audio version benefits from the extraordinary talents of Stephen Hoye, who does a superb job with all of the characters, maintains a wonderful pace, and is truly a gifted narrator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth while","review":"I have been very good about getting books from the library, but have had a hard time finding something as fun to read as Hiaasen. So I bought the book as soon as I found it was out and read it within 24 hours, yet savoring the Florida setting and the author's enjoyable writing style. It has made me think of rereading some of Hiaasen's earlier books, especially since I had read them before moving to Florida."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment unfortunately","review":"I bought this book as had red reviews at amazon.

I was desparate for something to read. Others had talked about this book but it did not do anything for me. I enjoy slow character development and details. This book had none of that. Its a quick read but you as the reader do not become invested in the characters. For me, that spells disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revenge book without a twist","review":"I have read one other book of Carl Hiaasen, \\"Striptease\\", which I liked. Skinny Dip however, was a straightforward revenge book without one twist. NOT A SUPRISE. EVER. ABC Movie of the Week material. Search \\"Elmore Leonard\\" for better dialogue and plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woffle","review":"I can't see how so many people could rate this book so highly. It is weak. I thought I had stumbled across a lost Hardy Boys novel from my youth. I've heard his other books are better, maybe he's riding the Geoffrey Archer factor, books by numbers. It's nice he is trying to educate us about the everglades, but really the book stinks. What a Christmas present, Bah Humbug."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was very eager to read this book after reading the reviews. However I must say the book just isn't very good. There is nothing spectacular about the book. Its just another story. The most interesting part was the education of the Everglades. I wasn't even going to finish the book but I kept thinking there has to be some big surprise or twist at the end for so many people to rate it so high. Nope, just another story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by a man for men","review":"I bought this book because it was best seller. I got to page 85 before I finally had to throw in the towel and give up on it. From a woman's point of view it was crude and it was just filled with man's sexual fantasies. I tried to stay with it for the story line but it just got to be too much. I hate to even donate this to the library. What a waste of paper and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored Stiff","review":"You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skinny Dip Misses Something","review":"I absolutely LOVE Carl Hiaasen. I have read all his capers through South Florida and beyond from Tourist Season to Skinny Dip. The twists he puts on actual problems occurring in Florida is always entertaining and informative.Maybe I've read one too many of his books, but this one just wasn't as entertaining as many of his others. I missed his trademark creativity in the disposal of the \\"bad guys\\". Although, I was thoroughly amused by his addition of the governor. Too bad he had such a small part.For someone not familiar with Hiaasen, I would recommend starting at the beginning - Tourist Season - and working their way through all the twists and turns. No one can truly appreciate the \\"Captain\\" and all his nuances without going back a few books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun thriller","review":"This is the first book by Hiaasen I read and I found it both gripping and entertaining. My favorite fiction has been mysteries by such authors as LeCarre and Forsythe and while this book does not match their best efforts I am adding Hiaasen to my list. It is a good escape from the depressing political news. While the plot and subplots are quite implausible, it makes great reading if it is seen as a satire of our society and conventions. A great book to read to take your mind off the daily news."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great story from a zany author...","review":"Did I just use the word \\"zany\\"? Clearly I did, and that's because I really can't think of any other word to describe Carl Hiaasen. Ok, so his stories over the past decade have been mostly the same (there's an environmental \\"bad guy\\" and a loner \\"good guy\\" and a love interest somewhere to keep it interesting...) but he always seems to add just enough newness and freshness to each story so that we don't get tired of them, but keep coming back to the crazy familiar story teller. Hiaasen is pure comedy.If you're into him, you also might try Christopher Moore. I've found they both are kinda nutty and write in an approachable way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as fun as skinny dipping","review":"This was my first Hiassen book, but it won't be my last. Skinny Dip revolves around a mysterious murder but is nothing of a murder mystery -- it's an entertaining revenge romp through suburban Florida. On their second anniversary, Dr. Chaz Perrone tosses his wife Joey overboard a luxury cruise liner. But Joey lives. The rest of the novel is driven by Joey and co's clever attempts at revenge. Along the way we meet a handful of colorful, fun, good, bad, and sexy characters.I found this book particularly fun to read because it was both surreal and plausible; Hiassen presents a more exciting, yet believable, side of life. I laughed out loud quite a few times and often smiled through chapters. Big thumbs up for Skinny Dip, and I can't wait to read more of Hiassen's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and weird offbeat \\"mystery\\"","review":"Fun and weird offbeat \\"mystery\\"of a book.

However, it doesn't change how much I enjoyed reading Skinny Dip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"This is the first novel I've read by Mr. Hiaasen. I had some time to kill at a local bookstore and began reading it, and couldn't put it down. The blend of interesting characters and twists and turns in the plot made for a very entertaining and interesting read. I laughed out loud more than once while reading this book! The only draw back I had was not having been a reader of his books before, I really didn't have past knowledge of Stranahan, one of the main characters, and feel he could have been better developed in this book. The other characters are hilarious!!! I'm already reading Skin Tight now and loving it too - always love to find a new author."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can relate!","review":"Since the heroic character Chaz shares my family name, I want to disavow any family relationship.

This book is not as bad as a couple of the books that preceded it but it is still quite ordinary in my opinion.It is just that the author seems to keep repeating the same characters and variations of them again and again. We have the hero, the inept baddie, the characters who are bad but have good characteristics.....The first few Hiaasen books were brilliant displays of black humour with the underpinnings of the environment but lately the humour has become less and the books have become run of the mill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a prude, but...","review":"There is an interesting and different twist to this yarn. I am not a prude but the author was unnecessarily smutty in his overused vulgar language and graphic sexual encounters. A cute story that didn't need that for a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Summer beach reading","review":"A fun easy reading book for the beach. Fast reading , You will not want to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and Fluffy","review":"Not much to say except it was a decent book that pushed your imagination as well as its credibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and interesting reading","review":"If you have ever wanted to get even with an ex-boy friend or ex-husband, this book will give you some laughs. Although Chaz does enough damage to himself with his own stupidity. Mick Stanahan helps Joey understand why her husband Chaz tried to kill her. Then there is Ricca the hairdresser and Chaz's sidekick, who ends up with a thirty-eight-caliber hole in her leg and dumped in the swamp only to be saved by a Vietnam vet with one eye and I'll let you read the end to see how Chaz feels about meeting this same character. This is a fun/fast read, great to take on a vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"skinny dip","review":"Fun characters you follow... uninhibited zany plot. After reading Skinny dip I bought a half dozen more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters, laugh-out-loud morality tale","review":"This is the first Hiaasen book I've \\"read\\" (listened to), but it won't be the last. The characters, though mostly one dimentional (except for the heavy), are hilarious. The scenery is lush. And the plot, which makes no attempt at believeability, is so tied together it's a Gordian knot. It's a murder mystery where no one is killed and you know from the start who did it.No fake ending either. The book just ends... maybe there'll be a sequel.The reader on this recording has a bit too much irony in his voice, but this is a minor complaint. He does an excellent job creating the characters. They come alive with his vocal inflection. I would not get the abridged version. Everything in this story is tied to everything else. If you miss something, you might lose an important thread."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hiaasen imagination in full swing!","review":"Mr. Hiaasen's ability to personalize tiny details concerning his characters, the wacky twists his storylines take and the creative flow of his mind are once again in full blossom in Skinny Dip.The emotions he is able to stir up via the novel's situation are very inviting and his style is quite unique in the fact nothing is predictable. Terribly interesting people in this book come to life and make you feel like you're watching it on the silver screen.Definitely another winner from Mr. Hiaasen along with Stormy Weather, Sick Puppy and Skin Tight. All are \\"must reads\\" and if you're like me, a new book just means a longer wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skink's Back","review":"But just for a minute or two.This book was very enjoyable, but maybe a little too straight forward for readers that really enjoy Hiaasen's wilder stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rollicking good read!","review":"Hiaasen scores again, probably one of his better works. When compromised biologist Chazz tosses his heiress wife Joey overboard while they are on what Joey thinks is a conciliatory cruise, Chazz thinks his worries are over and he can continue life as wealthy womanizing widower.Except he forgets his presumed dead wife is a former champion swimmer. Oopsie.So Joey not only lives to tell about what dirt Chazz has done her, but also enlists the help of an island dweller and her ex-pat sheep-herding brother to weave a tangled web of revenge for her not-so-beloved soon-to-be former spouse.This is a great read in a Peeping Tom way--you can read it with a wry chuckle knowing that this may never happen to you...thank goodness. I wouldn't call it heavy literature, but it's certainly a good beach read, and that season is coming upon us..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drawn out.......","review":"I have to say the story line was great. However I feel it was over written in several places, and the story was dragged out a bit to far. I found myself saying enough already....I did enjoy most of the story, but glad it's over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take The Plunge Into A Funny World","review":"This is the first Hiaasen book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. His books present a very funny picture of Florida, one you could only appreciate if you have spent some time there. His characters are also very entertaining as well, because many of them include such traits that they are over the top. This particular book is a prime example of that. His writing is well-paced and keeps moving all the while setting up a very complex story. His books are so well-written that you never even know that you are as far along in the book as it seems. Anyway, a great book and one you should read only if to meet the person who removes roadside crosses from any road."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun and entertaining book","review":"This book is a nice, entertaining read - nothing amazing or riveting but a fun book. The plot is unique in some ways but a bit predictable once you get the flow. I sometimes find the author's writing style a little over the top for my reading tastes but overall I would recommend this book to fans of mysteries and/or Florida-based fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more books from this author!","review":"This has got to be up there with the top 5 worst books I've ever read. There was not even one likeable or relatable character in the entire story. It started out ok but took a downward dive at page 20 or so (read this on my kindle). The plot was ridiculous, boring, and inconceivable. I could never recommend this book or author to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a FUN book to read","review":"I've never laughed so much reading a book. Great entertainment couldn't put it down. Finished it in day. Loved it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of revenge.","review":"Chaz Perrone has got to be the sleaziest, most unlikable character Carl Hiaasen has ever created. If you're familiar with Hiaasen's work, you will know that that's saying quite a bit.Chaz and his wife Joey (she was named after Joey Heatherton) are on a cruise to mark their second wedding anniversary. Chaz cold-bloodedly throws Joey over the side to what he is sure will be a certain and agonizing death.But Joey manages to survive and vows to exact revenge. Aiding and abetting her in this pursuit is Mick Stranahan, a reclusive former investigator who served as the protagonist in Skin Tight, a much earlier Hiaasen novel.This book is teeming with a host of way over-the-top characters guaranteed to tickle the funny bone of even the most jaded reader. When it comes to outrageous humor, Florida style, Carl Hiaasen sets the standard. If you like cynical humor that pulls no punches, read Skinny Dip. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun book","review":"This book was a lot of fun to read. It took off running and didn't quit. The plot was interesting and different, which is always refreshing. It kept me hanging on wanting to know where it was going without being predictable. A great book to read at one sitting or on a long plane trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skinny Dip Dips Too Low","review":"With Skinny Dip, Mr. Hiaasen joins the ranks of novelists who depend on sex to sell their work. The sad truth is that his descriptions of the many encounters that take place in this story are unrealistic and borderline rediculous. The plot of the story should have been self sustaining without use of all the dribble. Mr. Hiaasen also delves into a relationship that developes inside a nursing home which served only to prove that he has never set foot in a nursing home himself.Conversations between the various characters show a lack of consistancy to the profile he has created for them.I will borrow his next novel rather than buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Steve Waterhouse's ideas on team selling make great sense to me.I have been working with sales people for 25 years and his simple to understand concepts will help any sales person or salesmanager manage the team selling process more effectively. A good read with plenty of good ideas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"It pains me to say this but if the rating would have allowed it this publication would have got a \\"No Star\\" rating from me.It fails miserably in my view to give any new or interesting thought and simply recurgitates old boring material. Worse still it implies that this is ground breaking because it's applied in the context of team selling.A Baboon could have written this and the only creative writing comes in the marketing spin that has been used to hype this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst sales book I've ever read..","review":"I have been in sales for almost 30 years. I've managed very large teams in multiple areas across the country. This book offers no real techinique or inspiration. The only thing I am motivated to do after reading this is to write my own book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrilling Ride","review":"False Witness is a thrilling book that turns conventional plots on their head. The characters are lovable and engaging, and the story is fascinating. This should be the start to a good career for Larry Butram."},{"rating":"2","title":"A skeptic turned believer","review":"As a former (low-ranking) officer in the military, I was skeptical about the premise of this book. But reading the first chapter, standing up in Midnight Special, got me hooked. This is a well argued, impeccably researched book. Though I think some of the arguments are overstated, the bulk of \\"Warriors\\" confirmed suspicions I didn't even know I had, and resonated with my fellow officers when I brought it up with them. Clearly written without being condescending. A good read for anybody trying to understand the wars popping up around the globe."},{"rating":"1","title":"two right hands","review":"I received the package on time and in great condition.Problem, I was sent two right hand gloves. I tried wearing them and turning the glove backwards, it was not possible to wear.

When she opened them, I noticed that she received two different sizes of gloves. The larger glove fit but the other did not. I will be sending this item back.

The gloves are really warm and soft inside and out, but it's not what I expected. I must have extremely small hands as the gloves are too big for me. I also find them bulky for leather gloves. They aren't very feminine, so if you're looking for a pair of gloves that are purely utilitarian then it's a great deal for leather gloves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of stock","review":"Item: Ladies' Italian Leather Dress Gloves Black, BLACK, MReason for refund: Item out of stock"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blues Book!","review":"NOTE: Rated 4 stars only because it has no CD or cassette.A VERY good book on blues basics. Boyd takes your thru exercises, theory, and improvisations. The book explores various blues styles from early blues, thru Dixieland,swing, boogie and rock. This is a GREAT book on 12 bar blues style...and if it only had a CD/cassette it would be perfect!NOTE #2: This is probably not a book for total beginners. Without a CD/cassette it can be difficult even for intermediate pianists/keyboarders to understand the \\"sound\\" and \\"shuffle\\" of some of the riffs/pieces in this book. However if you have access to someone who can play these and let you hear the sound...then even a beginner can get some benefit from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a rambling mess of forgettable stories","review":"Sorry, but I have to completely disagree with the other reviewers. 'The Neon Wilderness' contains several stories of down-and-outs living in Chicago in the 1940s. Although the author has the local language and the feel of the streets down pat, he forgot to write anything *interesting*. The characters are generally not likable or encourage sympathy, and oftentimes the prose is utterly incomprehensible. Nope, I really didn't like this book at all.Bottom line: this book does not deliver a pleasant reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Lamp","review":"Great lamp for the money. Nice heavy base. Only complaint - dimmer switch is not really a dimmer switch, just hi and low, but wasn't a big deal to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It went to the landfill","review":"I read the reviews for this product ,but, since I had been looking for this exact lamp for so long I ignored what I didn't want to see. That was the review telling me that the poles to the lamp did not fit together well and the threads that you screwed together did not mesh the way they should. Which leaves the lamp wobbly and unstable, not to mention crooked. So please believe this, the poles do not fit together well and the lamp DOES wobble and is unsteady, which is the last thing you want for a lamp that is very hot and could become a fire hazard. Please keep looking, there has to be a better product than this out there. Mine is in the landfill."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good for me.","review":"The halogen lamp which I bought of this product workable for me.But one little problem is switch of lamp it's too loose.It maybe lost if you watch out of switch of lamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm shocked","review":"I went into the purchase of this set with strong reservations -- That's a lot of clamp for the price! I figured they'd be kinda crummy, but I could use them for unimportant projects if they were really terrible... They showed up and are actually pretty good!Just 2 of the slip clutch bar clamps are alone worth the price of this set, but you get 8 bar clamps! The bar clamps are all metal except for the adjustment handle, which is plastic. To be totally honest, I prefer the wooden Jorgensen handles, but for the price, these are fine - the plastic handles don't seem to affect the usability at all. Oh, and each of the slip clutch clamps have removable plastic covers on either side of the clamp -- they didn't have to do that, but a nice touch.The spring clamps are plastic, but seem to be strong - they also have pivoting grip heads, which surprised me.I want to give them 5 stars, but I can't, as jorgensen clamps are better (wooden handles), but 4 stars is good! I'm buying a few more sets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Columbian Clamps","review":"I purchased these clamps for my woodworking business. For the price, you cannot beat it; however, I would recommend for professional woodworkers to purchase the upgraded clamps individually. These clamps are not the standard clamps -- they are a little on the light side in terms of size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy clamps","review":"This may do the trick, but they are relatively flimsy and under tension, the bar flexes too much.I have a higher-end set of clamps, and I like them a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great clamps for the price -- exceeded my expectations!","review":"I bought these clamps because of the reviews on Amazon.com -- and because the price was right. For my projects, these clamps exceeded expectations. They were a pleasure to use -- easier to use than a better known brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defintely worth it!","review":"You get a lot of bang for your buck with this set. I bought it for my husband for Father's Day. He loves them! His attitude is that you cannot ever have enough clamps in a workshop. My husband especially loved the different sizes which definitely help him with his different projects. His only disappointment with the set was that it was not the lathe or the saw that he asked for Father's Day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Set","review":"This is a good set of clamps at a fantasic price. I agree with the other reviewer who stated that some of the spring clamps could be swapped out with another bar clamp or two. But considering the cost and all you get, it's worth it -- I bought 3 sets.I found that it isn't that easy to release the slip clutch clamps when used as a \\"quick release\\" but once the tension is off the clamp, they work just fine. The only reason I don't think they work so well is because the release is small, not leaving much room for your finger(s).All in all, this is a good set of clamps. I would recommend this product to anybody, especially those just starting out in woodworking like I am. Clamps are one of the biggest expenses in a shop as you \\"can never have too many clamps.\\" You'll still need to get other types of clamps though, including your pipe clamps, parallel clamps etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"I ordered 1000 chips from this company.

It is REALLY heavy thats why the shipping is so much. The chips arent cheap, they are heavy and definitely clay. The only bad thing i would say is when i opened up the case it was damaged (probably through the shipping because the box it came in was pretty banged up and looked like it had been wet at one point!). I emailed chips and games about the problem to see if maybe i could get a replacement and they responded the next day apologizing and are now sending me a new case! wow thats GREAT customer service. If you're unsure about buying this off the internet let me tell you it is a great poker set, especially for this price! thanks chipsandgames. : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"no grooves, very slippery","review":"Just played first night of poker with these chips and I have to say that although they look and feel nice enough, they have no grooves, so they stacks are constantly falling down.

Not a good purchase at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seller wanted to make me happy","review":"I'm very happy with my purchase. I wanted poker chips, and I got good poker chips. The set was speedily delivered to me. There was a problem in that the dealer buttons were not included in my set. I wrote a mediocre review of the product. As a result, someone at the company contacted me and wanted to know how they could make my purchase better. They sent me the missing dealer buttons. I'm impressed with the fact that they do show concern for the customer's experience and want to make you happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent set","review":"The set is brand new, chips are packaged in plastic wrapping. The chips are nice, about one out of 20 have a defect, yet majority are not noticeable though unless you look very closely, like I did. It's impossible to have a perfect set. My set came with all dealer chips, etc. The aluminum case is a little cheap, or it may seem that way cause the set is 22 pounds and pulls on the metal with great tension. When I bought the set, fedex said it was 16 pounds, but don't worry, the set is the full weight. The only thing that really disappointed me is that the cards are not casino quality; they're half paper half plastic. After a few weeks, they started peeling and ripping, but you can buy casino cards for very cheap. The rest of the set is good. I would recommend this item and seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad business","review":"I ordered the 500 piece set, paid shipping on 500 piece and they sent a 300 piece set completely different than the one they advertised.

I was a little ambivalent because they were so cheap and wondered if it would be poor quality, but I am very pleased with the chips, the case, and the cards.

I liked that the press had handles.The dough needs to be the exact round shape as the press, if not--if the dough drapes over the edge, a knife or something sharp is necessary to cut off the excess dough. The press merely presses the edges together. The pleated edge looks nice and is about the same width as the \\"stuffed\\" part of the dumpling. Be careful while pressing because the hinges tend to pinch the dumpling/dough.This press is time consuming to use (i.e. getting it to work correctly and properly). Also, the plastic does not seem very durable; the \\"handles\\" bend easily. In the end, I just made the dumplings by hand (ans the press).I gave it 1 star for ease of use and for time-saving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

Two songs (Song for The Lonely & A Different Kind of Love Song-remixed) from her \\"Living Proof\\" cd. There is also the dance remix of One By One.Even though this stuff has been repeated, it is nice to just hear her sing again.

It's perfect for any individual, scholar and new believer alike. It does, in my opinion, get a little wordy, and I actually wished the book would have been a bit shorter, but overall this is a very important work written by a very humble man that does not wish to divide his pre-trib brothers, but is willing to take abuse for his beliefs.Every Christian owes it to themselves to research this subject rather than to simply believe the majority around them, and I believe this is a fine place to begin.Dave Bussard, author of \\"Who Will Be Left Behind And When?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a very thought-provoking book to the open-minded reader","review":"In a day and age where Christians seem to rely on getting \\"raptured\\" out before any trouble starts, Rosenthal presents the danger of such a teaching: if \\"they\\" are right, noone will be the worse for wear.

Then the false doctrine is inserted. The sixth seal is considered to be the begging of God's wrath, hence the rapture of the saints takes place before God's wrath therefore \\"Pre-Wrath\\". The Bible on the other hand teaches plainly that the seals (all 7 of them) are part of God's judgement or wrath. The book is misleading and the theory is \\"NEW\\" -- shouldn't that speak volumes. Over the hundreds of years of Biblical exegises, NOW comes along a \\"NEW\\" view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosenthal is right on the money!","review":"I thought this was a great book. Rosenthal clearly shows that the return of Christ occurs with the opening of the seventh seal. The scriptural support he gives for the timing of the rapture is solid. I wish he would have discussed in more detail Robert Gundry's Semitic sequencing of the seals, trumpets, and bowls. Because even though Rosenthal is right to say that Christ will return after the opening of the sixth seal and with the opening of the 7th seal, Gundry may be right to say that the seventh seal converges in time with the seventh trumpet and the seventh bowl. And that makes prewrath rapturism a slightly modified posttribulationism.

Read it yourself. I'll just say that on the topic of what Christians refer to as \\"The Rapture\\" (and I am very familiar with that topic), the author systematically examines every popular (and sometimes obscure) biblical reference, and makes his point for what he refers to as a \\"Pre-Wrath Rapture\\". I have read many books on the subject (with the benchmark being the Bible), and find that Rosentahal leaves no scriptural \\"pre-trib\\" argument unaddressed. He convinced me. Perfect!

Delicate and full of tenderness, the film is both entertaining and moving in its depiction of a father (Michel Blanc) and his daughter (Melanie Laurent) who can't say \`'I Love You''. Years of lies have damaged their relationship; yet The Day I Saw Your Heart is evocative for its surprisingly optimistic conclusion...I have seen Inglorious Basterds and Beginners and I found Melanie Laurent's performance to be once again outstanding. Her alchemy with young French actor Guillaume Gouix operates wonderfully while her intimate game with Michel Blanc is to be remembered.The quality of the writing and the originality of the directing make filmmaker Jennifer Devoldere a talent to watch.I highly recommend this film that the general audience will find sweet and truly optimistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"been looking for this dvd forever","review":"and when i finally found it, it sucked! i expected it to be sumwhat stupid silly but it ended up being one of the worst movies ever. the whole story line doesnt even fully make sense. i think this was pearlmans idea to make big bucks off all the boy bands. if u like boy bands (like i do) ur prolly better off with the soundtrack, not the movie. the lines are cheesy, the main characters have no acting backgrounds...jus good looks, which is really pathetic. i paid 7 bucks for this movie and im feeling ripped off already. pretty sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"I loved this movie SOOOO much, its great.. :).

Its hard to express exactly what that means, these types of movies are heavy on long, slow plot development and very light on making the climactic horror scenes believable and worthwhile. No different here. The story development is generally entertaining, but it is slow and drawn out. However, the scenes that should be scary are very amateurish. The way these scenes are pulled off leave a lot to be desired; the camera work and editing are weak, which is disappointing given that the buildup to the scary scenes is actually pretty good.

A HOMO POP SINGER IN TUPAC CD??? WHAT'S HAPPEN???)...That's hilarious!They simply give the mic to 50 Cent, he raps, after with a vocal transformation program, they change his voice to Tupac's voice!I really think it's that because how can be so much songs of him never-heard?

I can't describe how good this labum actually is though. Most of the songs are really catchy and get you pretty depressed that this guy is actually dead. Really really good CD, id say 75% of this cd is listenable while the other tracks seem to be just thrown in to make it a pretty long CD. Tracks that really stan dout are Dont Trust Me, Who Do Ya Love, Loyal To The Game, Out On Ball, and Ghettto Gospel. Really really good CD and worth the 13-14-15 bucks it cost. Play the sampler on this site and you'll be hooked. Gave it 4 stars because the whole CD isn't that great, wish they threw out all the BS tracks cus it would of been a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"good - but stretched","review":"I admit I was nervous when i heard eminem would produce this - his production only ever sounds good when its for him - and at first I didn't like the album because of this. It was like he was just using string heavy, plodding beats making every thing into some fake epic like 'runnin'. Chorus's were given little thought to, plus he ruins soldier by singing on it. Oh yeah, and I couldn't help feeling the artists name would have been more suitably 'G-Unit/shady Records' feat. 2pac.But on re-listening I actually came to like the album. Although the search for yet more of tupac's recordings is begining to scrape the barrell, and 3 remixes at the end pad out the album, half the tracks are really good, and half are really poor.As a huge tupac fan I am biased, so thats why I rated this album 4.

The beats dont even come close to fitting with any of the lyrics...and no, i'm not Blindly agreeing with folks here.( if so many people say that the beats dont match there must be something in it).I would not even download this off the internet.This is the worst tupac album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST PAC ALBUM IN A LONG TIME!!!","review":"Wow where do I start well Eminem did a excellent job making this album its better than Encore I think personally. Just hand over the rights to Eminem to let him and Dre work there magic and better music will happen with 2pac. Ok This Cd is very solid. But What I really dont care for is the bonus cuts I think there a waste of time and there not as good as EM's versions. So Im Basically basing my review on tracks 1-13. The best songs on the CD is Ghetto Gospel (Next Single in my mind) Thugs Get Lonely 2 Soldier and Loyal 2 The Game. I believe Eminem threw in those altered Pac voices by him saying G unit and all that is cuz he worked with his lyrics so much its as if Pac was really with him even though he wasnt.

These are not songs that 2pac would have ever produced himself, does not even have a familiar 2pac feel or vibe. Anyone purchasing this album is only making eminem richer and defaming 2pac's legacy as far as I am concerned.

Where's the sympathetic awareness of the streets? Where's the anger? Tupac was not Ludacris, 50 Cent, or Lil' Wayne. He was a poet and a philosopher and a pioneer.

Very clean beats on Ghetto Gospel, Uppercut, Black Cotton, etc...Eminem's hooks aren't as bad as people make them out to be. He has a high pitched voice.. so get over it. Eminem has more respect for 2pac than most of us know... if you've read his story you know he grew up with nothing, just like 2Pac. I think that you can hear Em's respect of 2Pac through the music in songs like Black Cotton and Ghetto Gospel.Loyal 2 The Game is probably the worst track on the CD in my opinion.Again, Em takes some liberalities in terms of his intepretation of 2Pac... but his heart is in the right place.

However, in practice it didn't deliver the goods most fans had anticpated especially since the last real album was better days. In effect, the beats didn't match the words and it made tupac sound medicore which is not the case despite this album being good lyrically. The fact is it's not eminem's album it was Tupac's to his liking and style not Eminem's. It would've been better it was produced by those who had produced his Music while he was alive or those who really knew him because these days every Tom, Dick and Harry sounds like that they feeled for Tupac and knew him which is cowardly like Eminem.

This started with Still I Rise to Until The End Of Time to Better Dayz and the quality has been going down and down and they hit rock bottom with this one.

The only time it was acceptable is when Natile Cole did unforgettable with Her father Nat (who was long passed away) as a tribute, and that is OK in my book. But for other artist, there are way to many people making money on using deceased rappers on their albums. Hey I got a great idea..Lets take rock bands next, ex..Audioslave, feat Jimi Hendrix.

That totally pisses on his memory. The Outlawz are the only ones who would deserve to be on this album. It this is how all the albums are gonna be I hope this is the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why don't you just p*ss on his grave?","review":"This is only for the fans that want EVERY 2Pac release. This is the most worthless, butchered piece of [...] \\"Official\\" Pac album made so far. All the original versions of the tracks I've heard on this album like are 1000 times better. Like the original Out On Bail, Loyal To The Game feat. TREACH not g-unit, or Thugs Get Lonley Too feat. TECH N9NE not nate dogg. The ONLY reason I got this was because I have all of his albums and I needed this one too. The entire album is garbage besides Don't You Trust Me, which isn't even that good either but it's the best thing going for this release. All the beats sound like the carnival, school yard, corny sounding beats on Encore if not worse. Basically this album is just p*ssing on Pacs grave. Until Afeni figures out noone wants to hear this [...] & releases the original versions of his unreleased tracks, if you want the GOOD versions of his unreleased tracks, get Makaveli 2-16."},{"rating":"2","title":"PAC IS STILL THE GREATEST","review":"It's sounds nice to hear pac again, Should have stuck with more WEST coast production. Em makes some cool beats though but sounds like he slowed up pac's vocal to make him fit to his beats.Overall I like the album I'm a fan of all pac's music hes still the greatest.

No tracks they way Pac wrote them. No original beats. The tempo is changed from the original. They change words to make him say things he never said, like \\"G-Unit!!\\" and \\"Drop that, Em\\". 2Pac would not have wanted this CD released the way it was. If you want Loyal to the Game, buy the cassette of the \\"Above the Rim Soundtrack\\". Or buy the Makaveli collection on Ebay to get the songs in their orginal form.This album is the worst 2Pac album period. Even worse than the Nu-Mixx Classics (another poorly remixed album). The only reason I bought it is cause I have all the other ones. I would not recommend this CD. Buy any other 2Pac CD before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"i love pac but...","review":"...this album sucks! the tracks don't sound like pac's music, it sounds like eminem's and though i respect eminem, i think he doesn't have a right to produce an album by tupac. and eventhough afeni let em produce this album, it doesn't mean wack. afeni is not tupac. eminem didn't know tupac and he made tupac collaborate with wack artists like obie trice and he even made tupac say g-unit! although we couldn't really say what could've happened, i'm relying on my belief that if tupac was alive, he wouldn't collaborate with em and especially g-unit. this album is not tupac. if you want to hear eminem's kind of music, then buy this album. you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your dough!!!","review":"I for one am a huge 2Pac fan and when I heard a new CD was coming out I was excited! But after hearing this \\"album\\" I am so dissapointed. Most of the beats were by Eminem and although I dont hate Eminem I cant stand what he did with his executive producer position on this CD! He slowed down 2Pac's vocals, Sped up 2Pac's vocal, and cut-n-pasted words together to make 2Pac say things like \\"Obie\\", \\"Em\\", \\"G-Unit\\", and more. Some of the voals on this CD are sped up so much that 2Pac sounds like he is twelve years old (refer to \\"A Crooked N**ga Too [The Eminem Version]\\"! No lie! If you buy this CD all it will do is tell Amaru / Interscope that you will pay for a Tupac CD no matter what they do to it. I know we all love Tupac but take a stand for Tupac and remind the powers that be that we want 2Pac the way 2Pac wanted to present it to us! The only song worth listening to on this whole CD is \\"Loyal To The Game\\" produced by Dj Quikk.

This is a total disgrace to Tupac's memory. There is no way in hell that Tupac would role with 50 Cent or Eminem, and now their doing this project. Total digrace. They've been messing with his vocals making them sound awful, putting themselves on the songs and making him say G Unit. I just don't get why they don't just release the originals, this is bulls***. Its just more easy money for greedy producers. Do not support this, if you want to support Tupac's legacy than pick up one of the classics -2pacalypse Now, Strictly For My N.I.G.G.A.Z. Thug Life, Me Against The World, All Eyez On Me, The Don Killuminati, R U Still Down or Greatest Hits. Do not buy this crap, cop the originals and you'll see how terribly they've messed up.

It should have had 2 verses by 2pac and 1 verse by the outlawz. That song sums up the entire CD - fake & uninspired. Its a marketing ploy to get street cred for Eminem and G-Unit with 2pac fans.The last good posthumous 2Pac CD was \\"Until The End of Time.\\" Johnny J and DJ Quick all did a wonderful job on the beats and the entire cd felt as if a lot of thought was put into it. This just sounds like Eminem was messing around in his recording studio with 2Pac acapellas.Listen to 2Pac's \\"Ghetto Gospel\\" w/ Akon and you will hear a version 10X better than the one on the CD. Why couldn't they have used that?Afeni should be ashamed of herself. Go back to Jose Johnny J \\"The Cuban Militant\\" (as 2pac called him) for beats, or go home.

The original tracks were already made and sounded great! The way Pac wanted them to. Some were unfinished, perhaps, however that could have been fixed without redoing everything Shady style.and If you want Pac's friends to remix his songs in his tradition, you'd bloody well must pay them! After all, Pac did! And these guys have to eat too! Eminem has enough cash, so he can affored to work for free.Once again, it shows Eminem worked for free.The result: 2pac \\"fast-food style\\"...straying away from his legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for PAC's standards","review":"The cd has tight-azz rhymes that only pac can deliver. No death row Makaveli-era tracks. See 2pac at his purest non-gangsterized, and activist self.That alone is reason to buy the cd.But the production is the typical 8-Mile Soundtrack style known to be used by Eminem and crew.Pac would've never used such beats and would rather have done it himself.Way too far-fetched for my tastes. Afeni went too far on this one. Lots of the beats do not even match his rap style.I say a) go out and buy the bootlegs of rhe ORIGINAL versions of his songs to get the real feel.b) lets push Afeni to release his tracks as meant to be heard.or c) release cd's mixed ONLY by producers who've worked with PAc in the past: Johnny J, Quik, Easy Mo B, Shock G, Daz, Dre. etc...buy this cd used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Tupac want Eminem to produce his 5hit?","review":"Eminems favorite song is #9 on the \\"MAKAVELI\\" album!

Personally i think every song on this cd is incredible. My favorite song is Ghetto Gospel. Elton John is a great accompaniment to 2Pac great rhymes. Eminem on Soldier like me puts on a great chorus to match the spectacular rhymes. I don't care if it is parental advisory or not every teenager should hear and truly listen to it.

In fact, he could write better songs from his grave than Eminem can alive. The only Eminem song that kind of made sense was: Coming out of the closet, and that's just because it gave an accurate description of that transsexual queerbait. That dude thinks he's a crazy muthaf**ka cause he's from Detroit, well I'll tell you what... the only thing more rotten from Detroit is their lame ass basketball team. WESTSIDE!!!!!!!!!RIP PacP.S.

But like I said , I thought I would read until I became tired of it. The book was very well written and kept me turning the pages to see what would take place next. I liked it because it was written on a cowboys point of view, and it let you into the mind of the cowboy for a better understanding why they do what they do.

I have sent it in a SECOND time now to be fixed, and was told that they will rush it to me but \\"need time to fix it properly\\". So is that now what they did the first time?

So you pay for their poor build quality, that's a sweet deal for them, no?

She didn't freak out, so the process of trimming her nails was a nice one. The design of the trimmers don't allow you to clip too much at one time.

It was very easy to clip them and they left a clean cut rather than crushing the nail like my old trimmers did. My dog seems to be much more calm when I use these than with my old trimmers. The package says \\"for medium to large dogs\\" and they look like they could trim just about any size dog's nails, even 100+ lbs. The only downside that I see is that the guard is not a reliable way to keep from cutting too short. It is always better to trim too little rather than too much so you don't hurt your dog. Luckily for me, my dog's nails are clear, but if your dog's nails are dark be extra careful. Have a vet or groomer show you how far to trim and what to look for if you aren't sure where the quick is. Usually if you look at the nail from a side profile, the nail gets thicker where the quick is. Don't trim too close to this thicker area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps a lot with nail trimming time","review":"I used to use my guillotine-style nail trimmer and found that I had a really hard time getting it into the right position before I could make the cut.

So if you want to plug it onto your PC and configure it, you need to get yourself a x-over cable.Also the new firmware can only be upgrade through the Windows based Utility. So if you are using OS other than Windows, you may have problem to upgrade your ME101.In addition, the web configuration page is slow and buggy. If you access it through the wired port, you are okay. But if you try to open it wirelessly, it is like lottory. You can open it sometimes, and can't others.Bottom line is, if you can affort a bit more, the WET11 seems like a better solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Nice but doesn't work","review":"I have spent about 2 hours too long trying to get this device to even see my wireless network.

Thinking it was perhaps a problem with the Netgear Router, I tried to use it with an Airport Express base station, and the results were exactly the same....Sees connections, drops connection, endless \\"reboot\\"...doesn't work.The web based configuration software is poorly implemented and doesn't allow for setting the bridge to see the router (gateway) and receive an IP address (DHCP) in the same domain. In other words, all you are allowed to do is select DHCP without further stipulation, i.e. IP address of the router it is seeking an IP address from. When the directions are properly followed the device continues to drop its connection to the wireless gateway. There is nothing more to say, it just doesn't work. A total waste of time and money.

It is a clunker of a product. I returned it after a week of fiddling and well-meaning but useless support from Netgear's phone support temps. In my case, it would only work if WEP was disabled and I used static IP addresses on client PCs behind the bridge. If the ME101 was a product released into a older, well-established market, it would be recalled immediately.

No flat for the month and a half since I've put them on.As an interesting aside, the Slime settles to the bottom of the tubes, and when you just start out biking, you can feel (faintly) the rhythmic thump-thump-thumping of the out-of-balance tires.

They're eccentric, which is a good thing, but not exactly brilliant or affective. The music videos I liked were No Surprises (simple, plain, but affective with Thom York's face mouthing the lyrics to the song), and Fake Plastic Trees (strange, lots of bright colors, interesting looking people, it has a somewhat vulnerable feel that's very affective). The rest to me were either just OKAY, such as High and Dry and Just, while others just didn't do anything for me, such as Paranoid Android, Street Spirit, and Karma Police.

I devoured the first 5 chapters (~170 pages) in a weekend. Then, inexplicably, the authors depart from their tutoring role and go into lecture mode. After the obligatory HelloWorld example and a few sample applications and applets in the first part of the book, we are subjected to reading the next 200 pages before another interactive exercise appears. It's a shame, too, because I really like the authors' writing style. They definitely kept me interested but I just felt that I wasn't learning anything with the meager offering of hands-on exercises.

The sound is flat. I don't think the tracks work well together in an album format, and all around it seems a bit lost. For some reason, Orton's singing doesn't seem to fit with the instrumentals. Her voice on that first track sounds as though she's dying, and I don't mean that in a good way.There are a few promising tracks, esp \\"Bobby Gentry\\" and the Roots Manuva remix, but I think that's the case in spite of, rather than due to, Beth Orton's efforts.Anyway, those of you who really like Orton (as I do) will probably go buy this disc despite this review. I suppose I'm writing this for those of you who are newly discovering her. For those of you who are interested in checking Orton's music out, I have to strongly recommend \\"Central Reservation\\" and \\"Trailer Park\\" as better places to start. She has a lot of great material out there that's worth hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This release has added some very original sounds to some of Beth Orton's songs.

She needs to stick to the minimalist acoustic thing, because when she even ventures into electronic-ville, her songs are devoid of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment for this big fan","review":"What has happened to dear Beth? Instead of new work we get a \\"best of\\" and a b side cd. What is wrong? She is far too young and too creative to retire now. Since I own every US release issued by Beth I figured I'd take a shot at this CD which is not even really a b side set. Outside of three acoustic numbers which are good, but not great, this CD is nothing to write home about.Maybe if enough of us who are true fans refuse to accept this kind of release and let Beth know that we will not spend our hard earned dollars on second - and sometimes third - rate material then she'll put together a real CD.

You will need to be pretty curious about Mr. Hooke and his cantankerous personality to navigate this book. The extensive use of quotes from original texts and letters provides the story with authenticity that is admirable but sometimes, makes it a little laborious read. I suspect it is important to understand how Hooke was hooked on patent medicines and opiates, not to say the odd heavy metal, but constantly reading about his vomiting habits is not for the squeamish, particularly at the breakfast table. However this is a great read and I came out of it feeling more sympathetic about Hooke who accomplished more in each month of his life than most of us do in a lifetime. Certainly Lisa Jardine made a comprehensive effort to capture the whole man and succeeded perhaps a little too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"London life in the 17th century","review":"It's amazing how many documents referring to Hooke have survived from the 17th century. Jardine seems to have studied them with care and insight. This is an excellent biography.

The Alloy Orchestra's soundtrack is extremely annoying as well. It undermines the emotional impact of every important scene, especially compared to the wonderful excerpts from this movie with a proper orchestral soundtrack during the documentary \\"Lou Chaney: A Thousand Faces\\".This documentary is really the only reason I decided to keep the collection.

We can only stand the low setting and even that is ridiculous. Forget even trying a higher setting.It LEAKED! The container is fine, but somehow the unit has been leaking night after night. Our entire carpet got soaked and the ceiling below the unit is all yellow with water damage!I can't believe a product like this can even be sold. I've had the unit for over a month and I'm not sure what to do.I'm definitely going to contact Holmes, but I'm expecting to get nowhere with them.

We just got ours from Home Depot and will be returning it immediatley. It doesn't work!! I was bewildered when the humidity gauge kept jumping from 29 to 39 every few seconds and would cycle on and off when in automatic mode.

I used to own a cheaper humidifier by Holmes, and it didn't work either, but then I thought I got what I paid for. This time, I am so disappointed in this company that I will never buy any of their products. How can they sell products that don't work?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good overview of keeping amphibians, but. . .","review":"This book is a good overview of keeping amphibians if you know nothing about them. There are 149 pictures in the book, which is nice if you are looking for pictures, but there are only 59 pages with explanatory text. Unfortunately the pictures cover at least 50% of most pages. Usually it's more than that. There aren't too many details about any particular aspect of amphibian care. The accounts for the species are nice but don't give too much information. They tell what kind of habitat the amphibian needs, what kind of food they eat, and gives a picture. There are also some brief chapters on breeding, housing, and diseases. If you know what kind of amphibian you want to keep it would be better if you bought another book instead. This book could be good for people who don't know which kind they want or want a little bit of an idea of what caring for an amphibian might be like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Cook????","review":"Joshua Spanogle's Isolation Ward is a gripping and suspenseful read. The plot is fairly loose throughout the book but does eventually come together. Dr. Nathaniel McCormick (Nate) is an in your face doctor that works for the Centers for Disease Control. The guy doesn't know how to back down, even from his boss and will use a caged rat if necessary (read the book, it'll make sense) to defend himself. Though I like Nate, I'm not sure he's realistic.As I read Isolation Ward, I kept drawing comparisons with the other doctor turned bestselling author, Robin Cook. This is unfair on my part, but I remember reading Cook's first bestseller Coma way back when and the comparison is natural enough. Spanogle is talented, and in time may become as good an author as Cook. Certainly, Isolation Ward is a good start.Good plot, tight dialog, and interesting characters make Isolation Ward a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid book","review":"This is a stupid book. I just stopped reading it 1/2 way through. It is not plague spreading story as you are led to believe. It is basically about one charachter who I guess is supposed to be interesting and we are supposed to care about (not and no). Investigating a possible plague outbreak ...one after another of unbelievable coincidences and all that is happening is his inner turmoil. Terrible. The only reason I gave it one star is I don't know how to give it no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very excited when I got my copy of this book. I am a big fan of medical thrillers. I started with Robin Cook and Michael Palmer and from then on I was hooked. Unfortunately for me, I selected the wrong book. It was very slow and he didn't pick up the pace until I was about 60 pages from the end. Then all hell broke loose. I have a feeling that Josh got a little help from people telling him to \\"spice it up\\". All in all, I was disappointed and still don't know what PERV means. Hope he does better on his second.

Joshua Spanogle grabs you on the first pages of this book and never lets go. His young Dr. Nathaniel McCormick has that irreverent quality of a genus and, yet, the despair of a man fighting a medical nightmare interwoven with government bureaucracy. How Spanogle made this work is a wonder, but work, it does.This is a book for those readers who appreciate a tight medical thriller, with terrific orginal characters. Pick this book up after dinner, and you won't sleep until you finish it. Welcome, young Doctor Spanogle to the ranks of Crichton and Cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good First Novel","review":"I think Joshua Spanolge has got a lot of potential. With this first novel he comes across as a solid writer with a story that has both suspense and an engrossing plot. The only thing I didn't care to much for was the lead character, Dr. Nathaniel McCormick. He's definitely not a people person and I didn't care for his attitude. Of course that's just the way he came off to me. Other than that it was a fine medical thriller and I'm sure to read his second novel tentatively entitled 'Growth Factor'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patrick Reviews the Book","review":"The Heart of A Chief is a great book.

Me and my friends didn't know if we should cry or join in.\\" This is my favorite part because Chris, the main character, notices how he and many other Native Americans feel about Native American mascots and he does something to eliminate Indian sports team mascots.

He decides to stand up for himself and class mates for what he believes in and to get the casino built somewhere off the island.I think this a very good book because it shows someone with a lot of courage doing what he believes in. This book gives the mind encouragement in doing what's right. It makes you think anything is possible and worth trying.

I too usually read a book once I start it. For the first time, I just couldn't. The storyline itself was good but the writing left much to be desired. The comparisons were awful and the dialogue, well let's just say I don't know anyone who uses \\"therefore\\" in everyday conversation. Some sentences ran on so long I found myself reading them over to understand the point. Unfortunately, even then I sometimes wondered, \\"What is he trying to say here\\" or \\"Why didn't he just say...\\" In my opinion the character development was minimal at best.

This is worse than Eric Jerome Dickey with all of the name dropping: BMW, Porsche, Pierre Cardin; and I'm willing to bet not one of those companies paid him one cent for the free advertising he gave them.

The grass was also wrapped around his neck and other limbs, trapping him completely.After several minutes of careful snipping, I was able to free our dear little mouse, but it was too late. He died shortly thereafter. Whether it was his inability to reach food and water while trapped, the mangling of his poor leg, or the stress of the whole ordeal that killed him, we don't know.

It consists in four shorter essays by then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, followed by a single longer essay by Hans Urs von Balthasar, with the total comprising roughly 2/3 Ratzinger and 1/3 von Balthasar. The whole is unified by a focus on \\"incarnational\\" ecclesiology: the relationship between the Mother of God and Mother Church, and the relationship between the incarnate Son of God and the Church as the \\"Mystical Body of Christ.\\" Ratzinger's second essay focusses on an analysis of the Second Vatican Council as a tension between the masculine and feminine principles in the Church. In like manner, von Balthasar's more speculative account concludes with an account of the Church as living in a permanent and necessary tension between the hierarchical and charismatic principles.

From the first, the outcome of this book was predictable. But, what could have been an interesting change-of-heart story; turned into a series of whining sessions. The lead female doesn't deserve her male counterpart. Her character continuously sings the sorry tune of self pity. She was truly obnoxious. By the end of the book, I wanted the Lieutenant to marry ANYBODY else. This book gets two stars for the subplots and the the perfect Lieutenant. I was disappointed with this book. Debbie Maccomber usually delivers better stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I generally enjoy any kind of romance with a military theme and the cover of this book quickly caught my eye. It's unfortunate, because I endured 297 pages of boredom in order to get to the anti-climatic finish.The \\"heroine\\" of the tale, Erin MacNamera is a bland character with very few redeeming qualities. Forced to grow up as a navy brat, she refuses to engage in a relationship with a wonderful man simply because he is in the military. She is petty, spiteful, and rude in her quest to drive him away.My biggest problem with the story is the fact that the author conveys an attitude that growing up as a military brat is a prison sentence. She fails to mention the plethora of benefits there are to being a military dependent. Most children of military tend to be outgoing, culturally sensitive, broadly educated and adventurous.This is the first book I've read by this author and it will also be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Navy Brat - Apt Description","review":"The title is apt. The lead character is, in fact, an undeserving brat who meets a wonderful lieutenant jg. However, she doesn't want a relationship with the guy because he's in the military and she cherishes the stability of not having to move as his tours of duty change. She behaves miserably towards him. One would only hope that the lieutenant would meet someone better.

Early on in the narrative, Scudder is told frankly by a young doctor after a two-day alcohol blackout, \\"if you drink, you'll die.\\" Scared by the warning, Scudder takes a case he doesn't want in a despearte attempt to distract him from alcohol. His struggles with the bottle come across very real and are harrowing to behold. The case is a good one as well with Scudder attempting to track the manaical killer of a hooker who was trying to leave the life. Death is an ever constant theme, with the book's title being a riff on the old literary saying \\"there are eight million stories in the naked city.\\"This book is everything great private detective fiction should be; dark, cynical, violent and lonely.

Now, I am 60 and my 18-year-old daughter has spread her wings and is beginning to wonder if there isn't something more than the history she learned in high school. This book was my Christmas present to her and she's delighted with it. Perhaps someday she'll give her own daughter a similar book. Thank you, Evelyn Reed, for your hard work, brilliant mind, and excellent writing ability for giving women their place in the evolution of humankind."},{"rating":"2","title":"good solid groove album!","review":"I think a couple of these reviews are rather harsh, this really isn't a bad cd at all! Lenny and Victor have a nice groove going throughout, not too much showboating (they've matured in 20 or so years folks!)

The production is great, the beats are fire and his lyrics are crazzzyyy. Killa Cam has his own style of rhyming and its straight fire. Camron flows over the tracks nicely and it continues with around 18-19 tracks (with the exception of skits) on the cd. I cant name the best tracks cuz there are so many. This is not quite a classic but this is a must have for any REAL rap fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cam should just stop","review":"There were only two tracks that were outstanding on Cam's over-long album, and they were both produced by Kanye West. The rest of the production is also on point, but Cam's \\"mic skills\\" do not compliment the slick production and at times, his feeble attempts at rapping are laughable. And you wonder why Nas didn't hit him with an Ether..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite the simplicity...","review":"Cam'ron just got that creativity people, although at times you think you could have said something like that. His lyrics make sense, it is actually hard to play on words the way he does and he still manages to disclose reasonable information. But what is very key to point out about the album is that the production is on point. The tracks are produced with skill and focus and I applaud the production of the record.\\"...that's how i play mine, jump over the grapevine, take my chances one on one with the k-9's...\\"Thats some ill lyrical weaponry right there ya'll, how many of you are gonna fight k-9s when the jakes is tryin to put you away on rockafellar laws kid?

The intro cam has is a great beginning. It sets the tone for the rest of the album. Hot tracks include Down and Out, Kanye was on point with this beat, Adrenaline, cam swicthes up his flow and twista spitting that fire, and Get 'em Girls, which is old but still a hot track. The only thing wrong with the album is too many skits, some are funny but others are not needed. Cam'ron Purple Haze is a great cd for a collection.

He is as much a \\"killa\\" as \\"murder mase\\". LOL!!!!! Cam is wack plan and simple. His whole camp are the worst rappers in the industry. Yeah Kanye may have laced the album with dope beats but that is the only element that is dope. Instead of wasting those beats, kanye should have saved them for an artist that has quality lyrics. To make it easy for people to understand, Cam is a BEAT WASTER.

I've made myself listen to it all the way through about 6 times over trying to get myself into it, and I just can't. There's only like 2 good songs and the rest are bad. The beats sound like some ameteur producer made them; the rapping from Cam'ron and guests sounds like people who're trying rap for the first time, and the lyrics are garbage. I mean, I absolutely love rap and hip-hop and have been a devoted listener since 1994, but this CD just didn't do it for me. Maybe hardcore Cam'ron fans would like this, but in my opinion, you could close your eyes at some CD store and pick a better rap CD than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dipset in da buildin","review":"Killa Cam out did his self this is his best cd to date with perfect beats and rhymes that have face value and a deeper meaning just listen to dipset forever and u'll kno wat i mean no matta if u a dipset hater or was just neva really intruiged by the movement this is a must buy classic for any rap fan period. Cam has potential commercial songs like Get 'em Girls produced by Chitowns Kanye West and then he keeps it real street with songs like adrenaline rush/psycho drama featuring twista and he adds a remix of the dis track to mase called father forgive us at the end.

She is deeply psychologically disturbed and wants to have sex with her father. She's violent and has severe anger problems. The father should have recognized this - but seems unaware all the way to the end. It's unbelievable that the daughter wasn't forced to have counseling. In the movie, it's never even considered as a means to help the girl.The film-makers seem to believe that receiving a good beating or giving a good beating is the way to solve deep rooted psychological problems. A notion in itself which is very disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Exciting movie. Extremely funny, somewhat risque, a little bit violent, quite unusual, and oddly heart-warming.

Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild goose chase","review":"Initially, the questions on this practice guide appeared useful. however, as i took the practice exams, I realized that the questions were far afielf of what would be on the exam. There was alot of general psych questions that were completely irrelevant to the exam. Even the ones that addressed school psych were extremely outdated (some appeared to be from about 1978), often drawing on tests that were no longer in use for a very long time. I could go on and on about how far afield many practice questions were from the real exam. This book, unless you are a psychology history buff and intend to play psychology trivial pursuit, can only serve to worry and annoy a potential test taker."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!","review":"This book was out of date when I was in graduate school 30 years ago. This is especially disturbing because the NASP exam hasn't been around that long. Not only are the test editions obsolete, but there are many questions based on psychoanalytic theory,answers based on discredited theory (e.g. etiology of homosexuality, and answers that are simply incorrect. It looks as if the author stuck some very old exams together without much concern about their relevance to current practice or NASP guidelines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this item","review":"This review refers to the NTE/PRAXIS edition (actually, it is an older edition, NTE/PRAXIS is a label pasted over the original title).

While the plot of Gantz seems like it would make a great series, what was achieved in two seasons could have been done in two DVDs.

But alas, all I got was DBZ feeling fights going on for many episodes and endlessly whining characters.The art in Gantz is beautiful. The concept is so cool. The characters are rich and feeling.

The End.I felt the series was a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, really bad execution","review":"The most frustrating aspect of this series is when you're yelling at the screen for the fools to get on with their task... and you will do this for EVERY episode. The characters do a lot of standing around talking and, depending on whether the plot requires it or not, the villains will either patiently wait for them to finish, or take advantage of the inaction and kill someone.While on missions, none of the characters react to their particular situations in a manner that is even imaginably believable. Yet, when they are returned to their normal lives, the story shifts to an endearingly humanistic spectrum. It is during these times that the writing is the best. Still, the mystery of Gantz is suppose to be the most compelling, but sadly, the writing in these areas just falls apart.Aside from all that, the artwork is top-notch and the action, as rare as it may be, is pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Reading","review":"For anybody that is infatuated with Mt. Rainier, this is the book for you. Living in the Pacific Northwest, Rainier is a fact of life for all of us. On sunny, clear days when it towers over the downtown seattle skyline, we say that the \\"mountain is out\\" and cannot help but steal glances at its mighty presence.It is readily apparent that this book is a labor of love for the author. He revels in any and all information about the mountain that he can track down. All of his studies of the mountain add flavor to his own wanderings. He sees in the mountain all of the history, geology, native folklore, and danger that it deserves. His respect is palpable and his experiences are priceless. If you want to experience Rainier in a different way than you ever have before, you need to check this out.This book is well written, an easy read, and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A triumph!","review":"This book was like a hybrid of two of my favorite books - \\"Arctic Dreams\\" by Barry Lopez, and \\"Into Thin Air\\" by Jon Krakhauer. It brought back memories of my boyhood in Seattle dreaming about the adventure of someday climbing this ever present entity. I felt the wet slap of rain soaked branches of the coastal forest as I read through this. I had always heard about the air crash of marines buried on the Mountain, and now that I have read about it I feel the Mountain's mystique even more. Thanks Bruce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I have to admit I thought Bruce was a bit odd for feeling so passionate about a mountain.

Barcott says many silly things in order to make up for poor research and sloppy editing, but his humor strikes me as being of the adolescent \\"look at me, I can swear, Ma\\" than, well, funny. I would definately give this sorry tale a miss. Rainier deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"No desire to vist Ranier after this","review":"After slogging through this overwritten and overwrought account of the author's obsession with Mr. Rainier, I lost what little interest I had in ever visiting the place. The mountain is painted as dreary and gray, with grimy little spots of human encroachment. The only moderately interesting part of the book are the chapters on the Himalayas and high altitude climbing, which, if Barcott stayed on point, would not even be in the book.

I really don't know who's idea the levels were, but they must have been in some sort of dream state."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching this DVD will give you a full blown stress attack","review":"I personally love Russell Crowe and 30 Odd Foot of Grunts. My excitment in receiving this DVD was soon a great disapointment. With the DVD come four pages of instructions on how to navigate throughout the DVD to see all of the features. Some of the insutructions were very detailed including looking for hidden codes in the credits section of the four page booklet. If you were unable to successfully navigate to a certain section, you were denied access. I did not spend almost $30.00 on a DVD where I have to work so hard to figure out how to watch the DVD. I am VERY disappointed with this product, and I urge others not to buy it. My husband and I screwed around with this ridiculous DVD for almost four hours and still could not access all of the features. The features are all encrypted and encoded, and a huge pain in the [rear]. Save your money. And Russell, please forgive me for slamming this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very much Russell Rent This One","review":"Russell Crowe is a huge movie star and he is the draw to this movie. (And there is nothing wrong with that.) Yet he chose to be in the film very little. He treats himself as a equal to the other band menbers, ( which of course he is not), giving himself very little screen time. Yet, he alone is the reason most people would ever be interested in watching this movie. Crowe promotes the other band members, while he takes a back seat in this film. I guess he thinks it will give his band more credibity. I think he hopes that people care about them based on their music alone, and not his own personal fame. What a joke! If you have never heard TOFOG before, why would you care about anyone else in this film except for the major movie star. When you see the movie, it is obvious,he is hung up about his fame in relation to promoting his band. I found this movie rather boring when Crowe wasn't in it which was a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Texas rocks","review":"Loved the glimpse into behind the scenes...TOFOG definitely rocks the house...sounds like they need to be experienced live to be appreciated fully...although trying to get to all the different levels of the DVD was quite a challenge, I'm sure ole Russell is laughing....but the frustration was well worth it...after viewing this can't wait to see them live!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"You can't just plug this DVD in, kick back and enjoy. No, instead it contains several different levels that require a code to access. How asinine is that? I couldn't get any of the DVD to play because even the first level required a code and of course codes aren't provided. This band is way too arrogant and mediocre to waste your money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Official????","review":"The Attributes that I dislike about this book far outnumber the ones that I find likeable. It has an extroardinary number of definitions however most of them do nothing more than point out the obvious. The author obviously avoids technical detail. Since I bought this book I have been thrilled everytime I find a definition, but then let down by the lack of detail, and excess of ambiguity. My wish is for Mr. Newton the author, to add more detailed definitions in the next edition. The Encyclopedia of Telecommunications (McGraw Hill)is a richly detailed book, but does not have nearly as many entries as this one. If you can afford it, get them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed with Useful Info","review":"Newton's Telecom dictionary continues to be a favorite with students in my TrainingCity.com classes.

Although the illustration is quite appealing, with a unique Korean accent in all the drawings, the stories are poorly translated. There are many strange or clumsy sentences and inappropriate use of words, and words that are difficult for young children to understand. The book isn't geared toward user-friendliness for the young readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous! Classy!

It goes over the basics like tuning, grasping the pick,etc., but soon enough you're playing some nice tunes. The primer is written in tabulature as well as normal musical notation, making it all the easier to pick up quickly. I practice about 20 minutes per day and it has taken me about three months to get through and master the material. I now feel I have a good base to build on for further improvement. I highly recommend the video with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be misled...","review":"After watching the beginning of this movie for the first 10 minutes or so, any viewer would form the view that it was a documentary. But it's not.I am hard to please when it comes down to viewing deep subjects, but I was surprised just how good this movie was. I feel it gives a realistic look into the lives of those addicted to and affected by heroin.The acting is so-so but I feel if other actors were used, the movie may not have been so real to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"Tis is a great book to use for back to school. the students in first grade love to share their own stories after we read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This story did not really grab and hold my interest or my 4 year olds.

GREAT pictures, as usual by Mark Teague.Enjoyable and worth purchasing (used in good condition) anyway - as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"back to school\\" book!","review":"This is a fun \\"back to school\\" book with a twist. The main character is asked to write about his summer vacation and he chooses to write something that is obviously fiction. He tells about being kidnapped by cowboys and spends the summer with them instead of with his aunt. I read this book to my second graders on the first day of school and they love it.Part of the way through the book I start hearing comments from them such as \\"he's not telling the truth\\", and \\"he's just kidding\\". There are many fun activities that can be done using this book as a springboard. I usually have my students write about their summer vacation and it can be the truth or it can be fiction. After their writing is complete they share it with the class and we guess whether it is the truth, or like the boy in the book, fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids loved it","review":"My kids are 6 and 8 and I read out loud to them everyday.

The art work is wonderful, too and really helps the story along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant Relativist","review":"Like another reviewer here, I too felt his book spiral down in the latter chapters. The penultimate insult was when the young lady in Mozambique said she would pray for him and he had the audacity to basically say..\\"F Off\\" in so many words. I never finished the book after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Theroux is usually pretty dead on in his travel books. This one is no exception.The only parts of these books that are boring or irritating are when he meets other authors or describes his unbelievable talents...e.g. He claims to speak fluent Mandarin Spanish Arabic Swahili and a couple local African languages....and..and..and. But these really don't detract from the books.He is not sex obsessed in this book thank heavens.In this book he sucks up to some female author in Johannesburg he gets his karmic due for that as you will see in the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get to Know Africa","review":"An amazing story of a journey from the top to bottom of Africa. Very little joy here but it sounds sadly real. An extraordinary description of apartment building with people dumping their waste onto the road, young prostitutes, and goals not met."},{"rating":"2","title":"Editing mistakes","review":"I really enjoyed this book (like all the others of Theroux that I have read) as it I could really imagine the places that he went to. Theroux's insight and observations are fascinating.The only criticism I have is that we do not know how long it took him to complete his journey. Or did he perhaps interrupt his travels?I also found it quite disturbing that there were a few editing mistakes: the Big Five does not include the giraffe but consists of the elephant, lion, leopard, buffalo and rhinoceros. A freeway in Afrikaans is not a \\"vryweg\\" but a \\"hoofweg\\".He also tends to repeat himself a bit. Perhaps some tighter editing in the next edition is called for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misanthropic Safari","review":"I read this book before a recent extensive trip to Kenya and Tanzania. I had never been to Africa before so the book, in large part, shaped my expectations of African people and society. I took it for granted that I would be robbed, maybe even as soon as I arrived at the airport. I even went so far as to wear ragged clothing and carry a cheap bag, in order not to make myself a target. Now that I have returned from my trip, I wonder whether the author and I visited the same continent. The people I met were warm and friendly. I never felt threatened and, to my surprise, was never robbed. Now I see that the author had an overly negative point of view regarding Africa, especially Kenya. I suppose every society has its good and bad sides. Unfortunately, the author focused all of his attention on the bad and ignored all that is good about Africa. This is probably a reflection of him and his own pitiful view of life and people, than an accurate depiction of the continent."},{"rating":"1","title":"He has completed his transition","review":"Theroux was becoming a grouch and a crab in Pillars of Hercules. His writing was going downhill then and now he is complete. He is mocking, sniggering, back-stabbing and complaining the whole time. He is nastily anti-Christian and insults them to their face and in print. He makes snide remarks about people who go to Africa to see the animals, \\"pestering\\" in his words, and then hypocritically proceeds to go to a luxury resort that few of us could afford and .... sees the animals. Theroux is an elitist who looks down his nose at most of the rest of us. Lots of tedious passages in this book, reading about this breakdown, that flat tire, etc.Only valuable part of this book is the heartbreaking view of the poverty in Africa that is being made worse, not better, by the aid we have been sending. There are other books that are worth reading. This is the last book of his I will buy and I used to be a real fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theroux!","review":"I enjoyed The Great Railway Bazaar more than this one but, in my book, Theroux still ranks as one of the finest writers of this generation.

I don't know or care to know who or how they were rated because you know it was all political. This movie has several classic scenes that are so funny that it appears that the actors were caught off guard and were laughing along with the audience.

While early 80s comedies relied on star power and heavy gag-driven comedy, \\"Porky's\\" appeared with great realistic serio-comedy and a bunch of natural unknown actors.The film follows horny teenagers. You'd expect it to just be stupid storytelling and non-stop tasteless humor. But Clark fleshed out the characters into broad, believable, flawed humans. Each one has an interesting backstory or purpose.Very compelling in that \\"coming-of-age\\" way that doesn't take itself too seriously.

The so called \\"shocks\\" are tired and way outdated. There's absolutley nothing shocking or indecent about this movie. The \\"classic\\" scene where the fat teacher wants to identify the [...] she saw in the showers was pathetic. When the two gym teachers suggest putting up wanted posters and keep laughing like idiots I just stared blankly at the television wondering what the hell was so funny. What a waste of 90 minutes.

Matt and Meridith from Paradise are involved in this story too. It's nice to see their return. I loved Perfect and Paradise and this was in the same genre.A very fast read. A so so mystery.

I don't know of any other author who can capture me by just the actual \\"falling in love\\" moments the way JM can.Normally I stick to authors who pretty much ignore/are unable to write this way, and make up for it with a combination of action, secondary story lines and heat (of course). Many times the reader is left with the feeling that attraction between characters just magically morphed into love while you were turning a page and didn't notice. With a JM book, you see the falling in love happen as it unfolds effortlessly.This ability to engage the reader with just this truly makes her stand out as a great writer, her books stand out from the usual romance fare, makes readers fall in love with her characters ... and her books be an automatic buy for me. Other than the rush ending (yes, gotta concur a bit there), mostly bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Mistake","review":"I am a Judith McNaught fan. I waited patiently for Every Breath you Take. So much so, that I remember when the title was going to be Water's Edge. Try as I might, I just couldn't get into the main characters, whose names I cannot even remember. Once they left the island, the book went downhill. It was choppy and lacked energy. There were too few love scenes and many questions left unanswered. It was even anticlimatic when the two reunited. After reading Perfect and Paradise, Every Breath You Take is definitely a disappointment. I plan to give the book away to my public library. Judith, if you are reading these customer comments, you owe us another book where you have plenty of time to write it and develop the characters. Also, I agree with one of the reviewers about diversity. Judith, the world does indeed have black and brown people.

First, one character explains a great deal of the back story to two others in great detail for pages. Then the aunt shows up and fills in the rest. talk, talk, talk, Exposition, exposition, expositition. NO action. I got this as a sample so perhaps it's not a good idea to admit that I refused to pay for the entire book, but that really is a good criterion. If the first 5% isn't any good, why pay for and read the rest?"},{"rating":"2","title":"There WERE too many holes","review":"I agree with Stephanie N. about all of the holes left open in the story. Another question is....What was the point of Kate's father being killed? And Wyatt's father's death was explained way too simply, when they spend time trying to connect Wyatt to the deaths of the two of them and his own brother. And where did the sister-in-law disappear to? When do police detectives ever get carte' blanche to go to Anguilla and St. Maarten to follow someone when only one little piece of circumstantial evidence may tie him to a crime?I really liked the main characters, but the storyline needed lots of help. Evan was a waste of space. I have a feeling we'll be seeing Gray in another story....usually when there's a single, attractive, rich man in a story......another book follows."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Judith McNaught novel!","review":"I own and have read every novel by this author, including her contemporary first novels. This is her best! Her two main characters, despite a misunderstanding in the middle of the book, actually like each other - something that surprisingly cannot be taken for granted! Both are strong people whose romance enrich their lives. Fortunately, the murder \\"mystery\\" does not consume the story.

I've been reading McNaught ever since she first came over 20 years ago, and have been one of her most ardent fans, but this book is bad. The love scenes are clichéd, the main characters wooden, and the plot tired."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must read\\"","review":"The added scenes in this book are exactly what those who couldn't really \\"get into\\" this book, needed.

However, I wanted more from Judith McNaught and EBYT. And in the Special Edition I found it. Ms. McNaught's trademark poignancy brought tears to my eyes, her humor made me laugh out loud, and her further development of the characters enriched the storyline.Judith listens to her readers which makes her unique among authors. I recommend this new Special Edition to loyal and new readers of romance and Judith McNaught."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't read more than 170 pages","review":"I really do try to give all books a chance and I hardly ever quit, but this just got ridiculous. I kept waiting for the story to unfold, but I had to go through 170 pages of LUST and I still hadn't gotten to the story. I'm all for lust, but 170 pages nonstop? Please. It gets old after awhile. I hope the book had a happy ending because I doubt seriously that I will ever find out. This book is being given to GoodWill. I doubt that I will ever buy another book by the author. Dumb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"I'm mystified that any romance fan could read this book and honestly believe it compares it to Ms. McNaught's better books and characters. Judith McNaught is a good writer, and has written some excellent books, but this is not one of them. Every Breath You Take is poorly, poorly done.While the beginning is okay, the ending is rushed and imcomplete. After reading it, I wondered if Ms. McNaught took a vacation in Anguilla and needed to get this book published by the end of '05 in order to write off the vacation on her taxes.Also, like some of the other reviewers here, I have to question the high starred reviews written. Either family and friends are padding the rankings or the publisher and publicist are doing it, because I don't believe people who have to consider where to invest their book money would advise other readers to buy this book.If you must read this book (as I felt I had to) make sure you borrow it, because at least then you'll only regret the time you spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't hold your breath...","review":"The book description starts with; \\"Unforgettable characters, sizzling romance, and riveting suspense: These are the trademarks of beloved author Judith McNaught.\\" Read the reviews, not the product description before buying this one.I didn't find this book full of sizzling romance or riveting suspense. The book was very flat. The characters forgettable.Don't hold your breath in hopes that this is gonna be a good book. Judith McNaught is an excellent writer who usually does write unforgettable characters, sizzling romance, and riveting suspense, she just missed on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"every breath you take","review":"pales in comparison to earlier works by the same author. lacks edge and ends abruptly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best","review":"Ms. McNaught is a fantastic fictional novelist. It is hard to find any other writer in this genre who has created so many memorable stories and characters. I can read her books over and over and never grow tired of the material. But, this book is lacking her \\"magical touch\\". It is not her best work. It has more filler than story line and will not end up on my bookshelves. If you love her work and must read this book than get it at the library. Some of her best titles includethe following:Paradise,Double Standard, Until You, Once and Always, Something Wonderful, Kindom of Dreams and Night Whispers. Read these first and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Breathe You Take (Special Edition)","review":"The extended version of EBYT is fabulous. I could not have been happier when the paperback came out and it have about 100 pp added to it. I wish all authors would do this with their books. BRAVO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pale Shadow of Earlier Works","review":"I'm a huge McNaught fan (Perfect, Paradise and Whitney My Love being my favorites, in that order), but her last couple of books lack the spark of earlier works. The protagonists are not as clearly defined, or appealing, as those of earlier books. More importantly, the misunderstanding upon which the plot turns (and separates the lovers for nearly two years)is so flimsy that the reader is left thinking that both of them are morons. He said meet him at the boat. Why didn't you just go to the boat? I would ask our heroine. This book is for diehard McNaught fans only, and even they will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Predictable & Boring!","review":"This book can be best described as \\"okay\\". I, personally, was not impressed. Although I finished the book I found it predictable and dull. This is the second book by Judith McNaught I have read, the first one being \\"Paradise\\" which I enjoyed. I felt that \\"Every Breath You Take\\" was written in the same format as \\"Paradise\\". I can't believe this Best Selling author had no imagination or originality in this book. If you are a die hard fan you might enjoy this. If you are not, you might want to save your money and pick something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judith McNaught is Back","review":"Judith's last two books were good, but they didn't compare to Paradise or Perfect. She redemes herself with this one. She brought back Matt and Meredith along with Zack and Julie. I enjoyed Every Breath You Take. Let's hope it doesn't take two years for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing story","review":"I am the fan of Judith Macnaught and read each of her creation. But I think this is the worst book of her novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Similar story line, 250 years later","review":"This book reads like one of Ms Naught's old work: Almost Heaven, in the 21st century. The plot might have worked in the 18th century, not doesn't work quite well for the 21st century. The characters in this modern version are not very well developed. Almost as if a few chapters of the book were missing. For example, Ms McNaught took the trouble to paint a detailed picture of Aunt Olivia in the opening, but Olivia disappears and doesn't make a reappearance until the end of the book. What happended in between that endeared Olivia to the jaded leading man? It is also quite improbable for a worldly man to fall head over heels over a woman he just met without knowing anything about her. The readers cannot be convinced that a character in the book is intelligent just because the author kept stating he is; the author has to demonstrate it either through deed or through conversations. I found none in this book. A great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your typical McNaught","review":"I love Judith Mcnaught's work. Her historicals are stellar one-of-kind novels that pull at your heart strings. In my opinion all of her historicals are winners. SOME of her contemporary works are fabulous as well - Perfect and Paradise to name a few. There are other contemporary flops though (Remember When, Triumphant Heart, etc). Every Breath You Take was such a disappointment. The plot, character development, and writing was not up to par. I found it very hard to believe that a couple could fall in love in 2 days, be separated for two years and then fall back in love instantly upon meeting again. It was really forced.Someone mentioned it was \\"amatuerish\\" and I have to agree. I think anyone could have written this novel. I understand that the book was rushed, and to tell you the truth it reads like a novel that was written in a mad dash.I love Judith but this book was just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that this book was a huge disappointment. The only emotion I felt after finishing it was anger. I can't even put it in the category of one of Judith McNaught's \\"weaker\\" books. Those books were enjoyable, if not memorable. I thought EBYT was poorly written and poorly crafted, and I feel stupid for getting it. Book money is hard for me to come by -- I won't make the mistake of buying JM again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Loved this book the many times I read it in the past. I am disappointed that the updated version contains so much profanity. Is that what it takes for people to enjoy a book today?

I have read most of them more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Dynamics","review":"This family started out with an unwanted baby boy that was sent away to avoid complications and embarressment, was now being welcomed back because he was very successful, wealthy and powerful. It follows his emotional journey through the family and their close wealthy asociates and the intentional problems they place in his way. It is a wonderful story that makes you wish it was longer, because you did not want to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst McNaught Yet!","review":"I can't believe the 4+star reviews, (I think author friends or family are writing for Judith) This is the worst book she has ever written. In the story Mitchell is an intelligent multimillionaire but behaves like a 2 year old.I can't believe that an intelligent man would behave so stupidly, if he really cared for Katherine he would have been following her life.(therefore no surprises!) I never felt Mitchell was in love with Katherine.This is the same story as her last few books with the names changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"My sister in law is a huge Judith McNaught fan and started me reading her books. I have read just about all of them now and have enjoyed each one. However, I thought this was terrible and not up to McNaught's usual great writing. I thought this book was very similar to her last book - super rich guy suspected of murder. The suspense was not much and the misunderstanding that pulls the two main characters apart is so contrived that it feels fake! The two main characters supposedly fall in love after 3 days together on vacation and then when reunited 30 months later are still in love - this is so unrealistic. I still finished it and it was a quick read but I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"Come on- this? Again with the self-made bajillionaire tycoon hero/movie star/british lord who's been wronged by his family and wrongly judged by society? But she's done this story! A lot! I liked this story and these (yes decidedly flat) characters better when she wrote them in other books. She should have just left well-enough alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old boring plot","review":"Judith McNaught needs to go back and write Historicals. Her recent books haven't been as entertaining as her previous stories. I couldn't even finish reading this book! It is very rare for me to not finish a book no matter how bad it is! The plot is the same as the previous few books before it! The story started out good but it went downhill quickly toward the middle of the book. I've read and finished all her other books beside this one. I am skeptical about her future releases and will only read them if I have nothing else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"This is my first book review and I decided to do it because I was so dissapointed by this book. I love Judith Mcnaught books and have almost all of them. I read Paradise and Perfect many times over and was looking forward to this one too. However, this book was lacking all the details and plot development that the other books had. I agree with the other reviews that this book had too many loose ends and unanswered questions. It had great potential for a wonderful book - the cherachters, the mystery, the setting and the story. I wish it was written better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment","review":"I don't know if I have just outgrown McNaught or if she just doesn't have it anymore - either way, this book was a disappointment. I don't know why she insists on writing romantic mystery books - others do this genre so much better. It seems that no thought went into this book - and frankly, I am tired of the heroine \\"wiping her hands on the side of her pants\\" (mentioned three times ), this was fine for the young innocent in \\"Almost Heaven\\" - in a woman who has been having an affair for years, it sounds ridiculous. McNaught has been turning out bad books for a long time now, and this is sad for all of her fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TOTAL AND ABSOLUTE MESS!!!","review":"The dialogue had all the formulaic style Ms. McNaught is known for, however, I do not believe she wrote this book. It is reminiscent of the old Mills & Boon/Harlequin format where the characters and the storyline are not well developed. Throwing in the characters she had on her previous work (Paradise, Perfect & Someone To Watch Over Me)must have been done for good measure in order for her fans to remember her earlier work, since this book was just below average."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 pages of fluff then it gets good...kinda","review":"I usually really love her books and this one was good but not great.I think if the first 150 pages of \\"will she wont she\\" were not so repetitive it would be much more enjoyable. The characters of Kate and Mitchell were likeable and the story did get better as it went along.It was just way too fluffy for me and not a suspense at all.I also find the lifestyle of her characters so insanly unreal. Private jets, nannies,access to five million dollars in 2 hours, Money beyond imagination. Just too fluffy......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased","review":"I was completely disappointed in this book. I love Judith McNaught but this book was not well-written. I read her acknowledgements in the beginning and what I came away with that she had to hurry up and write this book. The last 80 pages of the just lost my interest and I could feel McNaught lost the story and had to hurry up and finish the book. I would like to see this book recalled and focused more on a well thought out ending before returning to the shelves instead of a \\"rushed, hurry up and get it published\\" type of approach.Judith McNaught's best book by far is \\"Perfect\\" with \\"Paradise\\" following up with a close 2nd place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every Breath You Take","review":"I guess I am just nor a romance novel kind of gal.The descriptions of the lead characters just go on and on, as do those of the \\"sumptuous\\" surroundings.

Not so. JM's depiction of Kate Donavan and Michael Wyatt as two people who are meant for each other no matter what was so wonderfully written that I drew out the last few chapters as one would a favorite dessert.

My only disappointment is that I've read and reread every one of her books and wish there were more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Read","review":"The difficult part of reading this book was the poor character development and the lack of resolution with storylines. Kate's uncle tells us that she reads people very well, so thus was able to determine Mitchell was a \\"good\\" guy after knowing him for 2 days. Why then, was she unable to see Evan's darker side after 4 years of dating? Why did Mitchell not want children with his first wife, but was more than willing to have several with Kate? What changed him? Why was Kate's mother not a factor in her life? Was her father randomly killed or was it murder? A very frustrating read. I skimmed the last 50 pages to get it over with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reader's preview","review":"I had the opportunity to read this work - before its official release. I highly recommend this book if you are a Civil War buff, even if you aren't! The first hand accounts of what is was like to be a young cavalryman during the American Civil War are engaging for any reader, particular those who like adventure and history. But be prepared, this book takes a no-apologies approach to its subject matter: it is decidedly Southern. In this lies a certain charm, if you want to call it that. It is supplemented with numerous period photos and drawings that enhance the reading experience. In addition, it covers the often forgotten war in the western theater and the subsequent fighting in and around that doomed little town called Atlanta. Over all, it is recommended reading..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There Done That","review":"Industrial fiction meets holocaust fiction and the survivor myth.

I do not like the grooves in the pan because after, for instance, frying an egg, the grooves retain food and if you don't use a brush to scrub the grooves you'll find that after it has dried there are going to be bits of food caught in the grooves. I can't imagine cleaning a whole set of this cookware.

Yes-this one moves along pretty well, too, but noted a time refence flaw pretty quickly (from 8 yrs ago to 9 years ago). Did NOT see that these characters were developed nearly as well as those in past works. The kid is great at music and really good with horses and karate(with very few, if any, examples to support this). Mom is a former member of an elite team,with the love interest being the team leader. Again, very little to no support of how much butt she can kick or of how sharp this guy is as a leader. f-l-a-t"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiffen up!","review":"I've read every single Iris Johansen book, and this is definitely the worst! To me it was something like you'd expect from a Harlequin Romance novel. And how many times does she have to use the word \\"stiffen\\"?

I know Ms Johansen can write - I guess we'll have to wait until the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"This was the first Johansen book I have read and it was a total disappointment.

Yes, the manly man hero is fine, and the rest of the characters are swell, but the whole tale falls apart when the horse scenes raise their ugly heads.Really, couldn't Johansen have at least read something other than \\"The Black Stallion\\" books before trying to write about horses? The whole plot line is just ridiculously implausible.Sorry, but if you know anything about horses, don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh....","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author, and I thought it was horrible. The characters are incredibly unrealistic. Frankie is the most annoying of them all, second is Grace. I couldn't relate at all, it took forever to finish because I couldn't stand reading it, and it was just plain uninteresting. I'll probably read another book just to see if this book is not like her usual work. I'm now reading a Dean Koontz book (one of my favorite authors), and it's so refreshing to read an author who at least has some characters that are relatable in some way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was hoping third time would be a charm...","review":"After being disappointed by 'Countdown' and 'Killer Dreams', I was ready to give Ms. Johansen ONE MORE try. After all, third time is the charm, right? At least, hopefully.This story started out decently enough, but it quickly degenerates into another sketchy, lackluster storyline. I found the Pair to be more interesting than any of the human characters within the book (or the other two books I read) The premise was just hard to swallow, especially since the explanations were not well-done. After this, I won't be reading any more books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to read it so many times....","review":"I attempted to read this book multiple times and simply could not do it. I tried from the beginning a few times. Then I thought, we'll maybe it's just a slow beginning. I attempted to read a few chapters in and still found myself incredibly bored. I checked to see if it was a sequel because I felt SURE that I was missing something that would make the plot make sense. Photos of blue eyed horses in the passenger seat of a car, the CIA watching a woman on a ranch with a precocious and \\"special\\" child who doesn't know who her father is. Horses who \\"know\\" things... It was clique and boring - boring - boring. I simply could NOT get into it after attempting for two years. I have now given up and am about to donate it so that another poor soul can waste their time attempting to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither fish nor fowl","review":"I love good mysteries. This book is not a good mystery. Reminds me more of a rather silly romance novel. It is sort of a throw in the kitchen sink and call it done.

Will not buy another book by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the new characters","review":"I enjoy Iris Johansen best when she veers far away from the urge to fall back on her early writings as a romance novelist.She has interesting characters, a great plot and keeps the reader turning the pages, and sad when the book ends. Not because the book is not entertaining, rather we want to know more about these characters and how their lives unfold. MS Johansen did make a grave error in one of her story lines, all amateurs know better than to do what her characters did while in hiding. I won't spoil it for you, you will recognize it readily. A good read, if you like MS Johansen's novels you will Thoroughly enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and fast moving","review":"Good story line in this fast moving novel. It was elementry sometimes though in her choice of words. Would be great for school girls who love horses like my daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I'm a long time fan of Iris Johansen's books, but I found On The Run very disappointing. The character and relationship development was weak when compared to her many other excellent books. The plot had potential, but tended to drag on. It didn't help that I found obvious holes in the plot.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone knowledgeable about horses. There were glaring errors in details specific to horses that I found very distracting. I usually find horse-related errors in fiction, but some of these errors were fundamental to the plot so key story elements became too unrealistic for the plot to be successful for me ... even as fiction.With better research and attention to detail regarding the horses, the plot that focused so much on horses could have been adjusted to work well. Non-horsemen wouldn't be aware of the errors and perhaps they would enjoy this book. Many other Johansen books have been keepers for me to re-read, but not this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful book","review":"I am constantly amazed at what can get published. The plot of this book requires the reader to suspend any sense of logic and rationality. In fact, the plot is so far-fetched I thought it was a parody. The characters are not believable at all. The reader is supposed to believe that Mozart has been re-incarnated as Frankie. Um right. And I am the queen of Spain. This is the first book by the author that I have read and I am not anxious to pick up another one. I found the plot lines and character developments to be insultingly stupid. Almost too embarassed to donate this book. I pray for the trees sacrificed to make this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I got about 40% through it, but couldn't make myself finish this one, since I just couldn't care about the protagonist. Grace Archer is a control freak. That causes her to make foolish decisions. She has trouble accepting help when she's in over her head. If she were family, you'd stick by her. If she's only a character in a book, you might just close the book and say, \\"Enough!\\"I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where have you hidden Iris Johansen?","review":"I've loved Iris Johansen for ages, but this book was really bad. It almost seemed as if she had it ghost written by a high school student. The dialog was stilted and silly, the characters irritated me and were totally unreal, and I don't know where Johansen learned about horses, but there is something strange about her description of an eight-year-old jumping a stallion. The earlier reviewer hit it right: The book almost seems like Johansen got tired of thinking so took a variety of cliche-type plot lines and hooked them together. I thought if I heard one more time about how \\"special\\" Frankie was, I would be sick - especially since the only thing special about her seemed to be how very badly she was written.Come back, Iris Johansen. I miss you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never stops but has holes in it","review":"I'm not going to ruin this for anyone - so don't worry about a spoiler. This story took off with a bang and didn't quit until the last page. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but was left wondering about several plotlines that were introduced but never tied off. Since this was a complete change from the Eve Duncan stories, there's no way of knowing if there will be explanations in a later story. Still, a real page-turner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That's it I'm done with her","review":"I used to love Iris Johansen's books esp. her Eve Duncan books. The last few though have been terrible. On the Run was the final straw, she's lost me as a reader. I read about 100pgs and gave up. The plot was so dumb I can't believe she got someone to publish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick.","review":"Are you KIDDING?That was my thought after completing this novel. Horribly cliched with second-grader knowledge of horses, a plot too silly to comprehend, a child that simply gets dragged to one ranch after another and apparently (other than music and horses) receives no education, and a couple of horses who know how to get to (for the love of Pete!) an engine in the desert. Throw in sex, guns, an untouchable evil person and a woman who is the only person in the WORLD who can tame the wild Pair. I guess you call it a book. YIKES.Masochistic streak.

Sure, Boston has plenty of excellent bands, but once you start heading south, things start to get watered down. That was until I found this album by Shipyard Wreck.I was expecting a thunderous heavy metal explosion based on the name & cover, but what I ended up finding was some of the best blues rock I've heard in years. James Gagne's deep and soulful vocals are rich with power and emotion, and his rhythm section is top-notch. The addition of saxophone, brass, and Hammond B3 organ only enhance their appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product with no setup required.","review":"With the CardBus/PCMCIA adapter I can now use my high-power ORiNOCO and Senoa Notebook network adapters in my desktops.

The triangular design is so unique, bold, and simply cool. While the case is a massive block of steel, it looks well-balanced on many wrist sizes. The maori markings of the face are intriguing, and repeated on the rubber band. The band is easily sized to various wrist sizes, but requires a little attention to keep clean. I've found that a cotton swab wetted with Armor All gives the band a great shine. This is a very fun watch to own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you understand the oriental culture and people more.","review":"I read this book a long time ago and it still is vivid in my mind.

Pearl Buck writes very well,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Irony at its finest","review":"Long after I read the last page, I reflected on the irony of a poor man's ascent to greatness--and yet his descent to arrogance and insensitivity, the two evils that plagued him as a poor man. It was difficult to read between the lines and see the treatment of the very woman who made him great, and the worship of the one who brought him low. Beautifully written, wonderfully detailed, this is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"My absolute favorite book","review":"This is my absolute favorite book in the world (well besides my own--LOL!) This was the first book I read that totally infuriated me. When Wang Lung took Lotus as his concubine I about had a fit! I was totally outraged and was only 13 years old! I didn't even know what a concubine was but I knew O-lan should have received more respect! This is when I discovered the power of words and how a brilliant author can influence the readers feelings about their characters and the character's actions. I digress though, this book is much more than just Wang Lung losing himself once he became successful. It's a powerful novel that will keep generation after generation's attention. I re-read this classic every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marvelous Book!","review":"It was a wonderful read! Pearl Buck's story tells us about the struggles of a man's life in China during a turbulent time in history but it speaks of us all no matter what time period or part of the world we live in. It's about the cycle of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written novel","review":"I read this book on a plane flight to England. I didn't even notice the time pass by =) The book is written in simple language and is easy to understand. The plot follows one man, Wang Lung, from his marriage to his \\"retirement\\" of sorts. It shows many aspects of Chinese life during that time period as well as some universal lessons. A good book to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still on my mind after 9 years!","review":"I first read this book in 1989 for an English class in the 9th grade. I was surprised at how this book captured my attention! The culture, being so different from mine, is so captivating. The author also captures the heart of the reader by allowing us to to really see into the hearts and minds of the characters. Kudos to Buck! I've read this book 3 times already. As I get older, I begin to notice new things and really understand all the pleasure and pain. I love it when a book moves me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every person should read this book at least once in life.","review":"I read this book as a teenager growing up in the Philippines and as an adult in America. The book strirred the same passions. This is an excellent story of life. It may be set in China but the morale of the story is universal. The struggle for survival and for human dignity, a mother's love and a wife's loyalty, the corruption of wealth and materialism, the decline of the family, the inequity of human society and the citezenry as victims of a political culture. This story happens everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very beautiful book!!","review":"it's no wonder that pearl buck is the first woman to be awarded the nobel prize for literature...i can read this book over and over again!! a timeless classic!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top 10 favorites","review":"The timeless themes explored in The Good Earth transcend cultural and geographic boundaries. The simple story of a Chinese peasant rising to the rank of prominent landowner is gripping, and at times, emotional. I think all people can relate to the series of failures and successes of Wang Lung and O-Lan, and the inter-generational and inter-class struggles.Pearl S. Buck's flawless storytelling and plain style will appeal to readers of all ages and backgrounds.I would highly recommend this book. Buy this one for your library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty good, but not worth reading if it isn't assigned","review":"I read this book for extra credit in my english class last year. I started it with high hopes, but as the chapters plodded along I got more and more annoyed with the unessesary descriptions and way-too-mellow scenes. Nothing really happened in this book. The most interesting part is when they move. ooh, fun. i would not reccomend this book at all. If it's on your summer reading, choose another book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"book in poor condition","review":"This book was in very poor condition, not \\"good\\" as described. It quite clearly had been in a library. I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lengthy, dragging book with some interesting realizations.","review":"I was forced to read this book for school and I found it to be quite a bore. The book seemed to go on forever and never end. I was simply happy when I passed the picture section of my book. Over all I did not enjoy reading this book and wonder how it can be a classic and yet so unenjoyable for many students. It was more a painstaking process to read than anything else. I can not recommend this book to read unless you wish to be very bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mentally Challenged Character","review":"Really liked this book, but hated how Wang Lung and his family treated his oldest daughter. She is never given a name. She's only referred to as \\"The Fool\\". The family leaves her to play alone, outside, with her piece of cloth. Rarely do they check up on her. And, if nobody thinks about it she is sometimes left outdoors. She's treated this way just because she is mentally challenged. It's bad enough that Wang and the other does this. But, it's really hurtful, that O-lan, the mother, does this. You would think that maternal instinct would cause her to feel differently. However, it doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"the good earth","review":"great for the money paid book was in good conition for how old it is the good earth is an excellent book, i thought it was quite sad"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I chose thise book for a book club. It is the one month of the year that is also for the men in our lives. I think this is a wonderful book for men and women. I am anxious to hear the reactions. Personally I loved this book. It is a book that could be written today and just the names would be changed. It could take place anywhere. If you have never read it or have forgotten it from school, give it a chance. It does not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way ahead of its time, fine audio book","review":"This book touches profoundly on the human capacity to withstand pain and suffering and endure. Wang Lung, in his simple connection to the land, is one of the great heroes of 20th century literature. I was amazed, listing to this book on audio, that Pearl Buck captured so much depth and emotion of the Asian character writing in the early part of the century.Sadly, this book is increasingly relevant today - as millions of people around the globe struggle to find enough food and potable water to survive, some turning to prostitution and criminal activity to endure. The Good Earth reminds us how thin is the line between civilization and chaos.Anthony Heald does a fine job narrating the audio book. His tone is earnest, filled with raw emotion, successful at conveying both external dialogue as well as Wang Lung's rich internal life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most fantastic and intense description of shifting China","review":"To everyone that has never read this book, i can only tell you something: you are loosing the opportunity of facing some of the most fantastic characters ever created in American Literature. And the warmth of china views, the sun that burns your face while you watch Wang Lung in the fields. It is probable that this bookcan becomes boring but only for those who read it obliged. If not believe me it will change your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very boring book","review":"The Good Earth was a very boring book. It has some meaning to it, but basically the whole book dragged along. There was a plot, but it was not a very good one. The whole book revolved around the land and farming. I personally do not like books about land and farming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, the language was good...but where's the feel?","review":"Like many others, I was forced to read this book for school. Since then, I've read it a few more times. My conclusion? Even through Buck may have resided and grown up in China, she never really developed a sense of what it was like. She knew her facts, but not once in this book did I ever feel that she caught the essence, the ebb and flow, of the Chinese culture (yes, I am of Chinese descent, 1st generation immigrant).Mark Salzman did a much better job of capturing the \\"Chinese feel\\" in *The Laughing Sutra.* So did Sheryl Wudunn and Nicholas Kristoff in *China Wakes.* Both books are ones I highly recommend.As for *The Good Earth,* write your papers and put it away. I don't even consider it decent American literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciatingly bad","review":"Oprah, forgive me, but this is one of the most boring, relentlessly depressing, pointless books ever written. I was forced to read it in High School and in College, and I believe I have grounds to sue both of those institutions for mental cruelty. Pearl Buck's condescending tone and wearying prose made me want to gnaw off my arm to separate me from this book. Her ability to insult the reader and the Chinese culture about which she writes is matched by her ability to make the exotic pedestrian. I would rather read the mattress tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"I had never read The Good Earth before Oprah picked it as her current selection. Unfortunately, I had to read it in small doses as it just didn't capture my interest. It reads as though someone is narrating a story in a \\"once upon a time\\" fashion. The story is depressing. None of the characters have any depth except the main one, Wang Lung. The author's over-use of the phrases \\"here and there\\", \\"this and that\\", and \\"hither and thither\\" was annoying. I still like Oprah but not this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply horrible","review":"I read this book long before Oprah put it in her book club. It is BORING! It is a good book if you need help falling asleep. The story drug on and on and on! I skimmed over most of it just to finally get to the disappointing end. This book is not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"creaky","review":"I wish my grandmother were still alive. It's for her generation - it's not for today. The Good Earth reads like like a parable - many, many paragraphs beginning with conjunctions. The author gives the reader no insight - it's all story. Recommended for lazy readers who don't want to challenge themselves. Little to think about...Terribly dated...politically incorrect...that the pages turn is the best I can say about The Good Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME!!!","review":"Everybody say it with me now - BORING!!!! the Chinese were so evil. this was one of the worst books i've read in my life.

I ordered in mid May and they said they were sending another book. I still have not received that book though I verified my mailing address. This has been charged to my account and I am afraid they will charge the next book to my account also. I am not happy with this dealer at all.

I remember reading this atrocity back in high school and I have to say its acrid aftertaste has stayed with me for more than a decade. This is a horrible and boring book. First she recommends Leo Tolstoy (I'm sure his ghost is none too thrilled) and now this. Steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"The sheer idiocy of this work struck me dumb; in fact I could not even discern the purpose among the idiotic lines of this writer. It seems to be another humanistic attempt to bring to knowledge the \\"noble\\" suffering of the farmer attached to his land more than to antyhing else. It might evoke empathy in a fellow slave mind-set, but beyond this limitation there is no further audience to be attracted to it. The stupid attachment to land is paradoxial- it might be an allusion to culture, which does make sense- people love to wallow in their own dung.Healthy adulation of secular symbols is reduced to a vice, while superstition and ignorance are portrayed saccharinely and as noble.One might call this a poor written diary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful book.","review":"I absolutely love well written books, and this book was very well written. The character development was great and the story kept my interest. It touched many of my emotions. Another book I recommend is A Year Since Yesterday by a writer I was not previously familiar with, George Edward Zintel. It is also one of the very best books I have ever read. If you buy A Year Since Yesterday, it is listed as paperback but is actally a high quality soft-cover. Great book for the money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Earth-Good Book","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite books of all time. This taught me a lot about 19th century china and the transitions that were taking place during that time. And, it's also a great story. The end was sad though. It shows how generation after generation culture and heritage become more and more diluted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good Earth,Sons and A House Divided","review":"My mother recommended this book that she had read forty years ago. What an insight into the old chinese way of living. My mum is blind and I have a Kindle and we are enjoying listening to these old Pearl Buck's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Content!","review":"This book was really interesting and intriguing. After reading it I feel like i really know Wang Lung and O-Lan and all the other characters. Now I feel like I know a lot more about the history and especially the customs of the average Chinese person. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the Chinese culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"As a student of Asian Studies, I must point to this book as the spark that lit my love of China. I read this book when I was in the 8th grade, and I must say that it to this day is still one of the best I have ever read. Pearl Buck, even as a westerner, never looks down upon her characters. She writes with such love and admiration for China that is uncommon for most of her western contemporaries. This is a good introduction to the rest of Buck's numerous works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Storyteller ... A Great Story","review":"I was swept away into the past and felt like I was living each characters' life. I truly emphasized with each of the women's lives. Born to be slaves they were under pressure to do whatever any man bid of them, but they triumphed in their own way, using whatever they could to survive their situation or raise above their station in some way. Whether it was using hard work, feminine wiles, cunning, manipulation, or overt scheming, they made their way in the world at the time. The struggles with the elements and their dependence on the land made for very interesting reading. I especially fell in love with, and pitied O-Lan. Ugly, looked-down upon O-Lan. It seemed she triumped more than all because she was satisfied with so little. I loved this story. Pearl S. Buck is a true storyteller. Looking forward to reading more of her classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written Story full of history and culture.","review":"This book was extrememly well written and such an easy read. I read this book for my book club of 12 women, and we all loved it and enjoyed learning about Chinese history and culture. The characters were fully developed even when understated. There was a grace and fluidity to this book that is so rare. I read incessantly, and I would definitely put this in my top ten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read, learn, and be moved","review":"Really a brilliant little book. Admittedly, I was doubtful at first that this \\"old\\" book would be keep my interest.

Buck, but I found many of her works in a local library sale. Then, as a start (after reading only a group of short stories), I got The Good Earth for my Kindle Fire. I suspect that the descriptions of the lives of Chinese poor is quite accurate, if difficult and sexist. As the chapters passed, however, I grew to value Pearl Buck's descriptions. Perhaps it is important to say that I was drawn to her writing because my mother's name was nearly the same and my mother had read all of the author's work. I'll continue reading this prize-winning author's work over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The China of Yesterday","review":"A superb work of fiction, written in 1931 by Pearl Buck. Her style of writing won her the Nobel Prize in 1938. In this recent paperback version (enriched classic edition) the background information and other details are included.I read this story of a Chinese farmer and his family, their customs, addictions, disasters, etc. again, because it is just so captivating. The author lived in China, crafted a narrative that conveys her love for the country and its struggles, and the reader becomes transfixed with wonder as we compare the China of today with the China of eighty years ago.If you have never read this amazing story, I recommend it as a history lesson - a way to understand this part of the world then and compare it to now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book with a bitter ending","review":"The book drags on and on and really about nothing! Wang-Lung starts off poor and O-lan the faithful wife stays by his side till her end. It goes on to show how working hard gained him more land and power. She could have excluded a few detail (or chapters). And the fact that he's bound to loose everything anyways when he dies is upsetting and you wonder why you even picked up the book. The section in the book where a 70 year old sleeping with a young girl is disgusting! Never in my life do I want to read something like that again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not enjoy The Good Earth","review":"I have just finished reading The Good Earth . It is about a man named Wang Lung and his struggle to be happy and to have a prosperous life. He needs to earn for his family and keep them alive through famine, drought, and hard times. Once he has money he thinks he will be happy. Many things then happen to him and he then learns that money doesn't buy happiness. Personally I didn't like the book. It was a good novel and well written I just did not enjoy the topic. You may enjoy it. It depends on the kind of writing you like. China is not something I enjoy reading about. My favorite part of the book was the way it ended. I won't tell you how but I will say that it left something to be imaged. For some The Good Earth would be important to read. It teaches many lessons about life and happiness. One who needs to learn this will need to read the book. It has taught me some lessons I will never forget. I hope you enjoy reading The Good Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excellent work ruined by 'enrichments'","review":"I have read this book many times and consider it one of the greatest books ever written. I wanted a new copy, since mine was worn-out, so I got this one, and was disappointed. The typeface was blurry and smudgy, and the paper quality poor. Worst though was finding errors by the person who provided the \\"enriching\\" narrative - she incorrectly refers to a primary character, Lotus, as 'Lotus Flower'. Nowhere is Lotus ever called this in this book! In another section, she incorrectly refers to her again, this time as 'Lotus Blossom'. Poor editing all around on the so-called enrichments, which ruins this book. Leave well enough alone, I say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is waste of your time","review":"This book was about a self centered man, living with his children and wife. He only loved her when the hard times kicked in. Then when he had his other pleasures he treaated her like dirt.Trust me, you should never read this book if you get to choose a book to read (unlike myself). It truly is a waste of your time! Infact I'm not really sure why I'm wasting my precious time typing about this book that really does belong in the trash can, like one of the writers wrote at the top of this web page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to be depressed? Read this book!","review":"This book would only be 1 star if it weren't so well written. Other than that, it's incredibly depressing. Why can't Wang Lung be a happy farmer? Just when things start to go right in his life, something comes along and destroys it. Read it if you must, but if you have a choice, read About A Boy insted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"In high school I did not appreciate what a truly spectacular book this is. This has to be one of the greatest books that I have ever read (and I have read a lot!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's emotional and helped realize what went on in the past.","review":"This book was interesting when it comes to the issues, We have a women who works her butt off up intill the tiem she gives birth and then resumes her job right after. The simplest things though, were strung longer then needed. This book helped me realize what took place in the past and how much everything has changed, wether it is a good change or a bad change. I think it delt with certian issues which i feel needed to be brought up. It also shows how people change when it comes to money. I feel bad for Wang Lung , he worked so hard for his land and to maintain it and get more and more and now his sons will go and sell it right behind his back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Masterpiece","review":"This book has transcended generations in its appreciation and continues to enlighten its readers. I thought the story was captivating, but its commentary on pre-revolutionary China is riveting. It is a difficult task to find sympathy for any of the main male characters (except for perhaps Ching, if he is a main character). While I am not sure it was written to say as much at the time, as a reader now, I think you can read the book and ask whether it is fair to blame people for their actions when they are simply a part of their culture? To blame the culture or the individuals?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ONLY work by Buck worth Reading","review":"Pearl S. Buck writes a true to the heart tale of family and money, greediness, and poverty, well written, timeless, powerful. Everyone who wants a family should try this, it's a touching and sweet tale of what children can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book For All Ages","review":"I thought this book was going to be unentertaing and boring, but I couldn't seem to put it down. My favorite part of the book was when Wang Lung and his family had gone south to the city to find food and money. When they came back to their land, they had become richer, and Wang Lung bought more land instead of material goods. Along the way he got more and more greedy. He took Olan's two pearls, the only thing that she held dear to herself. He never gave Olan the respect she deserved. Even on her death bed. This book taught me that we should always be grateful for what we have and to follow our dreams no matter how hard we have to try. Things will always look better in the end. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a new perspective on life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Novel Truly Deserving the Pulitzer Prize","review":"Though the language used by Pearl Buck is somewhat dated, the story of Wang Lung is a wonderful tale of man's struggles to survive, thrive and prosper. The connection of man to earth is a still-viable theme in our age of wanton destruction of our planet. The artfully described backdrop of life in rural China is also facinating, giving one a deeper understanding of the culture and people who are now our neighbors and friends. This book is a must-read for anyone who desires a better understanding of not only the interconnectedness of life, but of the cultural basis for many Chinese traditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!","review":"This is the most beautifully written book I've ever read. Everything just ties in perfectly and I instantly fell in love with the characters.This book made me cry soo bad!! I couldn't stop, and it took me a while to pull myself together. The ending was very good, and I cried again. I really, really HIGHLY recommend this book!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly wonderful story of life and death.","review":"This book was recommended to me by my mother many years ago. I wasn't interested at the time because I was quite young then, but I did pick it up a little later. My mother was right. This is a truly wonderful book. The novel is so well written, and Ms. Buck follows the cycles of birth, marriage and death in the family of a Chinese peasant in the early twentieth century China. As it is in real life, there are good years and bad years. The family patriarch is Wang Lung, and he is an ambitious farmer who has a great love for the land. He has two sons that he hopes to pass this passion on to, but neither one is interested. Both plan to sell his hard-earned property when their father dies. Wang Lung's struggles and triumphs are portrayed throughout the book in the framework of the natural progression of life. It is a wonderful and heartwarming story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic","review":"This is a classic that was chosen for our book club. It's one that transports you to another time and culture. It really sticks with you. Days later I'm still reflecting on this. I wanted to rewrite the ending so they all lived happily and wisely ever after, yet that's not as realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great American Classic","review":"Great American classic.

Pearl Buck has written so that the reader can feel and understand the real China, it's history, and it's civilization."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful aspect of Chinese culture","review":"Even though I read The Good Earth as a freshman in high school, I found all the descriptions of not only the culture of Old China, but also of the pride of a man and the selflessness of his wife amazing and accurate. Pearl S. Buck uses beautiful language throughout the novel in her portrayals of one man's love for his land. Being an avid reader of historical fiction, I loved the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"this was a great book","review":"I enjoyed the good earth. although i got mad about some situation with o-lan i knew that this was part of their culture. i cried, i laughed. i got angry. this book touched every emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing Story of Family Life","review":"I just love depressing stories, not many authors out there want to take that gamble because they're afraid people won't like it and will hate the book overall (as what happened here). I on the otherhand knows a good book when I see one, this is a wonderful tale of life in China.I highly recommend this to people who chose to read it themselves, not assigned for classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Itself","review":"The Good Earth is not a travelog that will transport you to the beauty & wonders of other lands. It is a travelog of life itself, its bittersweet joys, & hardships. It is a classic for this & many other reasons. Those who didn't like the it & stopped reading after 25 pgs. were right to do so. They wouldn't have liked the rest. Those who say they didn't learn anything from the book were also right. You can't learn anything from this book because it talks about life lessons. And the only way for each of us to learn those is by making our own mistakes and being taught by the hardest teacher of all, life itself.When someone is able to appreciate the beauty of life as a journey, with it's good & bad along the way, I recommend this book to them, especially the Enriched Classic edition by Pocket Books. It has great introduction & notes that enhance the reading of the book. It may also be available at your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good Earth, A review of China&#65533;s History","review":"This book at first is not the most exciting book but latter on the reader becomes more into it. It is about a Chinese man, Wang Lung, and his family. They face many challenges in there lives such as death and famine. The way that Pearl S. Buck describes the lives of the characters is astounding because person has a certain personality. The book tells the reader how life was for the peasants in China at that time. The cities are described in such a way that the reader feels that they are in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern classic that superbly depicts Chinese Culture","review":"The Good Earth is an excellent piece of literature that is both well written, and culturally informative. This novel educates the reader as to the customs and procedures of Chinese life during the time period in which the book was written. Chinese culture, religion, and philosophy are all expressed in in some form or another in this novel. I particularly enjoyed the vivid, yet concise way which Parl Buck wrote this novel, for I found that I could read through it relatively quickly. Perhaps one of the best qualities of this novel is its irony, expressed at the conclusion in which the main character, Wang Lung realizes a cylce in his life that has taken full turn, and concluded with his death and the possible emergence of a new Lord in the ranks of a poor farmer who groveled before him, much like he had done in the presence of the former Lord."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Book","review":"The most deserving of the Pulitzer book I've read thus far - Pearl S. Buck captures so much of the life of pre-revolutionary China. Wang Lung's love of his land, and the inevitable mistakes and joys he experiences in life are universal themes; the relationship between the characters; all of these combine to make a book that will touch you, sadden you, and enlighten you all at once. Keep the Kleenex handy for this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good earth","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I first read it in high school 40 years ago and reread about evry 5 years but this is the first time on my new Kindle Fire and it was a great reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book long before Oprah found it","review":"This book is a classic! I've reread it many times, and it was the book that started me on a journey to read all of Pearl Buck's novels. This is by far her best book. The characters are vividly portrayed, and memorable. Her knowledge of China and their customs make the book even more enjoyable. The book entertains, and also teaches us about this Chinese families' trials, customs, frailities, joys and sorrows. A fasinating book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Loamy Novel","review":"Panoramic, sweeping, magnificent, Buck's novel has grandeur. Set in rural inland China, she traces the life and death of one man, a farmer, a man rooted in the soil. Through the vicissitudes of seasons, he loses and gains, he suffers and rejoices, he releases and he takes, but there is always the land: rich, permanent, \\"running through his fingers,\\" life-giving.In the reading, I sensed that Buck was taking me far away into another time and area, a place where individuals are traded as slaves, customs are cemented in rigidity and then cracked when it is expedient, where life is a struggle to those who have no land.She writes with simplicity and solidity. It is a loamy novel. Reading it is feeling the depth of what a novel should be--memorable, filled with different strata, enriching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"When I originally read this book some 50 years ago, I adored it and thought it was the best book I'd ever read.

It was definitely not an enjoyable experience. It seemed to me that the plot moved in a generally circular fashion, with the same things happening over and over again.

The beginning was ok, showing the culture of China and how things were...but after a while, the events in the story became unnecessary, particluarly when Wang Lung started meeting up with Lotus and having an affair with her.

First off, the book is about a man who marries a slavewoman from a rich house and together they work through many troubles to become wealthy land owners. Wang Lung being the main charecter, takes on challenges such as famine and flooding and other hard challenges.

I recommend it to anyone who loves a good story. This is a story of love, family, loss, hardship and of rags to riches. Characters like Wang-Lung, Cuckoo and O'Lan are ones to be forever remembered. Don't dive into this book expecting to be enlightened by happy endings-this book, like life, provides not the typical Hollywood of cliche of \\"Everything is fine and dandy here in the end.\\"What is so good about this story is that it is like life--there is the good and there is the bad.

How would we know? After reading this I read James White's book \\"The King James Only Controversy\\" . I was only half way though when I realized that the KJVO position is without foundation.

On the other hand, I find this book irritating, sexist, and, in addition, completely off the mark in terminology. I understand that kids this age don't need an anatomy lesson, but all the experts tell us just to call body parts what they are and leave it at that or kids get the idea that those body parts are shameful. Naming a body part \\"wee wee\\" so that it can make \\"pee pee\\" goes past ridiculous into embarrasing. And why call it a \\"hole\\" for making \\"poo poo?\\" Call it what it is! Additionally, the book is completely sexist in that it implies that only mothers change diapers Dads reading this book to their daughters feel left out, to say the least. We have to constantly \\"rewrite\\" the book as we are reading it to \\"repair\\" the problems.

And I was not dissapointed at all. PILLAR'S FALL is a taut, chilling novel that keeps the reader glued to the page. Larken's narrative voice is strong where his descriptive power is vivid and his plot maintins the fluidic pacing of the story. But it is his characters and dialogue that drive this wonderful story. We're inside their heads where we feel empathy for Tom Pillar, and dread for the evil forces that he faces. His storytelling abilities make me want to read more of his works and since PILLAR'S FALL is part of a series, I can't wait to buy the next LEGEND OF PILLAR novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating book on an astonishing variety of topics.","review":"Charming, with chapters such as \\"The Significance of 'Nothing'\\" and \\"The Mystery of Free Will\\" and \\"Wilhelm Reich and the Orgone.\\" On philosophical topics, the book is accessible and fascinating. On science on math, it is mind-bending. On historical personalities, Gardner either takes no prisoners and is hilarious, or is admiring and gracious.

The only problem with reviewing a Gardner volume is deciding which of his collections of essays is the best place to start reading.This volume may represent the best intro to Gardner. While the subtitle is, \\"Collected Essays, 1938-1995,\\" none of the essay shows any signs of age. Each essay is supplemented by a postscript which updates more recent developments, or more commonly, Gardner's recent thinking on the subject. Consider the section headings: Physical Science, Social Science, Pseudoscience, Mathematics, The Arts, Philosophy, Religion. Is Gardner the last Renaissance man or what?In short, a great introduction to an amazing thinker. By the way, if you already have one or several of Gardner's other collections, get this one as well.

If that's true, then America must be pretty hopeless.His collection of essays certainly proves the scope of his knowledge--as well as the superficiality. Mr. Gardner knows a little about everything, but the little that he knows doesn't stop him from making seemingly authoritative comments. To be blunt, much of this is rather cheap journalism, with the pretension of erudition . Mr. Gardner, alas, gets too many things wrong.

It is simply off the wall opinion. It is time that someone wrote a book called useless ideologues, as Eric Alterman has done to a degree with his What Liberal Media.

The author also refutes the left's claim that they helped win the \\"cold war.\\" She shows in detail that they opposed most tactics & strategies used by the free west to win. The only flaws in the book are that it should have come out earlier, & could have been twice as long."},{"rating":"1","title":"not many surprises here","review":"It would be much more interesting for Charen to explain why conservatives supported General Pinochet, Saddam Hussein (Reagan and the first Bush gave him billions in aid during the 1980s), and the apartheid regime in South Africa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmitigated Garbage","review":"This is one book which should not have seen the light of day.

He represents the narrow-minded bigoted views of all conservatives.Does it seem unfair that I should have lumped all conservatives in with the idiot who wrote that review? Then why does it seem reasonable that Mona Charen can dump all liberals into one America-hating bag? She can't. This type of drivel is what is tearing this country apart. As long as conservatives believe that liberals are all unpatriotic and hate America, then we will believe that they are all shallow racists and bigots. You're not, and we're not. OK?!!!!Don't buy this book and indulge her biases."},{"rating":"1","title":"patriots and Americans beware","review":"The book highlights the hypocrisy of today's right wing pundit: the author romanticizes war without having fought, pushes tax cuts that assist no one but their elite friends, advocates cuts in education knowing their family will never need public education and launches unamerican personal attacks on political opponents in the name of \\"patriotism.\\"Also, please note that it is published by an extremist right wing publishing house and promoted by Fox News and other conservative media outlets."},{"rating":"1","title":"hahaha","review":"No idea why this showed up for me to review...

Not a fan of conservatism, to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"An accurate account of what many have always known.","review":"Ms Charen has brought together a near perfect account of the issues that trouble many of us. Why is there so much willful ignorance about the realities of communism? Why do the elites believe in the dream of utopia? And why do church people forgive Castro his crimes? Ms Charen has written a book which needs to be in the hands of every hs student in polisci and it should be discussed with those in favor of government run economies and government imposed social issues. Give this book to a doubted and talk with him about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I learned a lot about the world reading this book. I am not a conservative or libeal, kind of in between. This book was very educational for me as I realized that I had only understood things like Kahmer-rouge, communists and our reationship with the world only through the eys of popular media. I have now come to see things in a new light.The title was disturbing until I learned what it means, but it may keep away some people as they may not want to be labeled \\"useful idiots.\\" But overlook the title and read anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!

Her commentary is ilustrated, profound, and at this time, extremely neccessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Liberally Independent Review","review":"Having lived through and witnessed much of the liberal arrogance cited, I applaud Charen as grossly direct and honestly to the point with her facts. I find this book refreshing in it's fact based information. Liberals are really taking a hit here, so here's a warning: if you are leaning extremely left, you won't want to read this book. It reflects a sinister side of the liberal left, which is frighteningly real.While some in every society will always have a tendancy to turn their cheeks and heads blindly to man's inhumanity to man, seeking blame elsewhere, Charen keeps the issues focused.Charen masterfully creates a sensitive and patriotic novel well needed in a time of our unsung heroes. Liberals have stepped on our culture for too long, and now Charen has taken them to task. Before you rest to judgement, you must read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The True Enemy of our Nation.","review":"This book both fascinates and frightens. Frightening, because it delves into the true mission of the liberals of the last 85 years. And that is to turn the USA into a socialist state. Fascinating because it is refreshing and odd, to see the truth in print. Almost surreal. As every thinking person knows, the liberal press would never touch this subject, or topic, with a ten foot pole. The liberals will find this book hard to stomach, because it shows them for what they truely are. And sometimes the truth hurts. I highly recommend this book. Truely a book that was needed. Factual, truthful, insightful. And as I said frightening. Frightening because half of our nation thinks like a liberal. Bravo Mona Charen. Thank you for this book. I look forward to your next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Indictment","review":"This is another tour de force book spotlighting events that have had a big impact on recent history but have been largely under-reported and are not well-known.

Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Great Review of the Treachery Among The Modern Left","review":"This book is a very good book for those who are interested in determining where the rosy view of the communists originated. The rosy view of communists and statists that we find today in modern American cultures stresses the fact that those working within the movement have on the best intentions for citizens. Such a view is ridiculous, not to say disrespectful of the human condition. The statists and communists view the citizenry as little more than a resource to be plundered. They were not nice and well-intentioned. They were mean and hoped to glorify the state. Charen does a great job of illustrating the many individuals who worked to help promote this view and make sure the public has been kept in the dark. All in all, I would recommend this book to all who care about why the public views the statists in such a positive way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, but Slander is better","review":"If you're looking for facts on how the bloody liberals have all but ruined the American way of life - you've come to the right place. If you're looking for humor, check out Slander by the incomparable Ann Coulter. I must say that Useful Idiots proves to be a compelling read, however a bit trite at times. I am desperately looking forward to Treason by Coulter - Useful Idiots is a useful fill-in in the meantime I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book for smart people, useless for trying to win over idiots","review":"This is a book that puts together all the silliness of the Left. Especially enraging is how they 'blame America first' for all the troubles in the world. Most of the 'Useful Idiots' (a term Vladimir Lenin gave a hundred year ago for the same type of people!) portrayed in this book, Rich, Famous and self-absorbed!You will never be able to show such people they are idiots, useful or otherwise. Talking to them would just give you a headache. But, talking to those who believe these people to be the 'Elite', will be more rewarding ( how smart can these people be if they are looking up to idiots?).Still a good book, and enjoyable read, one that will make you mad, from time to time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rightwing trash","review":"Nice to see Mona having worked for CNN now owned by the Saudi Prince.

Because it's godless? This is sooooooooooooooooooooo crazy! Now you face the evils of fundamentalist Islam, so it can't be that bad, it has a god....

Christians will rejoice at this ..., well, unless they're real Christians. There is no doubt that the USA has always had a mortal enemy and has had many many wars.

Why do you suppose these reviews use the same language","review":"I have always felt that one should doubt the credibility of any book where 2 of the 3 reviews use the exact same phrase. It suggests some level of, how can I put this, Desperation? Cheating? Putting paint over rust? But I am probably some brain-washed person who gets all their information from a talk radio guy who makes up his facts. If the book's point is that liberals have been wrong on some issues, then it simply states the obvious. A more valuable book would make that point and also make the point, among other right wing fiascos, that the Reagan/Bush/Bush \\"borrow today and live well and let our kids pay off the debt\\" philosphy has fiscally and morally bankrupted America.This book is simply a one-sided view that will enrich the author at the expense of the Kool-Aid drinkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proving the Right Still Doesn't Get It","review":"I'll give Charen's book two stars because it is better than most of the garden-variety, ghost-written dribble that passes for the Conservative-Love It Or Leave It-Republican canon these days. Charen is light years ahead of ... Bill O'Reilly and the Fox ... crowd..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old News","review":"\\"Useful Idiots\\" is simply a re-hash of what most informed Americans already know. I was dismayed that Charen seemed surprised that after all the evidence is presented, so-called \\"liberals\\" still blame America first and refuse to denounce the evils of Communism. What Charen doesn't, or refuses to realize, is the end goals of liberals and Communists are the same. Ann Coulter knows it and has outed the liberals in her books \\"Treason\\" and \\"Slander\\". Coulter's books are far superior to Charen's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Information But NOT Very Deep........","review":"Mona Charen has written a book that is written well and it is obvious that she knows the subject matter.

I particularly like the theories on what causes AIDS, and find the practical care approaches really interesting. I find the new wave of research into the power of the human immune system fascinating, and this book really looks at many approaches that are actually yeilding positive results, but that wouldn't be advertised heavily because corporations can't make money by promoting them.Discusses an herb I was not familiar with--Sutherlandia. Has a chapter on therapeutic mushrooms in treating AIDS and Cancer. Chapters on the real effects of the current AIDS pharmaceuticals.

These compact stories all have deep issues about life and what it means to be human. I was surprised by the feeling that God may be wresting with what it means to be God and allow humans freedom. There almost seems to be a trial and error approach to creation. The people in Genesis are all exposed as being very human, with fractured families. The people on the video are also very human, and at time the discussions are very personal, like sitting in with an old friend. This book and videos offered an amazing number of views, and one shouldn't view them as dogma. I was particularly surprised by feminist and Koran views. I hope to read further by Burton Visotzky who was a participant.

There are many such Old Testament stalwarts who could have did this admirably, e.g. Walter Kaiser to mention but one.Thus, this book is very unbalanced as the liberal element is so prone to do: ignore the traditional, conservative opinion as well. You find it in all their works. While the conservative side most always reacts and interacts with the liberals, you rarely see it in the reverse.

It's interesting to read the reviews taking some of these artists to task for their renditions when many people only knew much of Warren's work by the covers done by Linda Rondstadt.In any event - as with all tribute albums, the results are uneven but the source material is so strong that it makes it worthwhile. Of course - it just makes me want to listen to the originals all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is so wrong with great tribute albums anyway...","review":"There should be no bias against tribute albums and cover songs; they should be judged on the merits and results; in other words ENJOY EVERY GREAT SONG. In this case - you have Zevon's bandmates, friends and relatives doing a professional job and an intense emotional task of saying goodbye the the man who died too young. Standout tracks are by Pete Zorn, The Boss, Wallflowers, Ry Cooder, Jorge Calderon, Jill Sobule, Dylan ...but the best of all is his son's cover of Studebacker.

I liked all the cuts to some degree but the Wallflowers' Lawyers,Guns and Money is my favorite. The most pleasant surprise is Adam Sandler's rendition of Werewolves - very witty and fun.

Hard to believe that only one of these songs (as far as I know) was written after he learned of his diagnosis. Son Jordan and longtime producer/cowriter/bassist Jorge Calderon assembled many of Zevon's closest collaborators, sidemen, cronies and admirers for a romp through both the sardonic, gallows-humor pieces he was famous for, but also the vulnerable, emotionally raw ballads he was equally adept at writing and delivering.Zevon liked singing actors for their ability to deliver the emotional content of a song, so he'd be pleased by Sandler's surprisingly muscular"},{"rating":"2","title":"One word...

I would really recommend the audio version as it is read by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little No Limit book out there","review":"The focus of this book is on tournaments and specifically no limit hold em tournaments. I thought it was great for covering some good pointers on how to play the game. I've also read both volumes of Harrington on Hold Em and it was good to see what someone with a looser style suggests. If you're looking for a good tutorial on tournaments I'd get Harrington on Hold Em but after you've read those read this one.I'm going to pre-order the little blue book right now because I can't wait to see what else Phil can show me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phil's book explains why he is good but not great","review":"Save your time and money for the books by Harrington Vol I & II and Sklansky Hold'Em for Advance Players. Those books explain the game of no limit much clearer than Phil who seems to have a it all figured out. Like he calls it, he is a good player but not great. Same with his little green book. He gives far too much information and offers to many caveats and poker jargon, most of which one either has to or needs to learn the hard way."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BASELINE FOR TOURNAMENT PLAY","review":"I am about halfway through reading this book. Although I know it is geared toward moreso inexperienced players, it goes into the necessary depth and is extremely easy to follow. It's a great baseline to start your tournament play from. Obviously everyone is going to play different, but this book, as of right now, seems like its great for players just getting into the bigger texas hold'em tournament play. I got this book pretty cheap (I think it was like $7.00). Extremely valuable information, especially when you are just starting to try and improve your game play. Definite read for someone who is trying to take Poker serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for learning poker","review":"This is a great book, well written, fun to read, and full of good knowledge. It is really interesting to see inside the mind of a pro player. I wish there was a bit more about style of play/betting when the hand does not go your way. For example, when/how should I come off a c-bet after the flop if i still hold little after the turn? With careful read, much of this is in the text, but it is easy to read to the end with the sense that Phil either folds pre-flop, or holds the best hand every time. Being aggressive is easy when you hold the nuts. How should I deal when I have a good, but not great hand and my opponent keeps calling me? etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you never read a poker book, this is a great first read.","review":"If you've never read a poker book, this is one of the first books you should read. It will tell the novice how to start thinking about the game. If you ar fairly new to the game, then you will find this book a wealth of information. An intermediate player will find alot in this book as well, although it may never be 'cool' to quote Phil Gordon. Unfortunately, I think Mr. Gordon explains Pot Odds poorly. SUMMARY: For the player who wants to improve but doesn't want to get too deep into poker theory, there is no beating Phil Gordon. The Audiobook version is great for long car rides or subway commutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Read and Informative","review":"Well-written, easy to read. This book covers the math, the tells (a little bit), and why players play the way they do. Also, I love the examples of tournament plays and things the players did to elicit calls. I love Phil's anecdotes which are part of the book's teaching. These are as informative as the lessons. The book covers a lot of material concisely, and in a friendly manner. The chapters are very easy to read and again the anecdotes ILLUSTRATE the principles the book expounds. Phil Gordon is modest and admits his book is not definitive (whose is?). I loved this book for its mathematics, tells, methods, and examples by player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Green Book","review":"This CD has been invaluable to me in playing Texas Hold Um!! I play every weekend at low leval tournaments & after getting this CD I won $1900.00 the same weekend in three $45.00 buy-ins.

Goldie has great samples, and his talent is with out question. but this these albums are just as boreing as the other wanna-be-futureistic Dj's on the metalheadz label of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing series!","review":"While the first in the series of \\"The Vicar of Dibley\\" was funny and interesting, the others fell off fast. The series went from slightly funny-risque to downright vulgar. There was no need for the directors to go in that direction as the series had a good cachet to begin with. We were VERY disappointed in the whole series. Crude, rude and vulgar. I wish I could get my money back! It came quickly--the vendor was good, but the series is a loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT FOR DAWN","review":"Dawn French in her own series based on a quiet little town where she is the Vicar (obviously) but the ensemble is great and the jokes are ever so subtle and the whole series is quite enjoyable. After having seen only a few episodes on PBS, I wanted to see more but knew nothing of it. Once it was released on dvd, and Christmas came along, I found it to be an excellant show. If you want to see Dawn at her funniest though, I'd go with the French & Saunders boxset, not this collection. French is a bit tame at times and looks bored with the direction of the series occasionally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run of the mill sitcom","review":"Bought this collection based on the glowing reviews posted here, particularly those emphasizing the series' sophistication. Well. I sometimes find gastro-intestinal and female anatomy jokes amusing, but definitely not sophisticated. This series has plenty of them, and, sad to say, most are not even that funny. The lead actress seems more suited for standup than series comedy, as she hogs and mugs her way through every scene she's in, dispensing one-liners that aren't particularly funny even by television sitcom standards. The supporting cast is a little better, but after you've heard the grizzled guy with the lower g-i trouble joke about it, or the grizzled crone talk about her sex life, and the grizzled no-no-no guy say no-no-no a thousand times, there's nothing left. Except 16 more episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Sorry That I Bought It !!","review":"WHEN I BOUGHT THIS DVD SET AND KNOWING THE PAST BBC PROGRAMS I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A NICE COMEDY, BUT OH NO. IF THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THE PEOPLE GETTING USED TO A WOMAN VICAR THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD BUT, I DON'T THINK PERSONS (\\"CHRISTIANS\\") WHO ARE ON A CHURCH COUNCIL SHOULD NOT BE SAYING AND DOING THE THINGS THAT THEY DO, I KNOW THAT THIS IS \\"COMEDY\\" BUT THEIR IS A LINE DRAWN AND IN EVERY EPISODE THEY CROSS OVER IT EVERY TIME. ONE OF THE MEMBERS WANTING TO HAVE SEX WITH THE VICAR. THE LANGUAGE USED IS NOT RIGHT FOR THE SETTING, AND ONE MEMBER DOING THE FULL MONTY IN THE CHURCH HALL WAS NOT NECESSARY AT ALL, ETC, ETC, ETC. IF YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN, DO NOT BUY THIS SET OR ANY OF THE VICAR OF DIBLEY.

I found it great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gem","review":"One day I was flipping through the channels and landed on this show. After that I was addicted. Dawn French consistently produces grade-A products.With The Vicar, she takes a comic approach to the serious subjects of religion and daily life, and the result is side-splitting entertainment. Even my parents love it!The British seem to have the ability to laugh about religion, while we Americans seem to be too serious.If you aren't too tightly wound to see the humor in life and religion, even if the jokes get a bit bawdy, this series is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brillo Pads","review":"Just a quick note to say this show is really funny as well as quite sweet. Emma Chambers is just brilliant (brillo pads) as Alice. Be sure to watch past the end credits on every show for a quick joke moment with Gerry and Alice. Everyone I know that has watched the show ends up saying no,no,no,no...yes.Best of BBC comedy"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love British comedy, you'll love this CD collection!","review":"I have always enjoyed watching reruns of the Vicar of Dibley on PBS so I was excited when I saw there was a CD set that would let me watch the show whenever I want.

The one problem I've personally encountered when buying older electric blues CD's, is sometimes the recordings, are so bad, they sound like it was recorded with a nail, by Thomas Edison. I.e.: \\"Buddy Guy & Otis Rush\\" \\"Blue on Blues\\", and \\"Buddy Guy & Junior Wells\\", Chicago Blues Festival 1964!\\" (Do not waste your money or your hopes on those two!) THAT IS NOT THE CASE with \\"LIVE AT THE WISE FOOLS PUB CHICAGO\\"! This is a crisp, clear, recording. In fact, it is louder than some of my brand new CD's. This is a winner from start to finish. Otis is in top form, guitar and voice wise. As of this writing, I have listened to it at least fifty times, and it is as fresh and rewarding, as the first time.

Just want to put 1 star to bring the average grade down. Also, adding to the discussion about good DVD recordings of this opera - check 1992 Glyndebourne production (Andrew Davis conducting). If you can agree, that Herman/Yuri Marusin is very impressive even despite he cannot sing (or maybe exactly because of that) - you'll love it! If you don't like this kind of singing - you may still like this performance, because all others (especially Tomsky/Sergey Leiferkus) are magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful little-known marketing tips and techniques.","review":"This is a great book for those of us looking to market our arts and crafts.

Comic books, magazines and paperbacks all jumped on the flying saucer bandwagon, both reflecting and reinforcing the public's interest. Even 50's movies like \\"Invasion of the Saucer Men\\" are covered in this book. There were a wealth of saucer-related toys, and they're discussed here, with copious photographs.

Until I realized that it only contains cognates. I have no idea why so much effort was spent organizing words that are almost the same in both languages. False cognates are useful, but I am not interested in seeing 180 pages of cognates. The middle section shows Spanish roots for words, and while somewhat interesting, it didn't seem that useful to me.

But unfortunately there were three which I could not finish. They bored me to death!! For the most part though, the majority were excellent mysteries written by many authors I had never even heard of but will now seek out in bookstores. Some of the gems are \\"Motel 66,\\" by Barbara D'Amato, \\"The Defenstration of Aba Sid,\\" by Robert Girardi, \\"ICU,\\" by Edward Lee, and \\"Wrong Numbers,\\" by Josh Pryor. This should be a definite read for all mystery fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promising new authors","review":"In this anthology, Donald E. Westlake includes a lot of new authors who have not yet published their first novel. I had trouble following some of the stories after reaching their conclusion (GHOSTS by David Beaty), but others show real promise for the future.One of my favorite stories is MOTEL 66 by Barbara D'Amato. It is a fairly short story that packs a lot of suspense and intrigue. The story takes place at different points in time (1971, 1985, and 1999) in which two events that happened in 1971 come full circle in 1999. There is no real ending to this story except for the one in the reader's mind. This is what a good short story should be like. It should leave the reader wondering what will happen after all the stories secrets are revealed. Another one of my favorites is WRONG NUMBERS by Josh Pryor.There are some other good stories in the anthology written by Dennis Lehane, Shel Silverstein and Jeffery Deaver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder!

I pretty much only use it for jam and pickles and wonder if Kathryn Kidd's review reporting a family that died of botulism was one where they tried canning low acid vegetables that should have been done in a pressure canner. Steam is actually hotter than boiling water so if it's used as directed, the steamer canner should get the jars hot enough to kill any bacteria inside as well or better than a water bath without all of the heavy lifting and time (the steamer comes up to temperature a LOT faster than a large pot of water does.) I love mine and will continue to use it, having given my water bath canner away years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY convenient, but dangerous","review":"I used to be the canning queen of North America, and steam canners were the way to go. They are light years ahead of boiling water baths as far as speed and convenience are concerned. Not only that, but the lids ALWAYS sealed.To my surprise, when I needed to write a book about food storage (Food Storage for the Clueless) years later, I couldn't find steam canners on the market. I did a lot of research, trying to figure out where these wonderful inventions had gone.Turns out steam canners were taken off the market after tests showed they didn't get the food hot enough to safely process the food. I know a guy whose whole family was killed by botulism from home-canned products. Do you want to risk this for your family?I don't know why this is being sold, but home canning professionals do not recommend its use. If it were safe it would be the only way to do most of your home canning. But it's not, which means you're back to the Stone Age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Food processing steamers are not approved by USDA","review":"I owned a steamer at one time after a reputable kitchen supply store convinced me that this was the greatest way to process food. I tried a batch of peaches and several of my bottles did not seal. I followed directions perfectly. In the meantime, I attended a food processing class put on by the extension service in the county and state in which I reside. We were informed that not only does the local extension service not approve the steam canners for safe use, but the USDA as well DOES NOT approve this apparatus for home canning. If you are considering purchasing this equipment, do some careful research before you spend good money choosing this system. Sometimes, easier and quicker is not always the best and safest in the end!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned out my stove drip pan","review":"The only reason I gave this one star is that there's no place for zero stars. I used this canner one evening and it worked great........THEN, I realized it had set so close to my burner that it blocked ventilation. Apparently, there was a huge buildup of heat because it totally RUINED my burner drip pan. I'm hoping the heat buildup didn't effect any of the electrical parts. I do NOT recommend this monstrosity.

Madame Helga was a great first single and Maybe Tomorrow had a brilliant cool sound to it. Now to the album. Apart from the singles, most of the other songs are only half decent and not worth listening to. Jealousy and Getaway have a nice tune to them, but they never go anywhere musically.

I was so excited about this band and for this album I actually ordered The Import before even available in the US!Unfortunately, this album never really bears fruit. The songs are all over the map...they range from just noise, to bad 80's power rock (e.g. High as the Ceiling)...to feeble attempts at soul (e.g. Miss You Now).

Should this movie had been made live even for the WB network it would have been a success, the story is that good.The only disappointment is perhaps the design of the Batwoman's costume, resembles too much the Terry McGuiness' Batman Beyond costume. They should have looked up the original Batwoman from the 1940s and 50s Batman comics instead, and update that design.If you're a fan of the BATMAN ANIMATED SERIES is worth your every dollar and keeping it in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Batman option!","review":"With a stack of DVDs two feet high you would not think our home needed another one - but obviously we did!

This movie marked the end of Batman: the Animated Series. A mysterious new figure, Batwoman, is in Gotham targeting the criminal underworld. Batman tries to find out who the Batwoman is, coming close, but then finding that it can't be who he thinks it is. It also marks a welcome return of the villain Bane, always a personal favorite.This movie also serves as a sort of backdoor for Batman Beyond. Take a look at the Batwoman's costume and you kind of get the idea where the suit in Batman Beyond comes from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie (read: not great cartoon)","review":"Overall, this was a great 75 minutes.

The gave this film project to a new creative team and it shows, the animation was cheap, repetitive, the dialog was dull. Worst of all was the story, it was pathetic and dull.

The playboy/businessman Bruce Wayne is merely a facade that the Batman projects in everyday life. This is major defining aspect of the Batman/Wayne duality. In the movie, the writers got it all wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG LET DOWN","review":"This would rank as one on the worst Batman features ever released on DVD. The story was very weak.

I would have to say that living in NYC around most of the groups described in this book, Sowells conclusions are mostly spot on. It's also very helpful that he bases most of the book on facts, not fiction and writes in a neutral, unbiased tone.The only groups that are obviously missing & relevant to today's ever changing face of America are South Asians, Arabs & Russians. I hope that the author can provide a second edition to include these groups as well, since they play an important role in shaping the history of our great country as much as the groups already discussed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasently Pleased","review":"I was very pleased with the condition of the book and i have had no issues with ordering online. i will be doing it again next semester."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sowell Book","review":"Thomas Sowell is a genius.

It was absolutely horrible! I love Sci-fi and fantasy but this one takes the cake. They spend hours standing around talking and then decide they need to have a meeting? One guy runs out of air while the others are fine? And no one seems to care that crew members are dropping like flies. Do yourself a favor and watch something - anything - else."},{"rating":"1","title":"best spoof of Mars EVAR","review":"Wow, awful.

But, I kept watching it and it was engaging enough to keep me following it until the ending, and I liked the ending a lot. It brings up a lot of interesting ideas about alien life and what left-over artifacts might be found.The really interesting part is that I've thought of this movie many, many times since I saw it. Its seems to stick in my mind. So, based on this, I've decided to write this review and give it 4 stars, in an attempt to raise the rating on the movie a little. Its really a lot better movie than most of these reviews say it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"insufferable, absolute rubbish","review":"The film \\"Stranded\\" looked promising but of course appearances are decieving, this is quite possibly the worst acting I have witnessed in all my movie-watching. The dialogue between the doomed charachters and their conversations are so unconvincingly unscientific and adolescent. This role is so inappropriate for the young, blonde captain, am I supposed to accept that these people are the brightest and the best? Luka's charachter is somewhat believable and he is the only redeeming part of this film, aside form the eerie mars landscapes. I suppose its worth renting, the crash in the beginning is so bad and low-budget it is laughable, KABOOM!I doubt that one of the brightest medical professionals would be as childlike and idiotic as that cute little asian lady. Also, the director should have done more research on the aforementioned professions of the charachters because this movie is a steamnig pile of poo."},{"rating":"1","title":"One for Mystery Science Theatre","review":"This movie was bad from the very beginning. It took at least 10 minutes just to get started. The acting is bad, the scenery is bad, the script is horrible, and the delivery of lines is even worse! Even though the actors aren't native English speakers, they could at least do some acting. They appear as though they're not even trying to act. There are also some serious flaws in the movie--the astronauts walk around and carry a dead body as if it weighs a lot even though there's little gravity. And they don't even consider eating the body to stay alive! How dumb are they? I haven't even finished watching this movie yet. It was so bad that I paused it to come here and write this review. I also took a dinner break and found it more entertaining to watch my hotdogs sizzle than go back to watching this movie. This is one that could be a lot of fun for Mystery Science Theatre 3000--and even then it might be too poor to save."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie since SWIM FAN","review":"this is a travesty, blockbuster does its customers a disservice by even carrying this peice of tripe.

It is similar to the creative movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. Vincent Gallo is an artistic Genius, his style of Acting is so creative, that it blows my mind. Kudos to you, Vincent. Check out Vincent Gallo in the movie Buffalo '66; a movie Masterpiece, which i recommend anyone and everyone to watch. This movie deserves to be considered among the best of the independent industry: Requiem for a Dream, Kids, Lost in Translation, 21 Grams, etc.For those of you who are lost in Hollywood babble !!!!Open your mind!!!!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"This movie was so BAD that I found myself fast forwarding through it. The intro/credits was hard to sit through, flashing between the credits and the crew while the descent to Mars is taking place. It should be titled \\"Ship of Fools\\" as this astronaut crew was totally in the dark as to the nature of their predicament and survival options. This movie plot was so contrived and ridiculous to the point of absurdity. The acting was the poorest I have ever seen. Not worth the price of a rental, let alone the purchase price. No entertainment value what soever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"I happened on this movie on my satellite TV and was very impressed with it. I liked the degree of realism that this low-budget picture provided. I should warn the reader that this is NOT a \\"Hollywood\\" production with 'Action', sex or monstors. I suppose many would find it 'boring' due to the lack of the aforementioned. It is a simple and straightforward story of what might happen with a group of astronaut \\"castaways\\". It does have a surprise ending although this is presented in such a low-key way that the audience almost misses the import of the discovery. It is like a stage play in that everything occurs with the characters and their dialogue and not equipment or action. I liked it as a simple story told well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don\\"t even think of watching it","review":"Well, if you like watching for about an hour people strolling around a deserted surface, talking as they were on a Sunday evening walk and thereby knowingly using up their last oxygen supplies - its your movie. Otherwise, if you want to watch a movie with at least some decent acting, dialogue or any significant plot (and an ending) - go watch a commercial or for that matter anything else. Because this movie is one of the worst I ever saw! Since I wanted at least get the ending I fast forwarded the DVD (for the plot it does not make any difference) and? No ending, really. If you want to watch a (philosophical) SciFi choose \\"Solaris\\" or the classics, do not waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would rather give birth than see again","review":"This sucks raw hind end. It was infested with the worst acting you could possibly witness. Imagine third graders reading the lines: monotone, dry, deplorable. I can't imagine why on earth the producers didn't try to launch this thing into orbit before it ever made the stores. The special effects were substandard for even a 70s scifi flick. Toward the end of the movie, I wanted to hurt these people. I think I'll go kill myself now so I won't think about it any more. Don't watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"big pile o' crap","review":"This, \\"Fear dotcom\\", and \\"Big shots Funeral\\" are all the worst movies in the world.

It should have negative 5 stars)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a sleeper","review":"And by sleeper, I mean a great movie to fall asleep to. The droning monologue through out the movie works better than a sound machine to put me right into dreamland. A documentary about a documentary would be more exciting. And if you're looking for a climatic ending, you won't find it here. And what's the \\"R\\" rating all about? They say the \\"F\\" word several times and mention masturbation. No violence, no intrigue, no suspense, and no special effects. Reminds me of the sci-fi B movies of the 60's, but only worse.

It was so bad, I actually watched it in complete disbelief that it could be so bad. The acting seemed like a joke. It was as if the actors were pretending to be bad actors, as if in a spoof. But it wasn't a spoof. It was real and very painful, especially the writing. But I watched it and wondered how someone put any real money into it without laughing himself to death or blowing his brains out from the guilt of sharing this with the rest of the world. What hurt the most was I love Vincent Gallo. But this one was more than disappointing. Oh Vincent, I feel like kissing you on the forehead like Corleon did to Fredo and say, \\"You broke my heart.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I have ever Seen","review":"The acting and props are sooooooo bad, that you could swear you were watching a junior high drama project. At one of many points of absurdity, one of the Astronauts rushes in from a walk on Mars excitedly holding a piece of ice that he found !!! Well, the piece of \\"ice\\" is a clear plastic box. Completely laughable. The \\"ship\\" is just a small room with some completelty fake looking plastic buttons that Gallo repeatedly presses. The space suits had a regular zipper in the back - to make sure the vacuum and poison gases don't get them !! The helmets that they used for their Mars space walks simply plopped down on the suit with no seal of any kind.At one point Gallo suddenly proclaims that they only have 12 hours of air left, and asks one of the women for sex so that they can enjoy their waning hours.I can't believe this movie is actually sitting on a shelf for rental. I can't believe they are even calling this a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie in the History of Film","review":"You've probably read it here already . . . this is a complete pile of trash. The effects are all fake, and the acting would receive an F even if this was a junior high play. The low point is when Gallo propositions the female astronaut as they are running out of oxygen - adding \\"we may as well die happy\\". Another low point was when one of the men brought in \\"ice\\", which was obviously just a white, plastic cube.I have never, ever experienced anything - including TV - as bad as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware...Product contains GMO's!!!","review":"These have expeller pressed canola oil in them.

But, even at that these taco shells were already WAY past expiration in their shelf life. They were not anywhere near fresh or fresh tasting. They were old, very tough and extremely chewy. They didn't crumble or break like you would expect. These shells were literally like eating cornmeal jerky and not a pleasant taco eating experience at all.

I had expected to get some practical examples about implementing DSP in FPGA.I regret I was attracted by the name of the book and some reviews definitely not from sillicon valley . Except in chapter1\\"introduction\\" there lists some basic FPGA concepts, I hardly say how this book was named as \\"DSP with FPGA\\".It does provide lots of mathemetical models, graphs for each DSP component, I believe it will be much more helpful to writing a PhD thesis rather than using as reference book in industry.If you are expecting to get some practical examples about implementing DSP in FPGA, this book might not be a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 3in","review":"It does not fit 3in PVC pipe, there is a gap that I'm going to have to use buildup tape or something on to make this work.

I program with PowerBASIC, and the Bible series is invaluable to my work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but does contain many errors","review":"An excellent book only spoiled by numerous typographical errors in the text although you will find the source code on the companion CD to be largely correct. Although Windows 95 is nearing the end of its commercial lifespan this series of books is still valuable to anyone wanting to write backwardly compatible Windows 98 applications. Although the typographical errors in the source code in this book are fairly obvious, some errors in the 2nd Volume in this series (Windows 95:WIN32 Common Controls and Messages API Bible) are are extremely misleading. For instance on page 677 it states that the EN_MAXTEXT message contains the identifier of the edit control in the low 16 bits of the wParam variable when it is actually in the high word of wParam. Another place it falsely states that the callback function used by the EM_STREAMIN returns nonzero to continue transferring data. However this series of books is still invaluable for anyone still writing in WIN32."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"This is one of the worst textbooks I have ever used. As for Heat transfer it is difficult to understand the concepts, and questions as the end of the chapter are ambiguous and is is difficult to understand what the question is looking for.

Hilary Duff's acting was almost as bad as her totally fake italian accent in the lizzie mcguire movie!

But I was surprised to find the movie surpassing both my expectaions before reading the review and my expectations after reading the review. One thing, though, is that Agent Cody Banks should never, ever be compared to Spy Kids. One reason is that Spy Kids 2 and 3 were terrible, and not to mention unbeleivable. At least in ACB, he lives in a real place and works for the CIA (which is of course, real). In Spy Kids, they live on the other side of the looking-glass, work for the OSS, and have rockets built into their shoes. Overall, Agent Cody Banks was a very good movie, with great actors, good visuals, and a good plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheesy fun","review":"A good James Bond Wannabe.

Yes, it's stupid but it makes things happen for a while. Hilary Duff is his would-be girlfriend as he freezes up when he talks to girls (stop it, you're killing me). Her dad is some scientist working for a madman (played by some overtanned Brit) and he has to infiltrate blah blah blah...Yes it is bad, but it could be worse, it could be the sequel.

What I believe makes This series and Blu-ray unique is seeing more of a perspective of the civilians during WWII. Many of the historical dvds give the viewer details of the battles, and film and pictures of the battles, but more from a soldiers perspective. I am glad to add this to my collection because I believe it added that civilian perspective. Many people forget that the civilian causaulty rate dwarfed that of the soldiers lost during WWII. The civilians were just as courageous as the soldiers in many instances. Hopefully we will never have to repeat the lessons that so many learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Martin Sheen","review":"First of all, the content of this documentary is excellent.

If I did not know better I would think the French and Russians were responsible for winning the war based on this DVD set as there is, comparatively speaking, very little coverage or footage of the air war, the level of American involvement in the ETO, the Pacific Theater and nothing of the CBI Theater. Antisemitism, collaboration and complicity were rampant in France long before the war. There were numerous factual errors and mispronunciations; how Tarawa was pronounced on the English version broke my heart :( The Bonus Footage was nonexistent with regard to my expectations and reason for buying this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very worthwhile !","review":"With a lot of \\"unseen\\" and graphic footage, I highly recommend this dvd set to any WWII or history buff. The only downfall that I have (other than it's being not long enough), is the last part that covers 1945. As many events that occured in the final months leading up to VE and VJ days, it seems like they tried to squeeze as much into 50 minutes as they could (example: Okinawa barely gets mentioned).

This book is supposed to be the only authorized written guide for a fighting system developed over a plus 30 year period. This fighting system is widely respected and adopted by many institutions, yet the book does not address in any significant detail, the basic building blocks upon which the rather advanced techniques which are shown must be based. The book addressed defense against knife, handgun, long gun, multiple bad guys, and hand grenade (I'm not joking). Yet basic stances, blocks, strikes, and training methods are barely discussed. As a manual or reference guide, this book is very poorly written.

A lot of good b/w photos. The book is redundant in explaining some concepts, but this also allows a better understanding of the tactics. Tactics: because the book is focused on the developement of tactics rather than teaching you hundreds of moves. It emphasizes also mental training.

I've made several of the muffin recipes and and a few of the loaves as well. I reall like the taste and texture and have recommended the book to several people. Whether the results are high or low carb depends on which recipe you choose, and you do have a choice for many of them of using the stevia-only versions. You don't have to use a recipe with cornmeal or cornstarch; they're in those particular recipes for a reason, but not in all of them. You can choose coconut milk, or any other non-dairy milk. I don't get why some reviewers make things so difficult for themselves. Can they use every recipe in every other cook book they buy? I'm not interested in every recipe in the book, but there are many more I have yet to try, and will. Of those I have made, the ingredients, except for the coconut flour itself, are all readily available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious, but not low-carb","review":"This book is very valuable for the basic information on working with coconut flour, as well as the recipes. I would NOT call it low-carb though, because there is a lot of sugar in the recipes. Even the \\"low-sugar\\" recipes are still half sugar and half stevia. I really liked the coconut muffins, but am working on which sugar substitute would be best so they can really be low-carb. The meatloaf tasted good, but had an odd, grainy texture that the baked goods did not. I'm very excited about baking with coconut flour, but will probably end up using a few of these recipes (the lower sugar and not quite so many eggs ones) more often than the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating recipes","review":"I'm sorry but the recipes just do not work. I tried 2 recipes before writing this review. The last recipe was cinnamon cookies. It says to roll the cookies in cinnamon before baking but the batter is so liquid you can pour it. So my cookies are baking in a casserole dish as a small cake. I followed this recipe to the letter, because the first recipe I tried didn't work either but I changed an ingredient, so gave him the benefit of the doubt.However, after reading the other reviews, maybe the muffin recipes actually work. I cannot eat wheat so I plan on trying a few more recipes because at least it can satisfy a sugar craving, but don't expect too much from this cookbook and be prepared to salvage the recipe.My cookie recipe that I salvaged tasted good the next day, so that's a good thing, but the fact that I had to bake it like a cake, says a lot about the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes use sugar -- NOT low carb!","review":"Coconut flour may be low-carb, but these recipes are NOT. Many of them use cups of sugar, for example, which means the book is all but useless to a low-carb dieter. It gets two stars instead of one for offering a few useful staples that you can make up from coconut flour, but the fact that the cover is pitching the fact that coconut flour is low-carb is very misleading; the implication is that the recipes will follow suit, and they simply don't.Not recommended at all to anyone who's looking for this as a low-carb diet add-on."},{"rating":"2","title":"recipes","review":"They recipes I tried were good but they are different due to the lack of gluten.

I have only made one recipe so far - the brownies. First, they are not low carb. I substituted the 1 cup of sugar with the correct measurement of stevia. I followed everything else to the letter. The brownies turned out so dry and tasteless that I felt like I am eating cardboard. The only way to make them remotely edible was to put a scoop of ice cream on top which defeated the entire purpose. Not only did I throw them away, but I threw away 6 organic-free range eggs, 1/3 cup of stevia and 3/4 cup organic coconut flour = expensive for a bad recipe. Since this is the first recipe that I have tried, I will most certainly give a few more a shot. I will re-review if I get better results.

For those who say there are too many eggs, keep in mind, coconut flour has no gluten-the eggs are needed to act as a binder otherwise whatever you are making would just fall apart. I have made the blueberry pancakes, the brownies, the cheese biscuits, the cookies and all have been great...the meatloaf was very dry and not good, so be careful what kind of meat you use-I used bison and it is very low fat meat in the first place, so did not work for this recipe.

If this were all the book did, it would be significant enough. But Yoshino combines his legal and historical arguments with a memoir in which he \\"uncovers\\" his various selves--his lawyer self, his gay self, his Asian American self, and his poetic self.

I highly recommend this movie to any zombie movie fan whose has ever wondered: what do the zombies think about all this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Worth Watching If You Love Zombies","review":"I really had my doubts going into watching this movie. Even the cover art for the film isn't that appealing (and probably part of the reason I avoided this film for so long). Finally sat down and watched \\"Aaah! Zombies!\\"...I absolutely love it! The script is really good and pretty original. Think Sean of the Dead from the zombie point-of-view. It has it's semi-serious moments and other moments that were truly funny! My favorite scene of the movie has to be when the zombies win the bowling game and do their celebration dance. To see zombies, who don't know they are zombies, try to dance is hilarious! This is the kind of movie I watched and immediately wanted to see again once it was over. Very fun"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooo!","review":"Didn't do anything for me. It was very slow and not funny at all. I even fast forwarded some hoping it would get better but it didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aaah! Zombies!!","review":"I love this movie. It is one of my favorites simply because it is so cheesy and original.. Not in that it is a zombie movie, but that it is the first one I've ever seen that puts it in the perspective of the zombies! It is very good, if you like cheesy films, which I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"great horror/ comedy that's hard to find anywhere else.","review":"A first for me to see a comedy that has zombies as a victums instead of them as the bad guys. LMAO. great for a Indie film like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific","review":"This was an awful movie - so bad it's not worth trying to critique. I do feel sorry for the actors who had to contend with a nonsensical script, but if nothing else it bulked up their resumes, and perhaps led to better gigs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it.","review":"Best acting NO, Highest budget No, but the story line was pretty good. It was comical and quirky. I would recommend it to anyone who has prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny! not your standard zombie movie","review":"This is quite a funny movie and had me laughing thought. But if you are a fan of more traditional zombie movies this may not be for you. There really isn't the traditional zombie action as the characters don't really know they are zombies for the most part so do some accidental killing. The zombie makeup is campy (but funny) and the scenes in the movie where you can see them as zombies are in B&W; and the scenes where it's from their perspective are in color and it switches back and forth.I would recommend it. I rented it and intend to buy it.This movie cannot be compared to Shaun or Zombie land as it's completely different in effects and delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGLY NOISE!!!","review":"How can one appreciate this type of \\"music\\"? Neo-classical it is called? Humans created music to express all kinds of feelings, or to paint a landscape with soothing, positively exiting or relaxing sound! How can one enjoy this irritating noise, that will keep him on the edge of his seat? That will eventually turn him into a nervous wreck! Do we even dare compare this \\"music\\" to the works of Dvorak, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Brahms, and Saint-Saens to name a few? How can one enjoy this broo-haha when he is used to REAL classical music? Adaptation? Open mind? Brain washing? Double personality? Cotton in ears? It's enough that we have to hear this noise on TV and at the movies. ZERO stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent step by step instructions","review":"The step by step instructions for creating projects was very good and save me alot of time.

This book helped very much with the careful instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow really","review":"This is the first Troma film I have ever watched and I couldnt decide which one to buy first this or Toxic Avenger or Class of Nuke'em High and so I read peoples reviews and saying this is one of Tromas best well for me this was just stupid and I know troma films are best known for there low budget and kinda crazy but wow really this was so bad and now I don't want to see the rest of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tromeo and Juliet; Troma goes Elizabethan","review":"Ahh, Troma, each production a classic in its own twisted way. Tromeo and Juliet is no exception. The classic tale of star-crossed lovers set in the urban jungle of the 90's. I must say that, for Troma, this was good. I can't give it five stars (if for no other reason than it is a Troma flick), but i can certainly give it four. This is a great choice for any Troma fan, but be warned; it has all the sex, violence, and twisted humor characteristic of a Troma film. Not one for the kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie was better","review":"First I'm going to start off by saying that the movie was really great. It's campy humor that you can't help but enjoy. Which is why I was disapointed with this soundtrack. Half the bands are talentless, and I mean they're real bad. But what surprised me was how there are some great bands on here too and most of their songs aren't even that good. Sublime , for example, is one of my favorite bands, but their song on here is just terrible. The only good song on this album is the song \\"sacrifice\\" by Motorhead. Sacrifice is a really fantastic song and is the only reason I didn't give this album 1 star. Overall don't wouldn't waste your time on the soundtrack, but the movie is a must-see"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad video quality","review":"I was extremely disappointed with the fact the movie did not run at all after 27 minutes and I kept getting streaming error. I never had such issues with Netflix streaming"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little strange, but it is Troma","review":"Here is a modern story of romeo and juliet, only that it is made about as obsurd as you can get. Not that that's a bad thing. This is still a great movie (if you have a sick sence of humor). Lots of great charaters, including one played by Llyod Kaufman himself. It is for sure a sick and twisted movie, but if that's your thing, then give this movie a watch, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No surprises","review":"This film was exactly what I expected. It is Shakespeare sneaking out of the gutter. It is refreshing to see a modern and more visceral take on a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tromeo and Juliet","review":"Unless You Have Nothing Better To Do... You May Watch This Movie.

I absolutely regret buying this movie. If there is anyone considering to buy this movie, I suggest you rent the movie from your nearest video rent shop and see the movie first. I find it very difficult to even give one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little film","review":"This is a fast, fun story based on Romeo and Juliet. It's got all the perversions you expect from a Lloyd Kaufman enterprise: graphic gratuitous violence, kinky sexual violence, incest, interesting nudity, and things I'm not sure there are polite words for. It's also got stunningly high production values for a Troma film, a good plot (lots of liberties were taken with the story, especially the ending,) acting that doesn't feel like a parody of acting, and character development that are usually far outside the abilities of a Troma film. If you didn't know it was Troma, you'd still like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tromeo and Juliet","review":"I can't say how the movie is because it was a gift for my son (he requested it and stated it's a really good movie). The rating is based on how quickly the item arrived, as it arrived much more quickly than anticipated. The rating is also based on the fact that it arrived in excellent condition. I give the seller a A+++++ rating and highly recommend. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"tromeo and juliet","review":"the movie was a little coffy it took romeo and juliet in put into a funny but much different way"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare + Troma = Gold","review":"If you ever sit and think to yourself \\"Shakespeare is a good writer and all, but sometimes I wish his plays weren't so high-falootin'. Why don't they ever have gore, or tits, or monsters?\\" well then, this sir (or madam) this is the film for you. Tromeo and Juliet is a Tromatized retelling of Shakespeare's classic Romeo and Juliet. If you're not familiar with Troma, what this means is basically taking the bard's tale and making it as trashy, low class, and low budget as possible, and I'll be damned if it doesn't work like magic. Great effects (especially for the budget), great violence, and plenty of sex make this one more than worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Troma's best","review":"This is a great film. Funny, violent, and chock full of nudity, this is what we've all come to expect from Troma. It's Troma's sick and twisted take on Romeo and Juliet, that contains just about everything that is considered offensive, including a penis monster! How great is that! I wonder if I was that only person who was disturbed by the nipple percing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for pac's dope lyrics, 1 star for the last 4 tracks..","review":"Some of Pac's best lyrics ever heard. Too bad the beats were wrong.This is the best EMINEM album though, cause 2pac is rapping over his beats instead of him!I hope Afeni learns a lesson. Sure Em worked for free. But the saying goes: you get what you payed for!That lady is rich and can surely afford more qualified producers.The last 4 tracks prove that anyone but Eminem could have done a better job in representing 2pac's work.This is up there with Death Row's crummy NU-MIXX Pac cd!Nice try Eminem, but you can't sell Pac's music with your own 8 mile sound.I recommend they redo this whole cd with Pac's favorite producers and keep the last 4 tracks!Producers to consider for the future: Dre, Daz, Shock G, Sir Jinx, Quik, Raphael Saadiq, Scott Storch, Red Spyder, Johnny J, and Fred Wreck...perhaps even RZA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!!","review":"I was excited when this CD it the streets but when I heard it I wish I would have saved that 14.95 for something else. I was so disappointed. The lyrics from Pac was tight, but to hear them you have to block out those sorry wacked out beats. When Pac lays a hook leave that hook alone. I thought I was buying a Pac CD but what I got was M&M part 2. I wish Tupac's music is released with as little tampering as possible. If additional lyrics is required because the song was unfinished, it should be done by the Outlaws and nobody else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give us some REAL 2pac music!","review":"I have waited for this album to come out as much as any other dedicated 2pac fan. i was thrilled to finally have it my hands. butwhen i put it in my stereo i realized it was nothin but a pitiful remixed piece of s**t. the music sounds just like another eminem's album with 2pac's name on it. theres no difference between this one and in em's or d12's albums. the worst part is that they made pac say their names, so you can hear him say em, g-unit, banks, buck, trice etc.I gave it 2 stars just because it's 2pac and because of the lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair B-Horror","review":"Two movies-in-one here. Evil Maker 1 and 2 gives us a hodge podge of ebb and flow; the fist one is about a group of friends (all girls) that go on a road trip and end up at a house where evil dwells (oops, that's a title to a different movie); the movie bogs down with the obligatory last-act-of-the-movie-first scenario that tells us...nothing...and the movie is about thirty minutes too long at getting to the conclusion, which involves a confusing plot twist and an equally confusion murderous response. eh...okay b-horror with pizza and beer.The sequel sort of rearranges the storyline from the first film and becomes even more confusing...or maybe it's just confused all on its own...than ever. The sequel is not even good b-horror, but after a few beers you won't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love micro-budget movies","review":"I really like this movie. Most people would think this movie sucks because of the very low budget and all that implies, but I think it was done quite well for what it is. Very interesting ambiance, and I liked the music chosen for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out guys - they're releasing movies from those 50-pack individually!","review":"Okay, if you include this with 49 other movies for around $20 as I had, you may be incensed by epics such as this. However, if you actually purchase it on its own, you should be asking yourself just WHO are these people that are allowed to sell camera equipment to just about anyone. FORGET about gun laws... get an I.D. check on these people.Oh well, maybe all this explains Obama...By the by, if you DO happen to be of masochistic yearning, this movie actually does have a sequel equally effective in inducing in most viewers dull mouth-dropping experience. I understand one can recreate the effect of absinthe by watching both serially, but might I suggest one not do so without the use of a lobster bib unto which to drool.GO RED SOX !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but not for kids","review":"This was a different movie. Jessica Chastain was great. My only problem was that it seemed to just drift along with no real sense of purpose. I don't expect a moral but at least plot that had real bite would have been nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Jolene\\" A Well Done Flix","review":"I love movies with a decent storyline and Jolene is one of those movies. The plot/storyline keeps you glued to the movie. Jessica Chastain does a absolute super job as the main character \\"Jolene\\". A teenage orphan spends ten years traveling cross-country experiencing life, love and heartbreak. Highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rangefinder out there!","review":"I was looking for a rangefinder for a long time to see what it could do for my golf game. I finally had the chance to try this Nikon one out in person and I was sold! Very small, very easy to use and really amazing accuracy. This is the best thing to happen to my golf game (and it needs a lot of help) in a long time! Try it you'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Got batteries","review":"I felt the product should be more clearly marked. For example stating that the item needs a special lithium battery, so that if the item was purchased as a gift as the one I purchased was, I could have also purchased the battery. This made for a very unpleasant Christmas for myself and the person I purchased the gift for. I can not rate this product until I purchase the battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Film Is Excellent","review":"Ever watch a movie that you can't get out of your head the next day, this is one of those films. The plot twists and turns and keeps you on your feet with the introduction of new characters who need to find their place. In the end, the film ties together nicely and leaves you feeling sorry for two hit men!!!Definitely not your main stream thriller. The film is imaginative and you won't walk away feeling jaded."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Good Night\\" is a Great Comedic Crime Drama","review":"This \\"Pulp Fiction\\"-esque crime odyssey has more hysterical colorful characters than Oz has flying monkeys! If for no other reason, see this movie for Ally Sheedy and Ralph Macchio's turn as brother and sister hit team Donnie and Marie. Of course, there's also Deborah \\"Blondie\\" Harry as a New York crime lord; Michael Rapaport, unforgettable, as a bumbling hit man prodigy; and a slew of amazing cameos by Robin Givens, Lanie Kazan, Frank Whaley, and more. The myriad New York City locations pack grit and atmosphere like the A train packs bitter commuters. But, unlike the underground railway, this ticket buys a fantastic ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Stretch","review":"This movie is the best Gary Stretch movie ever. His character is so different from all the others that he has played before. You can't help but root for him all the way through. With clever sarcasm for humor and danger everywhere, this is the real definition of having a bad day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazng Film","review":"This is an amazing film (as the title implies). Craig Singer did an fantastic job making this film. This Captivating film will leave you on the edge of your seat, and by the end will have your jaw dropped.

I thought that this movie was \\"better than watching nothing\\". Boy, was I ever surprised, I loved this movie. I can't say enough wonderful things about it. With all the garbage at theaters these days I'm not surprised that this didn't make it to our local big screen theater. The powers that be at large theaters don't know great even if it bites them in the face. But, I'm certainly glad that I stumbled across this diamond in the middle of all the dirt out there and on television today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!","review":"I was surprised how much I liked this movie.

And for those who don't know him, you should watch! Very heartwarming story of a young deaf boy and his need to connect with his absent father whom he worships. A must see tearjerker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful acting","review":"I truely enjoyed this film. I'm usually all about the fluff of a film, but I gave this a look because of Gerard Butler. I came away from it loving the little boy, his mother, and his grandmother's roles more. However, the one scene with the mother and the stranger (Gerard Butler's character) on the dock is extremely moving. I agree that it is a very powerful movie and worth taking a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Warming","review":"Learning to trust after being betrayed is shown well here.

Defiantly would recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost real life...","review":"A nine year old boy writes and receives letters from his dad whom he surely believes is a sailor. This could be true, but unfortunately it isn't. The author of these letters is his mother who affectionately writes them. His real father had been an abusive guy so his mother went away taking her child trying to have a better living in the Scotland of the 1950's. As the boy knows the ship your father works is coming to his place, Lizzie, terrified, asks help and one of her friends helps her to hire a stranger to be the loving fake father. Gerard Butler plays this role in a sweet manner which almost convinces the lonely mother, he is for real. Lovely film for people of all ages without fantastic and unrealistic turns."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Film In All respects","review":"I had heard that this film was very good, but didn't anticipate its emotional impact. When his mum has to find a Dad for Frankie so that he can win a bet, the film just takes off into the stratosphere. Beautifully acted, photographed and cast, this will go down as one of my all time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a sweet, move well worth watching","review":"This is a sweet movie. You can accually picture it happening. It is set in Scotland with Scottish actors, and actresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic","review":"I thought the story may be a little unbelievable and fairy tale-ish, but I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did. Very good movie with imperfect, but charming (except one) characters. Good acting, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wishing for a wider release!","review":"I was lucky to have this movie in my state- so I made the 300 mi round trip to see it. Stayed for 2 showings- almost better the 2nd time.. I wish Hollywood would take note of this film, how effectively it draws the audience in without special effects, just a good story and terrific acting and direction.. Looking forward to the DVD since many people I know can't make the drive! If you read this and it is near you - SEE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful film, heartwarming and endearing.","review":"I loved this film, there's nothing i can say to put it down. The acting and actors are great. The story is superb. And its got to be one of the best put together films i've ever seen.I love feeling the emotion in films and this had it by the bundle. We would get bits and pieces of info about the characters' past and the shock of you realising what they're actually saying is immence. The film was brilliant, the only reason it recieved 4 stars is that after the film i remained too sad/emotional to want to spend time with the real world. I felt i had to watch something funny or actiony to perk me up again, so that i was ready to face the outside world.A definite winner in my book.One i would definitely advise you to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Frankie: a simple, tender film.","review":"This is a beautiful little movie, touching and involving. Made in Scotland, it won some top awards at film festivals. It was obviously made on a budget and realistic in its setting. And it has the extra bonus of starring Gerard Butler, the actor who played Phantom of the Opera and who has stirred much interest in movie circles. He looks to be a very big star. This movie is a tender and enjoyable piece, and well-acted from top to bottom. The boy is especially good. It is a small film as movies go, but well worth seeing. I loved it and am now a big Gerard Butler fan as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful and sweet","review":"Normally I go for action adventure and epics. But seeing as I am a huge Gerry Butler fan of course I had to buy this movie. It was slower than what I am used to but did not disappoint in the long run. I thought Emily Mortimer and the rest of the cast were very good as well. Although I did need to turn on my subtitles to understand the accents (not Gerry of course), but I really enjoyed it. I especially loved the ending. I had read that it had somewhat surprise ending, but I still did not anticipate how. Thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves you hoping for a sequel!","review":"To tell you how good this movie was....I couldn't wait for it to come out in America, I ordered it from the UK (Didn't know it wouldn't play on my DVD player!)....Discovered it could play on my computer!! The performances by the actors have you participating in their feelings and emotions as the story unfolds. The ending is surprising and leaves one hoping that a brief revelation near the ending will open the door for the future. I think the big distributors really flubbed up by not picking up this movie. I truly hope all the principal players would be \\"up\\" for a sequel...This movie is entertaining, something for the whole family...Buy it and be prepared to love each character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. It's beautifully filmed and the acting was \\"pairfect\\". I love everything about this movie...from the actors, to the scenery, right down to the music used. The story is very touching. Both Emily and Gerard do an amazing job just acting with their eyes alone. I recommend this movie to people all the time. I get mixed reviews on how people felt about the story after they watched it. Some found it rather depressing, others thought it was sweet. I personally think it's a (bitter)sweet movie with great heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible that I'd never heard of this movie before...","review":"I can't get over how good this movie is. I won't take up a bunch of bytes restating what everyone else here has already said (probably better than I would), I'll just rate it what it's worth and be done.

Sharon Small plays a different character from Inspector Lynley series and does it perfectly. Gerard Butler is a hunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Gerry Butler movie to date","review":"I bought this dvd so-so many weeks ago and have seen it countless (I lost count, actually) times. So far this is THE BEST Gerry Butler movie yet. The movie is so simple (and obviously low budget) but the plot is superlative which completely blew me away. I had never been so touched by any movie before and made me cry (especially the person who made me cry was no other than Gerry B). Other casts were just as perfect. Like other reviews, when I first saw the movie it lingered for so long and made me depressed that I needed to pop in some caffeine and jogged for miles to get the adrenaline back pumping. I saw Gerry's latest stint in 300 but it didn't impress me at all. This movie is unassuming but \\"a real gem\\" and real acting at its best. So few movies are made like this (and what a pity!). I'm glad I have this dvd copy and I will cherish it for so long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Frankie","review":"I loved this movie! The story line was believable and the characters came alive. If I was not already in love with Gerard Butler his portrayal of the Stranger would have sealed my fate. I love Scotland and it's landscape and voice shine in this story about a mother and the bond of unconditional love with her son. Emily Motimer (who acts the part of Frankie's mother) has a way of grabbing her audience and making you feel every heart wrenching emotion that she is producing. By the end of the movie you feel as if you are no longer an audience member but that you are an active participant in these peoples lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Frankie Review","review":"I was very suprised at how much I liked this movie. It takes place in Scotland and it's about a mother, son, and grandmother that have been moving around from place to place most of Frankie's(the son)life. He has been writing letters to his father who is on a ship that travels the world. You find out however that his father really isn't on a ship and that Frankie's mother has been writing the letters to make it appear as if Frankie really is hearing from his dad.It's a great movie about what a mother will do for her child, to protect him. It's a great movie and I definatly reccomend seeing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Frankie","review":"A real sleeper, a good find.

Its a \\"slice of life\\" movie, there isn't a grand opening, or ending, but the story line is sweet and the music is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Frankie-- endearing movie","review":"This sweet Scottish movie is one of my favorites. I've found it worth watching more than once. It's a romance without mush, a realistic story without predictability and has characters that can say much more with a look than your typical actors. Gerard Butler's best role--need I say more? I love this story as an example of something different. Hollywood, please take notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slowwwwww","review":"This movie was so slow I couldn't get through the whole thing.

I was SHOCKED that I had never heard of it, nor seen any adverts for it...especially as I was living in Scotland at the time.

It's such a great movie. I wish they would have promo'ed it better here in the US, because this movie would have gotten at the least an Oscar nomination. Such a great piece of film.

It shows a young girl leaving the house at midnight to meet a strange man in the forest (the leprechaun, but still!).They also call The White Pony a \\"she\\" but it is most definitely a \\"he\\".Some nice scenery and lots of pretty shots of the white pony. Also some funny antics by the leprechaun."},{"rating":"1","title":"ack! Not for the horse people","review":"This movie made me cry! Not from saddness but from its terribleness!! I hate hokey horse movies that make the horse world look stupid and dumb. I have been around Horses my whole life and been on Pony Club for over half my life and knowing so much about horses I couldn't enjoy this movie at all...not even a little bit. But if you have a small child then they might like it b/c it was designed for the very very very young NOT the older people in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"The White Pony","review":"I bought this movie for my 2 1/2 year old who is fascinated by horses.

I keep a copy on my shelf right net to Bucklands books on Wicca."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for solitary practitioners.","review":"Over the years I have bought several copies of this book. I wore out one, the others all were loaned out and never came back. I figure those folks needed it more than I did at the time. But I always end up buying a new one because my library seems incomplete without it. This is a must have for any solitary and even for those of us in covens. There is much to learn for Mr. Cunningham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Wiccans, but no one else.","review":"As its title suggests, this book does quite well for Wiccans, and even more particularly, Wiccans of the traditional bent. I bought it on the basis of it being geared toward solitary practitioners, but found its heavy Wiccan bent uninteresting. I know Wiccans worldwide rave about Scott Cunningham, and I've seen worse authors, but unless you're a traditional Wiccan living in a rural area with lots of access to nature - and quite a bit of free time - this book isn't very useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes i Know he's the most famous Neo-wiccan Author..","review":"But..This book and Living Wicca are too simple.Don't get me wrong i enjoy Cunningham pratical books ( i love wicca in the kitchen )but to follow the Godess Path you'll do better if you read Starwaks Spiral dance or Marian Green's Witch alone and for women who want to reach self-empowerment through self-knowledge you must read Lasara Firefox's Sexy Witch."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I am very disappointed on this book. I bought it for two reasons. First, it is Scott Cunningham's. Second, I needed a book to farther my knowledge in Wicca. It presented less ideas or feedback than the other books I've read on the same subject. The best thing on this book is the statement that one can approach Wicca individually. I believe that the younger generation or the teens will be more irritated at this book. It does not contain good spells. It does not teach or give ideas how to integrate crystals, herbs,oils, etc. while doing a spell or ritual. Teen-agers will have more participation in this craft if it shows the adventures in spell or rituals. Nevertheless, I think that Witches should still buy other books that Mr. Cunningham has written for more knowledge involving Witchcraft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Simplistic","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Not what I expected at all. Buckland's \\"Complete Book of Witchcraft\\" if much more informational and flows from topic to topic much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your best option","review":"Scott Cunningham was a gentle soul and wrote some important reference books, but this book is not one of those. Commonly recommended as a beginner's first Witchcraft book, unfortunately it's just fluff. Cunningham is lily-white, childlike, and uniformative in this and his other \\"Witchcraft 101\\" books. If you're a serious beginner and have some idea about what witchcraft and magick are about, skip this book and travel straight through to The Spiral Dance by Starhawk and/or Natural Magick by Sally Dubats. If you're completely ignorant, or for some reason want a very slow, gentle, dull introduction to the life of a Witch, then this is your book. Otherwise, don't waste the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book then and still do now","review":"This is THE GREATEST book I've read on Wicca so far. It's simply written and easy to understand and it gets straight to the important part of wicca that most books miss, the religion. It was my second book on wicca and the main reason I continued to study and still do. It's a wonderful book to show to friends and family who don't understand wicca and would like to know more about it but are scared by things like magic, spells, and the word witchcraft. It's a clear explanation of wicca and has a strong emphasis on ties with nature. I reread parts of this book just for inspiration. I praise this book highly. Everyone should read this. If nothing else, it's a great introduction to wicca."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Wicca 101 book","review":"While what Scott teaches isn't exactly Wicca as Gerald Gardner would have it be, he teaches Witchcraft and he teaches beautifully. He gives you permission to be your own witch - and in Pagan circles, that's a rare gift! Scott Cunningham's books are all well worth reading, and this is the one I suggest to those just starting out on their Path - above and beyond any other 101 type books out there, this is the most gentle and generous of the lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your planning on being a solitary wiccan buy this book.","review":"Many of the techniques in this book can be used by a wiccan at any level.

There is also alot of information for the most knowledgable Wiccan to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginners guide to magick","review":"This book was excellent. Although I have read more exciting and informative books since I purchased this one, it was Scott Cunningham's great work that got me started. If not for him, I don't know what I'd be doing right now. Even if it is difficult to understand at times, the explanations were great, the outline of tools and rituals was very helpful, and the book of shadows in the back gave me an idea of how to start my own. I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to know more about Wicca."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"Blessed be!! This is a great book for both Wiccan and non-Wiccan people. It is one of the first that I had read when I decided to follow the path, and is still one of the best. Cunningham packs a wealth of information into this book and his simple style is very easy and free-flowing. Even though I have decided not to follow Wicca, I have no problem highly recommending this book. It got me started on the folk magic path, practicing both runic and candle magic.

It really scared me because of what society has said of it. Slowly, ever so slowly I inched closer and closer. There was something so familiar about Wicca. The first book I ventured to buy was MAIDEN, MOTHER, CRONE by DJ Conway. The second book was this book by Scott Cunningham. I learned so much from this book. My fear was alleviated because of the simple explanations included. The suggested ceremonies were easy to understand and do. Its a good book for a person who needs information about this spiritual path Wicca, and there is no group or coven available to join. I am grateful this book was written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for starters...","review":"I was impressed on how Mr. Cunningham presented his work.

She read it, and liked it. Now I feel like she understands me better, and maybe dont worry as much.I look forward to reading other books by Scott, and hope they are as good as this one.All witches start somewhere, and this book is a good place.It was for me. Blessed Be. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"This is a good book for beginers, solitaries, and even the more 'expeirenced' Wiccan. IMHO, everyone can learn from this book. It sets back to the 'simple' principles, and also reminds one that there is no 'true way' as some would have you believe. I think this book is great for beginers, because it lets one run free, and sets out from the begining that even the authors way, isn't necessarily right. I think it should be in every Wiccan's library of books, and serves a good lesson to those who'd have you believe you are wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"He raised me","review":"Ahh...what can I say...when I bring people into the Wiccan world, this is one of the first books I encourage them to read. I love Scott's very basic, no fanciness needed approach to Witchcraft. His style is very good, in particular with Witches who are still finding their footing. Being a practicing Witch for over 9 years now, I frequently refer to his books for additional guidance and approaches.

Since I am not going to pursue the Wiccan path itself, I ddin't want something overly detailed; nor did I want something biased towards a certain tradition. This is excellent for anyone on any pagan path just starting hir journey. It has some good basic spells, and allows for a lot of fleixibility. I higly recommend using it along with Weiser's \\"A Book of Pagan Rituals\\"And who is this scutler child who keeps being a hair-brain?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful guide for the solitary","review":"For anyone interested in the earth bound religions, this a wonderful guide for both the beginner and the advanced prationer alike.

I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Changed My Life","review":"This is probably the best book ever written about American Wicca. Scott's down-to-earth but mystical style leads you through all the basics of Wiccan practice, and the information in the book is just as valuable for the advanced practitioner as it is for the novice.

It's a beginning for those that have no clue or that have been told lies. Sure the rituals aren't that amazing, but your not supposed to rely on anyone published rituals for any length of time. Beginners don't need all the pomp at that time. Honestly I don't understand why so many are complaining about this book. It's a wonderful book and I recommend it to everyone that is just starting out. He is showing a religion, silver ravenwolf and friends are showing hocus pocus, black fingernails, and fun necklaces. If you want that, go for it, if you want a faith base, read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly What I Was Looking For","review":"I've been looking for a book to help guide me as I begin my pagan journey.

It's very general, encouraging the reader to rely on their own intuition and use this text only as the foundation for their own tradition, not taking every word as gospel. It goes into basic ritual design and magic, but not into the more technical aspects, which should be taken seriously and left until after much more studying. A very good foundation for the beginner, helps a lot with starting a book of shadows and your own tradition as a solitary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"this book gives the basics of wicca, by someone who knows what he is talking about.

I found its simple, friendly style easy to digest. I was also intrigued with all the reference to stones, incense and oils.

Good beginning book for modern, general Wicca."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginner material","review":"Don't let the flashy cover print, \\"over 400,000 copies sold,\\" second guess your purchase of this book. There is a reason this number of individuals, perhaps very much like yourself, owns a copy. Perhaps the best way to obtain a better understanding of any given topic would be to start with the basics, learn from the ground up; plant the seed and watch it grow. This book has done so for many and could quite possibly for you. Enjoy and Blessed Be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best starter guide you could own","review":"I wish this had been my first guide into the mysteries of Wicca. Mr Cunningham wrote this book with the knowledge that not all people follow the same path, and he often makes reference to doing what works for you. The book is written like a Wicca 101 class starting with History first and working into the deeper mysteries of what it takes to be a Wiccan. He insures that you understand that Magick is working with the natural energy of the Universe to help manifest something. NOT a \\"quick\\" fix solution that will produce items out of thin air!If you are seeking a book to start your Solitary path, or even a coven reference, than get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the range","review":"An Ecclectic/Solitary practitioner must read this book. The author encourages to modify the book for personalized use. This book is aimed towards solitary practitioners. And it can be easily modified for the practice of a couple, and that is the most wonderful thing about this book.This book helped me to understand many basic principles of Wicca. You may also need a good highlighter pen to use with this book. It is very practical. I keep this book with my BOS inside the circle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What ever happened to the religous experience?","review":"I didn't like this book for the same reasons I don't like Buckland. It's a \\"just do it\\" witchcraft book. There no regard whatsoever to the rich pictoral folklore of old Europe, which, whether modern Wiccans will admit itor not, played a larger role in the developement of Wiccan beliefs than did any genuine historical tradition. The rituals are all about energies. The book is geared toward new agers, not Earth worshippers.This is the kind of paganism that you can practice in your sleep. \\"Feels the energies\\" he says over and over again. Condensing those energies into actual entities, like faeries, is what separate pagans from your standard new ager. But, like I said, Cunningham's devotion to history and folklore amounts to almost nothing. There are some good listings for corropondances, but what is there is shortened, meaning you'll have to look elsewhere if you're looking for a 'complete' Wiccan resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Could Do Better","review":"This book was supposedly for the solitary practitioner, right? So why did I feel like Cunningham was trying to walk me hand-in-hand through every step of my Wiccan beginning? C'mon Scott, let me think for myself! Almost half of the book is his own Book of Shadows, which sucks by the way. If you're a beginner look for Jennifer Hunter's \\"21st Century Wicca\\", it's a much better book with more practical info for the beginner. If you absolutely NEED something to read, Cunningham's book will suffice, but wait for your initiation until after you've read Hunter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"informative but dry and repetitive","review":"This was not the first Wiccan book that I had read, and maybe that is why I don't think its so great. When I first skimmed through the book, my opinion was thatI felt as though I was fliping to the same page over and over again. In reality the author had repeted himself a few times. In adition when I finnally got around to reading this book, I found it VERY dull. However, to a person beginning in the craft or to someone who wants to look into the craft, then this book is good to read, if you can stay awake that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are you waiting for ?","review":"If you're a beginner, click ADD TO MY BASKET, if you're not click ADD TO MY BASKET; in any case you'll not regret it.He's no longer amongst us in phisical shape but he left us a pletora of good books and thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the beginner!","review":"This book is what turned me on to witchcraft.

Anyone that has been practicing for awhile wouldn't be interested in this alough for a begginer it is an unconfusing way to figure out what it means to be Wiccan. The chapters go in enough depth to give a good basis for farther reading. He also has another section on practice and a beggining to a BOS for the begginer.

This book deflects the negative spin on Paganism in today's world. I just wish Cunningham would write a book on parenting, paticularly lesbian parenting, and raising your children Wiccan. I come from a Jewish background, and this book has compelled me to blend these two religions. I think Cunningham has an excellent writing style, and I was terribly pleased with this book. I would be happy to take any emails to discuss this book with others. GO GET IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter drivel about the runes","review":"I was quite happily reading through the book until I came to the section about runes. His lack of knowledge was amazing, total, utter drivel. He thinks there's only 12 runes, he's associated incorrect meanings to runes, he's used hex signs and called them runes and some he seems to have completely made up. Worse than even Ralph Blum wrote. I have to ask now, if this ignorance extends to other parts of the book? I can't judge how good the rest is, knowing how bad this bit is. My comment is based on working with runes for over 30 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cunningham is amazing","review":"Cunningham gives so much good info for anyone who wants to study wicca or just know about it.

I'm only 15 years old, but this book is so well layed out and beautifully articulated that anybody can follow it! I enjoyed this book thoroughly and will own it for years to come. One of the main points of this book is also one of the most important: don't think that you MUST copy spells and rituals verbatim, but feel free to change, write, and create your own to fit your likings. I have already recommended this book to a friend, also just learning, and would also recommend it to everyone and anyone interested in this beautiful religion! Good luck, and may the gods smile upon you! What are you waiting for? BUY THE BOOK!! Plus, you do save money from Amazon. I could've saved about 3 dollars! Have fun, and harm NONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WICCAN-TASTIC!","review":"I have not completed the book yet and already I am pleased with it. I have tried studying Wicca in the past and had such books as To Ride a Silver Broomstick and The Grimoire. These books seem to read too much like stereo instructions. Cunningham's book is very easy to follow and very interesting. I am very happy to be using this book as the beginning of my journey to become Wicca. This book is very much geared toward making the religion your own and truely feeling the rites you perform. Not just going through the motions. It is very to the point about those who wish to only do \\"magic tricks\\" rather than explore all the levels of consciousness and to broaden oneself. 10 thumbs up :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Guide For Beginners!","review":"Since I am completely new to the Wiccan path I realized that (obviously) I needed to study if I really wanted to take on this religion. This is the first book that I bought, which was only around five days ago. In this book their was great information that dragged me in. It had some wonderful basics that any beginner would need to know. For myself, I just found it amazingly helpful and I am very positive that Wiccan is the path I want. (My mother has given me the choice to pick any religion and she told me she would support me in any way.)One part of the book when it showed and told about an altar and it's layout was a nice touch. I also enjoyed the many symbols that I had no awareness of until after I had finished with this piece. I recommend this book for anyone who is trying to start off as a Wiccan or who wishes to just know more about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Introduction","review":"This is one of the most recommended introductions to Wicca for a reason; because it works.

Scott Cunningham's is definately in the top three (and yes I have read more than 3 :-P) His book is easy to read with a wealth of information. Everything he writes is clear and concise (unlike this review) He briefly touches on many of the vast topics to be found in Witchcraft. This book can give you the basics of different topics, and then follow up with books and studying which focus primarily that topic (which Cunningham may have a book for).More advanced and knowledgeable practitioners will be bored with this book, and the information is very rudimentary. but the title does have the word beginner in it, so if you have been practicing for a while and buy this book, you deserve what you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick shipping","review":"Product arrived quickly and in very good condition.

I love how it is clear without speaking down to the reader. It gives enough detail on what to do and not to do with Wicca, but leaves it open-ended enough that one is inspired to use our own imagination instead of just follow some cookie-cutter recipe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Pagan Beginners","review":"This is a good book for those who are beginning to introduce themselves to the world of formal paganism. I am not Wiccan so I can't say how it measures up to the religion but there is a lot of good information for those who don't know what path they will take but at least want to try something. It's not condescending in tone rather it's warm and inviting, with undertones of understanding.

It holds up just enough information for the basics the religion Wicca, along with enough advanced point to make the grade with more advanced users of magick. Scott Cunningham's work is amazing and I love him as an author, but he could have don without handing out his BoS in the end of the book, thusly splitting the book in two to most whom only seeking it for references.

I started out with Silver Ravenwolf's books and I will continue to read them. I bought this book recently and it makes me feel as if the god and goddess are only in nature and not within us. I makes me feel like the god and goddess deal with us here and when we die we have to deal with some one else. I hate this book, it even made me consider Christianity but the Goddess has led me back to Wicca and I will never leave it again. It has also led me to consider Druidry.

Then with renewed interest I picked it up last week and read it from front cover to back cover and I went on to purchase several other books to start me on the path towards Living Wicca. Scott Cunningham makes things easy to understand and puts a lot of emphasis on trusting your own instincts and realizing that what he says is not written in stone.

I highly recommend that if you need anything else after reading this book, check out his other titles like \\"Magical Aromatherapy\\" and \\"Wicca a Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\\". Also works from other authors including \\"Book of Hours, Prayers to the Goddess\\" by Galen Gillotte and Llewellyn's \\"Witches' Datebook (for the year)\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Got Passion? Got Pizazz?","review":"This Book is very informative. It has all the information that I've been looking for, it's the real deal. The only thing is, the author's writing style is not very exciting.

I think religion and belief systems are something one should feel passionate about, and that should show through in writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Wicca book","review":"This was a cool book on Wicca. Most of the information was solid, but I was disappointed because there wasn't much on the fae.

It seemed to be written for a teenager new to Wicca. I found it very boring and simplistic. I am new to Wicca, but I found this book dull and much too simplistic. For me, the author took the joy out of learning Wicca. I have been unable to read it through because I feel as though I am reading a children's book. I felt it was a waste of money. Boring....boring....boring"},{"rating":"2","title":"good primer","review":"Well written primer on Wicca. I personally like his style in that he does not force a view upon the reader. He tries to lead the reader to discover their own feelings toward the subject. At the same time he covers most of the bases as to what you need to know to start practicing wicca. A very practical guide"},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy way to the Wiccan Path","review":"I have found this the best Solitary Guide to Wicca available.

Cunningham stresses throughout what I feel is truly important: individualism in spirituality. Unfortunatey many other books forget this and I'm sure many readers conclude that what they have read is correct and 'the way it ought to be'. Nothing becomes so concrete unless you make it so, and this is the prime lesson that is taught within \\"Wicca: A guide for the Solitary Practitioner\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A very imformative book.

Living Wicca is equally wonderful, as are many of his other books. For someone who's been following the path for a while it'll seem a little bland, but it's the perfect place to start. I especially love his books because he's not strictly Wiccan, he recognizes that are many ways to do things and presents the information as his way, not the \\"right\\" way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gathering of information","review":"For a beginning solitary Wiccan or a different view for the initiated group Wiccan, this book is quite informative without being 'preachy'.

I'm sad to report that, despite my \\"inner voice\\" red-flagging me about the obviously homemade cover art, I had to part with my hard-earned cash and wait til I got home to confirm that, \\"Yup, it's a bootleg!\\" I'll admit that I couldn't detect any clicks, pops or skips, but there is an unmistakable harmonic distortion on high vocals and cymbal crashes that can only point to a vinyl source master.

It's just a bunch of idiots sitting around talking about stupid stuff and every 15 minutes there is a super lame 'horror' scene.

Belly dance is not swinging your hips right and left like a duck, it is an art that requires years to study.I have been dancing and teaching for more than 10 years and I have collected over 200 belly dance DVDs and videos, almost everything that is on the market.

It's kinda like watching Hannibal without first seeing Silence of the Lambs. Porky's lends a light-hearted slant to how sex in 1950's-1960's high school should have been. It played out the sexual fantasies without having to pay the consequences at the end. In a nutshell it was like Mad Magazines approach to Penthouse. Provided parents can check their biased morality at the door I would recommend Porky's to be seen by all teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY EVEN MAKE A SEQUEL TO A MOVIE LIKE ''PORKY'S''?","review":"THE ABSOLUTE WORST OF THE SERIES.

THE PLOT IS SENSELESS [WELL, ALL THE PLOTS FOR THE PORKY'S MOVIES WERE STUPID], THEY'RE HARDLY ANY FUNNY SCENES, AND IT'S JUST UNNECESSARY TO EVEN DO THIS SEQUEL.

The only reason this film is even granted one star (dispight the fact that theres nothing less to give) is some of the jokes are funny.

Porkey's is a fine series only the first and last films are good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check out the Troma originals!","review":"What is it with movies that they only become popular if as little original as possible? The Porky's series have, for some reason, reached an enormous popularity, while they were more than just highly influenced by far superior productions made years before them. Lloyd Kaufman's SQUEEZE PLAY (1980) and WAITRESS (1982) both appeared before the first imitation in the Porky series (1982), and although they had reasonably successfull theatrical runs, they somehow didn't come to be as well known as the rip offs. And more of Lloyd Kaufman's brilliance was made in 1983 (STUCK ON YOU and THE FIRST TURN-ON), but these much better titles also didn't reach the kind of audiences that later and even weaker Porky titles did.If you like the Porky films I am sure you will absolutely love the films that inspired these series, and suggest you check them out as well!

Well, all these reviewers have been EXTREMELY lucky. Twice, I've exchanged the box set because the disc that is in the \\"One Size Fits All\\" edition is actually the previously released version of Porky's with only the theatrical trailer and NO other special features. Anywhere. The third version I got was from 20th Century Fox themselves, and it was STILL the wrong disc! I assume the special features are not some kind of bizarre easter egg thing I have to hunt for (which I did anyway, to no avail). So, before you shell out for the box set, I advise you make sure you are getting what you pay for. When the box quite clearly states all the wonderful special features, and the disc has only the trailer, something is wrong at 20th Century fox."},{"rating":"1","title":"nowhere near as good as the original","review":"Porky's 2 starts off the day after the first one ends.At first it's funny then it goes down hill from there.If you must see this movie I'd rent it,instead of buying it.The only reason I own it is because I've got the DVD where it has Porkys/Porky's 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Gift for the Folks...","review":"My parents really liked these movies, so I gave them the collection as a gift.

Just One of the Guys, Private School, Spring Break, even up to the American Pie movies, all owe some kind of allegiance to Porky's. The shower scene where Tommy pokes his tongue through the wall for the unlicensed hygiene inspection is the best shower scene in the history of cinema. My cinema tastes are extremely varied, Goodfellas is my favorite movie, but Porky's is always great for a good laugh, from back to my childhood, and even into my adult years, it's still the best.

I thought maybe Scott was on his way back with Rock in a Weary Land, even though that was pretentious and ponderous in places(What Waterboys album hasn't been?), but this is so lame. The unrelenting religious patter grates so badly(it makes me want to rethink eternity-if this is the kind of stuff coming out of speakers up there...)This release reinforces the fact that Fisherman's Blues was the only marginally great album from the Waterboys.This sounds like a side band playing at a revival for old 80's has beens. ooo-wee-ooo....What possessed the man to throw such a chorus into a song???(Oh, sorry.

Okay, Mike is getting into this spiritual thing, and that's fine (see \\"Bring Em All In\\" - wonderful!),but his songs this time around sound embarrassingly amateurish.

A third attempt with tech support produced the suggestion that I change my web browser (I'm using IE!) Instead, I bought a Linksys card, which worked straight out of the box. Don't buy this product!

I purchased this one because it was eligible for 20% off through an Amazon Mom sale, and I'm happy with the purchase so far. I installed the gate myself (pregnant and all) in about 15-20 minutes. The instructions weren't as clear as they probably could have been, but I got the gist pretty quickly. Unfortunately, I realized I installed it so the door opened out into the hallway instead of into the room. So I had to take it down and re-install it the way I wanted it. That took less than 5 minutes because I knew what I was doing. For our doors, which I assume are standard width, we didn't need any of the extensions.My only concern is that the spaces between the bars is a little wide. Our larger dogs can't get their heads through or anything, but I don't know if a curious child might be able to injure themselves somehow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to use","review":"Very easy to operate with one hand and fit perfectly in the archway between the living room/kitchen.

When we received it, the gate seemed well constructed and easy to assemble. We have a number of other gates throughout the house, so we are certainly not unfamiliar with how they go together and work.When we got it set up, no matter how we adjusted it, it would stick at the bottom corner of the swinging door to the bottom crossbar. I tried everything from preloading one side to try to tweak it so it would have more clearance, but it still had interference at the same point when tightened fully.I purchased it based on the positive reviews it received, and maybe I received a defective example. But it went back to Amazon and we went with another gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doggie gate","review":"I purchased this to block off our hallway so that our dogs don't meander into the back rooms and do their terrorist things.The gate latch is adjustable so that our 4 year old grandson can open it to get access to the bathroom when he remembersto leave in time.

This past Friday, December 8, 2006, my 4 year old had the latch slip close and resulted in a trip to the ER! He lost his fingernail, got 3 stitches and broke a bone in his finger! The maroon part of the latch has a powerful spring that is TOO STRONG, especially for smaller hands and fingers! I shudder to think what would have happened if my son had smaller fingers! The bone in his finger is completely split in two. It was very serious! Please, I urge all parents to look for a safer alternative to this gate!

The only things that were hard to figure out was; the handle (how to get to the perfect spot), and that when you tighten the plugs on the sides, they screw in opposite directions on each side. When I finally got it installed, I was very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable","review":"Pros: Very easy to install - you are done in 5-10 mins. Good height. Looks safe for the little fingers.Cons: The extension connections do not snap well. The whole door is bending front and back, not sure if it is going to hold on my toddler.This is the second Regalo easy step door that I am buying. I bought the shorter version (with one extension only) first and it worked perfectly. However, I need a door for a wider opening and bought this product with two extensions. The way the extensions are connected allows them the structure to bend. One connection works fine, but two of them makes the whole structure to bend front and back, no matter how tight you fasten the bolts. The other problem is that you cannot fasten the bolts beyond certain point without preventing the door from opening/closing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong product delivered.","review":"After ordering the Los Angeles Angels T-shirt, Amazon delivered a Texas Rangers t-shirt.

Anyone who wants to learn about what it takes to compete at this level of tennis can get an education here. Also someone interested in the inner workings of the tour and the agencies that govern it can find out what they want to know.

I didn't guess the ending, and was surprised at who the bad guy was. Of course, I don't usually try to guess, but it's nice when the answer isn't staring you in the face the whole story.I did have a problem with the way the entire family was included in the police task force.

Speed Racer is one of these shows. It is crudely animated, but this in itself adds to the tone -- it is set apart from the goofier cartoons of the day. Dramatic to say the very least, this particular episode brings cult character Racer X (Speed's older brother) to the fore and Speed's angst at not knowing who he is and why he cares so much for him is brought out beautifully (the writers really CARED for these characters!!).

Some of the coincidental events in the book seemed too fantastic. The sex, drug use, and the drinking and driving scene were excessive. I would almost characterize the book as a trashy romance novel, for men, with no follow through. Jonah is not an age appropriate role model. In the previous books he is though.

But then there's there's a boring, almost useless (and conventional) central plot running through the whole thing.

For the money we paid for it, I have yet to be impressed. He was so excited about it but we couldn't get to go around the few track configurations we tried. They went around maybe once at the most then just fell down. One of the cars no longer works. The flexible tracks don't fit in the grooves without forcing it in. We bought this based on the good reviews, should have listened to the negative review. Can't say I would recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We purchased this last Christmas (owned for 8 months now). The track connectors broke after assembling only three different configurations. The cars do not travel the full length of several of the recommended track designs and the cars wear out fairly quickly. We can't build all suggested designs due to faulty parts and they are very difficult to assemble for anybody under 6 years of age. We have replaced two cars due to the wind-up no longer functioning and at $10 a piece for car or replacement engine, that's ridiculous. When they work they are fun, but if you can find a cheaper alternative, such as mega blocks or matchbox tracks that work with all cars, go with it. Darda is glossy cool on the surface, but not worth the money at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of fun with lots of possibilities!","review":"We're having a great time with the Darda Create-a-Course system. My son is 4 and needs help assembling the tracks (and probably will for a few more years on the larger layouts) but he really enjoys choosing the layout to build, picking out the pieces and participating with the \\"construction\\" phase, and then both he and our 2 year old daughter run the cars. They do great on the loops! I think this toy has quite a bit of longevity - if we don't loose the pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive, and didn't last long","review":"I bought this for my two boys for Christmas this past year. It was great in theory, I liked the different tracks you could build and it was sturdy, BUT, not even 24 hours after opening it, the cars didn't work anymore. I was quite upset by this, as I spent $100 for this set. If the cars would have worked, it would be a great item, but for the money, I would have expected the cars to last longer! They aren't cheap to buy separately either. So, now the tub just sits up on a shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer racetrack!","review":"First off, I was a little nervous about the price, but let me say that it's worth it. Quality product, and being a guy who jumps right in without reading instructions, quite intuitive. I went back to the instrux after cranking out a couple of set ups, and it's easy to figure out without the instructions, but they give some good direction as to what you can do. my kids (girl 5, boy 2.5) can't get enough. It's even displaced the train table, which is saying volumes. The only thing I would like with this is full-color photos of the setups. With all the winding in and out of tracks on the loopy sections, it would be nice to have a little more clarity when doing some of the pre-set setups. But having all the parts to make multiple tracks at once is invaluable. I would also recommend having at least two cars per kid, to account for a 'temporarily missing' vehicle (i just ordered 3 more). Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never before seen such a diversity of jokes on","review":"professions and laughed so hard at all of them.YOur'll find:Nurses, taxi drivers, doctors, lawyers, accountants,plumbers, actors, hunters,dentists,sweimmers-tennis players, basquetball players..., computer people,barmen...all you can imagine and MORE !!!I strongly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent combination of learning and music","review":"This DVD was a real treat.

The only thing he's really right about is you have to feel the music and not think about what you are playing, but just try to connect to your instrument, which I didn't have to pay 30 bucks to be reminded of, learn a little theory a little bit at a time, learn your favorite songs, and improvise and jam with people.

Sad to say, I didn't - at all! Although some of the dialogue is clever, the overall impression is patchy and lacklustre, the characters confused, and the storylines hollow. The very basic graphics (to say the least) are truly terrible; the music is clichéd hip-hop nonsense and the stories don't engage. Sitting through an entire episode is in fact, something of an endurance test.

Aqua teen is among my favorite shows and I'm glad its so cheap on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meatwad Gets the Honeys","review":"Aqua Teen Hunger Force is so funny and imaginative. I stumbled on it by accident one late night watching Cartoon Network Adult Swim. I had seen this fast food version of South Park advertised before, and I thought there was no way in the universe I would ever watch something as dumb-looking as that.But ATHF is written by people with intelligence, wit, and a great - although warped - sense of humor. Shake, Frylocke, and Meatwad live in their quiet New Jersey subdivision. Shake is a jerk. He delights in tormenting poor Meatwad, and takes endless advantage of Carl's swimming pool. Frylocke is intelligent and decent. He keeps Shake in line. Meatwad is sweet and naiive, although sometimes you see he is not as naiive as you think. Their long-suffering, sweatpants-wearing neighbor Carl gets reluctantly sucked into all their escapades. And what escapades they are. ATHF Volume One has many laugh out loud moments. I only wish it was longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!","review":"Great show! not everyone's kinda flavor/style of comedy, but if your into very sarcastic comedy and can accept a different kind of visual appeal, WATCH THIS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally weak!!","review":"Totally weak! ATHF is a great series but the DVD collection adds NOTHING to the series as it originally aired.

Do yourself a favor, tape the series off air and save yourself some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"no laughs","review":"OK, it is clever in one sense--the characters have interesting quirks but after you watch one episode, they are all the same. I prefer homestarrunner.com for weird humor of this ilk with better wacked-out writing. Aqua Teen Hunger Force is basically a one-trick pony.The only funny characters I dug were episodes where the video game-like Mooninites showed up.The humor was like bad Shecky Greene and the animation tries to be sort of Terry Gilliam Python-like but just looks too Hanna Barbera flat and ultra '60s.Disappointing after reading the reviews here."},{"rating":"2","title":"good..........but no sealab","review":"Aqua Teen Hunger Force is a funny show from the Adult Swim segment of cartoon network. It surprises you with consistent off-beat humor based around the story's \\"plot.\\" This being said, i didn't give it the 5th star because it has the bad luck of being scheduled next to sealab 2021, which is the funniest animated show i have ever seen. However, since sealab isn't available yet on dvd format, i do recommend Aqua Teen Hunger Force."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect... Almost","review":"First off, I have to agree with everyone here that this is an amzing work of animation. If you like King of the Hill, the Simpsons, Futurama, Family Guy, and South Park, then you will love this as much, if not more. Instead of droning on and on about how good it is I would like to point out the biggest disappointment of the DVD. If you're anything like me, you enjoy the commentaries very much. Matt Groening and many others did commentaries on every Simpsons and Futurama DVD that has been released. Unfortunately, We get three lousy commentaries here from the creators. They spend more time watching the show along with you than explaining anything. In another they play a long, crappy song, except however for the BAD ASS GUITAR SOLO supposedly done by Dave Willis. Overlooking that fact, I must say the DVD is still a must have as will be the much anticipated future volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aqua Teen Hunger Force Assemble!","review":"Ok, I suppose there are people out there who won't appreciate Aqua Teen Hunger Force...but those people are stupid people!

Its hard to find, because its on for 15 minutes once a week (Sunday Nights at 12:45). I couldn't sleep one night and i stumbled apon it. I'm so glad I did because it is perhaps the FUNNIEST, MOST CLEVER, MOST ENTERTAINING cartoon ever made. I wait all week for the 15 minutes of show! I'm getting this DVD so I'll have something to hold me over. Trust me, if you like humor of any kind, this is the funniest cartoon ever EVER! I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much of a good thing...","review":"The two discs hold the first season of the adventures of Master Shake, Frylock and Meatwad, three creatures who live in a run down house near the Jersey shore. They make up Aqua Teen Hunger Force, a force of good, a force trying to deal with alien invasions, monsters, robots, rainbows, cloning machines, talking dolls, money, mold and other weird events that seem to happen on their street. Love the opening theme song.The DVDs have three commentaries and a few extras. My only problem is that I tried to watch every episode in one day and it seems that was a mistake. Watching it all at once seems to take some of the humor out of it. It got less funny after each episode. I would suggest keeping it down to one episode per day and maybe taking some kind of booze with it along with large amounts of some kind of salty snacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commence to Jigglin'!","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Space Ghost or most of the other Adult Swim cartoons, but ATHF completely knocked me out the first time I saw it - namely, the episode where Glenn Danzig buys Carl's blood-gushing house. That particular episode isn't on here (I'm hoping it'll be on the next DVD), but everything that is here is hysterically funny in a totally surreal way. My favorite episode is \\"Happy Time Harry,\\" featuring the depressed talking doll who totally lays into the fantastically inane \\"Jiggle Billy\\" action figure. And I still can't get Schooly D's opening theme rap (\\"Meatwad make the money, see/Meatwad get the honey, G\\") outta my head..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My gosh, I never thought I would see this!","review":"Awesome, simply awesome. I use to watch adult swim before they changed around the schedule and stuff. Aqua Teen Hunger Force is one of the funniest shows around. The first season is the best, and it maintains its goodness throughout.Shake, Fry-lock, and Meatwad go around trying to catch criminals. The odd thing is, the only episode that they actually try to solve some kind of case is the pilot episode. Master Shake is great, and anyone who loves stupidity and little thought process should love this. Each episode is different, and the craziness of them all make the series awesome. Plus, there are so many great and interesting characters(the moononites).Basically, go buy this dvd now. This series rocks. The animation fits perfectly, and the only bad thing is that the season is kind of short. I mean, one episode is about 15 minutes. Thats like 1 hour and 30 minutes. It's worth it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth","review":"When you pop this in and hit play it will play.

Buy this great dvd, and volume 2.!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, REALLY funny show!","review":"I first saw this on the Cartoon Network when Adult Swim first came out in September 2001. I was quite surprised by its content. Though the program is extremely farfetched and does not make ABSOLUTELY no sense, it's exactly what makes this show extremely funny with its crude humor and animation. Follow the adventures of Master Shake, Frylock & Meatwad as they do battle with the evil Ignignokt and Err of the Mooninites in a rediculous storyline and plot that will have you on the floor rolling around and laughing your head off! Now that this's finally on DVD, we can experience all the episodes all over again and any time we want!

I disagree with most of the reviewers in that Meatwad is not incredibly stupid but simply an \\"every-man\\" while master shake is truly the fool---but also the most loveable.

Good looking actors, but after 30 min ofthis thing going nowhere it really starts to get boring. So, Justin and Mila roll around in the sackconstantly, but it is not even interesting or sexy, it is just a total yawn. I had to turn it off at about60 min into it, because I was falling asleep and it appeared to have no end in sight. Spend you money on something else. This was just a complete waste of time. Justin should be more careful about the movies he takes on, as he is still building a reputation as an actor and this one does not help!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty awful","review":"The movie was mostly awful cliches with moments of humor Enough funny moments to warrant 1 star, but otherwise a truly bad film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Justin needs to stick to singing...","review":"Bad acting through the whole movie, boring, not worth $3.99 rental fee. Justin Timberlake is not a good actor in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!!!!!!!","review":"You know it's not a good sign when you keep wishing a movie would end already. I cannot believe this drivel actually made it out of the movie studio. No strings attached was so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just eh","review":"Spoiler warning.The leads are charming, but the story lacks depth and is totally predictable. And worst of all, flash mob on movies simply doesn't work, let alone twice. Flash mob is cool in real life, but in movies it's just a cliche, because in movies people burst into songs and dances all the time, been done a thousand times before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Dull and the actors have no chemistry","review":"This movie was just so dull and boring. The only scene I liked was the flash mob scene. Neither one of these actors could pull it off, and they don't have chemistry. Big thumbs down on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic","review":"Young attractive people just out of tedious relationships...check. Complaining how complicated love is...check.

It's magically forgotten after prescribed days of soul searching...check."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD case came destroyed","review":"When I received the DVD in the mail, the plastic DVD case was completely destroyed. The whole top half of the case was in 20+ pieces and a crack went down the side casing. The DVD was unharmed but if better packaging and handling measure had been taken, I would also have a case for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry met Sally it's not","review":"Tries too hard to be the next When Harry Met Sally with its quick-fire dialogue, which pales in comparison. Hard to like either of them until much later in the movie when they become more like human beings rather than dialogue robots. Her eyes are too big and catlike - looks unnatural. You should know already that this is not a family movie, but just in case ... It's not.Moderately entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Familiarity Breeds Enjoyment","review":"I went into this flick with real trepidition. Hadn't this territory been explored previously in that cynical exercise \\"No Strings Attached\\" where the principals had zero chemistry? Never fear this film is at turns witty, sexy, and funny. The chemistry between stars Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake is not only palpable but infectuous. They are ably supported by a terrific supporting cast that includes Patricia Clarkson, Woody Harrelson, Jenna Elfman, and especially Richard Jenkins who does a terrific turn as Timberlake's father with early stage Alzheimers. Just because a theme has been tackled before, usually poorly, doesn't mean they won't eventually get it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"For some reason, I'm still trying to grasp the fact that Justin Timberlake is testing out the acting scene. He's not bad, I just think *NSYNC when I see him, Mila is great in everything she does and definitely helps make the movie. It's mostly funny but of course needs the cheesy RomCom ending, but I still liked it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chick Flick","review":"I could watch this movie 100 times and still laugh like its the first time. Very cute and entertaining. Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake play off of each other well. I would definitely recommend this for a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copied No Strings Attached","review":"Its pretty much a remake of no strings attached, but boring and dull. Compare the movies, its the same concept. The only diffrence is that no strings attached is intresting and origial, while friends with benefits is a cliche'."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute waste of time & money","review":"This had to have been one of the most dreadful films I have seen in years.Where does one begin? The situation was highly implausible and not even remotely funny.The writing was absolute garbage. Do not waste your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butt Double.....","review":"This is a very predictable love story about two obnoxious people that claim they just want to be friends. We all know where this is going. The only reason to see this is to get a glimpse of Mila Kunis naked. But all you get is some side boob and a butt double. I want my money back. Ripoff!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Gotta be the worst video stream on Amazon. And to think I switched from NetFlix for this? Regarding the movie content, it's what one would expect from Timberlake. Wish he could find some depth of character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Characters were not realistic, the conversations between them were ridiculous. Many scenes were crude and meant for cheap shock for laugh value. If you like to see Justin's butt over and over then you will not be disappointed. The movie only made me chuckle softly once or twice. Overall waste of my 1 hour and fifty minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO FUNNY, A+ Movie for Comedy/Romance","review":"I was skeptical to watch this, because I hated No Strings Attached--a movie with a similar plot line. OMG. Friends with Benefits is so much better and such a great movie. It has two great actors in lead roles, and not just that, but the diologue is so punchy, funny, and well-done, it leaves you craving more. Is the plot itself semi-predictable? Sure. But the scenery, acting, and words make up for it. It has a level of reality that few films on this topic have. Also, it is obscene without pushing the envelope (cursing, brief nudity), but the focus on the film is on two people figuring themselves (and family drama) out. If you are even slightly curious about this movie, trust the good reviews on here and watch it. You will NOT regret it. A+++++"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"Not a very good movie. Predictable & lame plot. We had to force ourselves to continue watching. Acting was not very good and was not believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than \\"No Strings Attached\\"","review":"Loved Mila Kunis && Justin Timberlake was actually a really funny actor. This movie follows the same cliche plot line as most romantic comedies. HOWEVER, it also taught me multiple lessons. I laughed throughout the entire movie and I learned a couple of things. AND hey... seeing Justin Timberlake's butt a couple of times really didn't hurt my review of 5 stars. I would def. rent this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quality Romantic Comedy","review":"This was one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in years and I'm pretty critical of them. Not Corny. Solid Acting. Fun cultural references. And they deal with some tough real life issues (not talking about sex/relationship stuff) in a poignant way, without being too depressing. There is, as expected, a lot of sex, but they dealt with those scenes in a tasteful, funny, realistic way. If you enjoy romantic comedies, but have high standards for them, this won't disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun movie","review":"I remember cracking on J.T. when he was in N Sync, but he has grown into a very entertaining actor. I LOVE his appearances on SNL! Of course Mila is beautiful and entertaining as well. I have been a fan of hers since That 70's Show. This is a fun, kinda sexy movie that both myself and my girlfriend enjoyed. Two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things to consider in a relationship","review":"This video was pretty good. The plot was good and engaging. I knew how it was going to end up, so no surprises there. The chemistry between the two was believable and the preformances were great. Didn't care for the ending. Felt they could have come up with something better than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Rom-com","review":"This was a funny feel-good Romantic Comedy. No surprises, but it kept me entertained.Great chemistry between JT and Mila Kunis. I really like both of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good, completely engaging","review":"Surprisingly good. The broad arch of the story is routine and predictable but the details are well-defined, well-written, interesting, and delivered with conviction and credibility by a top notch cast. I was completely engaged from start to finish. I even teared up right on cue. Damn them for manipulating my emotions so well.Oh, wait, that's their job.Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross Sex - that's pretty much the entire movie","review":"This movie was too vulgar. There was constant sex, and it was not even \\"sexy\\". It was just stupid and gross. Wouldn't ever watch it again. actress annoys me too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movine is predictable and very boring","review":"Not funny. Great actors bad movie role. Got this movie because family in town visiting wanted to see it. Bad mistake especially since I bought it. I wish it had a been available for rental instead.It wasn't even cheesy. It just really sucked!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Love Love this movie!","review":"I am borderline obsessed with this movie! I have seen it so many times. I have it on DVD, DVR and my Kindle Fire and it is still funny after about 50 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't I just see this movie?","review":"Oh yea...\\"No Strings Attached\\". Mila vs. Natalie? Natalie hands down. If it hadn't just been done, this would have been a cute romantic comedy. Justin Timberlake plays the character well, but I can just imagine that he is actually like this. Ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"it was a great gift for my nephew and scored lots of good uncle points with this now i just have to watch it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, incredibly shallow.","review":"Justin is a usual bore and Mila is plain annoying, with plenty of sarcastic, dry banter that's not really funny. The plot is very shallow and contrived, and it feels like the movie was sort of done for the heck of it and nobody really gave too much cr@p. Boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"If you are purchasing this to put the digital copy on anything else, don't bother. The company will not allow for the digital copy to go in iTunes at all. It will only work with the Sony download on your computer. The company was no help either. I will not purchase any DVDs from here again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? Why?","review":"Slow-moving. Not funny. Watched first 20 minutes. Couldn't take it anymore. Got to the point when Justin took door off his office to tell his new staff that his door is \\"always open\\". Oh brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"I usually love romantic comdies but not this one...","review":"This felt so predictable and lacked any great acting; it felt like I'd seen a version of this movie many times before. There was nothing overly humorous, new, or unique about this movie so doesn't stand out in terms of romantic comedy titles"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and No Chemistry","review":"Stopped watching after 30 minutes. Would have stopped it earlier but gave it a chance. Acting seemed so forced and there was absolutely no chemistry. Don't waste your time or money - I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Movie!","review":"I cannot believe Justin Timberlake has not given up acting! This movie is dull and you will get bored immediately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No digital copy","review":"I purchased two Sony movies this past week, and this movie was one of them. However, neither contained the Ultraviolet digital copy code advertised on their covers. There was no paper insert or sticker. I will have to return this and hopefully the code won't be missing from the replacement. If you peruse the Amazon reviews, this appears to be a common problem. Shame on Sony for this, as well as for the decision to go with Ultraviolet instead of the easy-to-use iTunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"sleeper","review":"I rented this movie because of the positive reviews, and found it to be a waste of time to watch. I rarely post reviews, but had to do it this time to offer another point of view. Uninteresting storyline - it has been done sooo many times. The characters are cartoonish and use profanity for impact. Unartistic use of nudity and tasteless toilet humor. This movie has no redeeming aspects to speak about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blues singer from the 20's....","review":"Clara Smith had the prettiest voice of all the classic blues shouters of the roarin' 20's. She took most of her songs with a slow tempo, a very dicty singer with a clear voice. This cd has her earlist sessions backed by many great JAZZ musicians of the era... Highly recommended especially to classic jazz and blues fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choice","review":"The worst epilator I have ever had. Really. It just doesn't work at all, maybe it would only on really long and thick hair. On mine it just didn't do anything. Unbelievable, but true. I tried it for 15 minutes and maybe got only couple hair out, I just kept scrubing my leg with it, but not for good at all. I'm really dissapointed and have wasted my money for totally nothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try a little too much \\"nude\\" and way too little \\"lawyer\\"!","review":"I can imagine what you would expect buying a movie with a name like \\"NUDE LAWYERS\\". But, quite frankly, it is far from that! In fact, actual courtroom footage is rare and I was not thoroughly convinced that these people were at all lawyers. In any effect, this movie does have some salvagable features. The set design is very accurate and dialouge is imaginative and well written. With a few alterations this movie could have been big. I'm talking box office gold. Sequels and merchandise, an amazing spectacle of American filmaking. Except for the fact that this movie isnt really good. At all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Fun, Fun","review":"This movie was a quick paced lighthearted enactment of a young lady addressing her sexuality. Work, a close brother, friends, acquaintances all interact perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bland","review":"The dialogue in this movie sucks. It is either not funny or extremely cliche. It could have turned out so much better with the general plot of the movie but it was a huge turndown for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Coming-Out Movies Ever!","review":"There's a lot to choose from, unfortunately, when talk turns to bad lesbian movies. But even, say \\"Claire of the Moon,\\" which I found ponderous at best, had good intentions and a decent sex scene. This movie has one kiss that one of the people involved doesn't even remember.The idea had potential and the cast is good, but the story reels from one fake and ridiculous setup to the next. Do yourself a favor and see \\"Imagine Me & You\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Fontanetta","review":"This is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If no stars was an option, I would have selected this. I think 1 star is giving it too much credibility. It was very unfunny. Don't waste your money. This movie is probably the reason Tom Brady is no longer with Bridget Moynahan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Acting is nobodies friend","review":"I hate to do this to Alan Cumming because he's a great actor and he is, like always great in his character for this movie. But his acting alone could not carry this movie. The characters in this film are completely flat. Watching this movie you keep waiting for it to actually /start/. For the acting to begin, for you to actually start caring what's going on. For SOMETHING! But it never does. Instead you get a whole movie over acted angst. And then in the last 10 minutes are so, something worthwhile happens and then the movie is over.Honestly, if you're dead set on watching this movie rent it. Other wise, you'll hate yourself when at the end of the movie your one thought is... \\"Rachel Shelly is gorgeous.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"cute","review":"This is a cute movie. A little far fetched, but fun to watch. This IS NOT a lesbian love story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled and disappointing","review":"The story of the remarkable woman who came up with the London A-Z map is well worth telling. From a traumatic upbringing, Phyllis Pearsall became a one-woman cartographic dynamo who worked tirelessly well into her 80s.Unfortunately, this book is muddled, amatuerish and disappointing, reading more like a self-published book than one from a respectable mainstream publisher. The structure is all over the place and the copyediting woeful."},{"rating":"2","title":"This SACD is very good","review":"All of the music this SACD is very good. I like very much of the celtic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice for a padded bag","review":"This bag is just right for my elementary school aged daughter to keep and carry her short scale bass to lessons in. Smelled very chemically straight out of the package, but once it aired out, the odor is no longer a problem.The box that the item arrived in was a bit beat up, and half of the tape was coming off, maybe even cut, leaving the item to easily fall out. The delivery guy commented that the box says \\"rate this package\\" in large type on the side of the box. HA! I give the shipping package one star.Overall, this will be a fantastic case/bag for my daughter's bass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bag!","review":"Excellent Bag!

I only expected a medium quality for the price but its a great buy. It's very well. Padded and the zippers are really big and hold up really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bare minimum if you have a cheap bass","review":"This is a poor example of a protective case. I am only going to use it for transporting my bass in the car and then being VERY careful handling it. It gives very little if any real protection for an instrument. If you have an expensive bass, buy a different case, preferably a hardshell case and you won't have to worry like you would if you purchased this one.

If they cleaned it up just a lil I know lots more would be able to enjoy it.My Favorite joke was from George Lopez bout the Jack in the Box employee's and the white people trying to order, my goodness that was hilarious!! George Lopez's performance was the best hands down! Every mexican/chicano can relate to all the jokes, i was literally on the floor laughing.

The first 17/18 of the book were all about a faerie prince trying to stop a glue factory, while trying to get out of the human world and into his own. Even that last 1/18 of story barely comes close to touching on the (impending) war. The story is split three ways, which makes it hard to feel any suspense whatsoever. The cliffhangers feel more like annoying stops in the story. The book is fairly well written, keeping you craving more. I couldn't stop reading (mainly because I was waiting for the war). Although it was recommend from a couple of big newspapers, I felt it was mediocre. The writing seemed dumbed down for kids, along with the plot, albeit, not as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Faerie Book Ever","review":"Before I start I better tell you that I only got about fifty pages into this before I called it quits and read a real book. After reading The Iron Fey series, Wings Series, and the Faeriewalker series this book just couldn't even come close. I tried, and I mean realllly tried to get into this book but there was nothing to keep me interested. I could just not like the book because normally Faerie books don't appeal to me but then again I've read some really amazing ones that I couldn't put done and some I've even enjoyed so much that I re-read several times. This is not one of those books. I wouldn't recommend this ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids","review":"I cannot believe this is marketed torward kids.

It had such a low moral attitude and promotes that \\"all the girls are dabbling in it\\" like it is just a normal thing for a young woman to be gay! Yuck!

And I am not an immature 16, I read A LOT. I'd say this book is enjoyable from sixth grade all the way up to twelfth...if not higher. Even adults who love fantasy will be engrossed in this witty and compelling book. I fell in love with the characters almost at once; the moment I openned the book and read the first few lines, I was hooked. I read it in 2 days. It would have been less, but I read it at Borders, and I was only there for a few hourse each day. I wont get into the characters, although they were just awesome, because you already have reviews talking about the story. I meerly wanted to point out that this book can be enjoyed by those older than eighth grade, as the way it is written is by no means simple, and the story is a real winner. Take it from a sixteen year old female voracious reader. :-D Thanks for reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"A fast-paced book that draws you in and keeps you hooked.

There is literally a tab space between every word. Yes, every single word. This is the first book out of well over a hundred that I have downloaded with this problem. Thank goodness I did not pay more for it otherwise I would be screaming with frustration. So if you plan on reading this on a Kindle Fire, I would think twice before buying or at least try out the sample first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little to no plot...yawn","review":"I decided to give Faerie Wars a try after reading Wicked Lovely and Ink Exchange. This book didn't wow me in any way. Faerie Wars starts off with a bang. The son of the emperor of light faeries is on the run after stealing a Pheonix, he stumbles upon a secret, gets captured and escapes a few times, just to be scolded and exiled by his father. Then it goes down hill. We meet the human and hear about his problems while a sister searches for her lost brother. There is some sort of war looming in the background, but it stays mostly in the background. I do not think this book is dark in any way. It is DEFINITELY a KIDS book. I can't quite put my finger on why I don't like this book, it is a great setup for a story, but the execution is boring to me. Not much really happens in this book, maybe it will get better, I may give the other books in the series a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT!!!!!","review":"I bought this book thinking, \\"hey, its sorta like Artemis Fowl, right?

Maybe my expetations were too high or something like that but this book really dissapointed me. If you're really set on reading this get it from the library first. Don't make the mistake I did by buying a book you'll end up hating. It might of been the air of satanisim around the whole thing that made me hate it but maybe its just me. If you want a good read, read the Artemis Fowl series or something by Ben Jeapes. Just remember TAKE IT OUT OF THE LIBRARY FIRST!!! I don't want anyone to waste almost $20 on this like me. This goes for any book one has read a lot of controversial reviews about. For potential buyers of Faerie Wars, heed my warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good if you live in a windy area","review":"I bought this for \\"1\\" party.

The tent came down, we secured it up, once it couldn't pull up it twisted like a pretzel, velcro ripped, bars bent. It was really nice looking when we put it up, just make sure if you are getting it, it's not going to be really windy at ANY point, as it would be fine and then a gust would come and it's over.

On the plus side I paid $200.00 for it and that makes it less then half the price of the comparable hilti. It's also cheaper then the comparable Bosch.

Any viewer who did not feel that their intelligence was severely insulted by this nonsense must be as retarded as the girl was.

How anyone keeps giving Dario money to churn out this cornball rubbish is beyond me. I am a loyal horror fan but this franchise has lost me.

I actually have been wanting to see this for some time, but now wish I never even bothered. The story was beyond weak as was the acting. The only scary factor was how the main idiot could fall for such a beastly looking mess like Jennifer. Even if she had a nice body it still doesn't change the fact that her face looks like it got hit by a mac truck and she has no means of communication. Not to mention she eats people and house cats!

The guy she was with in the beginning didn't look like a homeless man to me-he looked like your average professional. Yet, he was repeatedly referred to as \\"homeless\\" and a \\"derelict\\". As the movie went on holes in the script annoyingly showed themselves. One minute Spivey is a police officer, the next he's unemployed and setting Jenifer up in an abandoned cabin in the woods.

It is undeniably disturbing, but to what purpose? Despite her spectacular body, I was unable to understand why Spivey and so many other men apparently feel so protective of her since her habits and her face are so thoroughly repulsive. Perhaps it was the point that the nature of the human male is such that he is willing to overlook a great deal in order to have ready sexual access to a magnificent female form. However, the atmosphere of this film is so unrelentingly grim that it is difficult to credit director Dario Argento with any satiric intent. The result is a string of gross-out moments with little discernable purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gruesome...not what you'd expect from a Steve Weber/Argento collaboration","review":"Believe it or not, Steven Weber wrote the screenplay for this installment. I feared that Argento would go soft because of this (considering all the lame Stephen King tv adaptations Weber has done)...but this is all out nasty stuff. It's important to note that none of Argento's magic camera work or unique perspectives are present--it's all straightforward, but this tale of a man trying to care for a grossly mutated young women with a killer body, who SEEMS pathetic and victimized, makes for a perfect short film.

There's only a toning move every 10 minutes or so! So, if you're looking for real toning or exercise, this is not it; maybe okay for relaxing, but I was really bored and frustrated listening to her talk about breathing instead of actually doing anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this dvd - great for back pain, strengthening, flexibility","review":"This is great because it divides your exercise session into 2- 30 min. workouts in case you can't devote a full hour. I broke my first dvd so this is a replacement.At a point, i developed persistent back pain that awakened me each time i changed position in bed @ night; after 1-2 wks of working out to this dvd, my back pain disappeared and had not returned after 2 yrs.this workout combines the meditative and flexibility aspects of yoga w/ the strenghening and muscle toning of pilates"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really relaxing but thorough workout","review":"I've had this video for 5+? years now and I still love it. I'll admit the time she spends explaining things can get annoying once you've memorized it, but I just forward through the breathing exercises and crap like that to get to the poses I want. Overall this is a great video and worth it at $5-$7 especially if you're looking to tone your body and become more flexible. I will agree with the other reviewers in that after a while her voice does start to creep you out, but at the same time she's so calm and happy that it's really soothing...I completely disagree that this is a total waste, it's a good workout, give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to my workout DVD library....","review":"This is a good all-around workout with relaxation techniques. It works all areas and incorporates breathing & excellent stretching for all-over toning. No cardio - which is fine, I use Louise's DVD as a after-work relaxing workout and do separate cardio training. Great for beginners and still challenging for the experienced yoga/pilates combo exerciser. I have used many different yoga, pilates and combo DVD workouts and this is one of my favorites so I had to purchase it for my permanent collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring","review":"I found this video to be too slow and too boring. I did the ab section first and I almost fell asleep waiting for her to stop talking and start working. I understand that Yoga is to be peaceful and slow, but this was way beyond slow. It was a drag! I wouldn't recommend this video to my worst enemy. Buy this video if you need something to help you fall asleep on your yoga mat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I knew the reviews were mixed, but I wanted to give it a try.

My old (genuine) bottle, had small bursts, spraying less volume.2. The smell of the cologne smells too alcoholic3. The scent wears off within minutes ! That's right...I spary it 10 times, after 2 mins, I can barely smell it on myself !With my old bottle, the scent would last the whole day, atleast !

I received my product very quickly. I will definitely order from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the information is here","review":"I disagree with some of the other reviews. All the information that you need to pass the exam is in this book. The questions on the exam are worded in a way that you must have a good understanding and recall of the chapters. For example, the book gives you the specifications for Thicknet (cable thickness, length, how it's used), but the questions aren't as simple as \\"How thick is Thicknet cable?\\". So don't expect those kinds of questions. But I didn't see one question on the exam (which I passed on 1st try) that wasn't based on information available in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"NETWORKING ESSENTIALS FOR REVIEW FOR MCSE","review":"I think this book is a good condensed reference guide for studying the major topics for MCSE Certification, but I would rather have another book on Networking Essentials for studying the topics of Networking Essentials with drill exercises on terminology and review like Sybex's MCSE STUDY GUIDE: NETWORK ESSENTIALS, 2ED. I own 3 books in the New Riders' series of Certification books, and I admit that New Riders is a good publisher of CNA/CNE & MCSE Certification handbooks, but I feel their books are more for intermediate/advanced users rather than novice/intermediate users like myself. I find the testprep software is a good tool for studying for the Net. Essentials exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for MCSE exam","review":"This book will not help you pass the exam.

It's just that compared to the other PPG dvds, this seems to be a seasonal rip-off. Even the \\"Meet the Beat-Alls\\" dvd had other episodes on it.Like I said, the Christmas story is good, it has a good storyline and is well thought out. This could well be the best Princess adventure of the Powerpuff Girls. There is a good visual joke where the makers of the cartoon are on Santa's permanantly bad list. Even Mojo Jojo has a brief cameo.The one thing you have to ask yourselves before you buy is \\"is one 45 minute episode worth paying for\\". There is a Dexter's Lab Christmas story in the bonus section, but I bought this dvd for the PPG not Dexter. There are also 2 songs here, the \\"We Three Girls\\" song is good, but again I'd prefer more adventures.To sum it up, if you are willing to pay for one (admittedly good) adventure, great, buy the dvd. If not, save your money and tape it when it's shown on Cartoon Network."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard case too thick","review":"Case was too thick so was almost impossible to work controls.Clip slides up and down too easy, would not use when running.Screen Protector was only plus as it was easy to install."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand bou siiw","review":"Gaagni, Xawma ndax grand bi dal na fii waaye woolu na \\"le plus grand ambianceur\\" dou deuggue ?

They taste good to me, but I will not reorder and am disappointed the reviews led me in the wrong direction.So, I give a low review because I hope it will cause others to read the review and know this item is not vegan, as suggested and as searched.

However, these cookies have an overwhelming fruity aroma, smell and taste, that I found hard to like and even swallow. I'm guessing it might be the prune puree in the ingredients. Oh and there were a disappointing number of chocolate chips in them - one cookie had two small chocolate chunks. With no chocolate to compensate for the fruity aroma - 2 stars.However, I find these filling and better with a big cup of coffee.

I must congratulate him on finishing the book in one week. More seriously, the book provides enough coverage of commutative algebra,Galois theory and homological algebra as to enable one to tackle the books by Eisenbud and Hartshorne on commutative algebra and algebraic geometry respectively.There are rival treatments by Cohn and Jacobsen but Lang beats them for conciseness.Lang is notorious for errors and omissions in his books and so one would expect a reader to have considerable 'maturity', i.e. the ability to correct proofs or fill in missing details."},{"rating":"2","title":"encyclopediac and brutal","review":"This book is like an encyclopia -- very thorough, but also somewhat inaccessable to those who don't already know the language and terms it uses.

I will certainly never use it to teach a course myself. I found the text to be very poorly written. There are not enough examples and his proofs are sloppy. I frequently found myself going to my old undergraduate books to look up clear explanations of easy theorems and also refering to Hungerford's Algebra book which is very complete.I have now taught the standard graduate algebra course quite happily using Dummit and Foote's Abstract Algebra which is a much better choice than Lang's Algebra.In conclusion, I think the title of Lang's Algebra should be \\"Algebra Made Difficult\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Text, Poor Reference","review":"The only thing that comes through cleary in this book is the author's arrogance. The reader will get a very good sense that Lang understands the material, but the reader will also get the sense that there must be a better book out there. Even as a reference, this book is lacking. The index is incomplete, and many important concepts are either poorly defined or the relevant equivalent definitions are not given. Finally, the order in which the material is presented is haphazard at best. This is truly a text only for those with a Ph.D. who work primarily in the field of Algebra."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's compact but where's the plus?","review":"I'm disappointed with this vacuum and will be returning it. I bought it to do bare floors, under furniture, and places that I can't reach with an upright. It doesn't pick up the layer of dust that covers my hardwood floors. It doesn't seem powerful enough to remove dust from my oriental carpets. The upholstery/crevice tool has no brush and must be held at a certain angle to produce the suction which can be aggravating. The floor tool also has to be at a certain angle to provide the proper suction which can be difficult when trying to clean under the sofa and other furniture. I can't find a dusting brush to fit the wand and I really wanted a small lightweight compact to dust things with. Oh well, you'd probably have to hold that at the exact right angle also. It is lightweight and quiet but who cares if you can't really clean with it. Also, I haven't measured the cord but it sure doesn't seem like it's coming out 17 ft, maybe it's stuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"My husband ordered this as it was one of his favorite Shirley Temple movies.

I had previously purchased Elizabeth Castro's book in this series, on HTML4. This was very good introduction for a beginner in HTML, and I expected the same would be true of the Photoshop edition. Unfortunately, it is not an appropriate book for me, as the approach and examples were not clear enough for self study. It is not clear if this is due to the complexity of Photoshop, or the approach adopted by the authors. I am now looking (warily) for an alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only it was a guide","review":"While this book does go through the fundamentals of photoshop, it does little to actually guide you through. It makes the same mistake that so many tutorial books do; it tells you what to do but then does not explain why, when or how it works at all.

I tried this ice tea maker hoping it would make my effort a little less. No dice.The problem is the stupid plastic filter. My loose tea leaves get stuck in about a quarter of the filter holes, and WON'T rinse out. So how do I clean it? I have to take a toothpick and INDIVIDUALLY poke out the tea leaves from the filter holes. Annoyingly time consuming and a royal pain in the a__.The pitcher itself is slim so it does fit in the fridge nicely. I went back to the old way of making ice tea because this thing does not really save any time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product but wish it was made with a different plastic","review":"This iced tea maker would have been perfect, but when it arrived I looked at what plastic it was made of and saw it was a #7 which I'm trying to avoid because of concerns about BPA. Bodum does say on their website that most of their products do not contain BPA - http://www.bodumusa.com/shop/pdf/BodumPC-BPAStatement(May2008).pdf, including the items they make that are labeled with a 7. So I suspect this product is fine, but the whole issue is pretty complicated so I chose to return it. I would be thrilled if Bodum would make this product with a different plastic because despite their statement, #7 plastics are getting a bad rap these days, so it would be a good move to just stay away from it. Even better, make it in glass!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for loose leaf teas","review":"While the infuser makes it easy to remove teabags from the pitcher after brewing, it is NOT suitable for loose leaf teas! The holes are too large and allow leaves to pass through and into the main chamber of the pitcher. Other users mention \\"a few floaters\\" and simply needing to be careful with the last sip, but I ended up with a TON of them. They are even more problematic if you do not finish the tea within the hour; the remaining leaf bits continue to impart tannins and a more bitter flavor. If you want to brew loose leaf teas, I suggest using a french press and then pouring THAT into another pitcher and adding any desired sweetener and ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"It is very small. Which was fine with us since it is only 2 of us. Within 1 use the removable Infuser was cracked at the top. Still usable but annoying. By the third use it is not cracked on the body of the pitcher where the handle bonds with the body. Now it leaks all over and is un-usable. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many floaters","review":"This is a pretty little pitcher, just the size I thought it would be, good for 2 people. I got it to make thai tea, which is loose and a bit of a mess to make a pitcher of it otherwise. So I was looking forward to having the removable filter to make this process easier, but there was way too much loose tea floating in the pitcher that got through the filter. It may not bother some, but it looked dirty and cloudy, not nice for thai tea (or any tea in my opinion - I made the sample loose tea it came with, turned out cloudy and unappealing looking). Now after I brew it, I pour it through a coffee filter inside of a mesh strainer into glasses before drinking, and then it's fine, but I didn't think I'd need that extra equipment. It is pretty to see the process of tea infusing in the clear pitcher, and I can definitely use it with tea bags or for fruit infused water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I love lemon water, so it's perfect. Although let's be honest little tea bits do get through the strainer, but not enough that it ruins the batch. I would just be careful with the last sip.This size is perfect for a small fridge. It pours about 12 glasses in one batch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller than I thought!","review":"This is tiny. Maybe it will make ice tea for two- but not for a family.

So I figured out who it was.Why have I not heard of them before? I love it. I'm not going to try and classify it, except to say that it's angry-fem-rock-ish...but wonderfully, wonderfully good. It's INTERESTING sounding, fun to sing, melodic, and the kind of music you are dying to hear in concert. It could also be described (with absolutely no anachronistic connotations) by the word \\"groovy\\" in that it's groove-able.

It grabs you by the ears and, shakily screaming, pours it heart and soul into you. It's a tight grip and there's no letting go.And yet, with all it's intensity, the music is full of beauty. Truth, whatever that may be, seems to linger and shimmer around the perfectly ragged edges. At times, you might find yourself misty-eyed without knowing why.I had the chance, years ago before I even knew who Sleater Kinney were, to see them in concert. After hearing One Beat I've never regretted more throwing that chance away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparatively Good","review":"Music seems pretty much a wasteland today. This cd is very well produced, at times great fun, and at times thought-provoking - but I think it's a step backward for the band.I highly recommend \\"Call the Doctor,\\" a great work of raw, passionate, intelligent punk rock. Sleater-Kinney has definitely changed since then. The question is: Are they maturing or just getting slicker and derivative?The vocal performances are imitative. They adopt the styles of a half-dozen female punk/new wave singers from the 80s - starting with Siouxie and the Banshees. Where is the true voice of Sleater-Kinney? What year is this, anyway - 1982 or 2002? The vocals are certainly well-executed, but the blatant imitation robs them of the power they could have.The song-writing is pretty strong - I like Combat Rock and Sympathy especially. It is a solid cd, well worth owning, but not Sleater-Kinney's best, and perhaps as another reviewer mentioned, the start of a downward spiral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressed Long-Time Fan","review":"It genuinely pains me to say this, but One Beat is a huge let down on many fronts. Sleater Kinney is one of my favorite bands and I still swear by Dig Me Out and The Hot Rock, but something has happened to the band that began with All Hands on the Bad One and has culminated in this album: theres a distinct lack of good melodies. Sure, One Beat has lots of energy, and they are tight and play really well, but apart from tracks 1 (title song) and 2 which are really good, the rest is filler. Lots of melodies that dont go anywhere to the point that I find myself fast forwarding track after track because I just cant take the lack of a decent tune. I should mention that I listened to the entire album 8 or 9 times before I wrote this review so as not to rush to judgement. I'm hoping that Sleater pulls out of this artistic rut and puts out another album worthy of their greatness like Dig or Hot Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riot Grrrls","review":"Sleater-Kinney have never sold out.

I love this band so much, they are the only people that matter in music right now!They are not only amazingly talented, but they are unafraid of speaking their minds about issues that need to be addressed. Pure energy, pure talent, pure brains!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Yet!","review":"If their were an award for best original anti-war activism songs/albums, this one should go down on the record for the current war in Bagdad. These GRRRL Rockers never miss a beat and keep the album rockin' with intense drums and zippy guitar strokes. The album is a fireball from 'one beat' to 'sympathy'. And, watch the lyrics on 'combat rock' and 'pristina.' Once again you have a band fearlessly unafraid to tell it like it is about war, sex, boys and girls, rape, non-conformity. This album can stand for more than one thing and will live far beyond the current political dilemma into almost every misunderstood kid's stereo in America, through all their personal meltdowns."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!","review":"Sleater Kinney rocks.I was introduced to them by a friend, and I have loved them ever since!They are loud and they can absolutely rock. No girly rock here, like the donnas. These girls give it their all.The guitars and drums in all their songs truly rock, and they are good.My favorite song on here is \\"One Beat\\". The lyrics are just great, and the vocals really bleed with emotion, but then again, so do all of Sleater Kinney's songs. The song kind of moves, and even the chorus has kind of, an exotic feel to it, and I love that.Anyway, tired of wannabe girl rockers? Get Sleater Kinney. Their sound is harsh, and it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im speechless!","review":"Lets be honest, no one really likes this band. Its all bandwagon, afraid of appearing stupid and unadventurous nonsense. If tame punk with Geddy Lee(of Rush great band)meets Diamanda Galas(great singer and composer) vocals is your cup of tea then by all means pick this up. But please there is far too much interesting music out there to waste your time with this. Check out Ash Ra Tempel, Robbie Basho, Scratch Acid, Boris, Dalek, and Borbetomagus instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing lingers like this cd, in my stereo!","review":"First off I'll say this album deserves twelve out of five stars. This is a shining rock masterpiece, from dare I say the greatest rock band in years. Sleater-Kinney's instrumental genius and spectacular politically charged lyrics, sang by the incredible voices of Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein (with Janet Weiss doing more of the 'backup' vocals). Of course every Sleater-Kinney album to date is astonishing, but 'One Beat' has something more, I feel it's their best album yet. Each song has it's own feel, beat, and message. Every song is great in it's own way but my favorites would be: 'Oh!', 'One Beat', 'Far Away', 'Sympathy', 'O2' and 'Lite-Rail Coyote'. I recommend this cd to everyone. I don't care if you hate rock music, you should buy this just to own a piece of pure musically genius. These girls are better than ever, and still going so strong!

Only two of songs on the CD sound vaguely familar to me, a long-time listener. And they are not even very good. This collection, in my opinion, is by no means the better material or that which you would hear most often on NPR. It's not bad. But it sounds like the second or third rate stuff compared to what is played on a daily or weekly basis. My guess is that NPR could not obtain licensing agreements for the better stuff.

Glad it came with a printer, because this camera is a piece of junk. I have never had shutter lag this horrible; you click the shutter button and you have to wait well more than 10 seconds before the thing actually takes the picture. The screen is jerky too, reminds me of watching video on a 24.4 baud modem. Horrible piece of equipment. DO NOT BUY THIS. Not even for a junky camera. It is not worth more than $10! Plus, at $10, I still wouldn't buy it. I purchased this for my 3 year old, and I'm even dissapointed for her how crapy it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"This camera is not remotely worth the money.

You will be much better off looking at another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy","review":"I work at an office store that sells this camera, and I've played with it some. It's junk. Pictures only turn out tolerably well if everything is just right. You can't be further away than maybe 15 feet, or closer than 10. The lighting also has to be just right, which drives me crazy. To dark, and the picture is black. A little to light, and the picture is a white blob.You can't actually use it in the real world, is what it amounts to. My old HP 735 takes far better pictures, and it's old and 3 megapixels.This camera is garbage. I'd say probably 1/3 to 1/2 get returned for store credit. The pictures are usually unrecognizable, and the camera is prone to breakage. People buy this looking for a cheap camera; it ain't worth it. Pay a little more, and get at least a low end Kodak or something. There is a reason this thing is so utterly cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible camera!","review":"I would expect better pictures from a $10 camera. We've only been able to get a couple of decent pictures after trying it out for a week. Way too bright with flash on inside and way too dark with flash off.

This show is one of the best on television. It began in 1997, and wasn't aired for a couple of years, until Cartoon Network began Adult Swim. Space Ghost is the footstone of that block of shows, and is a classic comedy. It's a washed superhero who was given one more chance, a talk showw in space. Along with Zorak and Moltar, Space ghost interviews his guests who are viewed through a T.V. screen. He is totally unaware, and many times does't even know who his guests are (which causes him to improvise, like asking, \\"Are you a leprechan?\\") The entire show is made of old clips of the '60's cartoon, which means you will see the same animation of the characters over and over, but that doesn't slow the show down. If you are asking yourself if this is worth buying, let me tell you, you will fall in love with this show after the first episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing DVD","review":"While Space Ghost Coast to Coast is a great show, this DVD is just plain disappointing.

I remember discovering this show on Cartoon Network years ago. My initial reaction was shock and bewilderment, but this was quickly replaced with amusement. It's a carefully constructed catastrophy of a talk show that is absurd, silly, caustic, and ultimately, inane. Somehow, it manages to lampoon talk shows and celebrity in a completely original and subversive way.The best thing about the show is the timing.

Although Conne Boswell's New Orleans filled vocals are spectacular, the sisters' harmonizing is amazing, their scat singing is wonderous.

It got even worse with the unit refusing to read ANY dvd only 3 weeks after I bought it. I took mine back for a refund but was curios & done some googling. It turns out the company that made these units cloned a Phillips recorder then went out of business just from wal mart pulling these from the store shelves.

Also, he likes to point out every single little bit of minutiae to the reader not allowing us to draw any conclusions on our own or use the context to get those details. The thing is that most of the time those bits of information are not even important to story, they simply serve to distract you.

The author fetishises weapons and their use but fails to convince the reader that he knows what he is talking about. A few feeble explanations are injected into the storyline as to why apparently normal schoolkids would instantly turn into rampaging psychopaths but that isnt allowed to interfere with the tedious and ineitable bodycount.There is minimal characterisation and no plot twists.You will never get back the time you waste reading this book.

Character growth in this story is almost obsolete; save for the one time Noriko actually gets a gun and reloads it(gasp!).It limps and staggers by simply offering the reader cliches and an overabundance of Mary-Sue's, weak or imbalanced women and one gay steroetype that I'm sure is as equally offensive. The book is hard to read not because of so many long words (that's sarcasm folks), but because of so many needless adjectives and sentences (Who needs to know what direction the object is pointing when he gives it to the boy?)The book does have some allegorical truth to it, but the authors writing killed it.

In this Dvd, all the women did was dance around a pole or move about on a table to cheesy music. Compared to any strip club that i have ever been in, these girls were very tame. If you are the type of person that likes women just dancing about doing nothing, then this movie is for you.

Highly recommended, especially considering the DVDs are loaded with bonus stuff. The only bad thing I can say is that the commentaries are only a few seconds long, and are not accessed by the menu. It is either an \\"angle\\" option or a \\"1 of 2 tracks\\" option, and these are not compatible with my not-so-awesome, built-in, very very basic DVD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coach Z is \\"deep-southern accented?\\"","review":"The Coach is so upper-midwestern, dude.

I would recommend you purchase the new 7th edition, to be released this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for all","review":"I liked it because firstly it's non-religious. Secondly, it features various scientists worldwide talking about the problems inherent in evolution theory - such as simple illustrations for how carbon and uranium dating work - and the assumptions that rest on them. It includes experimental data that describes and shows how rock layers actually form - throwing the whole \\"fossil\\" evidence used to support evolution theory into total disarray. You can see it for yourself how it works. While it does feel as if it has been made for a younger audience, adults who have seen it have often been quite stunned by it for the most part. My original copy also came with an insert listing the many credentials of those involved (some on an international scale - we're not talking about a few little nobodies). I lost my first copy in a fire and had a hard time getting it the first time but it was well worth it and I've ordered it again through Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How not to make a creationist video.","review":"With 1977 cinematography, and 1987 computer graphics, this item was thrown together by 1997. It somehow managed to win a Catholic award in Poland for that same year, but for the rest of the world, it didn't pass the smell test. This video blatantly confuses cross-bed strata with ordinary strata, fails to mention the importance of radio-isotopes in reference to uranium/lead radiometric dating, and outright lies about the samples taken by the Glomar Challenger. Despite all this, and my low star rating, I'm recommending everyone buy this video. It's good for a laugh or two, and is a lesson to all about just how far creationist propaganda will go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 5 scientists disagree with evolution?","review":"In this now 9 year old video, a mere 5 scientists voice their concerns with Evolutionary Theory.I would direct those of you who think 5 scientists is alot to the National Center for Science Education website - \\"http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=18\\" where they have Project Steve. Project Steve is a collection of ONLY scientists named Steve who agree with a statement endorsing Evolution. That is about 1% of all scientists. So far over 700 Steve's have signed it.If 700 Steve's agree evolution is a good science idea, why can't you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudoscience","review":"More rubbish by the religious right to misrepresent scientific fact. The video selects facts that support its assertions(poorly in most cases) and ignores a vast amount of others that refute the videos claims against evolution.

It will not tell the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Depressing, Somewhat Critical Look At The Beetle","review":"Everyone who is a fan of the VW Beetle knows of its Nazi sponsored origins. This video explores this aspect of VW history further. The most amazing thing is that it criticizes VW for not being fully willing to put its horrid origins on display and tell people of the horrible events in the Nazi controlled factory during WWII. VW, for its part, would rather focus on the Beetle's role in putting Germany back on the map, and giving people all over the world a chance to own a car at a time when few could. This video is NOT a history of the Beetle, it is a expose on the car's Nazi origins. And it's subtitle (seen only on the screen) \\"Heil Herbie\\" is a bit tasteless and unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great info","review":"This tells a very good story on the history of the car.

But it isn't nearly as complex or visually interesting as Azur & Asmar.One thing to consider, particularly if you are buying this for children -- is that this is not Disney. This animated film depicts an african village as you might expect to see it; most of the women are only partially dressed. If you are comfortable with this aspect then Kirikou is a fine film for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my 14 month old","review":"My 14 month old loved it. I thought it was cute.

This album sounds more like a cross between Bad Religion and Down by Law than it does the 'Can I Say' era of Dag Nasty. That's not to say that it's bad, the music on here is very good. However, if you're expecting vintage Dag Nasty, you might be disappointed. Featuring lots of mid-tempo songs and Dave mostly singing rather than screaming, sometimes you'd swear that Dave simply became the front man for Bad Religion and this was their next album. Brian's immistakeable guitar-playing is as strong as ever, but again, it's still different from the old days. However, traces of the old Dag Nasty can still be heard throughout the album, and it's very refreshing to hear a band rock like this again - hard and fast and oh so melodic. The 100 Punks hidden 12th track is also a welcome addition to the lineup. Despite the differences, this CD is definitely worth the purchase. Any fan of DC punk or just punk rock in general will find a great listen here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satire at its Best","review":"When I read Nervous People for a Russian Lit class I was overwhelmed by the absurd humor. There hasn't been a funnier, politically poignant and appealing satirist since Lewis Carrol or Jonathan Swift.Zoschenko etches out distinct parts of the Soviet landscape with hilarious spoofs, ridiculous characters and dark conclusions; Gogol would be proud.Despite the passing of time and demise of the Soviet Union the humor still survives. What's poking fun at Russians can easily be translated to the same for American government and bureaucracy.Admittedly this isn't for everyone. It's not all-age-encompassing like \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" or as current as PJ O'Rouke. Nevertheless it's worth a read for young and old adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than promised","review":"The description of the book was very accurate.

I bought this CD because I love \\"she\\" as soon as I heard it. Quite a talented man, seeing he did most of the music. I forget the number of songs (17?) so it's a long CD. Being a huge Queen fan, I found all of the \\"short\\" songs a great dedication to Queen, whether is was meant to be or not. You can close your eyes and swear it's Queen, from the harmonies right down to May's guitar sound. The bad part of these \\"short Queen\\" songs (1-2 minutes) is that THEY AREN'T LONG ENOUGHT !!! Like I said, being a Queen fan.....All in all, it's an entertaining CD. Fun to listen to. I would say it's a must have. However, if someone were to ask me if I had any negative reaction whatsoever, I believe the one exception may be the last song, mostly the long beginning of the song, leading up to the piano/vocals. But instead of passing judgement, I'll wait to see what others might have to say. Enjoy..........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a good introduction","review":"Its hard to find a good introduction to the life and teachings of Jesus and this book fills that gap. Stewart's book is dated (both in style and scholarship), but still very helpful. In brief, accessible chapters, he is able to convey a lot of content in a manner that is devotional as well as informational. I use this in a class setting and inevitably, people will report that he helped answer questions they have had and put together things they hadn't noticed before. Maybe someday someone will write a better book that covers the same material and serves the same purpose, but until then, this is still a good introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"To add depth and complexity","review":"Pickles like these can be very much an acquired taste, but once acquired, that taste can amount to an addiction, or even an obsession. These pickles can add an incredible depth and complexity to almost any dish.The one caveat concerns salt. If you are on a salt-restricted diet -- as many people with cardiac problems are -- these kinds of condiments pose obvious risks and take exceptional care to use safely.I spoke from memory and inaccurately in a late evauation of Deep's Hot Mango Chutney, so let me correct that here: 2 tablespoons contain 1400 mg sodium, while Priya Mixed Pickles, in the same amount, contain 1360.

I've been a fan of Ivy's for a while now and up until this point my favorite album was probably \\"Realistic.\\" But Ivy stretches their sound on this album; up-tempo songs like \\"Thinking About You\\" really aren't typical Ivy, but they really make it work. Songs like \\"Four in the Morning\\" and \\"Feel So Free\\" could easily be off any Ivy album. These clean, melodic, yet slightly somber songs are Ivy's home turf.So far, my favorite songs on this album are \\"Thinking About You\\" (they owe a lot to New Order's sound on \\"Republic\\" for this song) and \\"Ocean City Girl.\\" I haven't heard anything this catchy since Phoenix's \\"United\\" (I listened to \\"If I Ever Feel Better\\" for a year straight and never tired of it).\\"In The Clear\\" is a great album.

For example, a snide comment about Wharram cats spending time on the beach reveals her ignorance of the prime uses of shallow-draught multis.If you are already determined to go cruising in the exact same manner as Anne Hammick, this book will reinforce your decisions, but it lacks the balance and depth to be a serious work of reference. Could do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I enjoyed reading this book as the characters were likable and it was very easy to become emotionally involved in their lives.

She has interviewed many women from different generations but never specifies their number, background, age, class, or race. Thus all of her conclusions have a basis in fuzziness. Furthermore, she will generalize about a decade by turning to an example of a topic's treatment in a popular film, as if that treatment is parallel to someone's else account of their reality as a wife.

You manuver youreself though a searies of sinarios trying to put your country on top of the world. I liked the political aspects of the game combined with economic conditions.

With the game focased on economics there was a lot of needless war. Because the game was so hetic with no peace time you don't get to develop youre esponoge tatics as fully as you would like. Finally when things are starting to go youre way boom the game is over and you have won. Giving yourself no time to gloat over your acomplishments. Instead its off to more hetic elections.

If you've got a cell phone it's hard to justify spending much on a watch, but the price of this watch is so low that cost is not a problem. It's been very water-resistant and durable for me. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because the alarm could be a little louder; I've never used it as an alarm but I don't think it's loud enough to wake me unless it's right next to my ear. But overall it's a great watch; the only time you'll need another is when eventually (many years) the watch band breaks or the battery dies (it's probably cheaper to just buy a new one than to replace the battery)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio is always reliable.","review":"My husband has owned this watch forever---he works at construction projects so doesn't want to be wearing something pricey. What a deal this watch is-----he recently had to replace this watch with a duplicate one, not because the watch died but because the band finally tore away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Watch With a Bright Light","review":"My 14 year old son has had 3 of these watches. They now make the watch slightly different...they changed the light from the bright blue behind the numbers to an orangish light that lights from the left side. He really loves this watch and we are disappointed that it will no longer be availiable with the nice light. The only problem that we've had with this watch is that the band's aren't very sturdy. He fell and broke the first one and the second caught on something and tore off the side where the pin holds the band on, we're now on the 3rd. He's rough on them! Overall a very nice small watch for every day use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value","review":"You can't get a better watch for less than $15 dollars. Its small, slim and with 12 eyelets can fit any small to medium size wrist. It's a very simple, easy to use watch and the illumination function works excellent, although it doesn't \\"light up a room\\" like some reviewers claim. The watch is water resistant so it can take splashes without a problem. I shower with mine everyday and won't worry about wearing it in the pool this summer. The only improvement I could ask for is a louder alarm. I know it's not designed to wake a person up, but I still wish it could. Design-wise, well, it's nothing great. I like it, but I like nerdy things."},{"rating":"1","title":"The watch hinge is defective","review":"I bought this and upon wearing on my wrist, the hinge broke and the watch fell out of my hand. Apparently the rubber was cracked in the first place, broke and the little rod fell out. So I returned this back to the seller. There was no email to confirm return until I contacted them giving all kinds of excuses. Finally they said they will refund my money. But as of now I did not get any refund - not trust worthy seller. I was hoping to give them a chance but I waited over a month now and still didn't see any money refund back to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight, Water Resistant, Small Watch with great backlight","review":"This is a small watch that gets the job done and has a really bright light.

I like it, but the alarm sets itself on a lot, which can be annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Device","review":"I've been using the Illuminator for at least 20 years. It's light on the wrist, tells accurate time, has a stop watch and an alarm AND as an extra benefit can be illuminated for late-night time telling in the dark. The watch's \\"illuminator\\" is so strong it casts enough light in a dark room, tent or outdoors to see your way or to identify objects. It's cheap which means no tears shed when the battery wears out after a year or so or if it's lost (as has happened from time to time). I've been buying these for friends who, like me, view a watch as a tool rather than a piece of jewelry. My only caution is if you have a really large wrist, it may not fit. But, for $13 or $14 you can always give it to your kid. Great for guys who spend a lot of time outdoors for recreation or work. Durable and can take occasional immersions in water."},{"rating":"1","title":"not water resistant enough","review":"I just checked my account to see now I bought this watch in 2008 , so the warranty is gone and all i can share about this is that it failed the swim test earlier this year.. once the water droplets got in, the led numbers are broken and so this watch is no longer watched.. i'm going to be careful with what i buy as for water resistant versus waterproof,, there is a big difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"The product information of the Amazon site says the watch is water resistant to 330 feet (can withstand splashes, swimming, snorkeling, scuba diving).

I purchased the watch to wear when swimming. Seems like a bait and switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case did not last a year - junky","review":"This is a basic watch; it did what I expected it to, which was really to have an alarm instead of using my cell phone. It has a stopwatch but no countdown feature, which I sort of wanted, but oh well.The real problem is this watch is less than a year old and is already broken. I don't know what broke it but one morning I realized the bottom of the case near the strap pin cracked. I can still use the watch as an alarm but I can't wear it on my wrist. I won't be buying a new Casio after this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE CAREFUL WITH CASIO","review":"I have had a Casio watch for about a year and now the watchband needs replaced. I was informed by Walmart that they cannot replace a Casio watchband. I called Casio and they told me that as far as they know NO CASIO WATCHBAND CAN BE REPLACED BY A NORMAL WATCHBAND! I had to order a watchband from Casio and they had to know which model it was before I ordered it. Total price: $12.00 shipping, handling and sales tax included. I then asked the representative if instructions would be included because it was a different type of setup instead of pins. HE SAID THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO RECOMMEND TAKING THE BAND TO A JEWELER TO HAVE IT PUT ON!! PLEASE BEWARE OF THIS AS BANDS DO NOT LAST FOREVER!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a men's watch...","review":"...it is too small even for a skinny man's wrist!

Most of Lewis' all-performance videos reveal Jerry Lee, the high-powered, quintessential Country rocker. Here we get an unprecedented view of the Ferriday Fireball as boogie woogie master, balladeer, guitarist, philosopher and Gospel harmonist - plus the chance to see Jackie Wilson and Carl Perkins deliver excellent renditions of their hits, in addition to sister Linda Gail Lewis deliver the goods mightily on the incredible duet with big brother on \\"When You Wore A Tulip\\" (Tiny Tim's & the Three Stooges' versions really don't compare). Seriously, that show opener is a show stopper - it belongs in a Television time-capsule. A perfect performance! There are some \\"padded\\" spots with lesser known groups and performers, but American Music fans should know about this tape; Jerry Lee Lewis fans must own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Gradgrind taught Latin...","review":"This book is recommended for those who are more interested in charting and graphing sentences than learning Latin. The focus is primarily upon dismantling sentences and placing them on \\"kernal charts,\\" with little or no emphasis on reading. The \\"basic sentences\\" frequently contain material not yet covered. It is poorly glossed. In its favor, the book moves relatively slowly through paradigms, addressing the cases as need arises. And, if one works through the book, one is likely to accidently learn some Latin. However, the same end could be reached with almost any other book. I know half a dozen other languages, and have never seen a less efficient textbook. Like Gradgrind, the authors of this text seem hellbent on making certain that learning Latin is not tainted by pleasure. Despite wonderful instructors, this book left me with a dread of approaching Latin class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working After Two Months","review":"My iFM worked great on my iPod Photo. It was a convenient compact size, and had great FM reception even inside buildings. I also used it to record FM radio. I used it about two or three times per week for two months when suddenly the FM radio only received static. It simply stopped receiving FM. I ONLY used this FM receiver indoors at my health club, and never abused it in any way. Boo to Griffin for such a weak product."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice little tuner","review":"The really positive is the sensitivity of the tuner. It picks up distant stations better than _any_ of the portable players I have (Sonys and Panasonics.) I like to listen to NPR and classical stations - and in Santa Barbara, the only ones are many (60 plus) miles away. Also positive is that it's easy to use - I have the iPod photo.The downsides would be the long cord - it would have been nice to have a separate short cord also. It's a little awkward dialing stations - there's no fast way of going from one end of the FM spectrum to the other.Interesting about the recording comment of the prior poster, noting to convert to LINUX OS for better recording. I haven't tried recording with it yet. I wonder how one changes the OS and how that would affect the rest of the iPod.All in all, I am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak","review":"The Java Podz coffee pads do not fit well in the Senseo coffee maker.

As a matter of fact, a friend of mine has ordered it after seeing it on my wrist.Amazing value for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio Men's EFA119BK-1AV","review":"Excellent, very good quality, the glass is really tough and has great style in its design, I recommend it. so far met all my expectation"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH CASIO WATCHES!!","review":"I have had a Casio watch for about a year and now the watchband needs replaced. I was informed by Walmart that they cannot replace a Casio watchband. I called Casio and they told me that as far as they know NO CASIO WATCHBAND CAN BE REPLACED BY A NORMAL WATCHBAND! I had to order a watchband from Casio and they had to know which model it was before I ordered it. Total price: $12.00 shipping, handling and sales tax included. I then asked the representative if instructions would be included because it was a different type of setup instead of pins. HE SAID THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO RECOMMEND TAKING THE BAND TO A JEWELER TO HAVE IT PUT ON!! PLEASE BEWARE OF THIS AS BANDS DO NOT LAST FOREVER!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk.","review":"My wife bought this watch for me from Amazon 7 months ago. When I tried to switch from daylight savings time the center button was stuck making it impossible to change. Warranty is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard To Read Dial","review":"This is a handsome watch, but it is very hard to read the LCD displays. The instructions are necessary as there is nothing intuitive about setting the time and accessing all of its functions. The instructions that came with the watch are only readable with a magnifying glass (for those over the age of 39), as they are written in micro type. The watch band pulls hair out of my wrist, so I don't wear it. Overall I'd say this is a stylish watch, but it is a real dog as far as ergonomics are concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking, but a poor fit and watch band","review":"I bought this watch for casual wear to avoid damaging my more expensive watches. The watch works fine and looks OK, but I must say it has the worst band I have ever encountered. When sizing it, the individual links are very large which makes it tough to get an exact fit. As luck would have it, removing 3 links leaves the watch too loose and 4 links is a bit too tight. Another problem is the band catches on the hair on your wrist. Be prepared for a bald wrist and painful experience if you wear this watch everyday! I think in this price range, a rubber band will probably work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeniable Facts (Unbiased I hope)","review":"First and foremost--Digits cannot be seen in low light. I'm not talking about what most people think of as low light. I mean anything less than daylight. I have not been able to read the watch in conditions I could easily read a book.The hands cover the digits! More trouble than you might think.Hour hand is hard to see because it is red and has a hole in i--there is not enough contrast with the black face.Area of face is too small--about 3/4 inch across--There is room for a one and an eighth inch face.Thermometer is very accurate! But only if you take it off for a half hour to let it reach room temp.What does Edifice mean (as far as this watch goes)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch","review":"I have had this watch for a couple of weeks now so I feel I can fairly review it. First thing, yes the band sucks. It does pull out your hair when you first start to where it but now I'm used to it so it really does not bother me that much anymore. I wear this watch everyday and have not managed to scratch the face yet even though there have been some times I thought I should have. The watch looks great. I just like the look of the watch. The temperature seems to be within a +/- of 5 degrees which isn't too bad. If you're buying for temperature readings though get yourself a thermometer cause this thing isn't that accurate. All in all a great looking watch for the price and seems to be sturdy. One last minor complaint I have is that the watch backlight turns off to quickly and the hands on mine at least don't seem to glow in the dark for very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Watch, Lousy Thermometer","review":"If you're looking for a thermometer watch, I suggest you look elsewhere. Thw watch is heavy and seems well constructed but the thermometer feature lacks.

But for $50.00, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good watch","review":"this is a very good watch, but there are some things to complain!the temperature is measuring in your wrist, not the environment. if you want to see the real temperature, you have to dress it off and put in the put u want to find the temp. and wait around 20 min.the alarm is very simple and it rings just 10 sec.the other things i don't have anything to complain, very nice watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a nice watch","review":"I like this watch. The features of digital with an analogue appearance. I'm not sure if the thermometer works very well, even after \\"calibrating\\" it, but fine.

He likes the watch and wears it all the time now, (he was religiously wearing another casual watch from casio for close to 7 years or better)But I wanted to get him a dress watch. It did pull on his arm hair a little bit at first, but it wasn't bothersome enough for him to stop wearing it. The display can be hard to read at certain angles, but again nothing that was bothersome to him. And he's pretty picky about watches. He was excited that it told the temp. But it's not super accurate.... but kinda cool nonetheless. He likes that the analog display is controlled digitally too. I recommend this product for a guy who wants everything in a watch! I'm glad I got it for him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I really like this watch. Worth the money. As with anything though there could be some improvements.

Overall I'm really happy with it. Worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a watch if you like your arm hairs","review":"I would comment on the design of the watch but it is all pretty irrelevant to me.

The minor negatives I have are 1) the watch band pulls my arm hair endlessly, outch!! and 2) the hour and minute hands obscure the readouts but it's what I expected from this kind of design.

I was even able to remove 3 band links for adjustment myself (after watching a YouTube video on how to do it). However, after wearing it for a few days, under no extreme conditions, I was in my home & casually lowered my arm & the watch suddenly fell off my arm. It came apart where the band attaches to the watch itself. The spring loaded pin was not bent & there was no apparent damage. I was able to put it back together using the pin & it seemed secure. The wore it that day & into the next day. I had tugged on the band a little bit on both sides of the watch & it seemed secure. Well, later that day I again happened to casually lower my arm & it came apart again & fell off my arm.Up until the watch fell off I never touched the location where the band attached to the watch. The only place to remove the band links are at the the other ends of the band next to the clasp, and they're marked by arrows. I returned the watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"2 screws on the back of this watch came loose and the watch was ruined as my son took a shower.

Surprisingly I actually use the countdown and stopwatch (I didn't think I would).

Print quality looks to be the same as I am getting from my HP960Cse. The price is a bargain in anyone's book. No complaints here."},{"rating":"1","title":"loud and slow","review":"I got this printer free when I bought my new desktop for school. It prints very slowly, is very loud, and of poor quality. I have stopped using it to print papers because they looked very unprofessional and I did not like the look. It is a cheap printer, and I would only recommend it if you can not afford anything else (or it was free)."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute junk","review":"This is my second C40UX - the first one stopped feeding paper - luckily it was under warranty, so Epson sent me another one. Lo and behold, a few months later, the second broke with the same issue!It is true, you get what you pay for - it was free with my Dell. It makes me mad at Dell for shipping such a piece of junk - I should have taken the extra RAM option!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life span","review":"I bought this printer for Xmas 2001. Within four months it didn't want to let the ink through. I parked it for three months while I used my old printer, then tried it again and it worked fine. Today, (February 2003) I printed out a page and after it finished printing, a message came up telling me that parts in my printer need replacing and it now refuses to work. There was no indication of any problems. Only two months after the warranty is up and it is toast. For all the use I got out of it, it was not worth the money, and also not worth the money to send it away to have it fixed. Completely disposable!! and it didn't get all that much use."},{"rating":"1","title":"these printers \\"stink\\"","review":"I now have three of these ... printers at my store because they quickly run out of ink and have trouble installing new ones without running numerous clean processes which waste all the ink and force you to buy new cartridges. I installed new cartridges and the black worked fine but the color was missing lines and after about ten cleaning cycles the color started working but the black had run out of ink. Seems like a scam by Epson to sell ink cartridegs."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I received this printer free with my Sony Computer and it is the worst printer I've ever had the displeasure of using. Noisy print jobs and frequent paper jams make this little piece of work a source of great frustration. And to top it all off, the ink cartridge gives you very little bang for your buck.The Epson C40UX is the Pinto of printers, you're better off hiring a typing monkey because they both have the same amount of reliability and at least the monkey has the courtesy not to pretend to be able to do something it can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk printer, do not buy it","review":"I bought one from Dell but this printer runs out ink so quickly.

It made a noiselouder than my small honda generator. (It actually made me laugh every time it printed a page). It DID make quality prints, which surprised me.It had horrendous software, which made troubleshooting printing prob-lems almost impossible. It was VERY difficult to get to the ink cartridgessince they had to mechanically move into the correct position tochange them. Finally after 9 months it died. The drive belt would not stay attached to the print head.Please PLEASE I beg you, don't even get this printer free.

It's a collection of short stories focusing on the milestones of learning to fly the F-15. Unfortunately there is no depth to these 'stories' and all you see is irrelevant personal footage and lots of background commentary on what you've just seen. This combined with the over the top editing using short clips, lots of graphics and flash makes me think the director just didn't know about the process, and didn't have enough footage.Spend your money of Imax's \\"Fighter Pilot\\" for spectacular cinematography and great footage of aircraft or the PBS Documentary \\"Carrier\\" for a combination of the aircraft, ships, life at sea and stories of the sailors/aviators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - but badly executed!","review":"I bought this dvd series through Amazon a while ago now, and although I don't regret buying it, it really is quite a painful series to watch because of what has been done during the post-production process.The editing is truly shocking, with far too much stop/start, slow motion/fast forward bits added in for 'effect' - which in my honest opinion adds nothing of any value to the production. The aircraft and people are interesting enough, but the editors have ruined this series by trying to be far too clever for their own good.Borrow a copy from a friend or rent it at the local dvd store, and spend the money you've saved on buying a few beers to settle your nerves while watching this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I can only recommand this documentary! great photography, fantastic aeriel shots, very intersting. something you don't get to see every day. two thumbs up :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent addidition to any DVD library","review":"This DVD portrays a world we \\"civilians\\" have never been privy to. It's fascinating to see what the actual training is to become a fighter pilot: including the personal and professional stress these men and their families experience. There's no room for error when you're flying: one mistake can cost you your life. The footage includes, as promised, \\"never before seen\\" behind the scenes action and some amazing shots of actual airtime. Especially after 9/11, it's comforting to see the rigorous training these men undergo before they're allowed to call themselves fighter pilots.And besides, what kid hasn't dreamt of flying at Mach speed? This is a wonderful portrayal of the reality behind that dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best documentary ever on military aviators & planes","review":"This is an outstanding program from some of the most respected filmmakers of all time.

It has three discs and only after I tried a second DVD player did I discover that it skipped entire chapters. When I tried it on a new RCA portable DVD player, it would not work at all, just skipped around. It's trash and Amazon won't take it back because the original plastic wrap has been removed (which it has to be if you want to see it). What a stupid policy. And there's no way to contact anyone on their website.

You will enjoy if you suffer from schizophrenia or Attention Deficit Disorder, since no single video clip lasts for more than 1 second. Had this series been produced as a traditional documentary it would have been fascinating, but so much for that idea. I sat through three episodes before I could no longer stand it and turned it off. Thank God it was a rental. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD 1) you will regret it and 2) you will always hear me saying \\"I told you so!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many good reviews","review":"Great subject matter. Truly. But the worst editing possible. Period. I love anything to do with F-15s, and really wanted to like this, but could not. I watched all seven episodes and it just about broke my brain. It seemed like no scene was longer than about a second, and I'm not exaggerating. Tony Scott took the material for a great documentary and wrecked it with MTV-style editing for schizophrenics. It would be nice if someone recut this into a two hour great documentary, instead of 5+ hours of superficial, hard to watch garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This is the best DVD set!

Not only is some band putting out a comprehensive collection of their Peel Sessions, but it's a band I really like and already have one session of with the great John Peel, celebrating his 50th birthday on August 29, 1989.This boxset is everything I expected from it. Great recordings that document an extensive history of a legendary band. Spanning over 95 tracks and 12 complete sessions, this is a must have for any fan of The Wedding Present and a perfect starting point for someone stumbling across this while searching for John Peel.

It is a thorough and well documented (hundreds of footnotes !) scholarly study, based on primary sources, yet it reads very well. The reader accompanies the historian in his scientific work, examining old texts and coins and debating of possible hypotheses. The book assumes some knowledge of Roman history of the period, though: for example, the author alludes quickly to Severus Alexander and Elagabal without more information (the part on Septimius Severus is very developed). Also, some footnotes are in French or Ancient Greek, which may be difficult to read to some readers. Some parts, like the meticulous discussion of the borders of the province, are rather tedious. An interesting introduction to historical analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"VOC's galore..","review":"I bought two of these dividers for my space to try to break up my studio apartment.

I note they come direct from China which may/may not have a bearing on the substances used in manufacture.. Anyways, I therefore left them in my friend's garage for almost 2 months, and the smell seems to have mostly left, but I'm still not overly impressed.I would recommend anyone looking for a partition to consider the rice paper dividers over these, even without the smell.

Long gone have the days wherein Rod screamed about Hot legs or Tora! Tora! Tora! Out with the Boys. Nowadays he has settled down (new wife and probably new kids underway?) and that suits him just fine. He has discovered that not all artists have to be like Mick and Keith -who will probably die Rockin'- and the style he has committed to is just right. This album definitly proves him right. The fact that he has not contributed any song to this album says something about the man. He has found out that he is not a songwriter, just the singer. No less and no more but at the same time Rod proves why he his right not songwriting: His voice-impact is stronger than ever!! Ballad after ballad brings tears to my eyes; Tears of joy! Sam and Otis have finally found the singer that -like the three tenors- will be remembered for their terrific singing! Hats off mr. Stewart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate this CD lower I would...","review":"and I have the right to say that.

But Human has left me VERY disappointed...this CD is not cohesive, nor is it original, features NOT ONE of Rod's band members from the past...guys that have helped Rod sign his work even as he navigated on the edge of many musical trends. I have been thinking this for years but never thought I needed to say it publicly until now: Rod, honey. I love you. We all love you.

Is he a rocker (When We Were The New Boys)? Is he power rock ballad singer (Vagabond Heart)? Stewart not only re-discovers himself but hits a home run with \\"Human\\". He goes back to his roots and influences of Soul, R&B, and Motown to create a very rich and dynamic album. The title track pairs Stewart's gritty vocals with Slash's blistering guitar to create a unique piece of music. Stewart takes the Macy Gray penned \\"Smitten\\" and makes it his own. While \\"I Can't Deny It\\" is the most commercial and upbeat piece on the album, it is not his best work. There are many hidden gems on \\"Human\\" that you will enjoy discovering and savoring over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO","review":"In his extensive musical career, Rod Stewart tried almost every style of music and songs. In \\"Human\\" he take a shot at the Neo Soul which seems only logical.However, and for unexplainable reason to me, 2 songs fit well with Stewart's voice and his legendary career, and the rest can be simply called Trash.RS tried to release a modern and fresh album, instead he sounds older than he ever was.This album is in my personal musical collection since I am an old fan of this great artist however it would be unfair to recommend this album to anyone else than the hardcore fans who wish to hear Stewart's voice in a new set of songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST Rod Stewart Recording EVER!","review":"If you're expecting songs that are anything like \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\" or \\"Maggie May\\", stay FAR, FAR away from this one. I've got tons of Rod Stewart CDs, but after buying this one, I quickly rushed to the used CD store to sell it. Picture N'SYNC music with rod on vocals. Electronic drum loops and the whole mess. Rod is much better when he uses real musicians, who are playing real drums and real guitars. Avoid this CD like the plague, all ye who listen to classic Rod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rod is only Human","review":"This CD is not the Rod Stewart of old, but it is indeed Rod. I love that this CD is a little more mellow, but hey so is Rod, we cannot expect him to be able to prance around like a mad-man on all of his songs. I am glad he slowed it down a tad.
