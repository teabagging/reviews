The color quality slowly began to diminsh after that time and eventually required that I perform the head cleaning process before each printing job. I finally received an error message that instructed me that a major malfunction had taken place and to contact customer service. I was then instructed to either ship the unit in for service or consider a new unit. The manufactured would not tell me what the suspected problem was however suggested that it could be the printing head. I believe that not using the printer on a regular bases caused the heads to plug up beyond what the normal deep cleaning process could correct. My advice to anyone who buys into the Canon ink tank system, be sure to print a test page daily and perform the head cleaning process weekly. I don't believe I will own another Canon printer for this reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos from a photo restorationist","review":"I restore mostly black & white/sepia photos and this is the first Canon photo printer that prints perfect grayscale and beautiful color photos, especially when using Canon Matte Photo Paper.

Connected the printer last night without any trouble. My first photo from the 5 sheets (4x6) that came with the printer was fantastic. This printer is fast, quiet, fun when you can crop, adjust and print your fav digital pictures! Only trouble I current have is using the 4x6 paper feeder.

Trust me. Ignore the negative reviews. First of all, I haven't bought a printer in the last 5 years that comes with a cable. It might not be right, but it is what it is. So you can't distract from Canon for that. Second, the print head/ink refills are a snap to use. No problems whatsoever.LASTLY, and most importantly, you won't notice a difference between shots from this printer and ones prof. developed. There might be a difference, but you won't notice it. If I am printing prints to show my friends, then I use the Canon Photo Paper Plus. For prints I want to keep in an album, or really show off, I use the Canon Photo Paper PRO.You will be amazed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent Purchase!","review":"I really spent a lot of time doing research before I bought a photo printer.

Using Canon's Photo Paper Pro, these pictures print out as nice as Shutterfly and other major print shops. I have used a couple different types of paper, and I would advise, if you want expert looking pics, to use only Canon's Photo Paper Pro. Other brands didn't compare (at least not in my eye).Another great reason why this printer is great is because the ink replacement cartridges are only $12 each. Yes, the printer does come with five, but after printing out 100 pictures, the ink level has barely moved!

Something was going haywire with the printer and the Kodak software I was using -- not that the Canon tech people have any idea about that, after having spent hours on the phone with 'em.

What I have found is that the Canon i960 is the best photo printer out there. The i960 prints life like photos in 32 sec. I have tested HP's top of the line printer and even with the settings set to high it can NOT touch this Canon i960. The Canon i960 just rocks. It was easy to set up, and the the prints are BETTER than the photo lab. I have a Sony camera and I tried the Sony printer. Still NO comparison. The Canon is just Great!!! I also tried out all of the photo paper. I thought Kodak would be the best, but I was wrong. With the canon printer, the Canon photo paper pro is the top of the line. I Love how you have seperate ink for each color. You can just change the one that is low instead of all the colors just because one was low.

I was a strong supporter of Epson printers. That's all I've had. I thought I was pretty happy about it, until I met up with the i960. It is, to be simple, OUTSTANDING! The color is beautiful. Pictures are stunning. They are truly smear/smudge proof on their paper. The ink is lasting for quite a bit longer than the Epson. In fact, if weren't for the fact that I had to change the Epson ink cartridges so often, I would still have the Epson.Well, I'm glad I made the switch. I doubt I'll ever go back. Too many pluses for the i960. Yes, you do have to put out a larger cash outlay for this printer.

I have worked in IT for 5 years and I was scratching my head most of the time. The topics were scratching the surface and very high level with no substance. At the end of the chapter, I would outline it and it was eight or nine pages explaining something which would have taken me half the page to explain and then it did not explain it clearly.

Here we get classic tracks such as \\"See Emily Play\\", \\"Anorld Layne\\", and \\"Julia Dream\\". The cd booklet is quite odd with photos of a very strange instrument shot in different angles. Some of the tracks are very experimental (Interstellar Overdrive). 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"read this:","review":"Relics is a pretty cool collection. It is NOT technically a \\"greatest hits\\" album, as some reviewers have mentioned, since it contains 4 previously unreleased tracks. I don't think this album holds up to the later band standards, one of the reasons being that it lacks uniformity. However, the four above-mentioned unreleased tracks are quite good.\\"Biding My Time,\\" for instance, is sort of a bluesy psychedelic tune that seems to float through your speakers... you have to hear it. Another unreleased one is actually \\"Julia Dream,\\" which I think is the best song on the album and is one of the best Pink Floyd songs. I wonder why it was never realsed in a standard album. (Kind of like The Beatles and \\"Hey Jude.\\") Musicologically, or if you're a die hard floydian, Relics clearly releresents the band's transition from Barrett-influenced psychedelic period to Gilmour's \\"spacey\\" guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Early Years","review":"This is a nice collection of songs that will go onto be criminally underrated and neglected by most Pink Floyd fans. A shame really because they're really nice. Reading some of the reviews I'm surprised that some people hate Richard Wright's songs - I thought they were pretty good. And as for Roger Waters' Julia Dream - it's a beautiful song that I can't understand why some fans nor even the band hate it. Having said that I wish that there were more rarities on this album but...ah I suppose that could never happen. Still they are out there somewhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"The LP was better","review":"I'm not going to comment much on the music; you've probably been able to gather that \\"Relics\\" contains five tracks from the first three Pink Floyd albums plus six non-album tracks from the same time period (1967-69). It's somewhat of an odd collection that I'd give 3-1/2 stars to for just the music.HOWEVER...I'd like to point out some issues that none of the previous reviewers have mentioned. First, this CD has obvious audio defects. \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" has at least five audio dropouts. \\"Paint Box\\" and \\"Julia Dream\\" each have a moment where one channel loses the high end. To add insult to injury, the track times printed on the CD seem to correspond to the \\"More\\" CD, not \\"Relics\\", and the booklet is a complete waste of paper that omits the minimal information (recording dates) from the original US LP.I bought this CD to replace the LP, but in this case the LP was better. Capitol Records should be embarrassed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contains Rare Songs","review":"This is still a decent compilation album. It contains Paintbox, Julia Dream, Biding My Time and Careful with That Axe, Eugene (studio version).

Had they included such gems as Point Me At The Sky, It Would Be So Nice, Apples & Oranges, Nick's Boogie, and Candy And A Currant Bun, this collection would have been as essential as Dark Side or The Wall. This CD is another example of record companies trying to milk as much money out of fans as possible by releasing a few rare songs alongside album tracks.[DW]"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice assortment","review":"I own this because I love \\"Arnold Layne\\", \\"See Emily Play\\", and \\"Careful With That Axe Eugene\\". Some of the rarities (\\"Paintbox\\", \\"Julia Dream\\") are just ok, but if you love Floyd like I do, you want to have them anyway.

In a search for fulfillment in life, Cat goes on a spiritual search and divulges herself in the idea of karma. What is so absurd about this, however, is that while Cat is constantly in search of receiving favorable karmic retribution, she purposefully sleeps with attached men in hopes of breaking up their relationships, but at the same time seems to have NO clue whatsoever that karmic retribution in this case would turn around and burn her.The remainder of the book is a bit boring, and I had trouble keeping track of the other characters because there was nothing defining about them that made them stick out in my mind.

In fact, its premise might almost have allowed it to advertise itself as being \\"based on a true story.\\" There was the actual case of a woman who plowed into a man with her car, then let him die slowly impaled on her hood over a period of hours. This incident could have been the inspiration for a really good story of ghastly, ghostly revenge.However, \\"Hit and Run\\" doesn't permit itself to gather any momentum from this promising material for horror. After the first half hour or so of suspense, it just runs downhill and degenerates into a rather mindless gore-fest. What's more, a lot of the acting is amateurish. And the boyfriend in the plot is scripted as such a totally unlikable lout, it's impossible to care what happens to him.So all in all, I suggest you pass this one and leave it in your dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear....","review":"Some of this review could contain spoilers - because the movie is that lame.The movie was horrible all the way around.

Rick's character was wooden and flat as well. He spoke the words but they seemed spoken and lacking in emotion. The script was horrible...Mary hits a guy with her Jeep and manages to drive all the way home with him stuck to her bumper; yet, she doesn't know it until a few hours later when she wakes up in the middle of the night due to flashbacks??? I realize it is a movie for entertainment purposes but....really?? How much suspended disbelief is the audience suppose to exert?

Hence, this holster seemed to be a good choice.At first, it looked like it was quality plastic and has the swivel but I was greatly disappointed to see that the holster was designed with the blackberry screen facing OUT and not into your belt.This caused problems as I'm afraid of being in the rain with it or facing having the screen compromised because of its exposure. What a dumb design.You would think that the tab on top of the holster would hold the blackberry in place and it certainly does the job but if the blackberry was out of the holster, the tab is easily compromised in terms of breakage.....which, not even a month, broke off as I laid down.not worth the money for the phone orientation alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree with the title of this album","review":"combining the talents from bands At The Gates, and The Haunted.

But once I started it, I literally couldn't put it down, even though it was a pretty hefty book!The main character, Iona, is so true-to-life. This story is specifically about a group of friends who restore and reopen their local pub, but it's really about what life is like with your friends and loves when you are in your late twenties.

I've loved it since the first time I saw it. Everything about the movie is quietly powerful. The story, cast, and set locations are genuinely heartwarming. The patriotic message will stir the heart of everyone who cherishes what the Constitution truly represents. The insanity of the Joseph McCarthy Era is displayed beautifully. If you enjoy a well told story, get The Majestic.There is a good reason the movie is not available in Blu-ray.

First off, the issue of Jim Carrey. He's a funny guy. Can also act. We knew this. But to have him do neither in this movie is unconscionable. There's nothing in his character that Jim Carrey could give any of himself to. As has been said here before, anyone could have been in this role, thats how uninvolving it is.Way too long. The drama doesnt start bulding until an hour has passed. Tear jerking is employed. Youre going to have to bring your Suspens-O-Matic to the viewing to process all the disbelief youll be experiencing regularly....the whole town following the reunited lovers...the whole town waiting at the platform when Carrey comes back from Congress...oh, phooey. This is clean family fun, I will admit, if youre an adult without a brain or a high tolerance level for the inane you might finish this two and a half hour affair.

The script falls flat as soon as you hear the voice over and makes you go \\"Uh oh, a film about films.\\" It soon reverts to a montage of people telling us why cinema is 'magical' mixed in with a love story and some communist subtexts in there which seem dull and uninteresting and sort of shows the script is desperatly trying to tell a story of some sort of importance while Frank Darabont's films just keeping getting worse and worse.

A lot of critics said Jim Carrey's acting was bad and that he can't play a credible character, I really wonder if they were watching the same film that I was. The issues I found weren't really to do with the acting, that was just fine, the plot was a bit predictable... That being said, it's kind of an interesting what-if about the McCarthy era and someone actually standing up to that congressional witch hunt."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Jim Carrey","review":"This is a great movie for people who like Jim Carrey and wish he would receive more serious roles. He is a talented actor and should be recognized for something besides his ability to be crazy.

Great cast and directing makes this movie one of carrey's best. 10/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unabashedly sentimental","review":"Jim Carrey plays it straight in this movie about a young Hollywood screenwriter who is beginning to live the good life just as the McCarthy era begins. He is being accused of Communist ties (a false allegation) as he takes a drive and has an accident which causes him to lose his memory. He is discovered by the people in a small California town who think he is a presumed-dead war hero who has been missing for 9 years. The town is thrilled to welcome him back, especially his father, played by Martin Landau, and his girlfriend. He lives the life of a hero, until his memory begins to return and the Feds track him down and return him to Hollywood and then Washington to appear before the House Unamerican Activities Committee. Carrey turns in a fine performance in an entertaining film that only occasionally goes over the top with patriotic fervor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clean and decent movie for a change","review":"Most professional reviewers panned this movie - which is a sure sign that it's decent and clean and your grandmother and kids can watch it. If you like action, blood, cleavage, nudity and sexual situations and inuendos and that epitome of intelligent artistic expression in screen dialogue, the F- word, - then this movie is definitely NOT for you. It is a sweet story of boy and girl next door love and patriotism. I've heard it described as overly cliche, if that's the case then bring on more! I don't care for Jim Carrey's wild/crazy personna and avoid those films, but I love him in The Majestic and The Truman Show. Like Robin Williams, he shows that his talents run the whole spectrum and I can't wait to see more of his serious side. However he is a comic genious and it would be a shame if he totally abandoned something he is so good at."},{"rating":"1","title":"another Carrey movie, but not the best","review":"Jim Carrey is doing well in the funny role as usual, however this movie is not the best Carrey movie. It is long, or maybe too hollow, or maybe the pace is too slow. At the same time it focusses on just one, rather small place (Lawson), and the time frame is also short . Also there are some political undertones which I could not really always understand. As to the characters, they are are not too \\"live\\" actually (probably due to the amnesia that stikes Peter/Luke); I was not really impressed by Peter Appleton, Harry Trimble, Irene Teriwilliger, Emmit Smith, Sandra Saint-Clair, Adele Stanton and Lucille Angström Ichtville. The only interesting part of the movie is near the end when Luke (now Mrr Appleton again), reminds us of the 5th and 1st amendments of the Constitution of the United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"the stepford town.....","review":"this film, about people who love movies, just may cause you to develop a blind hatred of movies...a genuinely sweet attempt to recapture the Capra-esque spirit is buried somewhere within the glacial expanse of this film, which feels like an all-encompassing bit of fakery...especially in the whole HUAC hearings sub-plot, where the film seems to veer wildly away from realism, toward a desire to tug the audience's heartstrings and reward sentiment......it might not be so creepy if it didn't trivialize the actual McCarthy witchhunts, or if you hadn't seen the truman show. (to those who have, try watching these two movies back to back...there seem to be some eerie parallels..)two bright spots are the Sand Pirates of the Sahara, and Martin Landeau's performance.....his are the only emotions that seem to cut through the stifling atmosphere and ring true-sentimental without being eerily saccarine...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie of the Year","review":"What a fool I was not to trust the reviewers. I rarely get mad, but I must admit that I was very [angry] for having wasted [my money] and 2 and 1/2 hours of my life to this piece of... whatever. It's all Jim Carrey mugging, Martin Landau looking really old, and corny political speeches and untruthful sentimentality. I suppose it is retro Frank Capra, but this film is pathetic as compared to classics like \\"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,\\" or \\"It Happened One Night.\\" It's really not just stupid to compare them. It's wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and touching","review":"Jim Carrey takes a serious turn in The Majestic. An accident leaves Pete, a Hollywood screenwriter (who is also on the verge of being blacklisted as a Communist), with amnesia and he is welcomed by a small town whose residents believe he is one of their sons come back from the war, Luke. He and his father reopen the town's movie theater, which is a metaphor for bringing the entire town back to life. After months in the town, his own B-movie playing in the theater jogs his memory and forces him to admit to the town that he is not who they think, the same day his beloved father is buried. Pete returns to Hollywood to face the Communist accusations and stands up to the committee in a way Luke would have. The ending brought tears to my eyes and I immediately wanted to watch this movie again. It is a really sweet film and a welcome change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Carrey can act!","review":"This was an excellent movie. No normal Jim Carrey hijinks or toilet humor here. Although the writers took some liberties with the red scare and mcarthy trials, and the amnesia bit has been done before. This movie is on a different level though. The ideas this movie gives you are strong true ideas. You are what society wants you to be, be that communist or MIA war hero. This movie does a very good job of honoring the military as well and thanking them for the price they pay for freedom. It was a very good, very engaging movie that can be watched by the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Majestic","review":"Peter Appleton is a script writer during the 1950's who is suspected to be a Communist among many Hollywood film people (which is not true). Along the way, he gets into a freak car accident and suffers amnesia, then ends up in a small California town. There he lives in a run down movie theatre where he learns the magic of experiencing a movie in it. Soon, the Communist hunters find him and call him to testify before a Senate hearing committee. This is a nice movie. A movie that will make you laugh. The story (a man with amnesia is seen as a long lost son in a small town) is not that special, but it has some nice things to avoid the bigger cliches. This movie is very well made, and in the end you will have a nice feeling about it. I recommend it to anyone. It is to be enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebrating what's good about America","review":"Why haven't people given this film more credit? Because it moves at a leisurely pace, and there are no great chase scenes with crashes and explosions? No fight scenes with wire-fu and impossible gymnastics?If some of the themes of The Majestic are cliched, it doesn't matter when the actors are so good at conveying their characters, and eliciting genuine emotion in the audience. But I guess it is just too much to expect a modern audience, raised on \\"reality TV\\" (which is about as fake as you can get), to appreciate subtlety and hometown values. Harumph!This film deserves at least four stars, maybe a bit more, in view of the truckload of gutless artifice that passes for art in Hollywood these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MOVIE JIM CARREY FANS CAN BE PROUD OF.","review":"All I hear from people is that they didn't like it because he was too serious in this film. You know Jim Carrey is an actor and actors have alot more to offer than just comedy movies. This movie was good altough long it was good either ways. I think this was Jim's second best performance next to Eternal Sunshine. And if you don't like that movie either then maybe you are not the Jim Carrey fan you thought you were. Jim's a good comidian but he is a good actor that should never limit his acting to only comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"VERY ENTERTAINING\\"","review":"I found this book by Mr. Kelly quite interesting.

The unit does not easily configure, but more disappointing is that it lacks WPA for wireless security. The unit offers two choices - NO security or WEP. WEP is an outdated protocol that can be cracked in under 10 seconds. I would essentially have to gut my network's existing wireless security to roll back to WEP to support this unit, which makes zero sense.

It's a cliche now, but it was fresh when this book first hit the shelves, and it shows.The book suffers a bit from its age. Mostly I like the old-fashioned style, and the cars with running boards, and the endless smoking. There's a reflexive racism that rubbed me the wrong way, though I understand it's a reflection of the times. And I got tired of hearing about what freaks the really tall characters are (they're no taller than I am, in fact).Overall it's a satisfying, intriguing mystery wrapped in lean, gritty, hard-boiled prose.

This hideous disaster of a movie is the perfect example of why Hollywood should forget period films and stick to guns and car chases. Much has been made of Swank's blank-faced performance, but the real failure here is the script. It reeks, and no matter how it's dressed up, the director, actors, costumers, etc. could not turn this pile of bull's droppings into gold (literally, the film cost 20 million to make and grossed 400K). The failure begins with the writer's half-baked idea of taking a fascinating true story and perverting it, transforming the assorted cast of villians (who were motivated purely by greed) into some kind pop-culture heroes. Hence the confusing plot that never ads up to anything believable. Hence Swank's dismal attempt at turning a thief into a saint. Hence the cartoonish dialogue and ham-fisted acting all-around.

It's much more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood, get REAL.","review":"American actors butchered the British dialect in this film.

It truly is an affair, because people are getting tricked and maneuvered, it has intrigue that unfolded lovely, having been placed right before the French Revolution.Hilary Swank, although not my top choice for a costume drama, does a good job of playing Jeanne de la Motte-Valois, a woman who lost her parents and her title at a young age. With the help of a court women-chaser, Baker, she uses the Cardinal's desire for Marie Antoinette, and the luxurious diamond necklace that comes into place, to get what she wants.As lies are told, and people pretending to be someone else, the grand plot begins to resemble a tower of playing cards that can topple at any moment.It was a wonderful movie, that felt cozy, and it was almost like a mystery drama, in beautiful lavish costumes.

Nancy in the original movie was a hero, the only one willing to stand up to Freddy and fight back. In this movie, they make her seem like a wimp.

Firstly, I really liked this remake. I think it's the best horror classic remake ever. Freddy is scarier and more evil than ever. The acting, special effects, and plot consistency is better than the old films. This is kind of like the 1st 3 Freddy movies jammed into 1. The 1 thing that the old films had on this one is the creepy atmosphere. They old films were darker, and had a very chilling vibe. This movie doesn't have the same visual and mental creepiness. I think that the quality of the recording being less advanced had a lot to do with that. If they filmed this movie with the same cameras as the old ones, and used everything else from this movie, I think it would have been better.Overall, this is a great remake, but you can't replace an old classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nightmare on elm street","review":"i love this movie and i will tell all of my friends and family about this web site thanks again i look foreword to buy some more dvds"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"A Nightmare on Elm Street..

That being said, I also believe there are just some movies that you shouldn't remake. I think Nightmare and the Freddy character falls into this particular realm. Robert Englund's personality made Freddy a bit better than he was, if that makes any sense. With Jackie Earle Haley, Freddy becomes just another sick child molester.

There is no character development and the story moves around like a freight train with different subplots almost knocking into each other and without ever revealing anything germane to the plot. Fake Freddy looked absolutely ludicrous and resembled some 40 year-old man still living at home with his mother, not one of the greatest slasher characters in cinematic history. The movie takes every over-the-top cliche from an '80s slasher and with the grace of a 300 pound blind ballerina tries to make a coherent story out of it. Not gonna happen.

The lines given for Jack Earl Haley were awful and some of them came from Freddy vs Jason; for instance, \\"your in my world now\\" like we haven't heard that line before. Even the build up to the end was bad, along with the ending scene with Freddy pulling in the mom into the mirror. Overall, you don't care about the characters with little character development.

The dialogue......well it seems like that room of monkeys on typewriters finally churned out something.....this script.Freddy's new look was actually kinda cool.

It didn't take long of actually sitting in the theater for those hopes to be shot straight out of the sky. My main gripe is with the redesign of Freddie. He looks like Jim Carrey's Grinch That Stole Christmas. Nothing about his appearance was at all frightening. It looked far too plastic and fake. How do special effects from two decades ago look better than anything we can put together now? It is sad really. And they gave him way too many lines in the movie. Less is more when it comes to horror villains. Especially when you have such horrible dialogue as \\"Why are you screaming? I haven't even cut you yet.\\" Freddy's one liners are enough to kill this movie on their own. In fact I could have forgiven the terrible acting from the other stars, the cheesy gore effects and the ridiculous story details the new movie added..... if only they hadn't turned the centerpiece of the series into such a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite what I expected","review":"Ok, I really to put this movie as a 3.5Pros: 4 starsChange in the main storyline from the originalThe micro nap concept, that is pretty coolFreddy seems much darker and not as much of a comedian as the original Freddy.Some jumpy moments caused some girls in the theatre to scream. I jumped a little myself actually.Cons: 3 starsNo creative kills. In today's technological world and improved special effects, I would like to have seen some better kills. Alot of borrowed kills from the original.The movie dragged some in the beginning.The idea that if you are awake long enough you will go into a coma and never wake up. That was lame.The dream sequences were ok, but I would have liked to see some more creativity there too.Other then a few jumpy moments that most \\"scary\\" movies have, I didn't find myself scared watching this movie.

Yes, this movie wasn't quite as good as the original because it took a lot of the creativity away that the original movie had and not to mention no one can do freddy like robert but jackie did a good job. In all the movie is very awesome and if you are a freddy fan or not and haven't seen this version yet go see it and decide for yourself.

Now with that being said, here is my consensus about the new re-make. When I heard Englund wasn't in it, yes I was disappointed but looked at the positive side:-When I heard the re-make involved Jackie Earle Haley as the horror icon, Fred I was happy. If they were to have another actor to be Fred, it would 100% be Haley.-I looked as this as a RE-MAKE. Not a sequel. This is a standalone Freddy film.-It was the most serious side of the of the classic franchise.Overall I thought the film was excellent in it's own rights being that this isn't a sequel, but a modern version of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEW FREDDY.","review":"In response to MR LOCO.If you were really a Freddy fan, You'd know that the back story had never changed. They just played it up a bit more.Freddy was always a pedophile, they just never use that word to describe him. Go back and watch Freddy vs Jason. The opening scene: the licks a pic of a little girl. before killing a live one. Later on in the film: he fondles with his glove hand the main female character and says, your mouth says no, but your bod says yes.Also: In the films there is a little girl saying he likes little children. Especially little girls. Through out the years, there were always the little girl victims who jump roped. Like said. It's always been there. Just like a puzzle. You just have to piece it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst remakes","review":"I have to say this is one of the worst remakes in horror films. Effects wise it was good, but they butchered Freddy's backstory which was unnecessary but made Freddy less of villain. I'm sorry, but making him a child molester instead of a child killer in his human life was utterly ridiculous and took the scary edge off him. And like the remake of Halloween 1 & 2, you really didn't care about the characters and whether they were killed or not.When the movie finished all I thought was WTF? It was a remake that never should have happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"very forgettable..","review":"This seems to be the most forgettable movie I have ever seen. And this is backed up by having friends who have also watched this movie, and everybody I know, could barely recall a single scene from the whole movie. It's quite a feat. I don't know how that is even possible. One thing that I do remember and want to mention is that Jackie Earl Haley, who has delivered good performances in the past, seems lifeless, and uninspired. He never seems liek athreat, but most of the time looks like alittle kid dressed up for halloween, with a hat and glove that seem comically large to his small frame. It might just be the worst remake I've seen yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad!!","review":"I watched scary movies as a kid, but for some reason I stopped watching them when I got older because they scared me!!

Not to sound rude, but Freddy's voice was annoying in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible!!","review":"I have seen a lot of this original series and loved them. I borrowed this one from my local library since I usually hate remakes of horror movies and this was no exception. This remake is the worse than the Jason remake. I mean, the movie nearly put me to sleep I was so bored with it. You can't have a Freddy with Englund. I'm sorry, but you just can't. This was a remake they should not have even been thought up. This movie is a disgrace to the genre and I would recommend you all spare the hour and a half and do something else more worth your while. I'm I watched it to ward others away from it, but please save yourself the embarrassment and don't watch this pathetic excuse for a movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sucked","review":"it sucked...it was boreing, no tongue in cheek humor like the org. movies the female lead didnt act very well....the guy who played Freddy was good....save ur money or go rent the org...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare On Bored Street","review":"Boring,underwhelming remake that needed a jolt of energy but better than 4, 5,and 6 though, Haley couldn't fill the shoes of Englund, it was a sad attempt, even when the movies were bad Englund put his all into the role of Freddy. Watch once out of curiosity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freddy and the stock market","review":"I believe this film has correlations in REALITY. Why would I say that ??Just look at a chart of the Dow Industrials shortly after the film was released.This FILM PROVES that social mood is headed to hell in a hand basket so to say.I have no problem with that. I want the stock market to crash. In fact, exactly6 days after the release on 30 APRIL 2010, the DOW had a panic NIGHTMARE diveintraday of 998 points.SPOOKY !!!!And the media used the word NIGHTMARE to describe it.It would NOT surprise me to see a sequel VERY soon.This is an excellent movie, although in a terror kind of way.Stephen !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a movie review","review":"I bought this item thinking it was a regular DVD. When it came in the mail, the DVD case had RENTAL in large print across the bottom. The DVD itself also said rental on it, which means it has no special features. The product page says nothing about this being a rental copy, and the picture displayed does not say Rental on it like the item I received."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's with the hate?","review":"Nothing new?? It's a remake morons not a new feature film based on new ideas etc. This is an awesome movie and takes Freddy back to being scary and brutal instead of a stand up comedian. Granted I was scared to see how a new Freddy actor would stand up to the one and only Robert Englund but this movie did just that. The effects are great, the atmosphere is excellent. the kills are no holds barred awesome, and Freddy is played perfectly with minimal humour which at times ruined some of the NOES sequels. When the famous one liners come into play here they are done in a serious twisted way, which is awesome. I can't wait to see a pt.2 or 10 of this series as long as they keep it serious and scary like this remake and the first NOES. When judging remakes this TCM and Friday The 13th remakes were eons better than the lame Rob Zombie Halloween remake and the dreaded Halloween II remake.As a long time horror and Freddy fan, this was an awesome film, great job! Bring on the Sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my goodness!","review":"First of all with His dolla store mask yes dolla store.Robert England should sue.The mask was off the voice the everything.Proves there is nothing like the classics.I am so glad I did NOT pay movie theatre prices I would have been so p'd.This Freddy Kruger would have been running from me trying to get my money back.As you would say in the 90'sHATED IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment","review":"I ran to see this movie the day it came out. I have been a Nightmare on Elm street lover since a child, watching and re-watching all the original movies over and over again and never getting tired of it. I waited with anticipation, trying to relive my childhood horror movies.The first disappointment was that there was no Robert Englund! He was so missed in this movie. Any Nightmare on Elm street movie MUST have Robert Englund, there even wasn't a cameo.The movie itself was an okay horror movie, only that it can not nor should it have been named A Nightmare On Elm street, this movie is not in any caliber with the original movie. You will have a few scare and jumps but nothing like the original horror movie we knew from the 80's, which unfortunately that type of horror was what I was waiting for.Enjoy seeing it"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst","review":"This is the worst remake ever.

I think it goes more into the story in this one which gives it a slight plus over the original but to be honest, Freddy just wasnt scary in this one. The original Freddy(Robert Englund) was absolutely terrifying.But still pretty good movie either way. Glad they kept the nudity out of this one. Nudity seems to ruin alot of movies these days *cough cough* Pirahna remake"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well made technically, but not that good.","review":"I didn't like this much at all. The film itself was very well made and much of the dream stuff looked very good, but it lacked the the scares of the early Freddy films, and lacked the fun of the later ones. I'm not against remakes and reinterpretation, but this had nothing old, and really nothing new. it was mostly boring.the new guy playing Freddy seemed to be trying but the script didn't really give him much to go with. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Remake to Kill the Fans...","review":"It was as if none of these people ever even the originals. The movie is not scary at all just mostly a quick stab and kill with extra blood to make some more gore. The dialogue is stupid and not believable. Freddy rarely speaks and when he does its some pointless chessy line. The acting is semi believable when the \\"teens\\" are trying to be scared in their dreams or awake. But just wasn't that great. Terrible unscary intro to the movie too. Even the ending to how they \\"kill\\" Freddy is cheesy since all that's done is his glove hand is cut off and his throat is sliced real quick. But after that at the very end obviously they show that he's still alive. I would give this movie a C-."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a nightmare","review":"This movie is a nightmare. Any of its predecessor's are a better watch than this. There were a number of good casting choices, and the actor's/actresses themselves were competent but it was just a big flashy bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst nightmare ever!","review":"Everything you liked about the original nightmare films have been burned away in this awful remake. Nothing is good about this film, the CGI is terrible, Freddy looks like a fishface with the awful new make-up they gave him, and the characters in the film are monotonous and boring. This movie is just an insult to the fans, I can't believe how bad this is. No REAL Freddy fan would ever like this and without Robert Englund, the nightmare movies will never be the same. I wanted to give it a chance, but this film was a constant letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remake","review":"This is a remake of the 1984 film of the same name, only Freddy's body count film becomes predictable. Though at least credit the film makers for trying to update the tired Nightmare film franchise. Robert Englund is missing in the cast as lead villain Freddy Krueger and the new guy's makeup and costume are much more \\"ghetto,\\" giving it a little old school feeling. Worth seeing once for horror buffs, but overall the film wasn't satisfying, or scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nightmare on elm street","review":"Undoubtedly you've read some bad reviews about this movie, but they are unfounded. Having seen the original \\"Freddy\\" movies with Robert Englund, this new version trumps it in spades. Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach in \\"Watchmen) dons the clawed hand in this new addition to Wes Craven's horror camp. Finally we see the origins of Krueger and why he's just so angry at the world. As with many horror films, the victims are almost obnoxiously stupid, but if they were smart, we wouldn't be half as scared right. I highly recommend this movie, If you loved the original then you'll love this film. But don't see it alone"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than I expected","review":"I'll keep this short so I can be half as lazy as the film makers who made this unoriginal snore fest. If you thought the Friday the 13th remake was bad, prepare yourself to sit through another horrible remake of a great movie. My main issue with this movie is the over the top use of CGI. CGI has its place in film, but when your using it in scenes that could have easily been filmed with some simple props, it looks ridiculous! Case in point, there is a scene in the movie where Freddy takes an object to the eye causing a blood \\"splurt\\", instead of putting any effort into this scene the film makers opted to use CGI. Whatever happened to the good old days of latex and corn syrup? The effects (I use that term loosely) in this movie could have been done by some 15 year old kid sitting on the computer in his parent's basement. I'd tell you not to bother seeing this one but curiosity will get to you and you'll watch it anyways. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeping On Your Back Won't Help","review":"Platinum Dunes never let their scripts leave the marketing department; they threw thousands of dollars for the trades to read, \\"Watchmen actor and Nirvana director prepare for restlessness in Nightmare reboot\\", but never cared if either Jackie Earle Haley or Sam Bayer were right for the job. They weren't. Bayer can't seem to find a tripod or pacing and Haley's decided to play every character with a Rorschach croak. But even if they'd gotten different talent there's no saving a movie with a script congealed in a scab writer's gutter.So what is Freddy all about this time? Our Twilight cast approach the audience, point to the burned scarecrow in the gay Christmas sweater and say as somberly as possible, \\"He touched me.\\" That's it. No vibrant mindbenders or interesting kills or character arcs or knife hand building. Krueger was a sexual torturer, the kids he diddled turn eighteen and the chase continues.This hits the bottom of remake hell with a dull thud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a matinée and nothing more!!!","review":"Yeah. Where is Robert England when you need him? Probably somewhere shaking his head at this. This Freddy remake didn't do it for me. It wasn't totally awful but it wasn't that great either. The acting was mediocre and forgettable and I really didn't connect with any of the characters the way I did in the old series. The new mask Freddy has looks terrible. It looks as if somebody chewed a bunch of Bazooka gum and just slapped it on the actor's face. And the guy that played him sounded as if he had candy in his mouth during the whole film. That was a major distraction for me. To sum up, this is okay to watch if you are bored out of your mind and you simply can't find anything better to do. But I wouldn't waste too much gas traveling to the theater to catch this one. If you just have to see this please go see it at the matinée price or better yet wait till it comes on HBO."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Freddy for a new generation","review":"I have to say, I am old enough to have enjoyed the old Nightmare on Elm Street movies when they were originally released in the theater. I have always been a huge fan of the franchise. I just saw the remake of the original first Nightmare on Elm Street and thought it was pretty darn good. Yes, to me Robert Englund will always be the Freddy that sticks in my mind. However, with new technology and a new generation wanting bigger and better effects, I think that remaking this movie is keeping this fabulous horror story relevant to the younger generation. Also, the actual fright factor that I loved about the first nightmare movie back in 1984 was alive in this one as well. I am glad that the campiness of the later Elm Street movies was missing in the remake. It made me jump...just like the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unneeded and Pointless Remake","review":"Jackie Earle Haley actually did a pretty good job in this. Other than that this is a mediocre excuse for a remake that just tries to replicate some of the original scenes while leaving certain ones out(Johnny Depp being sucked into the bed and coming out in a blood geyser). Meanwhile it turns Freddy into a pedophile instead of just a child-killer like the original. The blood and other special effects also don't work as well as they did in the original. CGI blood usually doesn't look good.While this isn't quite as bad as Freddy's Dead it is pretty close making it the second worst of the series.Overall this was a pointless remake of the original horror classic that should have never been made. If you feel a need to watch it because you're a Freddy fan rent this but definately do not buy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible, unnecessary remake","review":"i had low expectations, but this remake totally disappointed. go back and watch the original. its story structure is beautifully tight. the reveals are perfectly timed. this remake is unsmooth, humorless and just lacking that certain magic that the original nightmare possessed. boo to platinum dunes for trying to make a quick buck off an established character instead of taking chances on new ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible ( I rented this and i felt ripped off)","review":"Wow.... i haven't seen a movie this bad in a while. So bad i felt compelled to right a review on it.... Don't expect Robert Englund quality freddy. They got some no name actor. Freddy IS the nightmare on elm street series. Freddy in this film looks like a cross between a pizza and that lady that had her face ripped off by her neighbors pet chimpanzee. He also sounds like a retard. Do not buy, do not rent, DO NOT WATCH! just try to remember the nightmare on elm street series in all of it's past glory. This movie is horrible beyond belief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"I'm a loyal fan of the big 3, Jason, Freddy, and Michael. I will buy this one but was upset that they didn't do a better job. My biggest upset was the over use of CGI. There is something more scary about liquid fake blood than CGI. I would have been much happier had they broke out the corn syrup and food dye. I liked that they tried to make Freddy look more like a burn victim but being too afraid to scare people they watered him down and is less scary again. They should have hid his face for 90% of the movie and than hit us with it at the end. Back story didn't change but didn't add any new life to it either, I kind of expected to see the trial. The scariest addition to the film they didn't take advantage of. The line about having 5 more minutes to play before brain death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but need to spiral-bind it","review":"These transcriptions are the real deal, albeit challenging.I was glad I took the other reviewers' suggestion and took the book to Kinko's and spiral-bound it for five bucks.Hint: choose the larger spiral so that you can turn pages easier.Love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong","review":"What can I say.

It arrived in excellent condition with the exception of a little smudge on the cover that was easily cleaned off with a wet rag. The only thing I would do different is use a little faster shipping method rather than the standard shipping. I thought that seeing how the store it was coming from was in Auburn Washington and we were in Spokane washington it would only take a couple days to get, in plenty of time before her classes started. It finally did arrive, the Saturday before her first class the following Monday. I have found Amazon.com a great resource for obtaining text books at a fraction of what they would cost new. Great place to save money, even if you use expedited shipping it is still probably going to cost you less than buying it brand new. Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mid-Century Consolidation of American Railroads","review":"This is an academic history of the evolution of the main corporate identities in the American railroad industry in the last century. It gives good coverage of the consolidation proposals in the wake of WW1 federal administration and of the moves to consolidation in the post WW2 years. It is an essential reference for the serious rail historian rather than the average railbuff. It would have benefited from a little more editorial care, especially for the maps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effervescent Glucosomine and Chondroitin","review":"This is the best joint product I've ever used, after it was recommended by a friend in another state.

While it seems like everyone else here thought it was wonderful, for me it offered very little pet advice and tons on showing and competition. I was looking for a book on how to raise a shih tzu as a pet and I have zero interest in breeding or showing, which are the groups for whom this book seems to have been written. If that's your goal then I wholely recommend it (which is why I gave the two stars rather than one), but if you're like me and the 98% of shih tzu owners who are looking for a pet based book, there are many better ones out there (for much less money, might I add!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABC's best album","review":"as an ABC 'freak' back when they were still noticed, this album was quite revolutionary at the time - the interesting thing to note was how far Eurythmics ripped them off and made far more money with 'would I lie to you' - complete ape of this album - as well as cover band copies such as The Power Station, etc.at any rate, a pretty much misunderstood album that still went gold at the time and still rocks today. So when you're tired of the catchy dance pop of their first album, slap this on and see who perks up and asks who it is....amigaboy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you kidding?!?","review":"People, don't deprive yourself of one of the top 5 albums of the 1980's. Every movement is defined by five to ten albums, The Britsh Post-moderns came up with very interesting ideas by rehashing strong guitar riff songs. All infused with biting sarcasm of a people frustrated with the previous generation. Not lacking any ounce of strength available, yet surprisingly smooth. New wave at it's finest and rawest, only comparative to Mind Bomb for smoothness but with a fuller sound pallette. Buy it, if you don't like it, donate it, give it to someone else, so they can enjoy it free, someone along the way will be changed by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABC does hard rock? New Wave \\"Metal\\" with Sax.","review":"I remember seeing that written in a review on this album when it came out. Naturally, I bought the record because of it. It's definitely a unique collection of songs and certainly a far cry from what you'd expect from this band. The real star on this record is the studio drummer, Andy Numark, the master of the 4-piece drum kit. Although not much technically challenging about the songs, each song features a \\"big\\" sound - similar to Bonham's big drum sound. Otherwise, the songs feature big, crunchy guitars and saxophones intertwining: kind of an unusual texture and definitely a matter of taste. This collection is a departure from the new wave pop sound by which you recognize them - it may as well be another band. Somehow, this worked against them - their notion of what was to come next wasn't in alignment with what the world was ready for. Personally, I liked this album better than any of their other stuff. Saxophone-haters should avoid this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever made.","review":"Prog Rock meets the Ecole de Beaux Arts.Some of the most intricately detailed compositions I've ever had the pleasure of listening to.

At the time, it was panned as ABC pretending to be a rock band after the pop-friendly Lexicon of Love. Some of the songs to me include elements of Roxy Music and Bowie, among other 70s rock greats.However, do not pick up this album to get the extra track (singular) 1:57 Vertigo. It's an instrumental that frankly is rubbish and it's clear why it was not included on the album in the first place. If the remastered versions are of interest to you, by all means pick up this remastered version. Just don't expect any hidden gem here with the bonus track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cult Classic","review":"There were only a few \\"difinitive\\" albums during the 80's...This is one of them.

I thought I knew everything about Jackie Chan, but man was I wrong! This documentary is overloaded with info. Jackie's path at becoming the world's top action star wasn't an easy one. If you are a Jackie fan then you have to see this documentary. One thing I found interesting is that Jackie and his stunt team are blacklisted from every insurance company in Asia. There is no way I could go over all the stuff he talks about. There is nothing better than hearing Jackie's stories from Jackie's own mouth.And in case you don't know about Jackie Chan, then I will just tell you that he put his life on the line for almost every movie he made. And he has made a ton of movies! He is one of the world's top actors, but he always did his own stunts. Included in this documentary are some of his most famous stunts, and also some outtakes, including the one where he gets hit by a helicopter!Rating-5/5. I would give this a 100/100 if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Documentary on a Great Man","review":"If you've even heard of Jackie Chan, you must see this video.

It has all the appearance of never being proofread; it obviously hadn't been run through a word processor's spelling corrector. It looks like the prior version was mechanically scanned.I think I found several inconsistencies in the content as well; inconsistent diagrams, for example. Also it fails to answer some obvious questions in the course of explanation.So I don't know if there's a competitive book that introduces all the material in 200 pages; but I'd suggest you spend more and read more and have more confidence that what you are reading is correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Times at Northern Tool","review":"This platform truck is a good truck, if you can get one. When I ordered on from northern tool, the shipping company damaged it and it was undeliverable. The second one came a week later and was missing parts. When I asked the company if they could just sent the parts, they said it wouyld take 6-8 weeks because the parts had to shipped from CHINA!!! I couldn't believe that they couldn't just go into the warehouse and get some screws out of another box. So they ended up shipping me another one. This is about a month after I had sent the original order in. So that one arrived and we refused it becase it was damaged as well. We then tried to get our money back, but we had to send the one unit back and they had to receive it at their warehouse. End of story, it has been almost 8 weeks now since I ordered and I have no platform truck and no money. THANKS A LOT NORTHERN TOOL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still on my CD player after all these years","review":"I picked up a copy of Once Blue's album after catching them as the opening act for The Beautiful South at the old 9:30 Club in DC. It was the fall of 1995. Over six years later, I still think this was one of the best duos to come out of the NY pop scene in the 90s. The songs are catchy, intelligent, and have a very unique style. The sound quality is excellent. Too bad the duo broke up before reaching any sort of media attention. Rebecca Martin, the singer, is still out there, recording strong solo albums that display her amazing, unique voice. Jesse Harris plays on Norah Jones' new album, and wrote a couple of songs for it. For those of you missing Once Blue, pick up Norah's CD and listen to the first track (\\"Don't Know Why\\") or catch the video on MTV. The similarity to Once Blue is eerie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless, wonderful","review":"Back in college, I received this album as a special of the month from a cd-membership club. Not wanting to go through the trouble of returning it, I popped it into my stereo and was instantly transfixed. Once Blue possessed such a unique, jazzy-folksy feel that was far superior to the post-grunge pop flooding the airwaves then (and even now). Rebecca Martin's vocals and Jesse Harris's guitar were a perfect fit. Seven years later, it's still one of my favorite cds.Once Blue has some awesome songs, including \\"Save Me,\\" \\"I Haven't Been Me,\\" \\"Where To Now?\\" and the whimsical \\"Stardust and Snow.\\" The most powerful, in my opinion, is the simple ballad \\"Amateur.\\" This is one of the few songs where Jesse shares vocals with Rebecca, and it is beautifully, honestly sung.This cd is out of print but it's worth hunting down. It's a shame Once Blue broke up, because this duo had such great potential. Jesse's recent Grammy win with Norah Jones speaks volumes on what might have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make it mandatory reading for anyone in the medical field!","review":"A nurse recommended the book to my sister.

A simple piece of equipment with simple assembly -- that is, assuming the parts fit together. The bench I ordered was defective. The front bracket was far too narrow and misshapen to accept the front stabilizer bar. The heavy steel bracket displayed no damage or paint chipping, suggesting that the problem occurred at the point of manufacture. And it's not an easy fix. This is clearly a quality control problem -- since one finds so few separate parts to be checked for quality. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets the Need","review":"This is a great bench!

Since it was not exclusively an Amazon product, it was not warrantied for a free replacement part. Rather than send the entire bench back and wait to reorder a whole new one (which is what I would have to do, per Amazon's instructions), I ordered a new pad through Bowflex and replaced the damaged pad. For the amount of money I spent on the bench though, I would expect replacing busted parts to be a bit easier and the 'non-Amazon' companies to be as honorable as Amazon, and stand behind their quality of merchandise.

It's solid, supports my head for flat bench presses, doesn't rattle at all (helps if you buy some floor matts), looks and functions like gym quality benches (If not better).

I honestly only finished the book because I was hoping the hero would slap her. The words most often used to describe her in the book are marble statue and ice cold. She blames the hero for everything and makes the monumentally bad decision to make his life miserable by never letting him forget it. So while the hero is left trying to make something livable out of a bad situation, she pouts and complains and says nasty things to him. Even with this going on the author decides to write in sex scenes which are really just uncomfortable since you know she hates him and can't wait to say something mean and sarcastic just to ruin the mood.

The tone of this book is similar, a lot of deep felt emotions with very little dialogue until later in the book.

I wanted the true square edge tiers, (instead of square with rounded corners), and these cost a lot less than Wilton brand pans. They are VERY well-made, durable construction, and resist sticking quite well, although I always use Wilton Cake Release with a silicone basting brush on every surface of every pan I bake in.

Their response was that they were sorry for the condition of the book but I had not even mentioned that.

The author has written a fictional, in-the-first-person, autobiography. Quite a contradiction. The extremely personal details of Ivy Stranahan's life should not have been included, as the reader has no idea where fact and fiction begin and end. One cannot imagine that Mrs. Stranahan would have wanted these details, if they are true, to be available to anyone who happens to pick up the book. Perhaps speculation of this sort would be more acceptable if the main character were one who had lived centuries ago rather than a 20th century individual. The bizarre details of her private life tend to distract from Mrs. Stranahan's accomplishments. This book can vaguely be categorized as historical fiction, and there are no illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting","review":"After reading the Kinship and Courage series I excpected this book to be just as good.

The book would be far more effective if reading it wasn't such a painful task. The material is very dry and many of the explanations within the text are very unclear.

Obi-Wan is desperately searching for his master, and gets stuck investigating with Astri, the teenage daughter of the man Qui-Gon was captured trying to protect. Astri wants to find Jenna Zan Arbor just as bad as Obi-Wan, for Jenna is the only one with the medicine needed to save the life of Astri's dying father. This was an excellent addition to the Jedi Apprentice series, and a great improvement over #11, The Deadly Hunter, which was the previous book. I highly reccomend this book to all Star Wars fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best yet!","review":"This book was fantastic! Unlike some of the other books, this one has it's share of action. Obi Wan is desperatley searching for his master, and along the way he has to make some pretty tough decisions. Meanwhile, Qui Gon is being held captive by a certain \\"mad scientist\\" (guess) and is having his blood drained daily. This book is a great edition to the Jedi Apperentice series.

And so, I decided that buying a inexpensive product such at this camera would be worth my money. I, of course being a newbie, didn't know how horrible this camera would perform since I couldn't find any reviews or anything of the sort.Installing the software was easy but taking pictures were not. First off, just trying to open the battery cover is hard. Second, when you try to take a picture, it's very blurry and enlarges everything you see. None of the pictures I took were viewable. Third, there is practically no difference in high or low quality. They basically look the same, except that you get more picture space in low quality.I would recommend some other product besides this.

She took it out of the video machine after 15 minutes, and does the same thing everytime. I think it's because it is very slow compared to her new favorites, the Baby Know-It-All videos and Baby Animals videos. She will watch Baby Einstein if it is on, without the same ill reaction, so its not because of the straight classical music. I think there is just too much use of the computer animated graphics, and the lack of narration also makes for lack of interactivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I bought this and the other video by this company with high expectations and have been seriously disappointed.

What annoys me though: Even today the living outnumber the dead. Given a rise of the population to about 500 billion in a couple of hundred years, as P.H. describes, this must be even more the case then. P.H. should have done some Math instead of just trusting his common sense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Asimov, Clarke, and Heinlein","review":"This so far is the best Sci-Fi series I've read. It truely uses science whereas many other books claim to, but get too involved with interplanetary politics. Or simple murder mystery in space with some aliens as a side bar like what Gentry Lee has done with Clarke's Rama. Hamiliton does use many characters, but its is a big universe. He is setting the standard for modern Sci-Fi, and he has just dated Asimov, Clarke and others. They were all great writers, but limited by the technology of their times. Hamiliton uses current tech. and current fantasized future technology to sculpt an incredible series. He will certainly appear in the marquee of great Sci-Fi writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good; Some neat stuff; Moves slow at times","review":"Because this is an epic, weaved through several books, character and plot development moves kind of slow. Overall it was worth reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dickens Lives!","review":"I think Hamilton has some great ideas, but in trying to tell twenty stories he's lost the ability to tell even one properly. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs at the beginning of each chapter because I didn't care to get bogged down in the ecology of another fantasy star system or the details of another invented technology.If the \\"big deal\\" is the how and why of souls returning from the dead, then why are crucial details shunted into side conversations that have little other meaning? If that's not the big deal, what is? Joshua Calvert's next conquest? The wonder weapon to finally seal the breach opened to the Beyond by the Li-Cylph (remember them)?All the enthusiasm I had generated during reading Reality Dysfunctions has petered out, finally squelched when I found out the sequel to this book isn't the end of the saga. I think he had enough ideas for 2 or 3 books, not 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get through it","review":"I am a huge fan of hard science fiction, but this book I put down a quarter of the way through and can't make myself pick it up again.

I did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"The payoff in volume 3 is really weak","review":"The premise and much of the action was good throughout the series, but after wading through 1500 pages, I could not believe how lame the ending was. It would be unfair to reveal the ending, so I will not do so.The ending reminded me of a bad mystery story where the killer was a new character introduced in the last 50 pages.I think Hamilton must have run out of ideas.If you believe that it is the journey and not the destination, then go ahead and read these books. They are in the pulp fiction style of several plots that more or less merge at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series falls on its face with installment #3","review":"After having read the first two books in the series, I am sorely disappointed by this book.It would appear that Hamilton has run out of ideas and is instead resorting to the \\"Star Trek\\" trap of including elements of the present (Al Capone anyone?) into the future for the purposes writing a story.The characters carried over from the first two books are just as interesting. The ideas contained in this series are just as intriguing. Alas, this book contributes nothing new to the series, and actually brings down the overall quality of it.I read the book, I finished the book, and I am reading the sequels. However, most people will not find themselves able to read through the drek that this book constitutes. Perhaps skipping ahead to _The Naked God_ might be a better idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violence too depressing","review":"I found the violence too depressing to continue reading the rest of the book.

Hamilton is worthy of stardom. 5 stardom.","review":"To anyone reading these reviews, the only thing I can say to you is that it is better than anyone says. People try to tell you that the story could've been told with less words and less chapters even. Let me tell you the truth. Don't let the size of the book intimidate you. Any good reader breezes right through Hamiltons outstanding use of parrallelism without slowing down as is done in naturalism. This entire series is worth every minute you spend on it. I've actually skipped work to continue flipping pages and drooling over the development. The cheesy subject only makes it cooler. Hamilton shows exactly how the human race would react to this plague. This series is outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Hamilton has Been Possessed","review":"and he's trying to steal my soul by boring me to death!!I hardly ever flat out stop reading a book and give up. That's what I did with Neutronium Alchemist. Even more tedious than the first book - Reality Dysfunction. Just as goofy (dead coming back to possess the living?!?). Even more intricate subplots that disappear for what seems like hundreds of pages at a time. Just as much gratuitous sex and gore. And finally Hamilton pushes it over the top by bringing back Al Capone. Gimme a break.<..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping up the quality.","review":"The complexity of this series is staggering. If you have read the reality dysfunction and enjoyed it, I would recommend you move straight into reading this sequel. If you leave a large gap you may forget a raft of plot lines and characters.There is little point in trying to summarise what happens in this book. That would defeat the point in reading the book! What I can say, is that the pace is just as frenetic, and the detail continues to build in this episode of the story. Excellent stuff, and well worth keeping up with the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyberpunk: The Next Generation","review":"This book is sooo hot. It's a rare mixture of slam bang action, high technology, ancient magic, and a really big philosophical question that's been dogging mankind since we crawled down from the trees. I don't know whether to wish for the series to conclude so I can see how it comes out or if I should just hope that Hamilton turns it into an encyclopedia so I can keep on reading forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic hard sci-fi mets space opera","review":"The worlds that Peter F Hamilton creates in the Neutronium Alchemist series are utterly compelling, as are his storylines and ideas. However his great books are let down by two things - his dreadful characterisations and his juvenile obsession with sex. I thoroughly enjoy all his books, and race through them, only stopping occasionally to groan and roll my eyes when one of his space-bimbos drops her panties for the hero again, or the cheesy bad-guy utters one of his faux-menacing lines.Regardless, I would highly recommend the Neutronium Alchemist and all his other books. It's worth forcing yourself to ignore the poor characterisations, the books are so chock-full of interesting ideas and situations and gripping storylines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has the typical problems of a 'middle' book.","review":"I enjoyed this book, but it fell a little shy in comparison with the first installment in this five book 'trilogy.' While still very good, the narrative dragged in places, failing to engage me as thoroughly as the first part. I find this a common problem for 'middle books' in trilogies, and it is understandable in a way - the set-up is done, the initial crises have happened, but the resolution isn't due yet. The immediate sense of dread that the first part created doesn't sustain as well here, especially when it becomes obvious that the bad things will continue to happen. Nonetheless, it is still a great book (in two parts), it offers much to ponder, moves the story along well, and leaves the reader ready for the conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Private Prayer Against Public War","review":"I read this book again just as the United States was launching its attack on Iraq and thought if only our leaders had read it and taken it to heart before deciding to go to war.

About as pretentious as the Russian lettering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....They once used to be a very creative band","review":"and all that's left are some clueless, punk wanna be/california, banal songs that don't even get close to the old TON dark, melodic psychedelic melancholy.....ehh. Waist of time and money by all means; and by the way pictured Rasputin have with all this talent less banging and simple lyrics?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this release. The reasons is because more than half the album is noisy feedback, and Peter Steele's songwriting shows how jaded he is with life, and the band. The lyrics are very juvenile and uncreative, and musically, just noisy feedback that lasts for 15 minutes a track.The only song I like off this album is 'These Three Things'. I really didn't even care for September Sun, reminds me of Adam Sandler's song that he sang to Drew Barrymore in the movie \\"Wedding Singer\\". This is the first TON album that I can honestly say that I do not like. I only like one song off the album, and even then its not what I call a radio friendly hit.Sorry Peter and Crew, but your not getting any younger, and the music isn't getting better. Quit while you are ahead so I can enjoy the great music that was once October Rust and Bloody Kisses. I guess this is what happens when you run out of ideas when you are pushing 50.The Dream really is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HEAR DEAD PEOPLE","review":"My god what have these guy's done. What a mixed mess. Josh Silver used to produce a band called pist-on and there cd was called NO 1. Well this should be called NO 2. Because it sure smells like it. Better yet there last cd should have been called DEAD and this one DEAD AGAIN. ILL bet Roadrunner Records are glad to get rid of these guy's. They take a 10 minute song and make it sound like 20 minutes, Its like the energizer bunny it goes on an on and on and on. They have one song that sounded pretty good but than they have to ruin it with a stupid Russian chant. It's an old saying if it ain't broken don't fix it. You guy's better go back listen to some of your old cd's and WAKE UP, WAKE UP. Call you next cd Awake Again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to my favorite band from Brooklyn??","review":"I have to say I was far from impressed with the most recent outing of the Boys from Brooklyn's talents. Ok I know not every CD can be as good as October Rust and I wouldn't want a repeat performance but geez! Out of the entire CD there were only 2 tracks that were even remotely close to the kind of music that I love and expect from one of my favorite rock bands (and even those were so unmemoroable that I can't recall them at the moment) How disappointing! I'm sorry to say I expected much much more from these guys than the generic thrash metal bang clang roar that I heard here. I think I'll go play some of their REAL music and sob in my corner now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long live Peter Steele!!","review":"How sad that this ended up being his last album.

For as long as it took for this to come out, I figured something may be worth looking at. In my opinion it's kind of boring. Most of the start of the album sounds the same. Without going overboard and writing a ridiculous long review. It's okay for the completist to add to the collection but, nothing really stands out. It's just Type O."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. Sadly.","review":"I waited for a very long time for Type O to come out with a new release and like many others, I was sadly disappointed with Dead Again. It is uninspired and BORING. There isn't much else to say except I wish it was more 'goth' because no other band I know could ever do the vampire goth music like Type O. This is just boring music."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Let me start by saying i am a huge Type O fan, have been since the early 90's. This is album is by no way the Type O negative I know and love. It sounds like a weak attempt to sound more like Carnivore, which it does not. (Carnivore albums are much better than this. Will i say I hate the album? No, i think September Sun is a great track, the best track on the album. I can honestly say it is my least favorite Type o album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not woth the wait","review":"I'll be the odd one out in this review but here it goes. October Rust was the best album ever. I've been waiting for this album like most hardcore fans for sometime expecting the creativety and musical magic of TON but this album is basically disappointing. I always believed that Peter Steele wrote the lyrics of TON while taking a dump and unfotunately this one stinks bad.Is it worth buying ? I'd say most are buying because the wait has been so long. If your a big fan like me BUY IT and hopefuly yo'll enjoy it more than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catholic???","review":"This is my second favorite Type O record, with \\"Slow, Deep and Hard\\" being the first. With that said, this album is what everyone has been waiting for since \\"October Rust\\" came out and ruined all the hardness that was left of the band. \\"World Coming Down\\" was heavy but slow and not very intense. This album grabs you and throws you to the ground. My only complaint is some of the lyrical content, there are lots of Apocalyptic and Catholic tones, and it's from the guy who wrote \\"Jesus Hitler\\" no less... still a 4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"A departure from anything GOOD","review":"As a loyal fan of Type O going back to Bloody Kisses, it pains me to say that in my opinion the band has lost their way with Dead Again. It feels derivative, lazy and uninteresting. I gave it three listens, trying to find something in it appealing, and aside from September Sun, came up short.Took it out of the changer, put in their previous work, and I was much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Type O in their mediocre mode","review":"Well it seems that Type O Negative are back in their mediocre mode which means that the Dead Again is an album of long, overwrought and confused songs that really needed a) to be tightened up and focused or b) left on the cutting room floor or in a notebook of song ideas to be revisited. Some fans love this kind of album because it's edgy (ooh!) but not me. Go buy October Rust or World Coming Down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Photos...But Nothing more ...","review":"This is not the book you are looking for i think..

It provides a fresh look at women as disciples, and a different slant on 'sin'. The author discusses the teachings of Jesus in the context of the teachings of Plato and the Stoics. Understanding the philosophical context of Jesus' times provides insight into what he taught, and what Mary of Magdala had to say about his teachings. It's worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT GOSPEL.","review":"If the Catholic church in 400 AD accepted this Gospel, Dan Brown would be a poor man. The argument between science and religion would never have happen. One must be willing to read very slowly, even repeating the same paragraph several time to understand the meaning. A great book for Philosophy students and the clergy. Most will be in denial of this Gospel but what else is new. A new meaning to being \\"a women\\" in the time of Jesus and being a follower of his. Also see the true St. Peter through Mary's eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rehash of old data","review":"This book brings together supposedly historical documents supporting the idea that Mary Magdlene was wife of Jesus, and also the thirteenth apostle.

Immediately upon reading the book, I found it to be old-fashioned and sexist. For example, on page 4 Bradshaw says, \\"What a child needs is a firm but understanding caretaker, who needs to be getting her own needs met through her spouse.\\" Further on in the book he talks about how a mother is supposed to bake pies, a daughter is supposed to do the dishes, the son is supposed to save the family from a fire, and the father is supposed to take the family on vacation.Even disregarding the sexist comments, the book offers very little new information. For the most part, Bradshaw is pulling from other authors such as Alice Miller, who has obviously written about these subjects in a much more logical and efficient manner. Bradshaw is redundant, often commits circular reasoning, and does not appeal to the gifted individual he speaks about so often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graet Book","review":"This deals very pragmatically with the issue of shame.

This music is wholly organic, complex and orchestral. You will find no trendy techno interludes or thrashing guitar here... just over an hour of sheer orchestral beauty, all organized by one of the prominent voices in action music today: Marco Beltrami.

The composer utterly failed to capture the pace and excitement that has become a trademark of the Die Hard series soundtrack. His music is atmospheric to the point where you can hear crickets chirping practically. A Die Hard film's score has to be fast and loud.

Sometimes the style of the other songs just does not match what mood the album is putting me in, and I get jarred out of my trance enough to go over and flip to the next song.I love this CD for trancing and dancing, and sometimes for yoga. (I know, weird. I am.) Very Goth tones make for cool slow moving dancing.I reccommend this one, although some of his other one song/many versions don't always hold up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one that all will know...","review":"Ok, let's face it, you're buying this disc for one of two reasons: a)you like NIN and this is a must own for your collection (and it IS) or b) you, along with those other people who like the song Closer, are just buying it because you don't want to get into NIN, but just want this one song, along with a few remixes, on a disc. Either way, the fan will be satisified.Closer to God, the opening track, is a remix of Closer. Not only is it a great track (my favorite of the cd) but it surpasses the original version. This one has a great, and catchy, drum beat, synth-lines, and guitar riff. Not only that, but some of the lyrics are different as well.The other standout track on this single is Memorbilla, a great dance track.Besides that, I won't be saying much else, because after the first listen, those tracks which I spoke of became my favorites on the single.

But then they lost their way in an attempt to break through commercially.This record, Sleep No More, is easily the best record of its kind to come out of the early 1980's. There is a sort of geometric symmetry to the music, rivalled only by Joy Division for sheer atmospheric intensity.Stand out tracks include Dark Parade, Be Brave and Our Secret. I've been listening to this LP regularly for more than 20 years, and even now the cohesion and narrative power as well as the amazing interplay between the band makes it essential.

This is a book I would share with friends who have only heard misinformation about the craft. It is beautiful and gentle in it's presentation. I do agree that the separation between witchcraft and wicca needs to be made more clear, though many wiccans are also witches one doesn't need to practice witchcraft to practice wicca.

There are still some things I don't belive in, but I continue to have an open mind and will continue to bye books on these subjects. If you are just learning this is a great starter book.

Other rituals I attend do this the same way so I was concerned to see this book laying out ritual in this matter. It is not to learn ritual from. The four quarters are our guardians.

This machine will not accurately read blood pressure (some of the numbers that i got would suggest that I could not possibly be conscious, let alone sitting here typing a review!)

Returned the second one as well. Save your time and look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product I've ever had","review":"This is one of the worst product I've ever known. I bought it as a birthday gift for my 70-year-old mother. She was very happy with it, since she wanted one for a while. She opened the box and tried right away. She got 150/110. Then I tried. I used to be a semi-profession soccer player. My heart rate is around 50, and blood pressure is around 90/60. But this machine gave me 128/92. Even worse, 3 days later, my mom told me she'd got 185/150, and similar results 3 times in a roll. That really pissed me off, since I didn't mean to spending my hard earned money on garbage like that, especially on my mom's birthday gift. At that time, I still didn't think the product was badly designed. So, I bought an exactly same model from Target. If this one works well, I'll return the other one to Amazon. To my suprise, the new one acts just like the previous one. What can I say, HoMedics?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BPA-200 Revies","review":"I've had the BPA-200 for about a year.

They said my blood pressure was 110/77. What a relief.I've tried the unit several times this week and the readings were scattered, but all were high. Previously I had a Panasonic manual unit.

Have checked with supplier to make sure I understand instructions and have followed written instructions to the letter, BUT....I have double checked it 7-8 times at 2 doctor's offices and twice with the local firestation/emt, and in all cases this unit has consistently been 15-20 points higher than the others. The doctors/emt recommend that I get one with an upper arm cuff because they have a larger measuring area than the typically small wrist types. We shall see. I may have gotten a defective unit, but Amazon was great with my return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I have found myself in a situation that requires me to monitor my blood pressure every few hours, every day. My machine is the 300, and is very accurate. It matches the Cardiologist, as well as my local Doctor's units very, very closely. These units are not designed to be as accurate as a Doctor's, but are designed to help you monitor your blood pressure on a regular basis. If your numbers swing a lot (like mine), then you need to be able to track this, and report it to your Doctor. This machine does a great job of tracking, and holding the information. I am very pleased, and will buy another one just like it if something ever happens to this one.Just my humble opinion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from La-crosse products at all costs.","review":"I purchased this product 1 year ago.

The bookfs authors introduce a broad array of investment theories and discoveries. Thatfs a plus. But their wordy sentences, which grow wordier and harder to follow as they delve into each chapterfs key concepts, offset the plus. The authorsf inconsistent use of terminology is another drawback. As I move on to later chapters, I feel as if the authors were growing more verbose. That benefits no readers, given the later chapters discussing higher-level concepts.When they revise this book for the next edition, they should hire proofreaders, journalists if possible. They care about readers and can help rewrite the entire book into a readable piece that helps students instead of confusing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grueling Read","review":"The authors make even the interesting areas of finance unimaginably dull with long, confusing sentences and few real world examples. I also think the textbook is setting students up for failure by presenting formulas without enough discussion of the assumptions going into those formulas.

A 3.5, maybe?","review":"This was a fun book - where the first series was a giddy splatterfest, this second story arc takes the premise more seriously and has the super-zombies returning to Earth in search of a trans-dimensional portal so that they can find another universe to feast on. There they encounter the remnants of Earth's population, including several super-survivors, and thus the race is on. Kirkman does some interesting stuff combining super-prosthetic technology with the whole can't-kill-'em premise, and for fans of the superhero and zombie genres this remains a highly entertaining book. Several characters - Wolverine, Ororo - remain little more than walking furniture in this volume, but it's hard to complain about weak characterization in a book where the main point is to see how hard it is to kill the participants.

The use of the bird at times reminded me ofThe Conference of Birds (Penguin Classics)- an allusion that Cunningham encourages by his reference to Persia. Through the book there are quotations, for example Vasily Rozanov, and allusions, for example a cup of hemlock in the context of philospher (think Socrates). And at times his writing reminds me strongly of other contemporary writers - Edmund Jabes, Anne Carson, and someone whose name is eluding me :-).The book, however, should not be read in a critical mindset - rather is is appropriately read and reread letting the images in which the philosophy is couched embed themselves in your mind as they are embedded in the mind of the author. Only then do Cunninham's questions and suppositions regarding power, politics, reality, language ... shine within their own context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stayed With Me","review":"I started this book thinking, \\"A simple read.\\" And I thought it was, at first.

I have taken it with me on many trips including AL, TN, CA and around FL. It has always found my destination. I have recently bought a new GPS to replace this one. Here is why. This unit is now about 5 years old in technology. At the time it first came out it was state of the art. But not anymore. It is big and heavy. It does not have a touch screen, but it was not hard to program in a destination. The map is always displayed with north facing up and the cursor will go in the direction you are heading so if going south then the cursor is heading down. Newer GPS's change the orientation of the map so you are always heading straight ahead.I got a very good price on this unit when I bought it but GPS's with more features are less expensive now.

This isn't what made the Surfaris great!

This VHS contains great cameras, great picture, great audio, etc... but the most important thing, the performance, is worse than an average one. I still don't understand why U2 didn't release Buenos Aires or Santiago 1998 instead.

The concert was lame then and it is lame on DVD. It is not the video quality, but the material itself. Popmart was really a diversion for U2. The concert is disjointed and the music isn't U2's best.In the Popmart DVD Bono reminds me of one of those mediocre Techno Miami superficial artists. Alot of superficial lights and video, but not much substance with respect to the music. The excessive showmanship overshadows the band and the music.I am so glad U2 decided to return to their Alternative Rock roots with the \\"Elevation\\" and \\"Virtigo\\" Tours. Otherwise I would no longer be a dedicated fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was in this concert","review":"I was in this concert, I was only 20 years old and I remember that in many radio segments saids that U2 didn't going to play that day because they had a sereius problem one day before with the son of the president of Mexico, but they didn't cancel the concert and played one of the best concert on they history.This DVD really doesn't have price"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the DVD - the VHS version is not worth it!","review":"If you've recently purchased the Elevation Live from Boston DVD, you'll find a sample of the Popmart VHS in the extras. The sound, even on the short clip provided, is so superior to that on the VHS version of Popmart that it is worth waiting for the producers to get their act together and release a DVD version of this great concert. I recommend to all to wait patiently - perhaps they'll get the message."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best concert videos i've ever seen","review":"Ok, to start this off, i am not one of those \\"i'd die for Bono\\" type U2 fans. I would call my enjoyment pedestrian at best. But this would have to be one of the best concert videos i've ever seen, compared only to Pink Floyd's Delicate Sound of Thunder. The song list, the light show, the camera work, the timing. Each aspect adds to the overall enjoyment factor. I wish it was available on DVD. OK, that's all. buy this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"great show during a much-maligned tour","review":"U2's Popmart tour was much maligned in the U.S., perhaps rightfully so, beginning with a much-hyped, then disasterous first show in Las Vegas. However, once the band got the kinks out (e.g., decided to drop the Karoke segment and do \\"Staring at the Sun\\" acoustic), the Popmart show was incredible. As always, the new songs had new twists - \\"Mofo\\", \\"Last Night on Earth\\", and \\"Please\\" were done much better live than on the 'Pop' (1997) record. Other highlights include \\"All I Want Is You\\" combined with INXS' \\"Never Tear Us Apart\\" (which was a subtlety not lost to this viewer, considering that INXS singer had just died), the Edge's solo rendition of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", and rocking versions of \\"Discotheque\\" and \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me.\\"Still, the Popmart show, although larger and thematically more coherent, did not live up to the mind-blowing experience of its predeceasor, ZooTV. Thus, I would recommend this video for hardcore U2 fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Universal Church of U2","review":"I've worshipped at the Church of U2 since 1980, seen them live three times and regard them as the greatest band of all time, as well as an ecstatic spiritual experience that facilitates full body immersion in transcendent beauty. True believers, as well as heretics of the way should check out this DVD if only for three tracks - \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\", \\"Please\\" and \\"Where the Streets Have No Name.\\" Bono and the Boys deliver the goods, displaying over-the-top musical energy, power and brilliance matched by only a few bands in the history of rock. Put aside preconceived assumptions, have some fun and experience The Mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention PopMart shoppers","review":"U2's much maligned PopMart Tour was actually a pretty spectacular piece of entertainment. The concert, the songs and U2 themselves make this a worthwhile video. However, what hurts this video the most is the rather lackluster picture quality. The Mexico City concert was broadcast on Pay-Per-View, and this video is simply a recording of the event (although it was reportedly pieced together from U2's two Mexico City gigs). U2 fans will buy this video no questions asked; casual fans may want to get ZOO TV: Live From Sydney first because of the latter's glorious picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Ironic!!!!","review":"This book was really ironic.Elizabeth ended up loving J.High while Jessica hated it.We got introdused to 2 chacters Anna&Salvador.There was alot of jealosy in this book.Jessica throws herself at the sofistacated Lacey.While Salvador invades a friendship thinking it was a little more.This is a must have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SVJH got real","review":"I loved this book.

Elizabeth doesn't hang out with Maria and Todd anymore either. I don't like the way we read from Salvador and Annas point of view. To me Annas a whimp spilling gatorade all over Elizabeth because she was jealous and Salvador seems disgusting picking lettuce out of Elizabeths teeth. But I do like reading from Jesses and Lizs point of view. Why does Anna keep saying Ever since Tim? I thought the scool was supposed to be just built and there would be some kids from Secca lake there. But they keep meeting them at the mall or the ice cream store. Aren't they from another town?

The book is just very amateurish. There is some excellent gay fiction out there by some very talented writers. This book is not one of them. I honestly couldn't finish it. One of the worst I've ever read.Just trying to help some of you not waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Buy Ever","review":"I have been using cheaper versions of this product for years.

It is about fighting her sadness and lonliness and growing up amidst the horrors of war. Yoko compellingly compares her friends in New York struck with AIDS, to the sufferings of the people in Hiroshima. It is an album where she expells her demons, but manages to bring you up again to a safe shore...and show you some Great music/instrumentation, feeling and just about everything else with her son Sean Lennon's band IMA. It manages to have a Fresh alternative sound and keep the listener interested.Very Yoko--Very reccomended! ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 10 best book ever","review":"This book is among the ten best books I've ever read. I would highly recommend this one to anyone. It is the perfect blend of history and fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment!!","review":"After reading the storyline and other reviews, I figured it would be a book worth reading--I was very wrong! The book was very violent, the language was trashy, the characters very strange (to say the least) and the book was 400 pages too long. I kept thinking it HAS to get better, but it never did. I admit, it is not the type of story I would normally be attracted to and now I know why...the storyline was so convaluted and some of the history was interesting, but name dropping within the storyline became boring and so much didn't connect that I am not sure how I made it through the book. It was a total waste of time and I would not recommend it to anyone! I rated it one star because I had to complete the field and the lowest number available was one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Start - Weak Finish","review":"This is like reading two books. The first half is good historical fiction including 1700's Ireland (kind of a 1700s Angela's Ashes), sea voyage to New York, Slave Trade, and good character development. The last half is a far-fetched story of Cormac's living without aging for 200+ years in New York (although he had to go to the dentist after eating jelly beans). The New York documentary is great, but unfortunately falls flat with shallow story line and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much more.","review":"The book's premise had such great possibilities. Being a huge NYC fan I read it hoping to learn more of the city's history in an enjoyable novel instead of a dry history book. Instead the author spends a large portion of the novel in Ireland, and then skips over most of the city's history (except for too much time on Boss Tweed) until the climax on 9/11. Where was his editor? Too much \\"PC\\" and large chunks of boring writing. Don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magically Luxury in a Novel.","review":"Peter Hamill has woven together densely rich descriptions of time, history, religion, Ireland, New York, war, racism and love in his book Forever. It is a luxuriously slow read, so vivid and beautiful, it makes you want to take your time as you journey along. And Hamill's concept of what it means to live forever--and the pain involved therein--is a unique look at the thing we all think we want most--immortaility. Suspend your disbelief, yes, but dive right into the magic! Forever is by far the best novel I have read this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"pete hamill","review":"pete hamill is always good reading....especially for new yorkers who are familiar with new york city, past or present. this is an unusual history, combining realism and fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Being completely ignorant of Irish history, I found the first part of thebook to be the best. I know others say the second half is the only part worth while. The whole thing is gripping, epic, historic, and fulfilling. I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rare Book I Threw Out","review":"I went into this book looking forward to something great from Pete Hamill. Uunfortunately I was severly disappointed. The main character is someone you grow to be indifferent about and the story is predictable, too long and boring. Mr. Hamill is obsessed with certain topics and that is clearly apparent. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very good read","review":"This book is like a saga with many whips and turns that is a well crafted, detailed masterpiece that tells of the life, the historical and magical life of Cormac O'Connor, who's achieved more than any human in a lifetime. This book had me laughing and crying, and at the end left me breathless. Well worth the hours I spent in bed reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a good book","review":"....but he got carried away with wanting to list all the people who have ever been connected with New York...which was quite boring. I started out liking it and the Irish history but about half way through questioned whether or not I'd finish it. The story line was lost so many times in the name dropping. I skipped over the last 10 chapters and am still not finished. I give up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I bought the book very excited about 'visiting' New York through the past centuries. Hamill does not include enough description to create the places in the story for the reader. I felt like I was just in the tiny world surrounding Cormac. And after 600 pages, I have not come to care about Cormac O'Connor or what happens to him. Hamill does not effectively communicate any real feeling from him, though his experiences should be incredibly emotional and intense. The plot is predictable and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the history","review":"I loved this book. It has some great historical events in it. I loved the historical parts so much I was almost sad when in got to the modern times, but a story does have to progress. If it were not for the fact he lives so long you could think this was just a novel about a persons life, it does not read like fantasy book even with the premise. It has lots of real life episodes. I think the ending is good too, but I won't spoil that here. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"NYC Historical Fiction - at its best.","review":"This is a great piece of historical fiction - especially if you're interested in the history and evolution of New York City. On top of that the story line is great. Totally worth the read - you'll be recommending this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!","review":"Forever is one of the best books I have read this year. This novel is in the same league as Caleb Carr's The Alienist and maybe even better. I loved the historical aspect and watching Manhattan grow from a small town to a bustling metropolis. The main characters Cormac and Kongo were expertly crafted. This was the first time I read Pete Hamill but it definitely will not be my last. I left off a star because I thought the book could have covered a broader section of history instead of focusing intensely on a few periods."},{"rating":"1","title":"My reaction? Meh.","review":"The premise of this book was the reason I bought it. Given immortality, a man experiences pretty much the entirety of the history of NYC. I must have missed the part where he witnessed history. New York played a big part in this country's past, but it has been reduced to a couple of the sentences in the lengthy and tedious love life of a man who barely rates as a character in the book. The character is told that in order to be immortal, he has to actually LIVE. He didn't do that, in my estimation. Other than an association with Boss Tweed and an eyewitness account of 9/11, he seems to have missed every single historical event that took place in New York. Immortality was definitely wasted on this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay attention to the review distribution","review":"Do you people see that the reviews are NOT top-heavy with the positives? There is a reason for that. I can't remember reading a more ridiculous example of pc nonsense, with the author imposing our modern sensibilities on a character some 300 years back. There is no character development, no change, no learning, NO relationship dynamics. Awful. Don't waste your money. If I could give this book negative stars, I would do so infinitely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I read the author's Snow in August and liked it very much although I had to suspend belief. But this one goes over the edge and I couldn't make sense of it all. Read about the first half and then decided it wasn't worth my time. No more Pete Hamill books."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes \\"Forever \\"to read.","review":"Interesting from a historical point of view, but tedious to wade through.The concept of multi-generational revenge doesn't make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled expectations","review":"Being familiar with this author's work, I immediately bought this book. I was hoping for an extraordinary piece of fiction set against the rich historical background on NYC. But I was severely disappointed. While I enjoyed the upfront part of the book and the story of the character's life in Ireland and the ongoing religious struggle, this kind of depth did not continue when the book shifted to New York. Furthermore, I found it distasteful that 9-11 was used as a device to bring on the book's denouement. Not only was it insensitive, in my opinion, but the set up was so transparent that one could see it coming a mile away."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a waste.......","review":"Pete Hamill is a good writer, I read him all the time in the Daily News and enjoy seeing him expound on the history of NYC on the NY PBS specials, etc - I even liked seeing him in \\"King of New York\\". However, this book, and the idea for the story, though it was amazing, was a blown opportunity. Making Cormac a figure that rubbed elbows with George Washington, Boss Tweed, etc., was too much, and the 'suspense' leading up to September 11 was a bit ridiculous. His writing seemed like he had to ensure 550+ pages to his publisher, at times. The story from Ireland to NY was great, but he really got carrid away and made too much of well known history (Draft Riots, Tammany, and others) and not enough of daily life. I felt like I was 300 years old by the time I finished the disappointing ending, and, as a New Yorker and someone that works downtown Manhattan, almost insulted by the ending. Nevertheless, I still like Pete, I just wouldn't recommed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for everyone in lower Manhattan","review":"A great New York epic, Pete Hamill is wonderful at presenting characters you want to spend time with and understand the choices they make over the course of the novel. The premise works, sharing a history of the obvious, and not so familiar milestones of Manhattan. Lower Manhattan is rich with history and with all the discussion surrounding the WTC memorial, the impact of which will be felt for centuries, Forever shows New Yorkers how the city got to where NYC is today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Start, But Worth the Read","review":"Like many other reviewers, I too found the beginning of the book to be somewhat flat, however, when the main character gets to NYC in 1941, the city shares the spotlight. I thought that the Hamill's New York characters and city had depth. Having grown up in Boston, I have been to NYC on many occasions and found some of the historical references of the city to be fun and interesting. Also, the Forrest Gump - like participation in well documented historical events (saving General Washington, friend of Boss Tweed, etc.) was great. A fun read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"This is what the novel supposedly is about: \\"This is the magical, epic tale of Cormac O'Connor, who arrives in New York City from Ireland in 1741 and remains, well, forever. For Cormac has been given the gift of immortality, but only on the condition that he never leave the island of Manhattan.\\" Well I got as far as page 211 and gave up since this plot still hasn't occurred in the book. If Hamill ever got around to it, it might have been a good story, but I don't like authors wasting hours of my time waiting for a story that hasn't occurred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Conclusion","review":"Although the pace of this novel was, as other reviewers pointed out, a bit slow, the story did contain interesting historical and cultural information. If you buy-into the magical elements (which was a bit of a stretch even for a paranormal enthusiast such as myself), the story of Cormac's journey through history is engaging.However...I found the ending disappointing to the point of being annoying. Cormac's choices and ultimate fate were more like that of a romance novel than a respectable work of fiction. Considering his long journey through Irish, African and American history, his final choice (I won't be a spoiler and reveal it here) was inconsistent with both the character and common sense. Cormac, of all people, should have a better perspective on the fleeting nature of life...but he doesn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More episodic than epic.","review":"As many other reviewers have said, the idea is intriguing. Could have made for a great historical epic. I loved \\"Snow In August,\\" a fantasy full of authenticity ... something about \\"Forever\\" didn't seem quite so authentic. I had doubts early on when Cormac's father suddenly told \\"Robert\\" that he was a Celt named Cormac O'Connor -- especially because what his father described sounded more like contemporary New Age 'Celtic paganism' (i.e. post-1950) than the multi-faceted warrior culture that Hamill seems to want it to be. A lot of things about the family seemed out-of-place in 18th Century Ireland. I also thought that it should have started with Cormac's desire for revenge, and that Hamill should have sent him to America right away.\\"Snow In August\\" was a believable fantasy; this wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland writing","review":"I bought this book because the story line sounded interesting, but I couldn't get past the poor writing. The sentences are completely devoid of any lyrical qualities. The bumpy cadence was so distracting that I abandoned the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I am a fan of historical fiction, a fan of all things Irish, and of New York City history so when I saw this book I picked it up immediately and excitedly. What a huge disappointment! I have not read Peter Hamill before, but I know a good story from a bad one and this is all bad. Try watching Star Wars on an old black and white TV with a broken static-filled speaker and you may have an idea of what it like to read this book. Characters were two-dimensional. I repeatedly got the impression that Pete Hamill had to finish this book as quickly as possible with little heed for telling a good story. I certainly did not lose any sleep on this one. Try Kevin Baker's Dreamland or Joseph O'Connor's Star of the Sea if you want a riveting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book Written By And For The Author; Not For The Reader","review":"Pete Hamill is a fine writer and his \\"Snow In August\\" is one of my all-time favs. But this \\"Forever\\" fantasy lacked a theme. The story was not unified like, for instance, a river... instead it fell all over the place, like rain. Some parts of New York;s history (and its characters) were ignored, others over exphasized. The sex and the hero's unusual, dream-like sexual partners strained the imagination. I can understand the \\"pull\\" these things have for a writer when spinning a fantasy, but I thought the author over indulged himself in that vein. Also, is it possible that Hamill's hero could live hundreds of years and learn so little? Develop so meagerly? I read every word because I trust Pete Hamill. I wasted my time. But - hey! - even the Babe struck out now and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent Manhattan","review":"This novel starts slow, but quickly builds momentum. Pete Hamill masterfully draws the reader into the rich tapestry of protagonist, Cormac's experiences on the island of Manhattan. Although the ending could be argued cliche, the novel is worth the journey through the history of Manhattan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff and fantasy","review":"As some other reviewers, I was hugely disappointed in this book. I enjoyed some of the historical scenes but some of the dialogue and situations just made me roll my eyes. I could never quite get connected with Cormac who lives forever. Just when I was into the history, some bizarre feat of fantasy would interrupt. I especially felt the ending was contrived. The book had potential, but just did not live up to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpected disappointment!","review":"I found this book to scratch so many historic surfaces yet never once did I find any depth. Hamill's writing causes me to read and want more, but never got it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aptly titled","review":"Pete Hamill named his book correctly in that it does, indeed, take forever to trudge through. He spends too much time setting up the story and then seems to run out of steam, skipping over entire sections of the city's history. Additionally, the ending was weak and unfinished. It is apparent that the events of 9/11 were retrofitted into the narrative after the author had completed his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Yes. The author can write well. In the technical aspect. But the story felt dead and it seemed like I was dragging my feet reading it just to get through. And worst of all, the thing that made me keep reading was the GOAL that he had set out to accomplish! and then the ending! Good grief. The MOST anticlimactic ending I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Refreshing . . .","review":"After spending the summer reading the best-seller murder-mystery type books, and deciding that they were getting rather repetitive, I picked up this book and was very pleasantly surprised . . . It is not your run-of-the-mill, boilerplate story. It is historical, magical, and very readable. I highly recommend this book for everyone who would like to take a vacation from the ordinary and jump into the magical world of immigration and the history of New York City."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absorbing Tale, Spanning the New York City Experience","review":"The premise of the novel, that Cormac O'Connor lives for centuries in New York City requires taking a giant step into fantasy, however once the reader is drawn into the life of this \\"immortal everyman,\\" the story becomes compelling and absorbing. The author, a respected journalist and novelist, has crafted a masterful tale of an Irish Jew who is magically given immortality, provided that he never leaves the isle of Manhattan. From the mid-1700's until the present day September 11th events, Mr. Hamill weaves a richly textured story of history and individual experience.There are times when some elements of the story suffer from excessive \\"political correctness,\\" however, the characterizations are rich, the plot is simple with just enough twists to make it interesting, and the themes are universal (justice, compassion, etc.). This is a fine novel, both thought provoking and entertaining at all levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying, Boring, Crap.","review":"Noticed how I cleverly used ABC in the title of my review. Those are the first 3 letters in the alphabet! Get it. That's about how clever Forever is. I became so annoyed with this boring book that I abandonded it somewhere in Thailand. It was the last book I brought on my trip, but, after a few hundred pages, I felt no book was better than this book. If you like books about a person who has a telepathic relationship with his horse and dog and vice versa, then this book is for you.I rarely review books on Amazon, but this book was such a waste of money, time and paper that I felt it my duty to warn fellow readers. If you like children's books, then read one of those, not this fantastical Easy Cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Wordy, Pacing Way Too Slow","review":"I also read this book, as another reviewer did, because of my love for New York, but the first several chapters lingered way too long in Ireland and I forced myself not to skim that part, to get to New York already. I believe Mr. Hamill could have told this story in about half the time, because of the plethora of unnecessary details that didn't push the story forward. As an author and an editor, I also found it wasn't very well written--there was much use of passive voice, some grammatical errors, and the prose could have been much tighter. It read like Mr. Hamill wrote a first draft, dashed it off to the publisher who didn't spend much time on copyediting, and rushed it into print. A DRINKING LIFE was worlds better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, oh why did he bother?","review":"Sorry, but I really did not like this book. I read it for a book club meeting, so I forced myself to wade through the whole book. I could not accept the premise or the combination of fantasy with almost naturalistic detail on the development of New York City. Moreover, once the protagonists parents died, there was no real character development - in fact, there were no real characters, just puppets moved around by the author.A lot of research went into the history of New York City, but I would have been happier to read a historical account than to find it in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I like historical novels which is why I bought this book. It turned out to be a disappointment. It is badly in need of editing. Very wordy, boring and a very tedious read. After finding that I was skipping large amounts of text just to \\"get on with it,\\" i decided to quit reading. Not worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books of all time.","review":"I'm not a literature critic or expert by any means but I just loved this book. The Irish and American history, the characters, the love stories, and the concept of what it might be like to live forever but still look about 40 yrs old the whole time.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visions of glory","review":"After just watching Gangs of New York, I can see it ties in closely with this book and gives a feel to the scene of New York City two centuries ago.. I have spotted a few errors in the time periods..the building of Trinity chuch in NYC was in mid l800, yet the chuch clearly is visible at the time of the revolution..perhaps a bit of closer editing for historical fact could have been used. The story itself is well done and full of surprises and characters..Pete Hamill has done it again, produced a fine work of fiction..or fantasy whichever one likes..both are suitable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever fails!","review":"Not a great choice for women- too much talk of balls, and sh%^, not to mention revolutions and sex without commitment. The premise is appealing- a person that gets to live effectively many different lives. But the stories are more like disconnected vignettes than one coherent tale (it is not surprising other reviewers have either loved the ireland vignette or the new york vignettes). More importantly, it fails because it is dark without levity for balance. Without levity, we cannot \\"really live life\\" or \\"remove the sludge\\" - the very things the author commands us to do. If you're tempted by the history of new york, you're better off with a text book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Beginning, poor middle - didn't finish it","review":"This was my first Peter Hamill book. I had heard much good stuff on reviews about this author. I choose the book at random, well mostly at random - i was interested in the NewYork theme. I was overjoyed when i read the first 39 chapters - don't get excited that was only 150 pages!. I was immersed in the story and I loved the North or Ireland story of growing up in south Belfast many years ago. A place I have spent many years in myself. When the story moves to NY the pace of the story changes and the quality of the plot changes with it. I got really bored with Cormac the reporter theme. Maybe it was my own fault for enjoying the Irish theme too much and not wanting it to change. Maybe I have no patience. Either way I didn't finish it and donated the book to my work book club. With so much choice of books today I moved on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it....","review":"Although this novel is filled with the extremely interesting history of New York, and, the premise is promising the character development is so weak that I soon found myself rolling my eyes and wondering if, indeed, the book would go on \\"Forever\\". Skip this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-read for the native new yorker","review":"having grown up my whole life in new york, reading a book like this has given me a multi-faceted view of the greatest city on earth. while i am still finishing it, i find it very hard to put it down. cormac is a wonderful character, and so are the people he comes across throughout his time. hamill makes you envious that cormac can see the progression of such a great city, but at the same time, pity him for all he has seen, which haunt his dreams. a truly wonderful read, from a historical and a literary perspective... highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"World class,east or west...","review":"With TNT on hiatus,Tony Harnell did not waste any time putting together another great band:Westworld.This is their amazing debut album,and every minute of it bears the mark of a supergroup(Westworld comprises members of TNT,Danger Danger,Riot ,and Rainbow).Great vocal harmonies and amazing arrangements will keep the listener interested spin after spin...it is bands like this that will put rock'n'roll back on the map.A four star album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

However, I have found that another book, titled The New Decorating Book (by Better Homes and Gardens magazine), does a better job of this. It's beautiful but also serves as a teacher. I learned about The New Decorating Book last winter when my daughter brought it home from school where it's being used to teach interior design basics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice packaging for same-oh, same-oh information","review":"This was a waste. I loved the look of the cover, but the book (1) has no photos, (2) has no information that I don't already have in my other decorating books. It has good basic info, but two other books (with photos!) do a much better job: I recommend Better Homes and Gardens THE NEW DECORATING BOOK and Terence Conran's EASY LIVING instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but other books cover the same ground","review":"The design basics in this book are covered as well in other books. I know, because when I signed up for an interior design class at a local junior college, the textbook was The New Decorating Book put out by Better Homes and Gardens. It covers balance, scale, and so on and also includes furniture templates for furniture arranging. And it has hundreds of excellent color pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book, and it was very helpful!","review":"I was looking for a basic, in-layman's-terms book that would give me a general knowledge of home decorating, and this book definitely did that. This book is like a decorating 101 course. It has pop-out furniture pieces that you can use to rearrange your furniture, pockets to keep paint samples and clippings handy, graph paper to sketch out room designs, etc. I really liked the chapter on color, too. My husband and I are building our first home, and this book will really come in handy as we go through the building process. I'm glad that I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help for Do-It-Yourself Decorating","review":"I found this book very helpful. It's a workbook with guidelines for making decorating choices, covering most aspects from color to furniture to flooring and a lot more.

I just bought another copy to give as a gift for another new homeowner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This game was incredibly fun and groundbreaking when it came out.

On the joy motif expressed in 2:24-26 he remarks: \\"In themselves and rightly used, the basic things of life are sweet and good.

I wore each of the 4 (diff colors) I purchased only once. So I would consider these disposable rings and will not be purchasing from this vendor again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I was a huge fan of Bruce Coville in 4th grade when I read the \\"My teacher is an alien\\" series. That series got me hooked to his style of writing, so of course I got my hands on every book of his I could. I read this book in 8th grade, 4 years ago. It is definitely an easy read, but I was completely carried off by the story and read it straight through the first time I picked it up. Then I read it through again, the very next day. I believe I've read it about 4 more times since then, just because it's such a great example of a rollicking, fairy-tale adventure. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants an entertaining, captivating read. I only gave it 4 stars because I think it could use some more description in places plus the simplistic language. It's still a beautiful tale, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"The book has a lot of different kinds of characters and it shows how women can do the same things that men do and sometimes even better. In this book the dragon cannot be killed in any of the usual ways; you need to know its name. Princess Winifred (Winnie for short) sets out to save the kingdom from the dragon, dressed as a boy. No one in the story knows that she is a girl, much less the princess.This is a very good book. I read this book in two days, because I kept on reading it and did not stop. Whenever I had a chance during school time, I read this book; I even brought it to lunch.Liz Levin, age 8"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aaron Carter's Mentors?","review":"I am a fan of Aaron Carter and bought this album because Aaron recorded Grand Skeem's \\"Shorti\\" as \\"My Shorty\\". Aaron Carter's version is quite close to the original on track 4 of this album. Track 15 is a remix which sounds completely different. This is sort of like an adult Aaron Carter album, which I am surprised did not include a \\"Parental Advisory\\" label. Sadly it will be difficult to get radio airplay because the government prohibits the use of the \\"F-Word\\". This is some great party music. So far my favorites are the remake of Sir Mix-a-Lot's \\"Baby Got Back\\", \\"Party Time\\", \\"In-n-Out\\", \\"Hit-n-Run\\", and \\"Shorti\\". There is reference to a girl named \\"Shorti\\" throughout this album. Obviously the folks at Jive records have been paying attention to this band. Aaron Carter's recent material sounds a lot like this record. Lead vocalist Ali Dee even sounds like Aaron Carter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It !!!","review":"Hey just wanted to say that I got my Grand Skeem album last week and I love it.

However, I cannot delude myself and accept that this is the best they have to offer. First, I had to fast forward through all the songs because I couldn't stand listening to Sammy Hagar screech. Second, if this version of the band is so great, why do they play some of their old classics? Face it VH fans, when the band was in its glory days, David Lee Roth was outrageous on stage and Eddie was ferocious on guitar. \\"Right Here, Right Now\\" had neither of these two elements; which makes it a waste of time. VH fans should go to Amazon Auctions and bid on rare concert footage that includes Roth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Halen live","review":"To bad this concert is only available in a dolby 2.0 sound version.

Very poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Hagar finally loses the plot.","review":"This DVD starts well for about 8 minutes and then slowly puts the watcher to sleep. Bits and pieces cut up to make up a concert. It's obvious to me that VH cannot play a concert through without things going wrong. Eddie's guitar solo piece is particularly disappointing as he makes so many mistakes. The other disappointment is that he has not written any additional original guitar solo work since the 'without a net' video. Shame Dave Lee Roth never released a live DVD when he was with Steve Vai. It would have made Van Hagar look like a bunch of amateurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind of Like a Video","review":"The solo that Eddie does is probably worth the price of the video. It features shots from only one of the nights, with a lot of good close-ups and clear views of Eddie's hands.Live Without a Net is definitely a better choice, if you don't have it. The playing on it is a lot better.Another problem with this DVD is that it frequently looks like an MTV video. By this, I mean that there is a lot of footage that doesn't quite synch up with the audio. Well, it's not really live if we're watching video from a different night, is it? One minute Hagar's wearing a shirt, the next minute he isn't. It's distracting. There are actually a couple of moments when I heard lead stuff going and saw Eddie playing a chord. That's just sloppy editing.BTW, none of this is the band's fault. They rocked, as usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanking!","review":"Now i know that there are alot of DLR-era die hard fans out there. And if your one of them then don't buy this video. Figures. Although sammy gives the DLR songs a good stab he doesn't pull them off with the same energy as Dave. Having said that, i am a young VH fan (i wasn't even around when David Lee Roth was frontman) and if DLR was still front man they would have gone out of fashion ages ago. And where is he today? the last i saw of him he was presenting 'Dave T.V' - that laughable effort to be noticed other than the ex-VH lead singer. To me, sammy is far better than Dave purely because he brought Van Halen into the modern world. This video is an excellent concert which truly blows your mind. THIS IS WHAT A ROCK CONCERT SHOULD BE. They also do Won't Get Fooled Again by The Who very well. Solos are excellent. Being a drummer myself you have to appreciate how hard it is to pull of a double bass drum rhythm so fast and for so long.

First off, since this is the only live DVD, I have to recommend it, just to see them play and listen to the incredible sounding music. The performance is great, they don't miss a note.Unfortunately, the original high quality video shooting is utterly butchered by editing two shows together. As mentioned by many others, it destroys any sense of \\"being there\\". It's basically the equivalent of lip-syncing, but worse. It's like reverse lip-syncing, the moron director syncing a different performance to the music.And another annoying factor is how often the director cuts away from Eddie right in the middle of a guitar solo in a song. Quite unbelievable.Nevertheless, like I said, this is all we got, as far as DVD, so it's certainly better than nothing. Just sit back, squint your eyes to not focus on the video too much, and enjoy the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Image and sound quality are not very well.","review":"The video quality of this DVD is average and this DVD has only PCM sound, no surround available.The image quality isThe bass is big, but not clear.

Hoever, this DVD pales in comparison to Van Halen's previous Live Without A Net VHS tape. The way the concert film was edited totally ruins this DVD concert experience. As others have pointed out, every few seconds, the band's clothes and guitars change... then change back... and then change again... within the same song! How stupid and distracting! I'm glad that the director who butchered this concert DVD introduced himself at beginning of the film, because I'll be sure to remember his name and avoid any of his other projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent Van Halen Life","review":"I just love Track #8 - Pleasure Dome/Drum Solo.

I assumed it was on it because it's on the CD- Between the concert there is interview footage with completely uninteresting information from all the band members.

I am an expert in Plato, I have every one of the Agora Plato Audio CDs, and want every one of Plato's dialogues to be done in this format by these performers! The great part of the Symposium Audio CD is that they use a woman for the part of Diotima, so it is always very clear whether Socrates (who is relating what Diotima supposedly said to him) or Diotima is speaking. The other performers are excellent as well - they truly bring the text to life. This is Plato as Plato intended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This video was a real disappointment!

He laughs and sings with all his other Veggie Tales videos but this one just makes him scream. The animations are dark and some of the music is like out of a horror film.

I highly recommend this for older children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining & Educational","review":"Both my daughter and I love this series.

But I'm not kidding...almost all \\"T\\" and \\"A\\" has been cut out of the R-rated version. You'd be better off closing your eyes and dreaming than to watch this movie.

The combination is easy to set and reset (however, it's not a sequential combination and each number can only be used once...if you select 3-1-4-2-8 then you just push down the numbers in any order (if you push 1-2-3-4-8 then it will open). That doesn't seem as secure as a sequential combination but I had my friend try to open it without giving him the combination and he was at for 2 hours before giving up...just don't choose something stupid like 1-2-3-4 or have it set to include every number and it's plenty secure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple!","review":"Easy to use.

I would not recommend this product to anybody who is using this product outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Daring","review":"I used it to sell my home by owner. The downside is that obviously I had to give it to realtors. Only one realtor was unaware enough to repeat the number with her clients sitting right there.

It is very easy to program and use, and looks and feels to be very well made. You need to program 5 numbers into it. One drawback is the lettering for the numbers, which are raised black numbers that match the whole finish.

Go to \\"gesecurity.com\\", which is the only contact info listed on the product packaging and inserts, and you are directed to additional websites with product brands having nothing to do with the name of this product.A pox on GE for both #1 and #2.

It has the power to take one to the time it describes, in this instance the early-mid ninteenth century in france. Julien Sorel is an ambitious character who tries to make his way by embracing hypocrisy - this is impossible for someone who isn't completely corrupt and so he is doomed to failure. Julien cannot control his passions or his sense of honour and this is what makes a seemingly calculating and sly character ultimately appear vulnerable and heroic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little TOO good...","review":"I purchased 2 of these lifter rods to replace the ones on my 2000 Honda Accord V6 after the hood closed on my back a few weeks ago when I was cleaning the throttle body. The fit was perfect, but this thing packs quite a heck of a spring: having 2 of these installed causes my hood to open like a catapult.

The movie details the relationships between two lost souls, maybe three if you count the dead cat, travelling through a Southwestern dessert in search of...their minds, their car, \\"success\\"? You really need this seminar...oops, movie. Crispin Glover is awesome as Ruben, an ecclectic 70's throwback who happens to like cat sqeaky toys and platform shoes and Howard Hesseman who plays a convincing Ed--a wanna-be motivational real estate recruiter who's going through some personal dilema's with a crazy ex-wife and a life going nowhere until he meets Ruben. Great dialog and scenary, I can't imagine my life without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat can eat a whole watermellon!","review":"Ruben & Ed is a diamond in the rough. I rented this movie one day because I could find nothing that I wanted to see, so I took a chance. My friend and I took it home and have been hooked ever since. It is right at the top of my 10 best movies. It is refreshing, and surreal. Howard Hessman (Ed) reminds me of the majority of realtors I have ever met. There are so many subtle jabs of humor that it is mind boggling... the knock on the door of the prospective client at the exact second, and the quick last second urgent fart immediately prior to the door opening... a big smile for the client.... it explains Ed's entire downward slide in life. And Ruben, not one to have his orderly life altered is thrown into a tailspin by the untimely demise of his cat, and Ed, and the desperate journey to return life to the way things were.A great movie to experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favs!","review":"There are two movies that I enjoy more than all others.

Rubin and Ed has beautiful cinematography,A good soundtrack, and humor that hits you every time you watch the film. a ten plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why didn't this movie win any Oscars?!!!","review":"Rubin & Ed is a cult classic that should be enjoyed by everyone. With one liners like \\"My cat can eat a whole watermelon\\" and \\"Why don't you keep your hands off of other people's refrigerators!\\" the movie has got to be good. Where else can you see a waterskiing cat that does tricks (e.g. no hands)? In what other movie are platform shoes used as a deadly weapon? Where else can you see 6ft tall platform shoes? Where else can you see a guy try and bury his dead frozen cat only to pack it back up because it's \\"not the right spot\\"? Where else can you see Crispin Glover drink the sweat from his odor eaters by wringing them out into his mouth in the middle of the desert? Granted the purchase price is a bit high, but it's worth the three night rental at your local video store. I guarantee you will want your friends to watch it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Movie rather 'The Movie'","review":"This film is pure joy. Unlike any movie ever made before it. I have personally watched this film over 50 times. Every time I either see something I never saw before or something I forgot. I wish they would lower the price on this film or put it on DVD.

I don't think there is a song I don't like. All the songs are in the same vein as \\"Gong-Oh,\\" if you are familiar with it--lots of accordion, bongo-type drums, horns, fun rhythms, et cetera. The title song \\"Novecento\\" is especially good.If you already like Paolo Conte, you must get this one too. If you have yet to be introduced to Paolo, then this would also be perfect. The songs are catchy enough for even the uninitiated ear. Ciao."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"The most upto date book on low-power design methods.

For starters, the wig was in the same size box as the DVD combo. I was hoping it would fit them, but wasn't sure. After we opened the box, it became readily apparent that the wig was a joke. It is thin, poorly made and is not an afro, as much as it is a pale imitation of one. My child tried to wear it, but it only covers the top of her (9 year old) head like a sad toupee. She finally did figure out that it fits her one doll, but the disappointment over the bonus wig is the reason we haven't even watched the movie, yet. I know the review is mainly about the wig, but, the wig is the reason I bought the movie.

Polka dot afro :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best one so far","review":"This is arguably the best one so far in the Madagascar trilogy. This version comes in three formats, Blu-ray, DVD, and itunes digital copy along with Ultraviolet copy. The movie is exceptionally funny and captivating. I guarantee you wouldn't regret if you purchase this version that is several bucks more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"We saw this movie twice in the theater. Its a great movie. Our kids want to watch it over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed :(","review":"I loved the first Madagascar and couldnt wait for the second - as is common with sequels, I was let down a little bit. I though given the reviews this one was as awesome as the first but sadly no. It just was not very good. A bit disappointing to say the least. I had a lot of issues with various things in the story line and it just felt rushed and didnt flow well."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip the last 30 minutes","review":"not sure if they ran out of script but this movie just goes into utter nonsense at the beginning of the second circus scene as well as the grand finale. The opening chase sequence in Monte Carlo is first rate, but it goes down hill until the london circus, where it falls off the cliff"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...Comparing with the first two","review":"The Madacasca 3 is the most well drawn among the three, the graphics are full of details and colourful, lots of action, you can tell they have spent twice the expense in creating the graphic animation. However the story plot is not as entertaining as the other two. There are scenes that I find boring and can be skipped. I think the movie suits adult aduiences better than kids, but as an adult, I find it not entertaining enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Not very funny ...... ..... ..... ..... .... .... .... .... .... .... .,., ... ... .,, .,, ... . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"skipped throughout whole movie","review":"this product was marked \\"very good\\" but plays very poorly...it was a christmas gift for my sons, they kept asking why it was skipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I had extremely high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The first two were downright hilarious and I love them both. I had expected this to be just as funny, but I just found it to be more annoying. The movie started out great and there were a few laughs here and there. However, the antagonist seemed poorly thought out. If there would have been less human interaction, I probably would have liked it more. I completely understand that there has to be an antagonist somewhere in the plot, but I felt as though the woman from animal control was really overdone. She had an overly annoying personality and she felt a little forced. I've been a Dreamworks fan for a long time, and I can't wait to see what they come out with next. I just hope that I find it more pleasing than Madagascar 3. It definitely won't be making it into my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, that's $4.00 I will never get back. Horrible movie...","review":"Against my better judgement, I rented this on Amazon Prime because of the reviews saying that \\"this is the best of the three\\" and complete lies like that. This movie, at best, had a few minutes of laughs surrounded by 2 hours of drudgery and inane plot lines, chase scenes and illogical villains. What is the point of this movie?I don't know if it's Ben Stiller's flat performance or the bad writing but the Lion is the least interesting character in the movie. Even the genius Chris Rock could only pull a few laughs out of this thing. The problem with Chris is that he has such an over-sized personality and voice (in a good way) that when it is paired with such tired and cliche scenes, he appears to be desperate for the laughs. As for the other characters, well, I can't even remember who they are.If you didn't care for (or were only mildly amused by) the first 2 movies, you definitely do not want to waste your time and brain cells on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought","review":"I was expecting a better movie. The plot was a little thin and the movie was boring. The movie is definitely geared to an adult audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance","review":"At first I didn't like this movie. Sure, I laughed here and there, but even as I was laughing I was thinking, \\"boy this is over-the-top stupid.\\" I liked the original Madagascar a lot, but then I didn't like the Kung-fu Grandma in the sequel. When I started watching Madagascar 3, I thought it was going to be too much about the people again--and I disliked the Animal Control lady even more than I had disliked the Kung-fu Grannie. But then something happened. When Alex came up with his New Zoo idea, I absolutely loved it from then on. I finished up liking this movie just as much as, or even more than, the original. One caution: my 4-yr-old boys thought the beginning was scary for some reason, and they don't want to watch the movie again. The only Madagascar movie they want to watch again and again is the original Madagascar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"My son asked for this for Christmas. I so wish I would have researched the movie before buying it. Talk about \\"far out.\\" They must've been totally out of ideas when they made this one.

But this movie is torture. I hate fake accents, and these are the worst. Maybe kids think it's funny but it sets my teeth on edge. There are movies that parents love to watch as much as kids, but this one isn't one of them.

So I decided to rent it for a fun family night. I was extremely disappointed. The story is very poor. Even the penguins who were so funny in the first two movies do not have much of a role here. I don't think we had a laugh before the movie was half done. Just a few \\"clever\\" hints mostly for adults that were still short of funny. It tends to get somewhat better towards the end but too little too late.I asked my daughter if she wanted to see the movie again the next day (since we had 24-hour rental). She said \\"no way!\\". Don't waste your time (and money)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even our kids didn't like this movie.","review":"Our kids (almost 6 and 7) and us enjoyed the other 2 Madagascar movies, although I still think the first one was the best. Typically subsequent movies aren't as good and that was definitely the case with this one. We rented it from Redbox, but not too far into it our kids were complaining they didn't like it. We did however finish the movie but it never got bettter. It was too bright, too nonstop, and no real story. It wasn't enjoyable to watch unless you just want nonstop super bright eye candy and nothing else. Unfortunately that's what most kids seem to enjoy these days.... We were hoping for more of a story or atleast something that made sense. We wondered what people must have been on when dreaming up this movie. It was really crazy. The bad lady character in the movie was insane and really hard to watch. She made the movie even worse. We were thoroughly disappointed in it. Only a few small laughs (that only the parents caught) throughout the entire movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"They should have never made this movie. What a waste of time.

This movie was a let down. First two movies in this series were good, but this one? Yuck. The sub-story of Julian and the bear was just ridiculously stupid. As long as you're funny when your stupid, it's fine. But don't be stupid just to be stupid. The plot was boring, and there was maybe one funny line in the movie. All in all, not funny, pretty boring, bad villain, (did I mention that?) equals bad movie. Period.(review written by my 12-yr old son)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a retread..","review":"This was a fun movie that was pleasantly not a rehash of the other two movies.

The movie starts a little slow, but the middle and end are worth the wait.Update - Ok everyone having this issue I have figured out a way to fix it.

I was warned about the ending by a cousin, but I kept on, hoping that he was just being too critical. He was not. The bad guys were really bad, which is good, but the good guys were not particularly good. It was very difficult to like any character much past his or her introduction, as they all tended to shed any morals they had at the first opportunity. The expectation was that the ending would point them in the right direction, but instead we got the wave of a magic wand, and everything's okay, even though no one deserves it.The shame of it is that the effort, the scope, and many of the ideas were impressive. A touch of decency would have gone a long way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ripples of Peace","review":"Harshfield wrote poems that will touch all readers.

I don't know why the first reviewer said it was too serious, I don't know. It shows the band playing jokes on each other and all that .... The band's from Chicago, and there's a lot of references to their hometown in it.

I have learned more American history and have come to comprehend the real men behind the names of John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington et al.

One has to admit that Abigail Adams emerges as almost important as her husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I am enjoying reading about John and Abigail Adams but I must say it can be a little dry, which is unlike David McCullough. I have not completely changed my opinion of John but I now find him more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating book about a fascinating man.","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me of how much I enjoyed watching the Adams Chronicles on PBS many years ago. It's amazing to read so much of Adams own words, and how accurate many of his predictions turned out to be, and how familiar many of his quotes still are."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"good book\\" but \\"distracting\\" in use of quotations as a storytelling \\"device\\"","review":"I found the excessive use of quotations so tedious and irritating that I had to put it down after reading the first hundred pages or so. It reminded me of a high school book report where all of the interspersed quotations are intended to show the teacher that the student really read the book and did the research to support their thesis.McCullough obviously did do a lot of research in writing this book and my guess is that he intended to use the characters' own words as a way to bring them and the time that they lived to life for modern readers. Unfortunately, he overdid it and all but destroyed the narrative in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best biographies I have read.","review":"First of all this biography reads really well, its not dry. And it is about one of the greatest Americans. I was amazed at the contributions President Adams made to our country. I am inspired now to go on and read more about President Jefferson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Founding Father","review":"If you want to learn more about the birth of our country and one if its most important founding fathers, then this is an excellent book to pick up. What I found most amazing was how the political battles of 200 years so closely resemble the battles of today. His debates with Jefferson and Republicans are timeless American political arguments including slanderous press, and claims of warmongering and being unpatriotic. But he also showed how these sides can reconcile as he and Jefferson exchanged insightful letters throughout the later parts of their lives.Not only does this book cover the events in Adam's life, but it also provides insight into his motivations and emotional life. This is conveyed through many of his personal letters, and the book also focuses on his relationship with his amazing wife Abigail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"I am a big fan of David McCulloch's (I devoured The Great Bridge, Johnstown Flood, and Truman). I was so psyched to read John Adams but once I commenced reading it I was bored by the constant Abigale/John romance. The Revolutionary War and Adam's presidency were nearly afterthoughts. I was disappointed- I never learned anything useful from the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"David, where did the fascinating detail go","review":"David McCullough can usually be expected to produce a monumental work which reads well as well as being historically accurate. This book reads poorly and is filled with details which are superfluous to an understanding of the man or the moment. As intriguing as \\"Truman\\" was, this biography is not......it fails to capture the reader and hold his interest, perhaps because the style is stilted or the persona are simply cardboard like in their depiction. It relies too little on a description of the times, and too much on platitudes which John Adams seems to b e surrounded with. David, where did that masterful presentation of history go??????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy, Lazy Work from a great author","review":"We feel compelled to weigh in on this one since it was such a runaway best-seller during the summer of 2001. David McCullough (of Truman fame) is one of our favorite authors, and it pains us to see him on autopilot like this. A biography should be more than a convenient arrangement of the subject's personal correspondence. Yet McCullough relies almost entirely on President Adams (quite voluminous) diaries and letters to his wife. The only supporting material seems to left over from a book on Jefferson McCullough abandoned. Read this if you want to know what being John Adams was like. Don't read it if you have any interest in gaining insight into how his life fit into the great drama of the founding of America.[HistoryHouse.com]"},{"rating":"2","title":"History Alive","review":"McCullough's great gift is his ability to present facts and dates in a compelling tapestry that fills every page with the pathos and passion of his subject. This book is his finest to date and that's saying a lot. The fascinating character of Adams is so compellingly told that you'll be sorry to see the narrative end. Recommended for everyone who loves to read or loves impassioned writing. David R. Bannon, Ph.D.; author \\"Race Against Evil.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Reading","review":"David McCullough is a fairly good historical writer, and his presentation of John Adams is no exception. While this book does not have the fast action dramatizations that \\"Mornings on Horseback\\" has, this is an excellent book, especially for those readers who are not initiated into the life of one of our greatest Founding Fathers. Some chapters are dry reading, but overall, McCullough presents Adams' later years with verve. what is most interesting is Adams' high level of commitment and participation to the founding and development of our great nation, and the observations and low opinion he had of Benjamin Franklin in many areas, particularly Franklin's work ethic and questionable relationships in France. What was shocking was the crass flirtations James Lowell had with the then-married Abigail Adams. Overall, this is a good biography that will open readers' eyes to the intimate life and mind of John Adams and his relationship with Thomas Jefferson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Mis-understood President","review":"Many of us will accept any book by McCollough, but this is his best. Thankfully it does not go into avery detail of his life, it rather brings him to life. We see bith John and Abigail as warm human beings who made major sacrifices for their beloved country. As the story moves along we gain insight into other revolutionary leaders, e.g., Thomas Jefferson, George Washington et. al.This is the perfect book for the person who lovesAmerican history and the one who thinks it might be fun to learn something about it. Scholar and casual reader will benefit from this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOST FASCINATING BOOK ABOUT A POLITICIAN EVER WRITTEN","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

It was written by an admirer and failed to cover in much depth some very questionable aspects of the Adams story. The Alien and Sedition Acts, an attempt by federalist to silence the Republicans via imprisonment, got an apologetic paragraph. His midnight judicial appointments merited a paragraph. I don't remember anything from the book on how Adams mistrusted Washington during the War, how he wanted to control the war department, yet failed to muster funding for the army. And did Adams have a role in the Conway Cabal?

I just finished the last CD and I am really glad I didn't give up on this title!I especially like the reciting of passages of letters to and from John Adams. These people had a wonderful command of language and conveyed their thoughts and emotions in beautiful detail. I also found it interesting that politicians 200 years ago had to face a scornful and vicious press, something I thought was a twentieth century phenomenon.John and Abigail Adams are wonderful role models. We can learn a lot from them by the way they handled hardship, separation, and duty. I know that I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent biography of our Second President","review":"David McCullough does an excellent job portraying our second president.

The Adamses deliver their messages in their own words (through their letters) with Mr. McCullough filling in gaps with interesting paragraphs and setting scenes for the next message from these wonderful people. We in American are very fortunate to have had such people to commence our republic and Mr McCullough does us a great favor by reminding us with this wonderful tome.

This should be required reading for anyone at all interested in the history of our nation and how it all began. The wonder is that it did begin. Hard to know who to admire more, John for his accomplishments or Abigail for hers. Two very inspiring, remarkable people. After reading this, I found many of my ideas of historical people changed.

Just understand, it's a thick one! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Light","review":"This book is a historical view bridged with parts of correspondents between the characters. It brings an amazingly bright softness to a President we really hardly new in deep detail. His outward hard appearance was softened in a new light. In summmary I thought that this was a phenomenal read. I loved it. Historical human insights to that era's time and philosophy accented with a deep love story between John and Abigail Adams. This is a permanent addition to my library, bravo David McCullough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Resurects and almost forgotten Founding Father","review":"Well, that is a bit of an exageration, but I don't think that that John Adams is very well known to even that part of the public that reads history for pleasure. This book will certainly change that, and hopefully we will learn to say his name in the same breath as Jefferson, Franklin, and Washington. He was no less important and deserves no less fame. An he certainly is more lovable as a man than I had ever thought. Next to Franklin, there is no founding father I more regret never having been able to meet.The book is short on his political thought and writings, which are an extremely important contribution to American political theory, but the book gives the general idea. It leaves one thirsting to know more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome on a number of levels.","review":"McCullough has done more than simply written a brilliant biography about a great American and mensch, he has brought him to life, literarily if not literally.As well as many of those around him, such as Abigail Adams, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington et al.And the American Revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL BIOGRAPHY","review":"This is my first history biography about a President and it's definitely the best. A must-read for anybody who just generally loves books. A very easy read. Doesn't read like typical biographies. Reads like a regular, fictional novel and really focuses on his relationship with Abigail, which is one of the great love stories of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Pulitzer?","review":"A new biography by David McCullough is always an event worth anticipating. With 'John Adams' McCullough has, however, given us his masterpiece. In this book he opens a door which we step through and are transported to the world and characters that made the American Revolution. McCullough maintains a level of interest, detail and characterization that I cannot recall in any other biography. John and Abigail Adams lived long and eventful lives and their candid letters and other writings have been largely preserved. This provides a great canvas for the author to work upon, and he makes the most of it. Of all the fascinating themes in this work, Adams' long and changing relationship with Thomas Jefferson is perhaps one of the best. Jefferson's character is used as something of a foil to that of Adams, and Jefferson comes off second best. I cannot recommend this book too highly...a terrific read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depth and Breadth","review":"This is simply one of the best biographies I have ever read. It goes into great detail in a refreshing style in four important periods of Adams' life: The Continental Congress up through 1776; the residency abroad as United States minister to England and Holland; the Presidency; and the retirement.In all of the periods important relationships are traced, especially those with Jefferson, Abigail Adams, and sons John Quincy and Charles, allowing the reader to see evolutions of these relationships rather than a static description of them.Finally, the scholarship is impeccable. A true delight to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Adams","review":"This is an excellant read.

Reading other accounts, it seems to me that Sam had a lot to do with John getting into \\"politics.\\" In this book I didn't get the feeling that Sam was instrumental in getting John started in to American revolution and politics. Are there differing opinions on this? Can Mr. McCullogh or some reader expound on this? Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Focus?","review":"This is excellent writing. This is agenda-driven. This brings John Adams into clear focus? This hollers out to be fair by bringing Thomas Jefferson into clear focus. This means also reading the Remick book drawn from Jefferson's own readings and writings, \\"West Point: Character Leadership Education... Thomas Jefferson\\". This is for history buffs? This is a book for all Americans. This is David McCullough's, \\"John Adams\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story about interesting man","review":"There's not much for me to say here that hasn't been said about this biography. It's an absolutely wonderful book by a great historian and writer. John Adams deserves more credit than history has given him for the role he played in developing our nation, and McCullough illustrates that.The book, like many biographies, is sympathetic toward the subject. McCullough barely criticizes Adams for the Alien and Sedition Acts during his presidency, for example. However, the book effectively presents a brilliant, hard-working, opinionated and insecure man who had strengths and faults. Being a Massachusetts native may have helped me enjoy the book even more. I was glued to the pages of this book and was actually sad when I finished. As far as biographies go, it's hard to improve upon this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner!","review":"As thorough as any of McCullogh's books. Lots of interesting tidbits of information on his relations with Jefferson, Franklin, Washington and his beloved Abigail.McCullough examines both the good and the bad of this \\"forgotten\\" founding father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent use of source material","review":"Good, especially the first half. Drags on a bit in the second half, after Adams becomes Vice President. I think if I had put the book down for two weeks and then read the second half it would have gone down easier. Well written overall, excellent use of source materials; in fact I'd recommend this book as a model for how to make extensive use of source material, especially unpublished archival material. The author clearly has steeped himself in the material which is awesome. p. 453: people are not equal in fact but in rights!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle vs Paperback","review":"So...this is what it has come to.

Thank you, How do you do all that with such small profit margins?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something lacking","review":"I don't know exactly what it is--but this bio of Adams is missing something key to his personality. For my money, the old two volume bio of Adams by Page Smith that I read last summer after visiting Adams house is the real, solid definitive bio. This is artful and clever--the Page Smith books are the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Snooze","review":"I have been reading this book for four weeks, and I am only halfway through it. I try, but my eyes just won't stay open through the long, dreary passages that seem to go nowhere. Much of what I have read is old stuff that we learned in sixth grade; Lexington and Concord, Bunker Hill, the First Continental Congress. But this author seems to have squeezed to life out of the story and served up the empty husks."},{"rating":"1","title":"biased ,biased, biased, biased, biased, biased","review":"Did you know John Adams could walk on water? (according to McCullough anyway) I have seldom read a more biased book from a historian of such note. Washington,Jefferson,Hamilton,Madison,Franklin,etc.,etc. Were all mean,unable,ambituous,vile men to varying degrees. Only Adams was pure. As a book on Adams it is fine but as a source on our colonial history, forget it. It could be 100% correct but I doubt it. I strongly doubt the honesty of this book. Again, it is a great book on Adams. However, I look upon it as \\"The Alice Through the Looking Glass\\" of history books. It is well worth the reading. But,is it likely he stood alone in character and ability?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Forgotten Founding Father -- rightfully so.","review":"Even David McCullough's brilliant insight and writing skills cannot elevate this competent and boring Ikon of American History beyond his deserved place as First Vice President. His life contained enough variety and excitement for a dozen men, yet he trod through it like a Civil Servant within sight of pensioned retirement. The only thing in the book more boring than the man himself are the quotations from his writings. I look forward to Mr. McCullough's next book, and hope it will concern someone more worthy of expending his time and energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written but Flawed","review":"McCullough's obvious jealousy of Jefferson, Madison, and other Virginians who are responsible for the Declaration of Independence and Constitution makes this a flawed biography. His argument that Adams deserves the real credit for these documents is hollow and off the mark. Adams made contributions, but his role must be rated secondary."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWN Don't believe the hype.","review":"I can't believe I was reading the same books as those giving this droning tome 4-5 stars.

I never forgot that I was reading a history book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous President","review":"A glib but superficial book overlooks Adam's horrible role in signing the Alien and Sedition Acts -- the most enduring threat to civil liberties in the history of the United States. This book is pleasant entertainment but not serious history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT, I Repeat, Do NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!","review":"So, I picked this book up...and I had high hopes for it. I thought,\\"Yeah, a book about John Adams. I really haven't read much about him. Should be a good book.\\" OR NOT!! Let me tell you, this book is horrible. Filled with 600 pages of worthless information about his personal life, I thought that I was being tortured. Actually, I was being tortured. The only exciting part of the book is when Adams fights for his life on a ship...and I was excited in hope that Adams was going to die so the book would end. I wanted to die myself, but, continued to read this book in hopes of seeing a brighter part of the book. The best part....the index, which helped me write a report on this POS book. Unless you want to be tortured in a new and very BRUTAL way..don't read this book. You might think of taking your life if you do read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside John Adams' Head","review":"David McCullough's John Adams is a triumph! In the opening pages he masterfully weaved the urgency and uncertainty of the early days of the Revolution with Adams thoughts and movements. The book read like a novel, and I couldn't put it down. When reading history, how many times can a reader claim that? Not often, and McCullough's style, and command of the pertinent details of history, has inspired me to read all of his biographies. Not to mention, that I can read key parts of this book to my students as they learn about the Revolution and our founding fathers."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Adams is a fascinating read!","review":"I had no idea John Adams was such an intelligent and fascinating man! This book not only give insight into his thoughts and ideas about the future of the United States, but also lets us in on the love and admiration he had for his wife, Abigail, who is just as intelligent and fascinating as he is. Their letters to each other just make me sad to think that letter writing is a lost art. This is not a fast read. It needs to be savored for the historical facts and information about this great man and how this country came into being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for fans of history and the HBO miniseries","review":"\\"John Adams\\" fills in so many of the blanks that leave viewers of the miniseries wondering, and leave history buffs yearning for more. Those who want insight into the inner workings of a man who seemed to have been somewhat overlooked in common history texts will love the facts that the author has culled and provided for us. \\"Huzzah\\" for a book that gives readers a story they won't want to put down about a man who deserved much more praise and notice than he received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book - at times a page turner.","review":"This book is a great review of American History, it's not just about John Adam's life, but also about how the Declaration of Independence and the constitution was formed. And how the rest of the world (Britain, France, Holland) felt about the new American country. At times it was a page turner. I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Adams finally gets the respect/acknowledgement he deserves","review":"John Adams' life encompasses a huge arc - he lived longer than any president. Crucial to the story as it was to history is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson born opposites - but alike in their devotion to their country. Amazingly and incredibly they died on the same day - their day of days - July 4, 1826. This book is a journey of history on a grand scale which entails politics, war, social issues, human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship, betrayal and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, John Adams is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived. John Adams is, so far, my favorite book this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb Work","review":"John Adams is an intriguing work about a fascinating man and it was a true pleasure to read. It deserves all of the praise that it has received. For anyone who is interested in rare quotes from John Adams concerning his thoughts on the interrelationship between religion and public virtue, I would recommend another book that I have recently read entitledGod of Our Fathers: Advice and Prayers of Our Nation's FoundersQuotes from his cousin Samuel and from Franklin, Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and other of the Founding Fathers are contained therein as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Adams","review":"This book is very interesting and informative. It arrived on time and was a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Adams - Flesh and Blood","review":"I've only recently started reading books (I'm 44) and I often don't finish them. Not this book! I read the 600+ page book in 3 weeks. I've always been interested in history and especially the Presidents, but like many, John Adams has been an enigma to me. I knew very little about him.Although David's book at times spent too much time on lesser important details and not enough on more important details, he made John and Abigail Adams come alive. I felt like I was alive in the 18th century watching this earnest man deal with the momentous events in his life while keenly aware of his shortcomings, knowing he was only human.John and John Quincy Adams' administrations may have had minimal impact on the U.S., but both of their services to the U.S. are without question and the rumored memorial to Adams in D.C. is well deserved and way late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Heartfelt and Inspiring","review":"I bought this book and for about the first 50 pages or so thought I would never finish it. I had never read an historical biography before but I like David McCullough and thought it would be good. Then, all of a sudden, I got sucked into it. Everything in it was moving especially the depiction of John & Abigail Adams' loving relationship. IN FACT, I think the book should've been called John & Abigail Adams as HER sacrifices were the equal of his. The book is well balanced and never glories John Adams. It makes a clear point of showing that despite all the great things both John & Abigail did for the country, the losses were great. For example, two of their sons became tragic alcoholics. Perhaps, the book suggests, this was due to John Adams' long absences in his work for the Country. I strongly recommend this to anyone, not just history buffs. My sincerest Thanks to Mr. McCullough for providing me with one of the best books I have ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Excellent reading for the history buff. Gives an in-depth look into the life of our of our county's great leaders."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCullough does it again!","review":"I thought that McCullough's Truman was about the best biography I have ever read. John Adams ranks right up there! I have read some rather harsh reviews of the book: they basically claim that McCullough falls in love with the focus of the book and that he is inaccurately biased by the infatuation. Well, I cannot comment on the accuracy as I have read little else about Adams; most of what I remember is that Adams was not entirely personable, and perhaps downright grumpy. McCullough refutes that and, most importantly, his writing is top-notch in pleasure and readability. For those that disagree with his characterization of Adams - WRITE A BETTER BOOK! (if you can!). Otherwise, accept that other interpretations of Adams may be accurate.Don't be fooled - this is a great and enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Human perspective","review":"Without delving into extremely personal situations encountered by John Adams and his journey through life, Mr. McCullough has succeeded in showing John Adams in an extremely human form, which puts an entirely new light on his accomplishments and relationships with other \\"Founding Brothers\\" and his family.A wonderful work to be read more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Audio Book on our Founders","review":"This is the best narrated, of a great writing of David McCullough. Strongly reccomended to anyone who wants to learn about our founders, cause when you hear the story of John Adams, you'll learn about Washington, Jefferson, & Franklin."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Adams","review":"Great book. McCullough makes the time come alive through his use of material and quotations from Adam's personal letters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Work","review":"This book provides great reminder in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 of the dedication and sacrifices of this Founding Father to the cause of freedom. The book is easy to read and provides new appreciation for the contributions of John Adams and the key role he played in the founding of our Nation. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was inspired to reread Jefferson's \\"intimate\\" biography as well as several other biographical works."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCullough's Genius Continues","review":"ANYONE interested in learning more about this country's genesis, the Founding Fathers and, of course, John Adams, should read this book. McCullough clearly is the U.S.'s resident genius historian. I loved \\"Truman\\" and Adams was just as good. The only drawback was that the audio version wasn't narrated by Mr. McCullough, whose voice is marvelous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and Accessible - a MUST read!","review":"McCullough's treatment of Adams is sweeping yet cogent, contextual yet intimate. If it is not possible truly to \\"know\\" an historical figure of Adams's import, this book is as close as one is likely to come. Mining thousands of Adams's letters to his wife, children and colleagues (including, of course, Jefferson and Washington), as well as newspaper accounts, books and historical records, we are given entree into one of the most important political careers in American history. However, what gives the book its luster is the intimate way we come to know Adams. He was a fascinating person, and McCullough, while obviously in awe of Adams and reluctant to criticize him, gives us an honest account. If time travel is not possible, this book is the next best thing. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"McCullough has done it again. Another exquisitely written biography that kept me interested from start to finish, which I was sad to approach. I am not usually interested in history, but if this man were teaching it, I might have majored in it -- well, possibly. I think he is that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book on John Adams","review":"Awesome book. I really identified with John Adams. A genius that had a great impact on our country's philosophy. The book has since been made into a great movie/series by HBO and it would be fun to read in conjunction with watching. This is the most complete story of John's life but I also really enjoyedFirst Family: Abigail and John Adams (Vintage)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowing John Adams","review":"This book is a true history lover's dream - extremely informative, wonderfully woven, deserving of any literary prize and recongnition. While it is primarily about Adams, one has the extra added look into numerous other personalities of the time from wife Abigail to Franklin, Jefferson and a host of others. The intricacy of detail in this book is astounding. I can't imagine a better biography of Adams or anyone else. If you love American history, particularly the Revolutionary period, you must read this book. Contratulations Mr. Mc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this one!","review":"I searched and located this book after seeing the HBO miniseries. I now see why this book has received so many accolades and awards. The author has researched and triangulated the facts of the lives of not only John and Abigil Adams but also revealed to us the lives of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and many others who were the basis of the development of our nation. As I read the book, I found it to be so well written that I hung on every word because I did not want to miss any part it. Whether you are a writer trying to learn your craft or whether you just want a good rainy day read...this book fits the bill. I now classify it as one of my favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising page turner","review":"Knowing very little about Adams, I reluctantly embarked on this book, only because my local book club had chosen it. It was AMAZING. I feel invigorated about American history. I thought there was nothing else to tell but this book left me with new appreciation for American history. Although maybe too much about Adams' personal life for history buffs, his professional life was intertwined, affected by and influenced by his personal life, and for me it made the book much more meaningful and interesting. My book club loved this book. (The HBO series based on this book, however, was a real snoozer, but that's for another review...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"History without the snooze factor","review":"There have been a lot of synopses of this book and I won't add to them. The author's writing style is lively and keeps you moving through what could otherwise have been a dull topic. John Adams isn't a name that leaps from the page as a fascinating character. He was involved in, but rarely the lead, in a lot of foundational activities in American history. McCullough is insightful enough to see that Adams therefore is the perfect foil for descriptions of these activities.Moving on to the things that Adams actually led... It's particularly interesting to see how he coped with the challenges of following George Washington. The man built the country; how do you follow that? Apparently pretty well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for Revolutionary novices.","review":"I was looking for an accessible introduction to the American Revolution, and this book didn't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish history had been this interesting in school","review":"McCullough does a wonderful job of bringing personality to the name of John Adams. The description of historic moments such as the signing of the Treaty of Paris, brought chillbumps to my arms. Adams is shown as a man passionate about his country, as well as his wife and children. The excerpts from letters between John and Abigail Adams add to the reader's knowledge of this great man."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great contribution to history","review":"Dr. McCullough has continued his roll. ADAMS is another effort which, though scholarly, is prosaic enough to rivet almost any undergraduate to a library chair on drown night. The Professor emphasizes that Adams was honest almost to a fault. McCullough also debunks some of the idolatry surround Adams's colleagues, namely Jefferson. He also includes just the right amount of gossip: Franklin's chess playing with bathing francaises, and the President's response to his son's drunkeness (Adams eighty-sixed him) were particularly well placed. A splendid mixture overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"good beach read","review":"Am 300 pages into this novel. It's very descriptive and really gives you a sense of the person, as well as the other revolutionary characters. You can very clearly picture the obstacles he faced and what type of man he was. I'm thoroughly enjoying it -- and recently heard it may be made into an HBO movie by Tom Hanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"Obviously the author has put in countless hours of research, drafting, editing, sequencing, etc. He clearly has an unparalleled work ethic. However, in my opinion it is written in an exceptionally dry tone, making it hard to enjoy for the casual reader. I suppose that's why biographies are not as popular in general, but after reading Walter Isaacson, I know it can be done. So in the end, five stars for research and calories burned (rare in any field), 5 stars for subject matter, 2 stars for presenting it all in a way for a casual reader to stick to. I feel like I should be wearing a smoking jacket with a pipe in order to plug in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, bad historian","review":"This biography must be commended for taking into consideration the many aspects of a very complicated man. John Adams was not a president to be forgotten, nor a man to take for granted. Mr. McCullough has researched completely every aspect of Adams' life. But what the author fails to do is analysis the significant actions of this man's life. He is telling a story, not looking at history for its importance nor its meaning. Why did Adams think the way he did, and how was that important to the future. This book tells a nice story, but fails to challenge the mind of the reader or the misconceptions of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit thick","review":"Overrated.Boring. While 'Truman' was a masterpiece, this book does not represent McCulloughs finest hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCullogh cheerleads for our 2nd President","review":"I enjoyed the book, but impartial it's not. From McCullogh's viewpoint, the reason that no one liked Adams was because everyone else was a jerk. It's a fairly blunt observation, but I don't know how else to put it.Adams was a man of integrity and history has given him short shrift, but this defense is too vigorous. According to McCullogh, Adams' failings in France and England and during his first term in office had nothing to do with Adams and all to do with Jefferson and Franklin.Never mind that Adams wasted much of his political capital in a fierce battle on what to call Washington (Mr. President).Adams was a man of integrity that kept us out of war and who was a keen architect of our form of government. But he was a lousy diplomat and an average politician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patriotic Passion","review":"At a time of patriotic uprising in the country, I purchased and read the story of John Adams. I, as a child of the late sixies and early seventies, felt that young people today needed a cause. I had sympathy for them because they seemed lacking in passion for their country. That of course has changed. This book gave me a look at an earlier generation and their passion for patriotism. American History has always been a favorite subject. In the past I have found that I craved the knowledge of not only the event but the personalities behind the events.This book, authored by David McCullough, fullfilled my need to know the history makers in great detail and the \\"others\\" that helped form their beliefs and philosophies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written History","review":"A common fault with most biographers is to either to polarize on the side of the subject or against the subject. McCullough tends to side with Adams in this case. For the most part this favoritism does not affect the story, Adams was undeniably a great man . However the \`Alien and Sedition' acts of his period were a definite blot on his record, a blot that McCullough seems to gloss over.Aside from such minor lapses in favoritism the book still remains a excellent history. It has been well researched. McCullough has used wide use of primary source quotes to prove his points, a key indicator of a good historian. What's more McCullough also has a keen literary sense which is commonly missing in many history's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The REAL Founding Fathers","review":"I was totally immersed in the eighteenth century by the time I had read a few pages. In spite of the size of the book, I read it in only 4 days, as I found it hard to put down. Compelling reading, and beautifully written. It was as though I knew each of these people personally by the time I had finished. I was lucky enought to have read another book just before this, \\"Children of Wrath\\" by Leo Hirrel, which gave me additional insight into the values and concerns of the New Englanders, such as John Adams, who impacted and shaped the development of our country. I highly recommend this as an adjunct to the John Adams book. I never enjoyed history so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk into History","review":"This is a terrific book, providing much more information about Adams than I had ever known in the past. Clearly well researched, the real joy of the book is found in the descriptive letters exchanged by John and Abigail Adams. The love the two of them shared is powerful, and the mutual respect is obvious. The presentation of these letters allow the reader to feel a connection with the Adams that a regular history book would not allow. John Adams' love for his family and his country is clear as one reads this book. You share in his adventures and his defeats. The relationship between him and Jefferson also is interesting as the book shows the tension that exsisted between the two men, as well as the respect. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godfather Of Our Country","review":"John Adams is perhaps the least studied founding father of our country, yet I believe he probably had the greatest impact. No matter which theatre of the American revolution might draw the most attention, if you look closely you will see Adams\` hand was certainly involved. Be it choosing the head of our army, international negotiations, financial securities, or the writing of the Declaration itself, John Adams was there. He sacrificed more of himself for the cause than any other patriot of his time. He was not the First American, he was not the Father Of Our Country, nor did he write The Declaration of Independence. However he did accomplish more for the good of the 'nation yet to be' before he was even voted President of the new United States.I believe David McCullough has finally done justice to a most deserving soul. After reading this book one discovers the true meaning of patriotism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Biography!","review":"John Adams is a great biography of our second president and first Vice-President. Author David MacCullough portrays John Adams as a family man. He illustrates the fact that Adam's true ambition was to lead a good and honest life. There disappointments for Adams, the early deaths of at least two children,one still born, and a poor term as president. The thing that John Adams most regretted is that he could not spend much time with his family during the years of service to his country. David MacCullough explains the trials and joys of an American leader. Edward Herrmann's great reading voice adds much to this book. This would be great for someone who wants to learn more about John Adams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look at a great American","review":"All you really need to know is that the book is about John Adams, the second President of The United States. And that it's extremely well written.So if you're interested in revolutionary history this is a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biographers Should keep their distance","review":"I usually like McCullough's work, but am disappointed in this one. McCullough seems to have become infatuated with Adams, therefore he highlights his good points (admittedly there are many) and so minimizes his errors that the result is historical distortion and misrepresentation.McCullough completely fails his job as biographer in minimizing the dangerous Alien and Sedition Acts. Adams signed this anti-democratic tyrannical bills and must be held accountable. McCullough sloughs them off as though they are piffle. Clearly, he is not thinking as clearly as he usually does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I feel compelled to weigh in on this one since it was such a runaway best-seller during the summer of 2001. David McCullough (of Truman fame) is one of our favorite authors, and it pains us to see him on autopilot like this. A biography should be more than a convenient arrangement of the subject's personal correspondence. Yet McCullough relies almost entirely on President Adams (quite voluminous) diaries and letters to his wife. The only supporting material seems to left over from a book on Jefferson McCullough abandoned. Read this if you want to know what being John Adams was like. Don't read it if you have any interest in gaining insight into how his life fit into the great drama of the founding of America."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real John Adams","review":"Very good biography of John Adams with information abaout the politics of the early days of the Republic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of John Adams","review":"I found the beginning a little hard going since Mr. McCullough pulled me from the current time into the past in order to discuss Mr. Adams' childhood. Several times he used this method of Mr. Adams reflecting on his early life while traveling. Once Mr. McCullough and I arrived at the \\"present\\" the book became focused and extremely interesting. If I was only to learn about Mr. Adams and his family the book would have been good but he also added written accounts about many of the original \\"founding fathers\\" which turned it into a great read. To understand the meaning of true patriotism, one has only to read and immerse oneself in this book and its imagery."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a treat","review":"John Adams is the first biography I've read in years. I haven't recounted American history since highschool and I felt like it was time. I had no idea a biography could be so interesting and entertaining. I expected to skim parts and get to the \\"action\\" but every paragraph contributes to the facisinating story of John Adams and the struggels of America in its infancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"This is a fascinating book. John Adams is a much more interesting and complex character than I previously believed. The book also gives a good overview of the revolutionary period and the early years of the nation. I loved every minute of my time reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best stories I've read!","review":"I'm definitely not an American history buff, and it was with a bit of trepidation that I undertook this long read. I am so glad I did! This is one of the best nonfiction books I've ever read. I was totally drawn in to the life and times of John Adams. Not only did I learn all about Adams, but his brillant wife Abigail, his son John Quincy, and his sometimes tempestuous relationship with both Bejamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Adams was a great man,and he sacrificed so much for his country. McCullough, like Barbara Tuchman (Guns in August) knows how to tell a story. Absolutely captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T READ THIS!!!!!!!!!","review":"After reading this book, I wanted to jump off a cliff. The only problem was, I live in the plains. This book is HORRIBLE, filled with useless information on the love life of Fat John Adams and his sick wife. Do I care about them? NO! I read this book for the politics, or thought I would, not romance. I would recommend this book to anyone who is on the verge of suicide, and needs something to push them over the edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"This is without a doubt the worst book that I've ever read. It took me more than a month to read the book and I am the type of person to finish a book at this length in 2 weeks or less. The life of John Adams will be found boring, dry, and uninteresting to a person who takes no interest in history. However, if you are a history buff, then this is the book for you. In my opinion it's 651 pages of boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"We were fortunate to have him","review":"A wonderful book. I feel I am there in Massachusetts with John & Abigail Adams, & know them both as friends. Historically thorough and complete, it should be required reading in American schools. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an amazing book.","review":"This work by DAVID MCCULLOUGH is no less than genius. DAVID MCCULLOUGH won the Pulitzer prize for this book. We are taught in school that John Adams was present during the American Revolution but to what extent? Simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book! Definitely worth reading!","review":"David McCullough has done an excellent job capturing the very essence of Adams. The book is largely based off of Adams personal correspondence and journals, and it really allows the reader to dive into the mind of Adams.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, great fun, inspiring","review":"Although there may not be much else to add to so many glowing reviews, I wanted to add my own five stars just because I loved this book so much.The book is brilliant, and great fun. What a wonderful and inspiring story, and what gorgeous writing! Adams is a forefather and a president for America to take great pride in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent biography","review":"David McCullough paints a remarkable story of one of the greatest heroes in American history, John Adams.This underrated founding father and president finally gets his due as a devoted husband,father, and patriot, a man who did not seek great fame or honor, but had it thrust upon him. Adams emerges as a strong intellect, sharp debater, and clever diplomat,ready to engage in dangerous missions to save his country. A man does not need to be a soldier to fight for one's country.The tome is always accessible and readable, even for a casual reader. Don't let the size intimidate you."},{"rating":"2","title":"good bio","review":"JA is a very well written biography. It brings the reader from Adam's childhood to his death in a nicely paced fashion. The research that went into this book must have been phenominal (considring it is based on 1000's of letters and additonal printed documents). A great bio for one of our foremost founding fathers."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCullough does it again","review":"David McCullough's John Adams is even better than his book Truman. It is an easy read and a fun read. I found it difficult to put down. mcCullough teaches you about the people who helped the 13 colonies become one country; how political parties were formed and how politicing then is not much differnt than it is today. He also provides insight on the various people who governed the US or wanted to. More than you ever learned in school. What really amazed me was the fact that the letters John and Abagail Adams wrote to each other or to others survived. The fact that their family and other people's families saved their correspondence is remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books I've read","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read.

I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable Objectivity, Good Writing","review":"It's said that all biographers fall in love with their subjects, but McCullough is particularly guilty of this. The book is well-written and comprehensive, but McCullough skews the book too much in Adams' favor, lauding his accomplishments but minimizing some major flaws in his character and career (admiration for monarchy, distrust of popular democracy (including forcible suppression of his enemies), and his Alien and Sedition Acts that subverted the Bill of Rights).McCullough shows the same fawning admiration and lack of balance in his biography of Harry S. Truman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story about an often overlooked American Hero","review":"John Adams is an often overlooked American Hero. Not enough Americans know what he did to help form this country and keep us out of war with France and England. This book is very well written and is an easy informative read. Highy reccommended for all Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"John Adams died this morning. At least that's how if feels for me, having just completed this phenomenal book. The narrative is so compelling, so moving, tightly woven with the letters of the greatest minds in the history of this country (Abigail's among them), that it brings these characters back to life and invites the reader to take part as a silent observer of their lives. McCullough expertly crafted his text around the stories that were told through the primary source documents, creating the biography of the Adams family and the United States simultaneously.The prose of John Adams is incredible. His mastery of the English language is breathtaking. The insight that the book delivers on every page about the framers of the nation is fascinating, intriguing, and at times infuriating.Read this book. Read it slowly, and read it again. Keep a pencil handy to underline passages.Adams and his story are a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A frank and funny adventures of a Flight Instructor.","review":"I enjoyed this book.

Just ruff up the mole with emery board or whatever you have lying around but try not to make it bleed, then clean around it, then put something around the skin to protect it like petroleum jelly, then apply apple cider vinegar directly, can also use a bandage to cover.

It began my love affair with ocean liners and cruise ships. I looked forward greatly to receiving this book as a Christmas gift to add to my collection of over 150 books on liners, etc.On arrival, the book is a great disappointment. The writing style is quite amateurish. The author seems to have relied on the stories of the same few people throughout the book. The pictures are small, often unclear and never in color. The ss America deserves much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPER!","review":"This is the first book that I have ever read by Catherine Coulter and find that I enjoy it very much. It is full of surprises, mysteries, humor, and sadness that it keeps you on you toes throughout the entire story. I couldn't put it down for a minute. Believe me, I couldn't wait to pick it up the minute I got back from school. It is truely a page turner. Set in the early 1800s, an innocent young girl tries to fight off her greedy cousin who wanted her heritage so he tries to force her into marriage. She escape him and ran into Frederick North Nightingale in an inn when her hostage became sick... If you enjoy books that makes you want to turn the page over and over until you finish them you should read this book. It will surely make you want to do that. Catherine is definitely going to be on my top list from now on. No way I'm going to stop looking for her books now that I found her."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENOUGH ALREADY!---(NOT A ROMANCE)","review":"I like a titillating and juicy story, but this one borderlined on sick. There was rape on top of rape, even the attempted rape of a young girl who was already pregnant from a previous rape. Add to that women-haters, women-murderers, incest, parricide, and in-depth details on gyno exams and you have a MISERABLE combination.The characters were not likable--some were even almost unbearable. The main villain was obvious and the whole ending with the sword-in-the-stone thing was ludicrous. Top it off with a narrator (Monica Buckley) who was so bad that she sounded like a little kid trying to change her voice and you have a recipe for total disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rape of the Sabine Women","review":"The Nightingale Legacy was way too heavy with the mistreatment of women for this review.

Ms. Hodge has a unique way of presenting multilayered political chicanery and intrigue in a simple and approachable manner. This obviously results from her extensive real world experience dealing with actual political power players. This book is really quite extraordinary. I recommend this installment of the series with a big thumbs up.

I loved it then. Since I've recently finished a Masters in forensic anthropology myself, I decided to pull it off my shelf and give it another run through.This is hands down the most honest and truthful illustration of what it's like to work in this field in a market flooded with a glut of products dedicated to the likes of Patricia Cornwell and Kathy Reichs. Every Bones/CSI fan needs to read this book and learn about the un-glamorous parts of these careers. I went into my career as a forensic anthropologist with a realistic understanding of the job because of Dr. Maples' great prose. While the CSI wannabes whine about the maggots and the smell, I do my job.This is a great book for anyone who is interested in forensic science and should be a required read in introductory courses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Men Do Tell Tales","review":"A must read for anyone interested in forensic science.

Throughout the book Mr. Maples educates the reader with understandable vocabulary and occasional subtle wit. An enjoyable, educational and captivating book to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scientific, yet interesting","review":"Usually, I do not care for scientific books; however, when I began reading \\"Dead Men Do Tale Tells,\\" I found it to be interesting and captivating.

It is very elequent, and puts the reader at ease, even when talking about the murder of children. It gives great insite into the world of the forensic anthropologist. The discovery of Czar Nicolas II and his family is especially well told. Dr. Maples is very good at making the reader feel like they are at the site of the grave and being the first one to dig up the bones. His argument about Alexi and Anastasia still being alive is very true. Another great story is the elephant man, Joseph Merrick. His description of the bone growths are very lifelike. When he talks about the hairs in the plaster cast of Merricks body, it brings shivers to the body. This is the best book I have ever read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted writing style makes this a disappointment","review":"I have to say that I was quite disappointed with this book.

'Too many strange departures between the cases covered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego and lack of depth gets in the way","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book.

In my opinion not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the tale?","review":"His arrogant style makes the reading uncomfortable. I am surprised that a promising introduction followed by boring,nearly self satisfactory chapters. Most stories are just worthy of a campfire side chatter. Disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book ruined by egotism","review":"Given the many positive reviews of this book, I'm really disappointed that I couldn't make it past the introduction. Maples is offensively arrogant, even bragging about capturing countless gorillas in Africa for scientific testing (which had NOTHING to do with the book -- where was the editor? ). Cancel that; probably the editor found it hopeless to deal with the guy. I disliked him so much I simply couldn't read the rest of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing look into forensic anthropology","review":"This was a fascinating book.

This is the first book I have ever read none stop. This book is not for someone with a sensitive system. The auther is very blunt but the stories he tells are great. If you are interested in forensic science as a carrier this would be a wonderful book to get before you make up your mind. I loved this book. I will buy and read more about this issue in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable and Informative","review":"I liked the no-nonesense relationship William Maples had with the dead. Whether he is dispelling myths about worm eaten corpses or explaining the reason for the distinctive smell of death he is both entertaining and informative. I was distressed to hear about his death in 1997 because clearly he is the type of expert that is needed in the field of forensic anthropology, one who knows both the lab work and the courtroom. The best expert in the world is useless in a case if he or she cannot convey their knowledge in a way that a jury will understand.He also showed an admirable (but at times frustating) concern for the privacy of the dead and their survivors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly written.","review":"I must admit when I ordered this book I was a little afraid it would be boring and hard to understand.Maples has written a first class book. I found it to be easy to understand and quite fascinating. He was graphic, but not to the point of being repulsive, and his honesty came pouring out in every sentence. Anyone who is interested in Forensics has to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I have read many books regarding forensic anthropology. Mr. Maples is eminently qualified as an anthropologist but I found his book to be lacking. His refusal to identify specific places, dates and identifications causes me to wonder how much is fact and how much is fiction. Dangling cases that go nowhere are a waste of time. So a bone was found by the side of the road and a dog chewed on it and??????? Where's the story there?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good and interesting read","review":"Interesting reading, as we delve into the mysterious of the past and of recent crimes. The author didn't strike me as egotistical at all. I mean, how many people can tolerate the smell of a decaying body? Even if it's a small animal, let alone a human corpse? Not many. So he's trying to tell the reader that it's a prerequisite of the job, what's the problem with that? Yes, he must be egotistical, since he thinks his profession and accomplishments and the cases he's worked on are important enough to write about. I wouldn't necessarily \\"recommend\\" this book, without a warning on it's gruesome content, but otherwise it's entertaining and fascinating reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"Truly interesting and insight full. I recommend it all the time. I have re-read it several times. Very, Very, Interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book by a wonderful man","review":"Prior to his death in 1997, Dr. Maples was a forensic anthropologist at the University of Florida. Forensic anthropology is a thrilling science in which you determine from skeletal material how somebody died, when he or she died, and who the person was. Forensic anthropologists are often called in to investigate bombings, plane crashes, war crimes, and crime scenes where the body is substantially decomposed.In this book Dr. Maples takes the reader into the Human Identification Lab and tells her about the most celebrated cases of his career.While an anthropology student at the University of Florida I had the opportunity to meet and get to know Dr. Maples. His love for the science was touching and he inspired me more than any other teacher or professor I have ever met."},{"rating":"2","title":"These intelligent and gripping tales are most amazing!","review":"Strange and Fascinating....this book definately lives up to its lengthy title. I was completely astonished by the intelligent writing and gruesome tales told in this collection of cases. You will laugh, cry, and more often than not grit your teeth at the witty tales that dead men tell in this book by William R. Maples and Michael Browning. This is a truly cunning book for people with the slightest interest in, well, death. Overwhelmingly educational and extremely well-written, \\"Dead Men Do Tell Tales\\" is extraordinary and brilliant in more ways than one.

Unless you need to learn about building antiquated ASP.NET 1.1 Server Controls using obsolete tools, don't waste your money on this book!It's very telling that all the images the seller chose to represent this book curiously omit any data regarding the ASP.NET Framework the book works with. The main image used to lure in unsuspecting buyers isn't the actual cover of the book, but the first page inside. If you were to see the actual cover of the book you would go no further. Also, none of the sample content images allude to the target framework.It's a sad story when you get the book you've just ordered, remove the wrappings, and realize that you've been had!

I wasn't interested, however, in retracing his career to purchase his efforts chronologially in an attempt to obtain a complete section. I just wanted to have a few songs so I could pop them in and call myself a fan. This was not the disc that got the job done. While most of the songs are great and the artistry is clear, this collection of songs does not work together well. I understand the risk anytime I buy a \\"greatest hits.\\" But this was terribly disappointing. I MAY feel inclined to listen to a song or two, but I am never inclined to put this in for the night.

It seemed like a low budget film which it is, but it's actually quite interesting.The plot was a really good plot, although, certain characters should have been played by different actors/actresses.There was a little comedy in the fight scene with the baby mama showing up to the cookout. Should have been a little longer.The scene with the boxer and his secret boyfriend of 5 years was possibly the realest and best acting out of the whole movie. The guy who plays the boyfriend that's on the sideline is SUPER CUTE! He seemed natural at acting and his scenes should have been longer and his character should have been extended. Would love to see him do more movies.But overall, the movie is good for what it's worth. It's better than alot of low budget crap out there. The message is really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD AT ALL","review":"From other reviews I thought it would be a good movie. They don't tell you the movie has sex, language, trashy, slutty.

I enjoyed the retractable cord and the fact that that it is small, which makes it easy to carry around. I also have small hands so it fits nicely. Plus it lit up, which was just fun.When I was looking for a mouse this was just what I was looking for. It did not need to have a lot of fancy buttons, all it had to do was be a mouse. However it died yesterday. There was not much logic behind it, it just stopped functioning. I have tried to get it work again and have decided that is a fruitless task. I don't know what the average life span of a mouse is but I have had other mice for much longer periods of time.Basically, if you are looking for a fairly decent, inexpensive mouse that may not last you a long time, than this would be a good mouse for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky","review":"I bought this to use with my laptop in tight quarters.

Well, with several of these patterns you can inexpensively buy yarn and quickly make items to use in fundraising (craft shows, etc.).

In my opinion if you have that many mistakes you should send it out to all the shops who have your book and let the buyers know - the book should come with the correction pages. The book had been out for a while before I purchased it and they later made a newer version - so I feel like I'm the sucker who got stuck with a version that should have been recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"I should have checked this book out of the library before I bought it. There are some nice patterns, but for me they're not worth the price of the book. I don't need a pattern to make a simple triangle kerchief, basic scarves and blankets, 1x1 rib legwarmers, etc. etc. So many of these really aren't patterns, in my opinion. I could come up with these things on my own with a little imagination and my stitch dictionaries (or in many cases, even without my stitch dictionaries). However, I do like several of the patterns, including the angora booties, silk camisole, and stuffed toys, among others. It's a nicely designed book with lovely pictures, but most of the \\"patterns\\" left me uninspired. I am, however, pleased that the author's suggested yarns are all natural fibers. Good quality natural fiber yarn goes such a long way to making simple handknits into something special."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun book","review":"While this isn't my favorite book ever, I found it fun. And the ideas are really good for last minute gifts. Most of the patterns are very simple and fast to knit, hence the name. While there is nothing ground breaking in the book, it delivers exactly what it promises.I also like the time guide. It is divide into chapters according to how long the projects take to make, which is helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful and frustrating book","review":"I started two projects in this book after not knitting in many years. Both resulted in a lot of ripping out due to poor instructions and pictures that did not match what the instruction said. The website no longer has corrections so I am left to figure things out on my own and as others have said when you have purchased high priced yarn you want to make it perfect.I do not recommend this book- go to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many mistakes","review":"I'm an experienced knitter, but the rabbit is definitely not a last minute project. There are some errors in the pattern, starting with the yardage in a skein of the suggested yarn, and none of them are listed in the errata. I intended to make the elephant,too, since I have twin grandchildren. The girl will get the rabbit when I finally finish it, but I'll buy the boy a truck. The book looks good, but I question the value of the contents."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"I own a lot of knitting books, and I have to say that this one is by far my favorite. I love the author's description of the use of color, and different combinations based on the color wheel. I've always had trouble finding patterns that are up-to-date, but still aren't off-the-wall and not wearable. All the patterns are great (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every patter is beautiful","review":"I've had this book for two years now, and it's still a reference book for me. Normally I buy a book and realize I only like one or two patterns from it, but this one is different. I like every single project in it. I've done all the baby hats and bonnets, the hourglass sweater, and the men's raglan sweater. They all turned out great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun patterns and a beautiful book to enjoy","review":"I bought this before Christmas thinking I would make some quick items to give as gifts but this book's value extends way beyond \\"holiday-cramming\\" projects. It is a joy to read with lovely illustrations and paper. I just finished the early American baby bonnet. The pattern was correct and easy to follow and the project was unique and gratifying. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly as the title states, but what fun is it to knit in a rush?","review":"This book is very boring and I'm going to give it to someone ELSE as a last minute gift. The patterns are exactly as stated, very simple with barely any shaping or creativity at all. Probably good for beginning knitters, but it has no instruction section, only a 6 page special technique section. It has beautiful photos, but that doesn't make up for the lame patterns. Felted potholders? Please... I'd have more fun shopping for a gift than knitting one of those up. Plus, I don't believe the time frames given for the projects, i.e. 4-6 hours for the gusseted floor cushions. No way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures but not practical","review":"The book has beautiful illustrations but that's about all I can say good about it. I was unable to find a knitting store that carried some of the yarns used in the book.Also, my daughter wanted to make the leg warmers as a Christmas present and with just a week to go before Christmas she could not find the yarn or the size needles used. We were both very disappointed with the book. Pretty to look at but not a book that I will be using."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Knitters should beware that the first edition of this book contains many errors in many patterns. The corrections are on the Purl Soho website and I believe they are on the 4th edition of this book to correct the many, many errors. Also beware that the 2nd and 3rd editions, although they have some corrections do not contain all of them.Although many of the patterns are beautiful, they should have been tested/edited more closely. I spent a lot of money on this book and expect the patterns to correct. It's not unusual to have 1 or 2 errors in a book of this size but this one seems to contain an inordinate amount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"I've made good use of this purchase. To date, I've made six of the patterns, and am working on the seventh. In general, I find the instructions to be well-written. The pictures are great--this is a fun book to mull over with a cup of tea, deciding what I want to knit next.That said, I do see a couple drawbacks:--some of the materials needed are hard to find. I wanted to knit the wrist warmers/fingerless mitts, but was completely unable to find 8\\" circular knitting needle, other than from mysterious online vendors! I had to improvise with the two-circular-needle method.--I found one pattern mistake, in the pink mohair scarf: the pattern has the repeat asterisk (*) in the wrong spot.--I'm a steady, fairly experienced knitter, but I found her estimated times too low. I finally figured if I doubled the time she suggested (i.e., \\"4-hour projects\\" really take 8 hours) I was just about hitting the mark. But all you really fast knitters out there will probably have no call to complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, easy to make, but expensive!","review":"Many of the gifts in this book are gorgeous, don't require a lot of sizing, are easy for a novice, and use lovely, livable color combinations. My only criticism is that with the luxurious all-natural yarns she recommends, the gifts can end up quite pricey! One gorgeous blanket is double knit with alpaca . . . even using a discounted wool blend the yard costs came to over $200 and that was before I bought the needles or spent the time making the gift. As a student who was hoping home-knit gifts could be a way to save money but still show I cared about the recipient, this book did not always fit my budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and fun","review":"I LOVE this book. I am a beginning knitter (still...after 2 years) but I've made a number of beautiful, challenging projects from this book. It is my favorite resource...and I own just about every knitting book. The only fault: some of the yarns they use in their examples are pricey and rare....oh but I do love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book","review":"This book is a visual feast. I bought it as a gift for my daughter and was tempted to keep it for myself(she was just as impressed as I was with the quality of the book). Most of the projects are aimed at beginner and advanced beginner knitters. A great value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun things!","review":"There are quite a few projects I am excited to make in this little book! I'm glad that I ordered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"This is a must have book for those last minute gifts! The book contains some very easy and quick patterns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pattern book.","review":"One of the neatest thing about this book is how quick and easy the projects are. When you're down to hours before a baby shower, a birthday party or a holiday - this is the book I would turn to find that unique gift for someone special.I have several books by this author, and all of them have some of the most beautiful photos. Joelle's instructions are easy to follow, the patterns are fun, pretty and who wouldn't love a cashmere tea cozy! I love just flipping through and admiring the gorgeous projects and dreaming of what I could make."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book in all respects","review":"This book is lovely.I have made many of the projects for gifts and have gotten so many compliments.I love the photography and the little descriptions for each item.A great gift for a knitter. You'll refer to it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS BOOK","review":"I have taken this book out of the library for almost an entire year (on and off)... it was time to purchase it and give others a chance at it! I love the book from a visual standpoint; the design and layout is appealing to me, and the patterns, while fairly simple, are inspirational. I have made severalof the patterns successfully, and would only caution against the 'hourglass sweater' which has some problems. All in all, great for a beginner/intermediate knitter's personal library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with a bunch of mistakes","review":"I teach knitting and recommend this book to all my students. The projects manage to be both timeless and stylish. But watch out for errors! Corrections can be downloaded from the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly nice gifts","review":"What a gem this book is! The projects are well thought out and the presentation is professional looking. I purchased this book because I'm familiar with the author's Purlsoho.com website. I am not much beyond a beginning knitter and I was able to follow the patterns without difficulty. I have made several of the projects for this Christmas season and have found the directions to be clear and accurate and the time specified for project completion was correct. I have read that corrections for some of the patterns are available on the aforementioned website. This book made preparing my project list and completing the gifts in plenty of time to enjoy the week before Christmas instead of racing to finish projects. The designs in the book are contemporary, trendy and stylish. The suggested yarns were readily found or easily substituted with similar products. I was happy to produce quality gifts from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice photographs, mediocre patterns","review":"Okay, so does a tassel or pom-pom count as a gift? Probably not, unless the recipient is a cat.The nice thing about this book is that it's organized according to how many hours it would take to knit various gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninspiring","review":"I frequently watch out for any new knitting books so I can find any new idea. This book is disappointing because the projects are just plain. I don't like the author spent pages just to describe (worship) a simple scarf, and pages devoted for pom pom? This is a trend anyway that beautiful cover with a few simple projects can sell to some novices. I just go back to some classic knitting books I enjoyed for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good!","review":"This is a very expensive book with very few projects and very similar to any other knitting book. For your money, better buy \\"Weekend Knitting\\" it has 50 unique projects for everyone in your list and all of the patterns are very original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oliver Twist DVD","review":"I thought I was ordering the musical \\"Oliver\\" so I have not even watched this DVD yet, and do not even know if I will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure","review":"In Polanski's film Oliver Twist, he fails to bring out the real message and story of this young orphan. People who just see this movie and do not read the book will see the wrong message of Oliver Twist. They will see an adventure instead of an explanation of the workhouses. That was Dickens' reason for making Oliver Twist. I thought this movie was horrible. I knew Polanski would have to cut out some characters and scenes from the book, but he cut out all the important ones. The story did not show Twist's family history and characters. I also believe this movie gave a bad message to kids because it showed people how to pickpocket. Also, in the book there was plenty of humor but in the movie I did not laugh at all except when I first saw Fagin. The one bright spot of the film was Ben Kingsley's role as Fagin who acted with a sweet and old voice yet you knew by his sound that he was a thief. BUY THE BOOK AND DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oliver Twist","review":"I am enjoyed on watched on the DVD'Oliver Twist'.I like Oliver Twist becasue great story and classic story.I like a DVD because I have lots of DVDS and this is brllaint story.I like a DVD because I am relax and fun watch to on the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly--all atmosphere, no delivery","review":"It begins and ends with little Barney Clark. If your Oliver can't act, then by-golly, there's nothing to look at for the next two hours besides the nice sets and the costuming.Honestly, I do have to admit to three good performances in the movie: Ben Kingsley was excellent as Fagin, Jamie Foreman was effective as Sykes, and Harry Eden as the Artful Dodger gave a great performance.But when the titular role is not compelling, or even interesting, then those other parts can not captivate nor horrify you the way they were written to be. If your audience doesn't care about Oliver, then there's a big, big problem with having an entire movie that revolves around him. It gets boring real fast.So sorry, Mr. Polanski!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent update on the classic tale","review":"polanski's characters resonate a faithful depiction of the dickens text. in this \\"twist\\", the characters are exactly as one imagines them to be in the book, come to life! succeeds beautifully with set, costume, photography, and editing. any dickens book in 2 hours has to be a huge challenge, but is very nicely done here. i am so thrilled this movie was made...it's the new definitive version. i'd love to see what polanski could do with \\"the pickwick papers\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does Hollywood think they can improve the classics?","review":"I found this version to be very dark and depressing. Not at all entertaining. I've read the book as a kid and have seen all versions including the musical which was the best. This version is something i would not take children to see and yet Oliver is about a child. Has Hollywood gotten so distorted in their thinking with loose morals or is that Hollywood is no longer the creative capital of the world. Films that are made in other countries run circles around american films. Of course we no longer have the real talent that we had many years ago. Don't bother to view this film, get the original or get the musical. Don't even bother to rent this one unless you want your kids to have nightmares."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZ....","review":"This is going to be short...I found this movie to be very boring...I lost interest in this film right out of the shoot. I do not think that this is a film that children should see...it is very dark, and it would not keep the attention of any child that I know of....skip this film, read the book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironic story choice for Polanski","review":"AS a convicted child molester, ironic that Polanski would choose a story about child abuse. Then again, exploiting children is something he knows a little about.AS for me, the first Oliver Twist was good enough. The musical Oliver wasn't too bad either. I'm skipping this one. Don't like to line the pockets of creepy people who think they are above the law.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just as I had expected","review":"In reading the published reviews wirtten for this movie thus far, I am not surprised that even with some contrasting opinions, they all seem to share the same common ground. No, I have not seen the production, but I anticipated that it would be yet another Hollywood, \\"Letdown, Wetdown, and Putdown!\\"Here we are once again, running to the \\"title\\" of the movie rather than the quality of the film itself. I find these reviews to be extremely helpful; similar to the warnings on a prescription label. Having read them all, I am safely avoiding this movie just the way I did with another \\"bomb\\" - The Chocolate Factory.It becomes more obvious to me that Hollywood is only interested in increasing its wealth, while attacking American ethos; hence, lowering its standards even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wished I had watched this one earlier...","review":"This review is not so much a rating for the movie, but the quality of the disc. I bought the DVD about 6 months ago and never had time to watch it. Until a few days ago. After 1h 41m the movie got stuck! Took it out of the player, carefully examined the DVD surface... not the slightest scratch or dust particle to be seen. Put it back in, jump to the scene and... stuck again. I have another player... guess what, it gets stuck already at the annoying SONY Pictures opening logo. Tried the disc in two different PCs, same problem: SONY Pictures logo and then... nothing. Ultimately tried to make a copy using DVDFab, a wonderful program that usually helps out, but nope: error reading disc. Of course it is too late now to send it back. I did like the movie though, so I'll spend another 10 bucks for a new copy. Hopefully I can then return here to add some more stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oliver Twist","review":"I actually wanted the musical but this movie is also enjoyable and it cost too much to send it back"},{"rating":"2","title":"I adore this film","review":"I purchased the 2005 version of Oliver Twist because I'd seen the trailer. This is one of those films that I have been watching again and again and again. Many times I will end up bored and wandering off because I feel fidgety with other films but this is in the category of ones that I'm not going anywhere when it's going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marshalls on 10","review":"First time I heard of this group was around 82 while in California employed by Uncle Sam. Catchy tunes with a sense of humor. Devil's Deck was the first tune I had ever heard by them which was receiving radio play back then. Steve Shelski's soloes have a hint of Kim Mitchell influence but I also hear a bit of Randy Rhoads vibe on Love Poison. Over the years I have turned a few friends onto this band. No hair or speed metal here dudes, just really good early 80's hard rock.This album is my favorite but the others have some great tunes on them as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is unreadable!","review":"I was interested in the book and the movie because of the 70's feminist/female-empowerment angle. I am sorry to say that I purchased this book after reading the mixed reviews here and found that it was completely unreadable. Perhaps it's because it's translated from the French: I will give it the benefit of the doubt that the writing appears better in its original language. But In English, the writing is terrible and there is no attempt at any literary value (despite its claims). The \\"erotica\\" was so clumsily worded as to have no appeal at all. I stopped reading after a few chapters. At least the movie had Sylvia Kristel, who - no matter what you think of her acting skills - is kinda cool in her cult, campy, 70's way. But this book has no Sylvia Kristel or any kind of cult cool. If you think Danielle Steele and Shirley Conran is corny and unreadable, this is much, much worse. It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Drivel","review":"A couple of scenes involving Emmanuelle and her catty, women friends are real and amusing. The rest of the novel is preposterous. The eighty pages of ranting by an artist named Mario might inadvertently constitute the most savage indictment of the \\"examined life\\" in the annals of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Title","review":"The author may have lived in the tropics and had wild times. She had no connection with the world around her beyond comments about the heat, which may have double meanings. The rant of Man's world over the natural world smacks of the college cafe. The sex in the aircraft is something else to seperate her from the world around her. Basically a few good sex scenes and early 70's pop philosophy.The Movie version provides better entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well when fits","review":"I really liked it but it was my mistake to order small size. I could not use it in training only because it didn't fit me.

To try to label and critizice him or this book in religious terms is a sign of not wanting to accept what you can learn from this incredible searcher for truth.Read this book, preferably after some meditation, in order to be more connected to your inner Self than to your critical brain that rejects all that cannot be explained rationally!Even if you look into this book just out of curiosity, or historical interest, it will give you much insight into the many roots the present-day European, and Western culture had in Spain at Ibn \`Arabi's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holiday Earworms, made even more annoying.","review":"If my three year old were reviewing this, her review would go like this:\\"Put on the Dora CD please!\\"But my three year old is not reviewing this, I am.

It really turned into a growing disaster, and it's ugly to boot.All of our young seedlings were doing great when we put them in there around late March. They were healthy and 5 inches tall, or so. We had carefully nurtured them indoors for many weeks.Within a week, they had fried in the greenhouse. It was just too difficult to keep the air flow optimal on hot days. I'm also not convinced it was warm enough during cold nights.We did transplant one seedling into a big pot and it did much better in the greenhouse, eventually moving outdoors and even growing fruit on it.Given it's ugliness, though, and the fact that the plants were mostly killed, I would definitely not recommend it.

It is a tale of how Buzzsaw Louie (with a working buzzsaw in his left hand) teaches the people of Dinkle town that the true meaning of Christmas is not more toys. Mr Nezzer is great as a greedy toy maker Silly Songs with Larry is the best one I've seen yet. This video inspired us to get more Veggie Tales"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little disappointing compared to other VT videos","review":"Compared to other Veggie Tale videos, this one was disappointing. The true meaning of Christmas was not strong enough nor pure enough at all. Christmas is so commercialized by everyone; why does this have to add to it? And the usual VT trademarks such as the theme song and reviewing the lesson are missing, and they leave big holes in the overall quality. There are so many possibilities with a Christmas video...but I saw a lack of creativity here. HOWEVER, this is a good start to telling little ones about Christmas and what it really means. My daughter LOVES it, and watches it over and over, even now in JULY! We have watched and own a number of VT videos. And as a family, we love them all. Overall, Veggie Tales has done a fantastic job in bringing God's Word to the every day lives of little ones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Veggie humor and a great story too!","review":"If you like the other VeggieTales videos, you'll love this one too!

This is one of my son's favorite Veggie adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Christmas movies for kids","review":"This video shows the true meaning of Christmas. The Veggies show that Christmas is not a big commercial thing where you get toys. Christmas is really about Jesus, and the gifts are just thrown in for fun; they aren't the main thing. Also, the animation is realistic. For example, on the \\"Oh Santa!\\" song, the pile of snow behind Larry gets gradually bigger as the song goes on. It's a great VeggieTales video & the best kids' Christmas video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre book","review":"I didn't read the apparent prequel to this book, but I don't think that should be a requirement.The book is a disjointed jumble of one-dimensional characters and \\"action\\" (repeated over and over) -- one improbable conspiracy theory piled on top of another."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than just a bit lost at sea ...","review":"Being a bit of a closet afficianado (sp?) on the Philadelpha Experiment, I picked up SHIP OF THE DAMNED with high hopes ... and perhaps that was my undoing. Had I left my expectations at the door, I might've enjoyed the read a bit more than the 2-star rating, but, unfortunately, the author composes very short, almost terse chapters that do little to stimulate the imagination; rather, he just pushes the plot along. As his prose and storytelling style has been placed on par with Tom Clancy by some reviewer, I think it's a dramatic overstatement. Mr. David attacks his story with an almost \\"look, ma, I can write\\" mentality, giving very little depth to his characters or the events they fantastically find themselves caught up in. It's high on plot and low on facts and science, so leave the brain at the door if you want to enjoy this ride on the SHIP OF THE DAMNED."},{"rating":"2","title":"works","review":"I bought the product because i.

I really liked the \\"waking up, sunday morning\\" song on dig your own hole, I hated the noel gallagher song (setting sun) in the middle of the cd.

I had heard \\"Let Forever Be\\" and bought the album, and I found that every other song was in a much different style--and I didn't like it. I was ready to use the CD as a coaster. It was not until I listened to this CD a few times until I realized it is better than I initially thought. The Chemical Brothers' style is unique, and it may take some getting used to. Being a fan of Techno artists like Lo-Fidelity Allstars and Fatboy Slim, the trance-like style of the Chemical Brothers was something different. I would recommend this CD to someone who is a fan of trance, but also a fan of more upbeat techno. It is a bizzare mix of both styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chem Bros keep doing it...","review":"Awsome disc, another great from the Chemical Brothers.

The first two tracks are OK, but from there it just seems to get dull ( Asleep From Day and Got Glint? spring to mind ). It feels as though the chemical brothers spent more time signing up guest singers for Surrender than they did in actually making the music.

Here technology has been used to cover up the total lack of any real musical hook or theme. OK, there are a couple of decent offerings here, but as usual, the main input on these tracks has been from others, (Sumner, Gallagher etc).

For any other artist, this could be a four-star album, but for the Chemicals, this album lacks the excitement and audio-candy amazement of Dig Your Own Hole. It's not that the songs are bad, it's just that they are rather lackluster and repetitive compared to their other works (especially the whole second half of Hole). It's unfortunate that the Chemicals didn't include the two B-sides on the \\"Hey Boy Hey Girl\\" 12\\"--those songs are more reminscent of the classic Chemical style and may even get some play next time I spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unjustly Underated Album by the Chems","review":"Okay, Exit Planet Dust is hands down the best from this Big Beat duo, but that this album has been bashed in comparison to its predecessor (Dig Your Own Hole) is unfair. Unlike eevryone else, I think the album is far more interesting than Hole because none of the songs sound alike. If you like techno, Under the Influence is perfect; if you want chill, Sunshine Underneath and Asleep from Day deliver. Plus, Hey Boy, Hey Girl has to be the best dance song ever. Due to song number 4 being a bore, I can't give this album 5 stars.

It is obvious that they have taken their time writing this album, for its better quality. The Chemical Brothers' sound has changed somewhat after their last album, DIG YOUR OWN HOLE.

The egos of Tom and Ed seem intent on fuelling their egos and being really 'clever'. They've also let themselves be inspired by tacky synth sounds rather than the ferocios techno leanings of Dig Your Own Hole. Having a whole clutch of guest vocalists in just leaves the record short of identity. Let Forever Be sums up the problems. It's just a lazy retreat of Setting Sun, Noel sounds disinterested, and the boys didn't even conjure up the song themselves. Out Of Control is possibly the only time where a guest singer really gets it right here. Overall there's too much ego and not enough class. Orange Wedge and Got Glint aren't bad but overall this doesn't cut the mustard.And is Hey Boy Hey Girl meant as a joke? It's so cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this CD.","review":"After hearing and reading all the hype about the Chemical Brothers, I thought I'd give them a try.

If you really like Techno stick to Fatboy Slim."},{"rating":"1","title":"brothers, chill back off these chemicals please.","review":"Surrender cheapens other forms of music, mainly techno, house, and electro. There are no kick-backs to any era throughout this cd. It's as if the Brothers graduated the Big Beat sound with honors and decided to enroll in first grade tech-house, learning only to doodle with old rave crayons. And the result is a splattering of sounds that are impressionistic of the worst techno art, poorly crafted and unpleasant to the ear. Mazzy Star's contribution is the best track, mainly because it hints at none of the 'childish bouncing in dark rooms with glo sticks' phenomenon that people who enjoy this album seem prone to."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL DULL DULL","review":"The Chemical Brothers have three things going for them; 1.They picked a cool name that the media likes 2.They are hyped by MTV 3.One Brother has funny glasses.

The interface is really slick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not great","review":"I got this game when it first came out, played it, and it was great. A few games later you start to notice that the all mighty AI, is all very much predictable. To a historical sence.... when my phalanx are able to fight along side my space marines.. it just kinda throws the game off. There is no option in the game to update units that have been deemed obsolete. So you can either send them off to battle to die or disband them. Either way, they will be marked up as a loss on the score card. If you are thinking of buying it, please have a system far beyond what they recommend. I have a P366 w/ 32 MB of RAM and when my civilization reaches about 20 billion people, it crawls. To give you an examble, I can end a turn and go take a shower. Overall, it is good for about 10 games."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good game, but not the best I 've seen","review":"Basicly a mix of civ2, alpha centauri and some goodies. It has taken most of the good civ2 stuff, taken most of the bad stuff out, and put in usualy good features and some times bad features to make a pretty good game. The tricky at first, easy after practice way of moving units might stop some people from picking up this game, but I recommend you get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This game is fun. pure and simple. control an empire to destroy your opponents. i haven't played the other civs. so i can't compare. but i like this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a quality successor to the Civilization series","review":"I was very disappointed with this game. The graphics are a step up, but the new klunky interface detracts from playability, even once you get used to it. My biggest gripe is that the technology tree wasn't expanded, but rather completely replaced. While this contributes somewhat to a new, fresh game, the elimination of key technologies and their functional replacement by other, more esoteric ones detracts from the realism possessed by its predecessors. Those happy with the improvements in graphics, units, technologies, and user interface Civilization II boasted over the original will be seriously disappointed if you're looking for the same in this title. I've already stopped playing Call to Power, but I still play Civ II occasionally, for what that says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Civ II in a new box.","review":"Why didn't I just read the packaging and put it down. No, I had to go and buy it. I played Civ II once, Alpha Centauri two or three times, and now Call to Power... well, I didn't make it through the tutorial.One word... ZZZZZZZZZZZ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poorly Done","review":"This game is just CivII with a new coat of paint. The game is boring, the AI of the computer is weak. I don't recomend it to anyone. The tech support on the web didn'y solve any of my install problems that I had. When I called ech support I got the \\"Is your computer pluged in?\\" line of questions that got me no where."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money - Buy Alpha Centauri","review":"This game is a VERY VERY poor follow on in the Civilization genre. All they did was make the game more turns (and therefore more tech adv). They added a number of sub rosa attacks. User Interface was tough to get used to for moving units. (I often ended up clicking a unit into a long move series...) Finally, the end game graphics stunk...In fairness, their trade model is better, as well as the tile improvements model (no more enigneers/settlers). They kept capitalization and infrastructure (from Civ II). Very good is the ability to save a production queue to use later.Go to the Alpha Centauri page now and buy that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of sound and fury... signifying nothing","review":"Luckily I did not buy this game myself -- I merely tested it on a friend's machine. Civ II is one of the most replayable games in computer history; this is one of the least, assuming you can even get through a single game. The designers looked at Civ II and stuck to the old motto of America \\"MORE IS BETTER!\\" So, they added more units, more governments, more improvements, more wonders, more screens, more subscreens, more tasks, more....This game gets bogged down incredibly quickly. Some of the units are fantastically powered (like the Slaver); some are not even worth buying (pity the poor Spy and Leviathan). Trying to take out an opponent is next to impossible. Trying to create a viable empire is next to impossible. What you end up with is a VERY long game to no particular purpose, other then mere repetitions of the previous turns. History has become dull...Do not bother with this game.This is NOT Civilization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Played this for hours!","review":"On my old XP system. Never was able to get this to run under Win7. That's sad because I like id a little better than CTP2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value in light of other Civ titles","review":"I reviewed this game at the same time Civ3 was out (which I have not played.) I find CivCTP to be just as addicting as any of the earlier versions. I have to agree with other reviewers that some of the gameplay is slow, but this was not a serious complaint from me. I appreciated how many object attributes can be seen through a 'right click'. City Management seems easier if you know how to set up the screen views.At the time of review, the product was deeply discounted, making this a very good value. If you get the value (jewel) version, the manual will be very minimal (with no or minimal strategies explained.) However, the game was pretty much easy to learn without a manual, esp. if you are already familiar with Civ, and strategies can also be gained through simple trial and error, so I did not find any need to seek the full manual or a strategy guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Succesor","review":"With all the great reviews that this game recieved, and having a passion for the previous editions of Civilization, i decided this was a must have software.After the 50 years you spend trying to figure out how evrything works, you start to feel the passion for the game, but It is not like the other ones. It is too complicated and too complex, it takes the fun out of the game. The other versions, were simpler and more straight forward. They tried to make this one so good, that they ended up screwing up the game. Buy Civilization 2, it is cheaper and better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than people think","review":"It seems some people don't like Call to Power because it's not Sid Meir's Civilzation, but that's exactly the point: It's a different game. This game is kind of a hybrid between Sid Meir's Civilization and Age of Kings. I think the AI intelligence is right up there with Civilization by Sid Meir. Also, the graphics are pretty good too. (This game is \\"old\\", so it may not be up to some people's standards.) Also, I like the huge maps and the lots of advances, city improvements, and units. Quite frankly, I like Call to Power's space-age military units better than Civilization's. If you're looking for a Sid Meir clone, don't buy this. But if you're looking for a fun alternative, this could be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Activision's big mistake","review":"This is the worst CIV game out there. They changed the interface so drasticly that it is no longer any fun. They renamed all the wonders and lots of the technologies and worst of all, it doesn't feel like a civ game. This game may have good graphics, but thats it. It is way to complicated. My settelers can't even bulid roads. The AI ain't great and they always appear early.

Unfortunately, not true...Even if you grew up in the Sixties (which I did), much of the first 300 pages or so are just a mish-mash of commentary and pseudo history. Do yourself a favor and skip to Part Four where you'll find a marginally-diverting scenario if California experienced \\"the big one.\\" Worth 30 minutes, tops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great","review":"This is not a good book. It tells the story of a massive earth quake which supposedly knocked California off into the ocean in 1969. Yeah, it sounds like it has the potential to be a good story. That's what made me pick it up.Alas, the book is dry and unexciting. It reads like a history book, and since it is a history of an event which never happened, it really isn't at all interesting.There are no main characters, so the reader has no one with which to identify. What story there is, is told in brief and disconnected pieces as if the book were a collection of newspaper and magazine articles. Perhaps this was meant to lend a sense of reality to the story but it doesn't work.In short, this book is a failure. It fails on so many levels that it would take another book to list all the shortcomings. Do yourself a favor. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still, after 35 years, one of my favorite books","review":"Like others here I've recommended this book, and given copies of it to friends, for years. Having just re-read it, I find my opinion holds up.I wish someone would do a Reagan expose that includes all the stuff Gentry writes about, only more in depth. The Reagan in these pages scared me so much that I registered Republican to vote against him in the primaries.The history of the Jackson bordellos alone is almost worth the price of the book, as are the statistics of what California meant to the rest of the country and the world in 1968--statistics which I suppose are still fairly accurate in the aggregate.If you can find it, do yourself a favor and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the point","review":"the author is entirely focused on how he would like to worship that he forgets Whom he is there to worship.

The lessons are aggressive, but easily followed during self-study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Hard Rock Collection","review":"Canada's Coney Hatch was very much a product of its time. They played melodic hard rock with a metal edge, and had that certain indefinable quality that lets you know instantly that you're hearing mid-eighties hard rock. There are shades of Journey and Foreigner-style AOR here, but the band's sound is closer to bands like Axe, Rail, and countrymen April Wine. Heavy, but not quite metal. Melodic, but not quite AOR. Definitely hard rock though.Best of Three is a compilation of material from Coney Hatch's three studio albums. Surprisingly for a \\"best of\\" compilation, there are no live tracks, though there is one song \\"Fuel For the Fire\\" that is exclusive to this disc. Best of Three is a great introduction to Coney Hatch, a band that should appeal to fans of classic hard rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book, but it just didn't work","review":"Anneke was not believable as a computer consultant. She was not likable, coming off as a very self-obsessed, shallow clotheshorse. The author's writing technique got very much in the way of the telling of the story. The rules of fair play in handling a mystery were not, in my opinion, followed. Things were very deus ex machina. I was not satisfied with how the mystery was solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Hold Charge","review":"This jumpstarter doesn't hold a charge.

Wagan Inc. made it right by replacing the out-of-warranty unit if I paid to ship the old unit. This is a booster unit, do not purchase it as a power source. A power source unit is a deep-cell battery. The Wagan Powerdome is not a deep-cell battery, it is a jumper battery. Jumper batteries aren't intended to be used as a power supply. This battery won't recover from repeated deep discharges. When you hear the alarm sound on the inverter, STOP USING THE POWERDOME UNTIL YOU RECHARGE IT! If you must have inverter power when the alarm sounds, attach the battery cables to a vehicle battery and turn the battery safety switch to \\"on\\" on the Powerdome.

Fictional Florida is full of locals colorful enough to populate a freak show, bad guys evil enough to carry out twisty 50-year-long schemes of revenge and tourists burnt to a flamingo pink. Then comes Connie May Fowler, the Florida novelist who shot to national success through the endorsment of talk-show host Oprah Winfrey. Fowler's deep understanding and respect for the Gulf Coast dresses the stage for her well-spun stories. It's a Florida where real people, seemingly face the daily miracles and familiar tragedies of life. Beautifully told. Romantic, lyrical, honest and uplifting, the story is a gem"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"I loved this book! The story is simple and that makes it so enjoyable. The main characters are well drawn and seem so real. Connie Mae Fowler has captured the setting perfectly. If you have ever been to Carabelle, FL. you recognize the sites and the people. I am sure that I have seen the Trailer For Rent sign along side the road. I couldn't put this book down.

Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, poignant storytelling","review":"You feel compassion for the main characters right from the start, and are drawn into their world of appreciating nature. Even though the book is technically a \\"memoire,\\" it reads like any other story. It's just, the story is a woman remembering her husband. Probably what's most interesting is that you start the book knowing the ending -- and while you're reading to find out how it happened, you're reading a beautiful story. The two young people in the couple explore themselves and each other, and live in a snug community.Charming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant storytelling","review":"As a few reviewers have noted, the book gains momentum with each chapter. Did Fowler plan that? or was it more a matter of the flow of the story grabbing her at about page 100? One wonders.Stay with this book. It is a gem of a story, and it will prompt you to remember that we are meant to live passionately; we are meant to surrender to ourselves and our yearnings; and that we are meant to care about and for others.The book gives us an experience that teems with life -- of the sea, of the island, of the forgotten coast along the Big Bend (Carrabelle, Eastpoint, Appalachicola), where most still struggle to make ends meet by fishing for oysters and shrimp.You will fall in love with all of the characters, and you will fall in love with the setting.

Bob relates his life and times on the ranch with Pearl and Ascended Master Bob Jr., describes how he was able to raise his body straight up into heaven by saying the word I AM one-trillion consecutive times, and reveals the Great Cosmic All-Time Secret Formula for subduing an angry rattlesnake (\\"rattlers,\\" he calls them) with a single kiss of the lips.*Spoiler:At the end of this book, you learn that God's \\"True Name\\" is not I AM after all.

She becomes involved in many searches for children---at the job, helping find Jules' homeless friend, Dio, and finally when Jules herself disappears while on a trip with Kate. This is a hard book to put down, particularly with the plot twists, including the possibility that Jules could have been kidnapped by a notorius serial killer. I enjoyed it but was somewhat disappointed by the unresolved issues between Kate and Lee at the end of the book.

I've been reading a few stories a day and sadly finished it yesterday. It has become one of my favorite books. There are too many good things to name about it and the other two books! There's a lot of variety in this latest installment, including more poems and cartoons as well as short stories. I enjoyed almost every contribution! A few great stories are \\"Never Been Dissed\\", \\"Dear Child\\", \\"A Gift of Time\\", \\"Ghost Mother\\", and \\"Accentuating Differences\\". The way teens work out their problems(especially family tension)is interesting and helpful. Now I know I'm not alone and have some ideas on how to deal with difficult situations. The mother stories reminded me to appreciate my own mom more. No people we love are perfect, but they all impact us, even if they die. The part I didn't like was that most of the love stories are sad and depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at first sight!","review":"I really enjoyed the Chicken Soup for the Soul books. They have stories written by people based on personal experiences. Some stories made me feel excitement, sorrow, and happiness. I can get all that from one book!

Well, Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul I & II were better than the third. But it was a really good book, you should read it anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicken Soup For the Teenage Soul 3","review":"Chicken Soup For The Teenage Soul III is really interesting because the stories that are in the book are ones that can really happen. The stories make you realize that you should be thankful for things you have and what and who you are. The stories in this book are peoples diaries that got put in this book.

This book also taught me a lot about myself and that there are people out there that think the same way I do. This book was happy, sad, fun, and enlightening all in one.

This book is one of those few. I always found it to be inspirational. Though Milarepa exhibits superhuman strength in his Sadhana, spiritual practice, it is nevertheless a lofty ideal to sustain spiritual aspirants. It is a truism, often neglected at great peril, that one is happiest when trying to live according to one's ideals. Ignoring the negative opinions and hidebound thoughts of the worldly environment one must forge ahead to manifest the ideals presented by the Great Yogis! It may be a terrific struggle, full of many setbacks, but Victory awaits those who never give up. For me Milarepa has been a beacon of a true example. may all who seek liberation from the dualities of this world find brotherhood with the Great Yogi Milarepa!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa","review":"This book was recommended by my spiritual coach.

It is invaluable for creating my own designs and her alphabets are better than any I have seen. My experiences with different shops is that they have different requirements as to extra rows, amount of needlepoint covered by the leather and the like. Because of that there are differing ways of figuring your designs and the number of stitches between designs.

While this book might be of interest to those curious about Sallis' general philosophical concerns, students of Kant should likely avoid it. The book is completely ignores the tradition of Kant commentary, leaves untouched incredibly important arguments in the Trans.

However, my one year old and four year old will not sit through this video long enough to learn anything. It is boring as can be. It is basically one woman standing there in front of the camera teaching sign. Occasionally, she will explain a reason for the sign (mostly for adults), but there is no repeating or recap, which makes it difficult for children to learn. There are no pictures that go with the sign so my one year old loses interest immediately. My four year old will watch for a few minutes, but gets frustrated because by the time she figures out how to do one sign, the instructor has moved on to four more.

Even though I have all eleven episodes (my family buys them THE DAY they first come out), Rack, Shack and Benny is my absolute favorite. The whole story is retold in a new way, so, instead of hearing the same story from the same point of view in the bible, it's remade in a different situation with the same consequences and the same portrayal of God's protection for his children. Plus the great solo by Junior Aspargus makes it all worthwhile, because, let's face it, Junior Rules! The dance of the cucumber is cool, too. (I like his clothes!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good remake of a biblical story","review":"This is a good video. The songs are very good as well. It's dissapointing that the catchy bunny song in the song you're not supposed to sing, but in the Silly Sing A-long there's a better version that you CAN sing! My only gripe about this video is the super-fast way in which Mr. Nezzer learns his lesson. Of course, that's the way it happened in the Bible, but it is quite unbelievable. I also would like to remind any confused people out there that the bunny song DOES support bad things, because that's what it is SUPPOSED to do!

Nezzer, owner of Nezzer Chocolate Factory, goes to extremes over his love for chocolate bunnies. Rack, Shack, and Benny work at Nezzer's factory and end up facing a serious dilemma: should they do what everybody else is doing or stand up for what they believe in? This highly entertaining computer generated video teaches kids a valuable lesson on handling peer pressure through its use of creative storytelling and catchy tunes.

They are all here in this video based on Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego from the book of Daniel. What a great lesson. With God you always win, but you do have to stand up for what you believe in. Bob, Jr. and Larry are right on target with not bowing down to Mr. Nezzer's big chocolate bunny. My children had no problem figuring out that God was with them in the firey furnace and they got the concept of the video right away. I highly recommed it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Veggie Classic","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this VeggieTales movie and can understand why it is a favorite for some of my Veggie-loving friends. The plot was good, the characters were lovable (except for Nezzer who of course isn't generally liked, though his singing is fun to imitate). I saw the video version, so I'm not aware of this line-changing business but it does seem kind of sad. I liked the story, liked the characters, liked the silly song too (Larry doing folk dance in spanish is pretty laughable). Highly recommended to any VeggieTales fan that hasn't seen it yet, and actually for those who have. It's one that you can rewatch again and again and still enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moral lessons made fun","review":"My toddler and teens watch this over and over again.

However this is a first effort, and although a more digestible album than Zig Zague, not destined to be played in your car or home more than a couple of times.

Her portrayal of a obsessive stalker was pathetic. Louis Jordan played her love interest, and he just did not play the part well either. Joan Crawford was the strong-willed Editor of a publishing company and you felt sorry she had to play such a pathetic part.Overall this is a chick flick gone bad.

Watching the movie now is almost laughable unless your of an age to remember that women were really like that in the fifties. Very gullible, and excepted sexual harassment as part of the job.

It seems they're flailing for an identity. Come on, Andreas has been doing this for quite some time, where's his songwriting skill? As for the new singer, his vocal presentation is decent, but the lyrics are rather drab. While I think this is a clear display of independence and perseverance at all costs, I am simply not impressed by this work. The instrumental pieces are creative, but the variety of styles, especially the punk/hardcore direction, startled me a little bit. But give them time. I'm very interested in seeing what they do on the next release... then we can better determine what they're working towards.

It has seem that the music has turned into pop metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst effort from Sepultura","review":"Sepultura's first album after the departure of vocalist/founder Max Cavalera, \\"Against\\" debuts the band with new frontman Derrick Green, and sadly this is an album which suffers from uneven songwriting from an unfocused band. \\"Roots\\" was where Max seemed to probably be heading the band for a more mainstream appeal, and \\"Against\\" spits back at him and his Soulfly outfit in every which way, and while it does have a few great moments here and there (\\"Choke\\", \\"Tribus\\"), the rest of \\"Against\\" is practically uninspired sounding and just sounds so generic. Green was, and is, a good fit for the band; lending some ferocious roars here and there, and thankfully Sepultura molded together better on the following albums \\"Nation\\" (which was the last studio album for Roadrunner) and the recent \\"Roorback\\". All in all, \\"Against\\" is the worst album to bear the Sepultura name, but thankfully things would get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sepultura's worst attempt.","review":"This has to be one of the worst albums I have ever heard. I got this album for my birthday as I was and still am a keen listener of metal and heavy metal music. I have albums of Metallica,Queens of the Stone Age, Faith No More, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Slayer, Korn, Slipknot and Disturbed that I like, but Sepultura's Against is a joke. The first track seems promissing with some cool guitar riffs and a solid heavy rythm. Afterwards, it just goes downhill. Every song seemed to mimic the next, with its repetative guitar solos and awful vocals from Derrick 'The D!*$' Green. Sepultura were a much better band with Max Cavalera and now the lead singer sounds like he has no teeth. All of my friends (who are metal heads) agree with me 100% that this is Sepultura's WORST album. Totally dreadful. After 10 minutes of flicking through each song, I had to stop it, take it out and throw it out the window. My advice: AVOID."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After listening to this CD I feel that Sepultura should get on their knees and beg Max's forgiveness. Perhaps for a regular band this CD is OK, but compared to previous Sepultura albums this one is a disappointment. The music is OK, but reading the lyrics really ruined it for me. This new singer just doesn't have anything to say. If you're considering this CD, I would strongly recommend Soulfly or Sepultura: Roots instead. Also, it is worth mentioning that Max did not quit Sepultura, he was kicked out."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO CHANCE, PAL !","review":"No chance, pal, that you'll like this Cd if you're a Sepultura fan. The new singer, Derrick, is worst than Max ( if this is possible!) and the band suffered a reverse they may never completely recover from. I hope they do, because metal in BRAZIL is almost forgotten forever (in terms of shows and bands making their living on it - there is market only to buy import records). In this CD, they tried something new, maybe for the sakeof fans not say that the new singer is trying to copy Max. Long Live Sepultura!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is just sad","review":"I lost all hope in Sepultura when this album came out. They lost Max thanks to Andreas Kisser and replaced him with Derrick Green who is just a laughable replacement. There's nothing good about this album. And every album since then SUCKS. Its now 2011 and they still suck. Why would you ever replace Max with someone who sounds like this. Just SAD...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Against","review":"Against being Sepultura's 7th studio album and their 1998 release and is their first release with their lead singer Derrick Green. The sound is a mix between alternative metal, groove metal and hardcore punk. There are several problems with this release. The new singer is not nearly as good as their prior singer Max Cavalera. The original sound that was Sepultura is pretty much gone and this is more an alternative punk rock release then the trash metal sound that dominated Sepultura's earlier releases. I have nothing against a band experimenting with their sound. However poor vocal skills on behalf Derrick Green kills this album. Allmusic gave the album 3/5 which is tad to high in my opinion. Since I can not give it 2.5 it gets 2/5. 2/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one bites the dust.....","review":"It was never 'trendy' to be metal, and everyone seems to be jumping ship, but how did the 'Beneath The Remains' lads end up doing this? Roots was a fine and successful experiment, but this continuation of that sound, without Max, is just plain boring. Get the aforementioned plus Arise and Choas.I'd rather listen to Motley...no scrub that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disapointment!!!!!!!","review":"What a total letdown. Max's songwriting skills are sorely missed. Also, their tribal thing is getting a little boring and doesn't really add to the heaviness, like it did on Roots. As far as Derrick Green goes, he sounds just like all these other generic bands like Korn (puke). Nothing special there at all. The Newsted colaboration tune \\"Hatred Aside\\" is tolerable, but still predictable and boring. If you want well written metal that will satisfy the crave, pick up the latest Hatebreed, anything by Cryptopsy and Jungle Rot and/or Sinister's new one. That's the sh*t. Its to bad to see that Sepultura's gonna clog the same $2.99 used cd bin that Metallica have been in for almost ten years."},{"rating":"1","title":"RMMßR &#65533;H WHÑ ÜL&#65533;ÜR Ñ'&#65533; ßLW ...","review":"What a shame. Max Cavalera WAS Sepultura. I don't think that the rest of the tribe should totally give up music, but keeping the name Sepultura is garbage. When you think of Sepultura, you think Max. You can't replace him. Their new singer isn't all that bad, but he had the impossible assignment of making us forget what we loved and start over. A total crock. The least they could have done was change the name..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another metal giant is gone","review":"What a massive disapointment. Most of this album is bad hardcore, and bears little resemblance to the band that made some fantastic death/thrash a few years ago. The new singer alternates between annoying screeches, a korn-esque whisper, and a rather generic growl. The music, as previously mentioned, is very simplistic and repetitive, with lyrics that I've heard a million times before. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Max clones, seek life elsewhere !","review":"The new album by Sepultura, \\"Against\\",is good and I haven't regretted buying it one bit. Sure, like many fans, I miss Max, but you're only fooling yourself if you thought they were going to get a Max clone. Sepultura are professionals and they love making music, if you have ever had the chance to meet them, you would know this by now. \\"Against\\", \\"Common Bonds\\", and \\"Old Earth\\" are probably my three favorite songs. The band is still just as heavy as ever and are not sulking in the past, like some of the other reviewers are. If you want the continued style of \\"Roots\\", buy Soulfly. Igor, Andreas, and Paulo want to continue bringing us, the fans, the best they have to offer. \\"Against\\" is their gift to us...ENJOY SEPULTRIBE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, where is MAX PORRA!","review":"This is a CD that should never be made with the name sepultura! The band is over! You can't continue a band without the original members, specially with a different singer... The only thing I can hope for is a reunion in the future. If you never heard Sepultura, please buy \\"beneath the remains\\" and \\"roots\\", they are very different from each other and show the way the band's sound progressed through the bands career."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD Sepultura! BAD! Now go sit in the corner and think about what you've done!","review":"Are they even trying anymore? Come on, even the cover art is bad Photoshop.I don't mind Derrick Green's vocals as much as everyone else seems to, they are just as angry and aggressive as Max's. It's the music that just isn't resonating with me the way it used to. The opening track kicks, but after that, it's flat out boring.The only remotely interesting parts of this album, aside from the first track, are when they break out the tribal drums and rhythms. I wouldn't call this a total loss, but it's pretty close. Definitely not worth full price. Buy the song Against, and do like I do and pretend the rest doesn't exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"First album without Max","review":"Admittedly, at first listen this album sounds a bit wobbly and it takes some time to get used to Derrick Green, their new singer. This album had to be released at this time though to show the world that Sepultura was still around in order to squash the rumors that they had broken up. In this album a lot of songs sound rushed and Derrick Green hadn't quite come into his own. Nation is a massive improvement over this one I would suggest you buy that one for sure. But the good thing to know is that Sepultura has not sold out. If you want to listen to sell-out music go listen to Soulfly. If you only want one Derrick Green Sepultura album buy Nation but if you want two buy this one because it is truthfully not that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Past Sep, but hey, ITS SEP","review":"Ive always been a huge fan of this band, mainly due to max cavalera. his departure to soulfly meant death for this band in my mind, but i didnt count on the band finding a replacement that was almost equal. derrick is nothing short of amazing, expierimenting with hardcore rants, death and thrash growls, and other such expierimentation. the band is as strong as ever instrumentally, Igor is still a powerhouse on the drum kit. Andreas is becoming an even better guitarist, and will continue to be so in my mind. The musicians expierimenting with not only different sounds but different cultures makes for an interesting listen. All in all, worth the money, but the Sep of Ol' is still the greatest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh boy..this is what happens without Max.","review":"I rushed out and got this CD the minute the store got it in. About 2 hours later I wished I could take it back. Max was the true creative force in Sepultura , any of you fans wanting to hear real good music should get Soufly's album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please apply Max factor","review":"After the sad demise of 'Roots'-era Sepultura we are left with Soulfy and a new Seps lineup. Whilst Max's offering was a little too formulaic for some, relying on tried and tested song structures, the new-look Seps disappoint for another reason. The unique brand of guttural heaviness boasted by 'Roots' has gone. This is, it pains me to say it, run-of-the-mill metalcore. Mind you, 'Hatred Aside' and the title track aren't bad... But 2 medicore albums later there's going to be a few people a bit narked at the reality of never being able to hear anything new from classic Sepultura again."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD HAS MADE ME SEE THE ERROR OF MY WAYS","review":"Before, I was a HUGE KoRn fan, but when I listened to Against, I came out of my denial and heard what music is really all about, and Sepultura gots it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you are looking for sepultura this is not them","review":"I HAVE BEEN A SEPULTURA FAN NOW FOR 3 YEARS AND ONLY OWN 4 OF THEIR ALBUMS I HAVE TO SAY AS A FAN OF SEPULTURA I WAS DISAPOINTED WHEN MAX LEFT AS I WAS DISAPOINTED WHEN I HEARD SEPULTURA'S NEW ALBUM AGAINST.

The songs \\"Not if you were the last junkie on earth\\" and \\"every day should be a holiday\\" were great music videos and just flat out great rock songs with a more upbeat tempo, while \\"Green\\" and \\"Orange\\" are great slower songs with very cool melodies. Most of the rest of the songs are pretty sweet as well, all very catchy and with a lot of \\"hooks\\" on each song. \\"Be-In\\", \\"Boys Better\\", \\"Good Morning\\", and \\"Minnesoter\\" are all very steady rock songs in their own respective right, as each one has its own great uniqueness. The is a very good album and I'd recommend it to anyone. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because the last 2 songs sounded like they were just experimenting with different sounds but had no lyrics at all, which got kinda boring to listen to, but the first 12 songs except for \\"whipping tree\\" make getting this album definetly worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style over substance","review":"...and the Dandies would be the first to tell you.

They keep the raw sexuality that oozed in the music of the Stones and Who and takes it to another level. They can incorprate pop-vocal stylings with songs about drug addictions and free-love. The layered effects, the instrument style and Courtney Taylor's vocals are excellent. Check out their self-titled album, too. It has some of the most somber, but rocking songs, yet.

We have these in our infant and toddler rooms and they are a huge favorite with the children. They are super fun and like a previous post said, easy to take along and no parts to loose or choke on. They are easy enough to push on for smaller babies to make the spinner work. The only reason I gave this four instead of 5 stars is because it is so LOUD!

It was one of the most frustrating toys he's had. The handle requires too much strenght to press down, so he was not able to operate it alone. He could press it down only when standing up (using his body weight), but the size of the spinner made it very inconvinient to play this way: he had to lean and crouch. The noise that the balls make is rather loud (in my consideration) and can irritate the adults after a while, too. Because my son was already walking, this static toy got very little attention.

She's figured out that you have to depress the plunger to get the little balls to roll, but the plunger is too stiff for her so they barely move. It's almost as good to just shake it and make the balls roll that way. But we have better rattling toys, so she usually lets this one roll away and plays with something else. Like another reviewer, I love that it's a self-contained toy. Unfortunately, it's also loud and bulky, so even though I had hoped it would be a good toy to take on outings, it's just not practical.

This edition, like just about everything from Kessinger, is essentially a xerox copy bound in thin cardstock. Agrippa's book is the great masterpiece of its kind from the early 16th century; modern practitioners as well as intellectual historians may find it somewhat impenetrable. As an historical resource and compendium of magical material, the work is unparalleled. I suspect that many modern practitioners will find it annoying that Agrippa gives essentially no practical examples.

They stay locked in your ear too, even when jogging or mowing the lawn. Good external noise reduction as well, with several fitments to suit different ear types. The volume is just loud enough, though it's nice to have an in-line volume control too.On the negative side, the sound response is a bit flat in the upper end. Bass is good, midrange is neutral and clear, though not as clear as more expensive in-ear units (like the Shure E3). The rather long cord gets tangled quite easily, and after multiple uses it gets twisted up.Bottom line: if you're looking for good quality sound that will stay fixed in your ear while walking about, you can't go wrong with these headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Company - Great Product","review":"PROS: 1) Made by great company with exceptional reputation2) Sounds great!!!3) I love the volume control.

This retelling of the Biblical story of Joshua and the battle of Jericho contains delightful computer animation (although the sheep perhaps need a bit more work), catchy songs, and humor that adults can appreciate. I particularly enjoyed the obnoxious French peas on the Jericho wall - an apparent reference to the annoying Frenchman in _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_.

(Even in homes that don't consider themselves \\"religious\\", something that can help you provide a good moral compass for your children shouldn't be discounted out of hand.) I love the way that Josh stands up to the \\"peas\\" on the walls of Jericho, and takes the taunting and teasing from them, and from the members of his group.

In real life there was a violent and bloody raid! Everybody behind the wall was slaughtered! This came about because of following God's intructions?! Were the people (including children) living there not part of the creation that God supposedly loves?

You do have to get your fingers out of the way -- i.e., let go -- but you can curl your hand around the brush-end of the dryer to hold the ends flat as they dry. My hair looked as well or better as when I dry it in sections with the $235.00 hairdryer and a large brush. While the Conair blow dry was not quite as smooth as those that I've had at a high-end NYC salon, it definitely was as smooth as a \\"no appointment, FIFO\\" moderately priced salon blow dry.

If you tried other dryers in that class they are at least double the weight. The finish and effectiveness as my wife says, is really great and as expected from the Ads. After the discount from Amazon, it's really a very good deal and sure we will go for Conair again.

It's the most important feature and it doesn't work properly. It left my hair frizzy and overdry. My Wet 2 Straight flat iron by Remington does a much better job and leaves my hair soft and silky.

I have pretty curly hair when it is wet, and it literally takes me 5-7 minutes to get my hair dried and straightened. Of course, I have to use my Chi to get it super straight, but if you are looking for a little bit of straightening with some volume, just the dryer is the way to go.

I really like this dryer and i'm glad i got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"While I enjoy the benefits of having a diffuser-type of blow dryer, I was disappointed in the ease of operation of the straightening/anti-frizz attachment. It's pretty cumbersome and I'm not sure it is any better than just using a round, alumnimum-based brush. In fact, if you are already using a round brush to take the frizz out of your hair I would recommend that you stick to that method. This type of attachment was just too difficult and ineffective for me to use.I still enjoy the quality of Conair's products but I am sorry I spent the extra bucks for this one. I could have purchased a much-cheaper Conair dryer with a simple diffuser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really easy to use","review":"Love this product.

I have shoulder length hair, soft texture, spiral curls.

Before this, no matter how I tried, I would still have to flat iron my hair before I left the house. With this product, I get a smooth and soft look, with more volume than the flat iron would leave me. So, although it doesn't replace the sleekness of a flat iron, I no longer 'have' to use it.I never watched the DVD and had no problems figuring it out: Just a little trouble getting the hang of it, but still ended with fabulous results. Also, it dries your hair quick-quick-quick. My old dryer couldn't come close.I would recommend using a thermal protector when using this, as your hair is awfully close to the dryer and it gets much hotter than my old one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good for Everyone","review":"I have medium length somewhat curly hair, layered on the top and sides, and I bought this item after seeing it on TV and looking at it on this site. Unfortunately, I'm less than impressed. I think it might work better if you have long hair, or hair that's pretty much all the same length, but it doesn't really work for me the way it's intended. The hair dryer itself is good, I like it, but when I put the attachment on it, it doesn't cut it. I watched the DVD several times, but I'm still not able to get it to do what it shows in the DVD. If it wasn't such a pain to box it up and send it back, not to mention costly with the return shipping, I'd do just that. Instead I'll keep it for the hair dryer or find a friend with longer hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"It used to take me over an hour to straighten my very thick, curly, long hair. I could never do that round brush thing they do at the salon. I LOVE this hair dryer. It dries and straightens my hair in about 20 minutes working in sections. It took a few tries to get it right but it does a very good job of getting the curl out. I especially love that you can turn the attachment.I actually give it 4.5 stars instead of 5 only because I do still have to touch it up with a 1.5\\" curling iron for some body and work out the bit of friz it leaves (also working in sections curling under). But I never really expected it would turn out like that using only the dryer. I get so many compliments on my hair with this technique. Best $60 I ever spent on my hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money!!!","review":"I have never written an online review before, but I was so disgusted by this product I would love to save someone else the headache.What it is: just another hair dryer with a stupid attachment that doesn't even go thru your hair, let alone straighten it.What it isn't: an easy way to achieve salon straight blown out hair style.Bottom line: I guess if people who do not have naturally straight hair (like me -- thick and wavy/frizzy) want straight hair, we will have to get it the old fashioned way...hair salon blow-out, or home blow out with a good hot iron to finish it.Don't waste your money or get your hopes up with this piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"i love this hair dryer, i got it for christmas, alothough, i thought it was rather expensive. it works great, i straighnet my hair everyday with it, and it doesn't damage my hair and makes in more manageable. i highly suggest it to anyone who wants a good straighner, i talked my friend into buying one, YAY ME!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too awkward to use","review":"The head is built at a difficult angle to use, no matter what position I tried it in, and it's a real pain to have to press in buttons and turn the head every time you come into the hair from a different angle. It's also heavy to use at those awkward angles. The drying/straightening process may work very well, but I found it so difficut to manipulate while \\"test driving\\" it with the manual that I never actually tried in on my hair. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good.","review":"This did not do like they show you on the info on T.V.It was just a hair dryer with attachments to me. Don't waste your money on it.

Those of us with natural hair know that when we are drying higher heat helps make the hair more manageable, even though your hair looses moisture with high heat Black people have to moisturize our hair so vigorously either way that it's worth it since the moisture get replaced daily through cremes and treatments.

This was my least favorite album (I am not even addressing post \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\" since, by then, the whole dynamic for the artist had changed).Now, when looking at this from a historical vantage point, it is very easy to see why this the weakest album. The group strayed away from what made them great...playing stripped down, hard rock and they varied their music too much. This was a talented band but they were no Beatles and did not qualify to venture out too far from what made them successful.The best songs \\"Muscle of Love\\" and \\"Big Apple Dreamin\\" work because it sounds like the \\"Alice Cooper\\" band.

I use a stapler a lot, and have had two problems with many of the less sturdy brands: they jam, and it's difficult to remove the bent staples inside the stapler arm; and they do a poor job punching through multiple sheets of paper.Most staplers, in fact, are NOT designed to punch through more than a few sheets of paper. They're designed for light use.I like the oversized handle on this stapler, and I especially like its ability to punch through dozens of sheets of paper. (I have a much larger, heavier duty stapler than this one, but it costs a lot more, and it leaves a jagged edge sticking out.)Bottom line: This product works as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after using for 1 week.","review":"Gave 1 star for working as it should. When i was able to use it, it was great! Easily my favorite stapler in the world because of how easy it staples. I work in accounting so i'm having to staple papers all day and night. My only gripe about this product (and reason i gave it a low score) was after only a week of using this stapler and feeling like Milton from Office Space, the spring that holds the staples in place somehow came off and i couldn't figure out how to re-connect it. I could not find any information on their website, instruction manual, nor was i able to get any assistance from their customer service about this issue or a replacement.

It worked well about two-thirds of the time, until today, when it completely stopped working. This was a pricey item, a splurge, which I bought thinking it would last forever. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stapler, but not as good as cut off staplers for large jobs","review":"This stapler works very well for 20lb paper - about 65 sheets or so. Be aware that when stapling fewer than about 20 sheets the staple will pop back through the front side. I have aStanley Bostitch Auto180 Xtreme Duty Automatic Stapler, 2 to 180 Sheet Capacity (B380HD)that cuts off the ends of the staples so you never have sharp points sticking back through the front.That said, this stapler works great. I am amazed by how easily it accomplishes the task - it acts like a staple gun - when you push it you get nothing. . . nothing. . . BAM!!! Like caulking a gun.The loading mechanism is pretty good too. Although I have not experienced a jam, it looks like it would be very easy to clear - everything is easily accessible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for high capacity amounts of paper and on cardstock.","review":"You will need another regular stapler because you are not going to want to remove the staples from this one and reload depending on how many sheets of paper you are stapling. You really do not want to use this for stapling small number of pages. If you try to do so with the long (high capacity) staples loaded then the staples warp into a weird point or break apart. However, for about 10 pages and up this stapler is excellent, if loud. The force required is minimal, and the staples go cleanly through the paper. We have been using it to routinely staple 50 plus sheets of scrap paper together into scrap paper \\"notebooks\\". This has solved the problem of knowing if a piece of paper is scrap before writing on the back, and has reduced the amount of waste in our household. It also easily stapled through 30 sheets of card stock for a school project.Refills of 3000 high capacity staples are currently available on Amazon for under five dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Just so you know, this is NOT The Job TV series with Denis Leary.

The ending came out of left field, with nothing in the preceding 362 pages of plot and character development suggesting it could end that way. Just a jarring, grating, train wreck of an ending that spoiled what was otherwise an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have stopped at page 465","review":"The majority of the reviews are pretty accurate. You do feel like your reading one LONG ending. But I chalk that up to style. It was just different. I don't want to criticize Grisham as this is the first book I have read of his (I'm not a big fiction reader), but something is missing. However, overall it is an okay read....unitl the end that is. The last three pages of the book absolutely ruined it for me. A man (Patrick) who has thought this far ahead and executed as he did throughout would NEVER have been in a position to let something like that happen. It left just too sour a taste in my mouth. All that reading......and 3 pages ruined it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his better books.","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed the book and the background information. Especially how he weaves the information into an exciting story that covers many places. Had to keep reading it. However, I was disappointed in the ending. Felt it was rather weak compared to the rest of the book. Once everything has fallen into place I expected more - I was 'hanging' on each result until ..... the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The suspense kept you there.","review":"This one initially had me cheering. Since I had it on audiocassette, my husband listened with me. He was able to see what wascoming -- until the end! ^MNeedless to say, we were both disappointed. Usually Grisham's book shows the good guy, or victim, coming out with the better end. This one, however, proved that observation was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another dissapointing 'blockbuster'","review":"THE PARTNER, in the grand tradition of Danielle Steel, is, yet,another 'cranked out by popular demand' book. I had hoped for a farbetter story than this. The characters seem weak and familiar ( perhaps they are related to RUNAWAY...? ) Although Grisham weaves a semi-clever web and continues in his tradition of killing us with intricate details, he managed to take a marginally interesting idea and turn it into 'just another predictable book'. THE PARTNER was not riveting and I found it so easy to put down to clean the bathroom and wash the windows. I do enjoy the author's descriptive narratives and feel compelled to share that, for the most part, the places his characters visit on the Mississippi Gulf Coast do, indeed, exist. Let's hope the next one won't hit the stands for quite a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRISHAM DID IT AGAIN","review":"THIS ONE WILL HIT THE BEST SELLER LIST FOR SURE. FULL OFSUSPENCE.

VERY TEMPTING."},{"rating":"1","title":"A below par effort by Grisham","review":"Just when I thought Grisham was doing something a bit differentwith The Runaway Jury (which I thoroughly enjoyed), I read The Partnerand was very disappointed. The story lacked the hold that Grisham usually has over his readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I've read all of Grisham's books..except the street lawyer..but this was one of the best.. the ending was superb!Not at all what I was expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I thought this book was very good. Everyone seems to hate the ending but I liked the ending and thought it was VERY creative. The reason I gave it an 8 is because it started out slow. But around 350, I stayed up till 12:30 in the morning and finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"This may be the weakest of Grisham's books in terms of plot,character development and realism. You never understand theprotagonist. Perhaps that is because this character, like all the others are so flat.For a man who is so meticulous in his planning, plotting and triple checking everything, Grisham reveals that he tells the girl all within two days of meeting her. Why? This relationship is grossly underdeveloped. Grisham mentions several times the \\"partner's\\" fondest desire is to spend the rest of his life \\"reproducing like rabbits\\" with the girl. What was the point of those repeated references?Anyway, I haven't read any of the other reviews yet. I didn't want it to influence my own. I've read everything Grisham's written and this is, in my opinion, by far the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Letdown From the King of Fiction","review":"When I put down \\"The Partner\\" after completing it, Ibegan to wonder if Grisham had lost his magic after all these years. Ifthis book would have ended without the last two pages, it would have been much better. \\"The Partner\\" also did not hold my attention as well as \\"The Firm\\" did. In my opinion, Grisham should take a few years off, collect his thoughts, and then go back to writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil Triumphs Over Evil: Who Cares?","review":"An entertaining enough potboiler, but the characters are all sodespicable I found myself hoping they all lost. This book makes oneappreciate how much better the legal suspense genre is currently being written by others, especially Scott Turow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dismal book saved only by the last page","review":"I am very disappointed by Grisham's effort here. His writing has become completely droll and predictable. Am I the only person getting tired of the same downtrodden Mississippi lawyers fighting the same corrupt agencies while being completely perfect and omnipotent at the same time. His writing has become a complete bore. The only saving grace in this overly melodramatic sob story was the intriguing ending. My suggestion is that you read the dust jacket and the last ten pages, then go find a classic to convince yourself that good literature is still out there somewhere. Maybe even in Grisham's world"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I read the other reviews and still don't understand what anyone liked about this book! A Grisham fan, I was very disappointed by this dismal effort. There was no real impetus to root for any character. The book is like a slow ride downhill. You can see the ending, and there is no thrill. I kept waiting for 'the good part'. A nice little twist at the end.....but it's too little, too late"},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but unsupported ending","review":"As usual, Grisham's book was suspenseful and interesting. Thelegalities were covered niceley and all the subplots ended neatly.However, I felt that the ending was completely unjustified. The twist seemed completely implausible based on the Grisham's narrative throughout the novel. While a plot twist can be surprising, it must be supported. This one was completely unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...the worst John Grisham yet!","review":"I have read every John Grisham novel to date, but no more. Idid not finish this novel and wish also that my money could berefunded. The usual John Grisham \\"legal expertise\\" was there, but this novel was sorely lacking in many ways. It was obviously just a vehicle for another movie script and the writing shows that he must have had a very tight deadline! Maybe it's time for John to switch to writing screenplays instead???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book except the last 2 chapters","review":"This book had the potential to be one of Grisham's best. After reading the conclusion, however, I had such a bad taste in my mouth that I won't read Grisham again. I won't spoil this for anyone who still wants to read it by explaining why, but let me just say it was a brilliant story with a stupid ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof that \\"the majority\\" is easy to please.","review":"This book had THE WORST ending that I have ever read. THE WORST. It was an ending so stupid and disappointing, I was actually left feeling angry with Grisham. If you paid attention to the details earlier in the book, the way that he connected you with the feelings of certain characters, it is clear that the author thinks the reader is a two year old who will believe anything. There are many positive reviews here, and as per Amazon policy, I won't debate them. I just wish that somebody had warned me not to read this garbage before I wasted my time. AWFUL BOOK! Shame on Grisham for being paid for such slop. I used to be a Grisham fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A machine wrote this book","review":"I've enjoyed some of the screen adaptations of Mr. Grisham's works, but this is the first time I have read one of his original works. And now I realize... The man can NOT write! Totally [absurd] plot-driven, without any sense of character, description, metaphor or any kind of literary liveliness. \\"He said, she said, he said\\" \\"He wore a blue/black/doublebreasted... expensive/cheap suit\\". That's about as close to the richness of life as it gets... + 90 Million dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling waste of time.","review":"This was the first JG novel I have ever read and it will be the last. I echo everything Chris from ABQ said below. The book did start reasonably okay, but the ending is ridiculous. And yes it could have easily been 250 pages shorter. In fact probably the only enjoyable thing was Lanigan getting electrodes attached to his nuts and systematically tortured.

Grisham should be every intellectuals choice for fine writing. There is so much plot and ideas in this book that I got confused sometimes, and sometimes very thoughtful and wondering about life. I think I will have to read it again to understand all the hidden meanings and messages. Although I am not in law school, I believe all the law students should have to read this book before they become lawyers. I really respect lawyers because this book shows how scary is their life, and all the bad guys and stuff. Anyways, this book is right up there with Dostovsky and Tolstoo. Read it today! I mean it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge let down!","review":"Whoa, what happened to the normal fast-paced Grisham fluff? This was one of the most depressing novels I've read in years.

Oh, I forgot the stupid ironic ending thrown in for good measure. Skip this one and get one of Grisham's better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend the time on something better","review":"This is definitely an easy read, but the time is better spent elsewhere.

Lots of fun to read. You'll love the protagonist, a thief. The plot revolves around his scheme to get away with stealing millions of dollars, while framing some very unethical lawyers, politicians, and businessman. I normally don't read the last 20 pages in a book. I can't stand that denouement where everyone rides off into the sunset and lives happily ever after. However, I couldn't sleep, so what the hell. Man, was I glad I did. Who would have thought he'd put a major plot twist on the second to last page. I should have seen it coming.Anyways...LOTS OF FUN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was capitvated by wanting to know Patrick's motivations.","review":"I'm surprised at how many of the other reviewers didn't like the ending. Happy endings are not real life. It was a bit depressing, but more realistic. I was only surpsied it took Eva so long to do what she did. I loved that the more you read, the more you discovered. It wasn't all handed to you, but you had to peel away the layers to discover the whole story. It made for a more fascinating read. John Grisham is the best, and I can't wait to read more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham is now writing only for the money!","review":"Like Tom Clancy and Harold Robbins before him, there comes a point in some authors life when there is nothing left--Except the calls from the publisher/editor to churn out another book. Grisham obliged with a very mediocre \\"The Partner\\" in 1996.In 1997, Grisham will do it again. That is to say, write a novel in 6 months and take 6 months off. I really can't say as I blame him. It's the system at fault.\\"The Partner\\" is an okay, easy weekend read and nothing else. The book is okay, but there is not much there.Grisham is destined to be known as just another unimportant 20th century author, in my opinion.

I read a book a week from a variety of authors and have read many of Grisham's books. I've enjoyed all the rest of his books and found them highly intelligent and thought out. In The Partner he makes every indication that the main character's friend Eva is madly in love with him and gives no indication or reason why she leaves him except that he wants that one last shock to the readers/audience. If you are going to end a story like this there should be some clue(s) even if they are so subtle that you have to reread some of the story to find them. Sorry if this ruins the book for anyone, but spend your money on one of his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breathtaking, twisting, and exciteing thriller.","review":"The Partner is one huge book. What I mean by huge is like when you think nothing else can possibly happen, John Grisham just keeps making the thriller, even more thrilling. The action never stops. When a man steals 90 million dollars and fakes his own death and hides for a long time. The thriller never really starts until he is found. The way Grisham writes, I can automatically tell it's going to be a movie. How when the man is tortured and put into a hospital, and becomes friends with the judge of his trial. But, where the first one ends up dead, something looks fishy. But nothing is as shocking, thrilling, breathtaking, exciteing as the big finally.

The Partner is no exception. I read the first 160 pages in a few hours one evening and found it very captivating. Its very interesting as the storyline unfolds where the protaganist's character evolves into something somewhat unexpected. Grisham provides enough details and subplots to keep the story interesting yet not overly drawn out to the point where the reader is left wondering,\\"gee what happened?\\" Anyway, its a fairly quick read so go buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown. . . !","review":"I started this book with fervor and hunger and ended with a \\"toss out the window\\" of the book and a vow to find a new author to follow.

Adroit maneuvering was done with the help of his lawyer Sandy and lawyer-girlfriend Eva.As the story progresses one gets the feeling that Grisham has stacked the cards too much on the heroes' side for Lanigan has every move by his pursuers anticipated and promptly parried.The story is good but I would place it at a lower rung to his other novels (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Brethren)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent. Story line is unrealisticaly perfect. BAD ending","review":"I've read about 5 John Grisham books in last 2 weeks and I am disappointed with many of them. The plots/stories are quite similar among them. As a result, this book was pretty predictable. Overall it was a relatively good read until the last few pages where Grisham left you high and dry with a bad ending which made you feel like you just wasted 10 hours of your time. Many others will agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb!!!

I'll say no more, go out and read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you start reading The Partner you're hooked.","review":"Definitely one of Grisham's best. I didn't think I'd read a book better than The Firm, but what a fantastic read. The story was full of suspense and it was impossible to predict the ending. I was tempted so many times to read the last couple of pages because the suspense was killing me, but I resisted. Glad I did because the twist at the end was fantastic. Well done John!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Ending","review":"If not for the ending, I would've given 5 stars because this Grisham novel was every bit as great as his previous books. But the end left me feeling empty and chopped off, as though he ran out of ideas. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down, but wished I had before I read the ending. Actually, I wish I had thrown it across the room like the reader from Farmington, MN. It's still not a bad idea. I hope Grisham will consider a sequel--it's about the only thing that will fill the void."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Partner","review":"Traditional Grisham story line. A good young lawyer trapped in a corrupt firm making a break for a new life. Overcoming many barriers, he triumphs with quick witted legal gymnastics. Some how he makes it new & different each time. The ending however, is very non-grisham. Disappointing at first because it breaks with the expected, it's ironic twist becomes more appreciated as Grisham moves toward reality. The result of age, wisdom & maturity?If you like Grishham, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulously Awesome!","review":"This book is so intriguing from the first chapter. The hindsight John gives his character Patrick is so amazing that with each step Patrick takes, he is clearly the Puppet Master of the whole book. Mystery and intrigue are bursting at the seams! The detail the author goes into, and backsplashes to the past to explain a little something in a previous chapter is genius. A million questions come to mind with each revelation, and John Grisham answers those superbly, without question. This is definitely a mind-thriller at it's absolute best. If there were a 10 star rate system, this book would get 11! The Partner is my favorite of all the John Grisham books. A+++++ across the board!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Author - John Grisham","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I read too late at night! I read in the morning! However, I did want a different ending. But, the ending Mr. Grisham decided on, really knocked my socks off. John Grisham gets better with each book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Folly of Stealing","review":"The protagonist (a lawyer) steals millions of dollars from his law firm and when he is caught and brought to trial he is able to negotiate a brilliant settlement and escape prison. But in a surprising twist all his briilliance leaves him destitute at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Partner: A Novel","review":"I have always enjoyed John Grisham's books and this was a good one. Court room drama has always fascinated me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Firm revisited","review":"I have read many of Grisham's books and found this the worst. It was the same general plot as the Firm but with a terrible ending. If his character was smart why didn't he place part of the money in a joint account. He wouldn't have to know where it was and if this girl was so in love with him, why the ending. I wouldn't pay the money to watch it as a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The First Thirty Pages","review":"The Partner by John Grisham is non-stop action, for the first thirty pages. The next three hundred pages or so that follow, is nothing more than a man sitting in a hospital bed telling his lawyer how he made it all happen. You see, Patrick Lanigan, the main character was a lawyer at a prominant lawfirm before he stole 90 million dollars from them, faked his own death and was on the run for four years until he was caught. That was the exciting part of this book, the first thirty pages. After you read the first thirty pages put the book down or go on the run for four years yourself because that is how long this book seemed to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham is laughing all the way to the bank","review":"The book is predictable, and the ending only serves to acknowledge the failure of Grisham to establish a sensible and believable plot. Once you realize the entire premise of this book hangs by a thread you are forced to contemplate the alternatives, and in doing so reveal the \\"twist\\" ending to yourself half-way through the book. Grisham wrote one or two decent books early on in his career and his continued success is a tribute to his ability to recycle formulaic plots into stories just original enough for most literate adults. Next time someone tells me to read the \\"new\\" Grishman book, I'll just say \\"No thanks.. I've already read the Firm.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Twisted Ending","review":"Although some people wrote a review that the story was predictable, I couldn't see how. The ending was something that I never thought was going to happen. While the book followed Grisham wordiness as usual, the plot was as good as ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Ending","review":"Great book from start to almost finish. It was such an entertaining read with lots of twists but the ending ruined it. Made it all a waste of time. Grisham's books are usually a lot more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Clever","review":"Great entertainment for the first three quarters; then Patrick's \\"failure proof\\" planning begins to get annoying-something should go wrong here and there. The international banking, spycraft, the legal maneuvers, etc. are wild and exciting-I don't know if it's \\"authentic\\", but Grisham makes it read wonderfully. The ending is strictly amateur night. It's like someone said, \\"we need a twist here\\" and the author tacked one on-it pretty much ruined the reading experience for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham's most entertaining in a while...","review":"AFTER JOHN GRISHAM'S FIRST 3 NOVELS, I THOUGHT HE COULD BECOME ONE OF THE GREATEST AUTHORS EVER. HE THEN WENT DOWN HILL AND COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED ME, EVEN THOUGH I CONTINUED TO READ EACH NEW RELEASE. THE PARTNER WAS A TURNAROUND. AS WITH ALL HIS NOVELS IT MOVES VERY FAST AND KEPT MY ATTENTION. I LIKED THE STORY LINE MUCH BETTER, ALTHOUGH IT DID BECOME PREDICTABLE. THIS BOOK WAS GOOD, BUT COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT. THERE IS NOT A TON OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT BUT THE STORY WAS GREAT. A GOOD FAST READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I am someone who typically has trouble finding time to read a book..especially finish one. This was my first Grisham book and I couldn't stop reading it. I kept fitting a few pages in on my breaks and little bits of spare time I had....a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading and fun","review":"Standard Grisham fun read while on vacation. Fun to read while sitting on the beach....but it is the Gisham formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did Not Like The Ending","review":"I thought The Partner was cleverly written full of suspense, twists, and turns. My only complaint is that I did not like the ending. Although it was a huge surprise and went with the flow, I would have appreciated something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy ending.","review":"Not what I expected from John. What a wasted evening that culminated in a 2am disappointment. If you're romantically inclined than please pass on this one. Although I don't want to know the ending I'll be sure to check the ratings on Amazon before I buy another Grisham book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Again John Grisham excels. A fun and intelligent plot which grips the reader throughout. To say the least, an intersting finale."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read it in two days!","review":"Not because it was hard to put down but it was so easy to read.All conversation and a few lines here and there telling a story. Thisbook sounds like Grisham had a deadline to meet, geared for the commercial list of best sellers. But I enjoyed the quick pace. I read the book more out of my curiosity as to how things would unravel. I loved the ending!! Had to be that way. Everything else just worked out too smoothly for Lanigan. I don't care about a sequel because I know how it will end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment!","review":"I was expecting another great Grisham book but I was sodisappointed. It dragged on and on with absoulutely no zip.I was relieved when I had finished it. I want to read more like A Time to Kill--Definitely a winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money!","review":"This book is simply an outline of what could have been a prettygood read. Hey John, how about spending a little time doing someresearch? Give us some details about life on the run, changing identities, and ripping off a high-powered law firm. I saw where another reviewer suggested that Grisham write more than one book a year - it shouldn't be hard if he continues to bind his outlines in hard cover. A better idea would be for Grisham to spend two or three years researching and writing a really good book (like he did at the beginning), and build some goodwill among his devoted readers who have been so disappointed by his last half dozen yawners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story with a disappointing ending","review":"This was a good book but not my favorite Grisham work. He justkeeps pumping out good books. I enjoyed it very much. Keep up thegood work and I can hardly wait until your next."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read it in one day, but the ending...WHY?","review":"I loved this book all the way through, until the very end. You had to admire the cunningness of the main character and his ability to \\"disappear.\\" After looking at a couple other on-line reviews, I was glad to see I wasn't, however, the only one left \\"annoyed and irritated\\" by the ending. There is NO basis for it! It comes so far out of left field, that even looking back with it in mind, it cannot be supported. There's too many characters to get to know any of them very well, and some just drop out of the picture altogether. The story itself is engrossing, and pulls the reader forward and a rapid pace, but the ending...Oh John, WHY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't bother sleeping when you start this one.","review":"AMAZING. Grisham has done it again. The plot was Thick and Engrossing. One of the best last page twists I have ever read. It will either tick you off or keep you waiting for his next bestseller. Grisham is one of the cleanest writers ever. This book will intrigue young and old. And your mind won't be warped in the process"},{"rating":"2","title":"A credible read!","review":"This a return to the days of the old Grisham, the story teller.Enjoyed the plot and the story progressed rapidly and fluidly.Did not like the main character or his wife . For that matter none of the characters were likable.With on exception, Patrick's girlfriend. The ending took away from the book, unless a sequel is afoot"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It Until the Last Chapter","review":"I love to read Grisham for the fast paced legal scheming and stategy, and this book really delivers. Grisham lets the reader experience the action by slowly weaving the plot and subplots together and doing so in such a way that keeps the story flowing at a fast pace. I would have ranked this book as my favorite over A Time To Kill and given it a score of 10 but for the ending which came out of nowhere and proved a bitter dissapointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the climax?","review":"Where was the climax of the book? Can anyone tell me? It just kind of putt-putted along and then it drops off the chart at the end. Was Grisham trying to put a \\"moral to the story\\" at the end or what? While my wife and I are sick of the \\"guy and girl run off to the Cayman islands\\" at the end of most Grisham novels, this ending stunk. In no way did Grisham ever prepare us for the end. If he was going to end it that way, he should have made the \\"Pluto Group\\" something that Patrick had never heard of. That's what I expected and it had by heart beating a bit harder. But when it didn't happen, he had not laid the groundwork necessary to end the book like he did, in my opinion. Overall, this was the worst Grisham book. \\"A Time to Kill\\" is my favorite by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great Grisham","review":"An enjoyable thriller from Grisham, but very familiar stuff. My personal favcrite of his is The Rainmaker, and this is nowhere near that good. But if you need a good page-turner with some enjoyable twists and turns, this is a good bet. In some ways, this is the flip side of the characters from Runaway Jury, and their clever plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham needs a new schtick","review":"Is it just me, or are all Grisham works the same book withdifferent characters? I admit I have not read all of them, howeverthe ones I have read are so similiar that I cannot keep track of which book it is. The female leads of \\"The Partner\\" and \\"The Runaway Jury\\" may as well be the same person. Both mysterious, beautiful and holding all the cards. The lead lawyer characters of \\"The Firm\\" and \\"The Partner\\" may as well be interchangeable. Grisham needs to lose his \\"submit new character name here\\" style of writing and prove he can move beyond \\"The Firm\\" genre with something intelligent, well written and totally original."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY Entertaining!!","review":"I was very entertained throughout this book, though the endingleft a little to be desired (which is true of several other Grishambooks). I was reminded of the Runaway Jury all through this book as his plot revolves around a person who has taken great pains to hide his true identity with the help of a female love interest. I read books to be entertained and this book fit the bill to a \\"T\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Grisham","review":"Grisham has gotten back to his old self. Interesting storyline. He rambles a little less than usual. Good surprise ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longest Grisham book ever!","review":"Or maybe it only seemed like the longest. In general, I likeGrisham's writing, even loved a few of his earlier works. But Icouldn't help feeling that in this one, he was just trying to meet a deadline. I found I didn't care what happened to any of the characters. They were undeveloped and you just couldn't work up any sympathy for even the main character. I got so bored in the middle that I did something I rarely do - read the last few pages early. Then I scanned through most of the rest. Just didn't care anymore. Sorry Mr. Grisham, maybe you ought to concentrate not on quantity of books but quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"I was excited when Grisham put on a new book as he is one of myfavorite authors, but this book did not live up to his usualexpectations. It had no interesting plot turns, and Grisham's usual knack for character development and an interesting plot failed him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Work Since 'The Client'","review":"I finally read The Partner. I didn't rush out and buy it.Grisham's cocky lawyer and political animal DA ... etc. formula hadlost its edge somewhere around The Chamber and The Rainmaker. I did enjoy The Partner. I think it was the way the plot worked backwards from the kidnapping. The main characters were edgier. The conclusion was more satisfying. Sure, much of it was predictable. All of the loose ends were too neatly tied. But, let's reinforce Big John! It has been four years since he's coaxed us to go a few extra pages each night. Maybe next Spring he'll surprise us with humble lawyers and courageous prosecutors. Maybe an innocent client will lose. Go get 'em, John!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill for The Partner","review":"I was really dissapointed by The Partner. No twist and turns,no surprises and a unlogical ending. To bad. I really liked, TheRainmaker, The Jury and The Firm. But this one was not at all up to his usual standard. By: Peter Carlsson, Sweden"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham is predictable - not such a bad things these days","review":"The Partner let us know what happened to the hero of TheFirm. I liked that. He seemed to run out of steam at the end; closedso suddenly I was shocked. However, the book was written cleanly, fairly and was what we wanted - a good yarn. John has evidently made the decision to support his family by turning out novels which sell well and have a following. There is nothing wrong with that. His style is entrancing, his characters likable, his plots thrilling and he doesn't split his infinitives. What more can you ask? The fact that John's style is recognizable is not a detraction - one feels comfortable with him. How pleasant to look forward to a new John Grisham each May! Keep 'em coming, John - they criticized Dickens too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I thought this was a good book, considering all the trash thatis out there. I thought that the characters weren't developed enoughbut that is what you come to expect from the author. It is very engaging and I read through it very quickly. His ending is different but, as if that guy could plan that well into the future. Maybe a few moves, but not like two months ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the average Grisham","review":"I was pleasantly surprised that I couldn't see exactly where Grisham was taking this story. That is, I had hoped it would end in a somewhat surprising fashion - as it did. A good rainy day read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has a terrible ending.","review":"This is a good example of a great author writing books to meet the deadline of his publisher. I don't think he had the time to put in a good effort for this book as his earlier ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Begining - Lousy Ending","review":"This book started out as the best John Grisham novel I have ever read with great character development and story line. Grisham had to ruin the whole book by having an ending that was so unlike the character of Patrick that he had developed.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner!","review":"This has been one of the most compelling reads I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Mr. Grishams' characters are intriguing. He has the ability to draw you into the story. The main character, Patrick, made me want to trust him,although I knew he was up to something. It is not very often that you come across a book so irresistable that you fear if you put it down you may miss something!I found myself reaching for it everytime I put it down! Thank you Mr. Grisham for a most enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, pretty good but where is the ending?","review":"John Grisham comes back and gives us an exciting story. Since I've only read four books of his, counting this one, I can only compare it to two of the others of his which I have read. It's almost as good as The Chamber (but not up there with it) but really third best, to both The Chamber and A Time to Kill. The fourth one is The Pelican Brief which wasn't very much to my liking, I must say. This book is pretty similar to The Chamber due to two things. The tension builds up with each page, and...there's an ending that doesn't quite end! (those who read it will know what I mean!) I don't like to be made to wonder what happens, I like to be told. It doesn't seem like almost five hundred pages was long enough for this book. There should have been more. If we did not consider the way this book ended, then it's a fun read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor substitute for \\"Body Heat\\"","review":"Instead of reading this book I should have rented \\"Body Heat\\", the great movie starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner since Grisham owes most of his plot to that movie. An obvious and poorly done rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"when will I learn??? not to expect anything from grisham","review":"I read the first two chapters here, and finding them rather^Minteresting, purchased the book and spent much of my Saturday^Mreading the rest. No surprises here!! The first two chapters ^M were the best, the rest, very predictable. The goods guys once^M again were flawless, the bad guys very bad and the perfect^M plans of the hero came off without mishap. But then, I suppose^M to throw a little surprise our way, Mr. G decides to end this^M escapade with the disappearance. What nonsense and what true^M lack of imagination. Why do we keep buying these disappointing^M books, and keep this dreary author on the top of the best^M seller list??? Maybe its only because the author is cute and^M supposedly a very very nice guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes stay away from this one","review":"The partner is one of those books where the author must of been on some sort of deadline and the last 20 pages were written showing to that deadline. Although I have read most of Grishams books and have enjoyed most of them, I read the ending 3 times and still didn't understand it.I knew that the twist is they didn't connect but I couldn't decipher what the writer was trying to say. Its probably a best seller because of the brand. The first 90% of the book is a setup to the conclusion of the planners plan being completed.The last one percent is confusing and poorly written. I couldn't figure out which country they were in or when or the timeline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"A totally unbelievable book pumped up with a lot of fluff. Grisham tries to make a hero out of a shallow lawyer with out a moral bone in his body. The only way he could of made this book good is if his hero had gotten raped in jail instead of coddled by judges and doctors who think its all right to rob and kill. Without the fluff the entire story line would last about thirty boring pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure junk","review":"I can't believe that any self-respecting publisher would allow this to be printed. It's obviously meant to be turned into a movie. The writing is insipid - Grishom has a habit of not using full sentences and writing like he talks, which is bad writing technique. The characters are flat, and all the loose ends are too conveniently taken care of. I can't believe I wasted a few precious hours on this, and I am warning others who read this review not to make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"The big 'J' is back","review":"It's nice getting up in the morning knowing that my most favourite author is at his peak, did I say peak, I meant rock bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Worst Book","review":"What can I say? This book had absolutely no drama, no surprises, and it was so bad that I didn't even finish the last 50 pages, because I didn't care how it ended. Time and time again, a plan was made by the bed ridden lawyer, and then it was followed through exactly that way. The characters were also drab, making a very boring tale. I can't believe I read so much of this book. Maybe because the words were big and their were just a few lines per page, making you read a page in about ten seconds. I don't know if I'll ever read another of Mr. Grisham's books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary vomit","review":"I can't believe that I read this book! I feel like I chopped a few hours off of my life. Its not that Grisham can't write, he has a definite knack for story-telling, but it seems he's more interested in trying to be clever. I was so unhappy that I took the time to read this book that I would honestly call it the worst book I've ever read. Yuck! The only reason that I kept reading it was because I always \\"hoped\\" it would start to pick up. Its like watching a bad movie on a rainy day just because you can't believe it won't get better. This not only doesn't get better, it falls into an abyss at the end. Instead of buying this book, tear up seven dollars and bang your head with a hammer - its the same effect and at least it will save you time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Grisham does it again","review":"When I read on the back of the book, I thought right away that I had to read it. And it turned out not to dissapoint at all. John Grisham has an ability to capture the reader into a net full of mysteries, and in this book into a world of one guy who succeeds in running away and hide far away from his life. All through the book you keep wondering how he completed that escape without being caught, without being discovered. And you feel with Patrick Lanigan all the way and smile about the cunning plot John Grisham brings to light. I recommend this book to people who don't mind reading about lawyers and justice...and to the one who likes some of his other books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I waited for this book to come off the bestseller list for months.My wait was worthlessly spent. As with all of his books Grisham packed a great punch with all of the legal information, which I always find facinating, but when it came to the ending I was left feeling empty and dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham you wasted my time!!","review":"I can't believ that I read this book! I feel so cheap, so dirty. Its not that Grisham can't write, he has a definite knack for story-telling, but it seems he's more interested in surprising readers than in just letting his gift work for him. I was so unhappy that I took the time to read this book that I would honestly put it in my all-time bottom five. I agree with another review here that it is like a TV movie in book form. Yuck! The only reason that I kept reading it was because it always \\"felt\\" like something interesting might be about to happen. Its like watching a bad movie on a rainy day just because you can't believe it won't get better. This not only doesn't get better, it falls into an abyss at the end. Instead of buying this book, tear up seven dollars and bang your head with a hammer - its the same effect and at least it will save you time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ending so bad, you'll wish you stopped reading early.","review":"So-so plot, never really gets going though. To say that it was poorly constructed would be an understatement. No real action, a good deal of the book was past tense - story within a story type of thing. Ending makes you feel like Grisham stole the hours that it took you to read the book right out of your life. I see mixed reviews here, but you gotta remember, people voted for Clinton, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAKES YOU SOOOO MAD...","review":"This was one of Grisham's finest....until the end. The end was completely unpredictable, but in a bad way. It made absolutely no sense. But it certainly did bring out quite an emotional stir out of me...as it did to others as far as i can tell from reading some of the reviews.Besides the ending, the book was an immensely quick read that I did not want to put down. The whole time you ask yourself how Patrick will get out of that jam, and Grisham almost always provides the perfect, but surprising answer.Read it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham Does It Again!","review":"Just when I thought Grisham couldn't get any better!

I couldn't put this one down - you won't believe the twists and turns this book takes, and the ending will leave you speechless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is one of the best Grisham books I have read so far. The first chapter will suck you in then you can't put the book down! I think the endind had some problems. Grisham, I think, sort of ruined the book with the last couple of pages.

Patrick Lanigan, you are just too smart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!","review":"I couldn't stand this book. I could have cared less for the characters or the story.

It should make a very fine movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let-down!","review":"I literally flung the book across the room after I read it. It was a great read up until the end.

However, I must say that I just hated the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Grisham, The Partner","review":"Very slow moving and uninteresting, does not hold my attention. I have read only 40% and can not wait for it to end. I do not recommend it.Purchased through Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drag and Unbelievable","review":"This was easily one of Grishams worst novels. The only good part of this book was the 1st 10 pages, and after that.. A MAJOR drag. Readers beware, NOT a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patrick's plan was incredible..but","review":"I have not read many of John Grisham's books. I could not wade through The Firm, but this one showed a thorough planner at work and his plan worked out very well,except for one small detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"I despised the end because of its stupidity","review":"I constantly found myself attempting to understand all of the names that kept popping into the plot. It was a very boring book, an unrealistic scenario, and offensive from the standpoint of encouraging kooks who might think to attempt this same type of story. In the last chapter of the book they referred to a sentence that read they had found him. Who exactly are they? It was a terrible stupid ending as almost everyone in the chat room agrees."},{"rating":"1","title":"explosive opening, 400 pages of boredom, terrible ending","review":"After the setup - a lawyer fakes his death, steals $90M, escapes to Brazil, only to be caught, tortured, and returned to the US for prosecution - I expected a dynamite book. Then I settled into approximately 400 pages of yawn-yawn lack of action as our hero sits in a hospital, scheming with his lawyer on his legal strategy while recovering from his torture-related wounds. The ending was pathetic. I was expecting some sort of stunning conclusion, perhaps an unexpected confession from left field. Instead, I got the impression Mr Grisham got tired and simply quit writing. It was a very unsatisfying conclusion, which leaves the reader hanging.Score this one as one star for plot. I do bump it up to two stars overall, only because Mr Grisham's style of prose flows well, even if he doesn't really have anything to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"I will let anyone who wants to read this book make up his or her mind as to its quality. However, after reading it, I felt like I had wasted a lot of time. The ending was very disappointing and very illogical to me. Perhaps that was the effect Mr. Grisham was aiming for, I don't know. It seemed to me, though, that the ending was poorly developed and completely inconsistent with prior internal character dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak, Look Elsewhere.","review":"What an utter disappointment! I have read a few of Grisham's books, usually quite good. Unfortunately this is incredibly poor. Weak, unlikable characters. Shallow uninteresting story. Hands down the worst ending of any book I have read. Look at other Grisham books or move onto Crichton or Dan Brown for a better thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful.","review":"great suspense, fantastic plot, definitely a surprise ending, albeit not the happy one I'd envisioned, but still good nonetheless. he is such a great writer! not many people can keep you guessing the whole way through the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Grisham Winner","review":"Great story about an unhappy lawyer looking for a way out of the rat race. Our main character, Patrick Lanigan, is quite the man to follow. I loved his antics as well as his great sense of humor with his friend, Karl, the Judge and his attorney, Sandy. There are some tense moments at the start but by far, The Partner is an entertaining read.I too was somewhat disappointed in the ending and would love to see a sequel by Mr. Grisham to give this outstanding story a solid conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm very glad I got this from the library.","review":"This book was almost nothing but backstory filled in via conversations and testemony by various characters. Almost nothing actually happens in this book. you can read the first quarter and the last quarter and really miss nothing. There was no suspence and the protagonist was so flat I kept wishing he had died during the torture in Brazil.

But soon, I got tired of the protagonist's unbelievable, superhuman feats of foresight, planning and executing everything flawlessly, down to his own faked death and then (almost fatal) real torture. Then, I thought the ending to the book was remarkably lazy - it was as if Grisham realized that the pattern of Patrick's superhuman-ness had pretty much guaranteed a certain ending for the last 100 or so pages, and so he was determined to thrown in an unexpected twist in the end. A twist that had no basis, based on his development of characters etc. I found that irritating and lazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Grisham's Best","review":"Grisham has done it again.

Grisham wrote the story extremely well. It was a perfect plot that was cleverly unfolded. Patrick worked for a law firm. When the firm got a case that ended up stealing 100,000,000 dollars, he stole the money, faked his death, and ran from the U.S., and ended up in Brazil. He lived happily there, just like everyone else for four years, until one day, when they cauhgt him.

The question lies, how and why was a successful lawyer like Patrick Lanigan able to appropriate 90 million dollars from his law firm.

Books such as A Time to Kill and The Chamber created characters the reader should be interested in. In his recent books, Mr. Grisham fails to develop what should be the most important element of any book, characters the reader can identify with, pro or con. Perhaps Mr. Grisham should take a year or two off rather than continue to churn out movie scripts. Harsh words, but spoken by someone who is truly a fan of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book equals none of his others.","review":"I've read far less enthralling books but this defenitely is Grisham's worst.I started reading it immediately after finishing The Runaway Jury\\" (which was great!) and I was disappointed.

Is it over yet?","review":"Not only was the book written in cookie-cutter Grisham style,it was much less interesting and intriguing than other Grisham books.Grisham did an adequate job of explaining things, but many of the explanations were thin at best. Additionally, I didn't feel as though he developed the character as much as say, The Firm.Finally, the ending was poorly contrived and unbelievable. Grisham spends the entire book painting things one way and then tries to convince the reader that it was all a farce in two pages. I'm not saying it should always be a happy ending -- just a believable one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was weak.","review":"The Partner was a weak book. I've read only one other Grisham book and that was The Rainmaker. And it was because that book was so good that I got The Partner. The book starts off well but then begins to slide. The unplausibilities start to build up and by the half-way point the book is an utterly awful mess. Grisham builds no tension in the book and the way that the problems are handled are just too easy of a way to slide through a book. The ending was hardly a surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typically Grisham","review":"As with other JG's books, I have found it an enjoyable read.

Personally, I found all his previous works rather blase and tabloidal in nature; e.g., the making of a canyon out of a ditch effect. But his one reads like something Clancy wishes to have written. I'm also especially pleased to note JG's sensitivity to us nonlegal readers, as he (thankfully) leaves out all the boring legal mumbo-jumbo of his past profession. Which indicates that he is finally maturing into a more commercial writer. John G! I'm surprised and pleasantly amazed at this novel! It actually is truly exciting to read! Indeed, one of the juiciest thrilling reads that I've had in a long, long, too long time. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe, with a poor ending","review":"This is my first book of John Grisham and I must say: \\"John, do you really think anything like this can actually happen?\\". It's not that I want every book I read to be of precise realism, but from Death Row to Dead Body Mutilation ????. Even though we cannot punish lawyers from a more general standpoint for their role on our society, at least the character gets part of what he deserves. Another story is that the conclusion was expected almost 50 pages before the ending.

A great storyteller that makes his books a quick read, Grisham has mastered the formula to make consumerism push him to the top, but the hype that now surrounds new releases is more a hope to live up to the high standard set by his earliest works. The most troublesome aspect of this particular book, though, comes literally in the last two pages. One of the greatest disappointments, the ending was a total surprise in the most negative way. I almost felt sorry for spending so much time reading the first 466 pages because it all seemed for naught. Sorry John, hopefully this is not a \\"Testament\\" of what is to come...."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Partner\\" by John Grisham","review":"This book grabbed me from the beginning and I couldn't let go.

I loved the characters, the plot and the twists and turns along the way.As I drove along I-77 listening the the ending, I almost had to pull over. I rewound the tape and played it again, thinking I had missed something. It seems highly unbelievable that someone as smart and meticulous as Patrick would allow someone to take off with all the money. And then he did not have the knowledge to track her down!

The opening six chapters or so are excellent (although the torture scenes were a little too much for me, so I speed read those!), and i absolutely love court room scenes, and Grisham is by far the king of those. This is perhaps my seventh Grisham novel, I think the guy keeps getting better and better, certainly this book has a more polished feel (perhaps he was writing with a movie in mind, but you never know). It does certainly read like a Hollywood movie - I'll have to check after this review wether it's been made into one. Overall, a fantastic vacation read and highly recommended.

I found the characters uninteresting, the story uninteresting, the storytelling uninteresting. Just not one of his best, in my opinion - seemed like this one he cranked out just to meet some obligation to the book company. The minor twist at the end was enjoyable, but not enough to save the book. I just didn't like the style, tone or storytelling. For example, I figured after chapter 1 (when Patrick gets caught) they'd go back in time to give some details, rather than only progressing forward. But it wasn't meant to be.

A lawyer fakes his own death, steals 90 million from his partners and escapes to South America. Patrick Lanigan is the lawyer and after four years, he is caught and brought back to Biloxi to face charges against him. Before returning he is almost tortured to death and due to this he is allowed to stay in a hospital instead of jail. While in the hospital he clues his lawyer and his judge friend in on the details of his escape. Everything falls into place too easily and of course Patrick gets away with everything. No one would have as much luck as he had or be that smart to get away with it and it makes the story not very believable. The ending does a fairly interesting twist, but the problem with it is that you see it coming about five chapters before it happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of man's illegal plans must be bashed by a woman","review":"The ending was a DEFINITE surprise and was GREAT!

To me, the kiss of death for any book is my ability to summarize it in one sentence. Although many books can thus be summarized, I find that I do it only for real clinkers. This is one of them. My summary is: \\" A guy disappears and is found.\\" I admit to a preference for happy endings. This is one of many reasons I so love Dean Koontz's books. But I don't think I dislike a less-than-happy ending IF the groundwork has been laid, or the reader can otherwise say, \\"Yep, that works. Sad, but it works.\\" In this Grisham potboiler, NO foundation is laid anywhere for the ending, which I assume was meant to be surprising or ironic or something. \\"Oops, we'll just turn things upside down for a memorable ending.\\" Memorable indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing.","review":"Three observations:1.

Grisham didn't give us any reason to understand why he elicited these responses from everyone he met.3.

This is a novel about a big pot of money, and characters who have no souls who are chasing it around. You won't care about the relationships--this is about dreaming what it would be like to have millions of dollars. A lotto ticket might be a better investment.I don't want to spoil the end except to say that it ends like all other Grisham books: it won't make much sense, it will be \\"ironic\\" in the sense that suddenly characters behave completely differently than you would have expected, and it is a \\"twist\\" in the sense that the author has been holding out on you and then suddenly reveals a fact you should have known all along. And, of course, it is about the money anyway. I turned the last page realizing I didn't really care about anybody in this book, I just felt, for a little while, that I was going along for a 90 million dollar ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Story shame about the ending","review":"Very entertaining, it was fun to see how Patrick Lanighan had planned ahead and got away with his prize. yet the ending does not make any sense whatsoever. Not because it was sad, but because throught tbe book the author did not give any background to make this type of ending logical. I understand you have to add an unexpected twist, but this ending is almost an insult to the reader. The Brazilian lawyer could have run away with whole lot of money from the start, and even if she did not want any one to be after her, she still had the money to enjoy at her home town with man she presumabley loved and near her father. Disappointing end to a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's on automatic","review":"This was a disappointing book with far too many elements in commonwith his previous lightweight entertainments:1. Young new partnerin a law firm in the south 2. Corruption within the firm involvingbig money 3. Young lawyer just incredibly clever, thinks of (almost)everything in advance 4. Young lawyer makes off with a ton ofmoney... 5. Escape to Latin America 6. Sailboat 7. Transfer offunds via wire to various off-shore banksThe last feature inparticular is interesting. Grisham has used the wire-transfer idea sooften that it is beginning to look like some sort of obsession. Thesame is somewhat true of escapes to the Caribbean or Latin Americawith gobs of money.Anyway, this is a simplistic pot-boiler withnot much suspense or risk to the hero (other than being almosttortured to death early in the book). The ending is strange,unexplained, and unsatisfying. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham needs a co-author","review":"The Client again demonstrates that success is built upon the abysmally low standards of the American reader and the resonance engendered in that public by detailing the slime of the American legal system. The book is a tour de force of weaving together a cast of cartoon characters, farcical plot and a No Henry ending by means of talented prose. The guy can write but he demonstratively lacks anything to write about. Grisham's motto appears to be: Suspend any rational though when you read this book.His books fall into two classes: 1) Hate \\"whitey\\" polemics and 2) Action-Suspense without suspense but with random action.He would please me if he would join forces with another writer who had a head for story line, character development and had a logical mind. With such help, a future Grisham novel could make sense as well as have great surging prose style."},{"rating":"1","title":"deceptive","review":"Enjoyed this book when I read it a number of years ago. It was so long ago that I had forgotten reading it. Recently, I was looking for a John Grisham book to read and saw that this was published in 2010. Fortunately, I read the Kindle sample first and realized I had already read it! It is deceptive to not post the original publishing date (2005) in the Kindle list! I looked at several other books that I knew were originally published years ago. Sometimes it lists the accurate date, other times not. This is a serious problem. I need to be able to trust Kindle to be honest about publishing dates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this one ...","review":"I just finished this book the other night and actually threw my book down in disgust. I hated the ending. I don't have a lot of free time, so the fact that I wasted it on this book particularly ticked me off. The beginning is intriguing but it goes downhill from there. I have read Grisham's other works and have really enjoyed them, but this book was missing the suspense that his other works contain (and that I love). This book was mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Listen to it On Audio Tape","review":"You'll be so annoyed and bored with Patrick's wait and see manipulation. And the ending was tacked on and weird. Does anyone else think Grisham is as overhyped as Seinfeld?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writing style, but I didn't like any of the characters","review":"This was my first reading of a John Grisham novel. I like his writing style ad pacing, but this story just wasn't for me. I didn't like Patrick, I thought he was little more than a common thief. Never mind his motivations. And there's a little twist at the end that just didn't work for me. I seem to be in the great minority, but this book just didn't do a thing for me other than make me say \\"I might read another of his books.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham Fan","review":"I enjoyed this read.

The characters were amazing, lots of twists and turns, just when you thought you had it figured out -- another surprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the ending portend a sequel?","review":"This book is a great read even if a tad unrealistic. However, entertaining fiction needs to be larger than life itself, right? As to the ending, while it was unsatisfactory from the protagonist's point of view, Grisham should \\"finish\\" the story with a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Story, Terrific Reader","review":"I have read and listened to several of John Grisham's novels, and The Partner has been my favorite so far. The story is gripping and suspenseful, with wonderful details and great character development. Plus, Frank Muller's narration is fantastic. Muller gives each character his or her own voice and personality so well that you know who is speaking even before the text tells you. I loved this story, and I specifically recommend the audiobook version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in ages","review":"As a long time fan of H&O, I was more than pleasantly pleased to discover this new release to be the best in ages.

Bought this CD after hearing the title track, and never expected much more than that when I got it. Whoa! This isn't simply Hall and Oates' best album ever, this is the best album I've heard this year. It has all the hallmarks of their hits but it also has a new edge to it that updates their music without in any way betraying its roots. The lyrics are deeper, more mature, and I can't think of enough good things to say about this CD. No real 'wish they hadn't done that' track on the CD at all, but my favorites are the title song, plus Getaway Car, Something 'Bout You, Intuition, Heartbreak Time, and my most favorite, Breath of Your Life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This CD!!!","review":"This CD is absolutely FABULOUS. I just can't get it out of my CD player. I've been a H&O fan since 1974 and it just doesn't get any better than this! Every song on the CD is great, the production is very smooth, and I just love it. It's adult contemporary at it's very best. If this is your first H&O CD or your 15th, you will LOVE it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock On!","review":"This is my absolute favorite album hall & oates have done! There are no standout \\"filler\\" tracks; all of them shine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They're back!","review":"Call me a die hard fan! Even after 6 years, the \\"Boys from Philly\\" haven't lost their sound. Daryl and John are actually sounding better than ever. The great part is that they're still working with many of the guys who solidified the music back in the '80's, Mickey Curry on drums, Charlie DeChant on sax, and who can forget T-Bone Wolk, who's taken on guitar as well as being on bass.Can't wait to go see them on March 8 at the Tower Theater outside Philly! You really have to see them live to appreciate the heart and soul of Daryl and John and their music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Return","review":"The boys are back! After many years of just hearing the \\"old stuff\\" on the radio, it's nice to have a new generation of H20 songs. The first 6 songs on the album are solid through and through. \\"Heartbreak Time\\" is a nice soulful ballad. Welcome back guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Do It For Love\\"","review":"It's amazing, this South Philly pair, continues to compose and perform music, that is as relevant today, as it was, thirty years ago. The first five tunes on this CD, are worth the price of admission. While it's obvious, Hall & T-Bone are the production architects behind this CD, it has always been Oates, who has supplied the glue, that has fueled the longevity of this musical journey. It's hard to think of another Duo, that has continually generated noteworthy music throughout their careers.While this CD doesn't capture the innocence of \\"Abandoned Luncheonette, or the maturity of \\"Big Bam Boom\\", it dose reaffirm this Duo's creative evolution.The inclusion of Oates \\"Love In A Dangerous Time\\", about the Aides crisis, originally written in the early nineties, is as valid today, when, you juxtapose the soundings of war in the air.While none of us are what we were in our youth, Hall & Oates still exhibit, the passion for making very good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This One's Another Dud Folks!","review":"Get Out the H20 or Private Eyes cdsif you're looking blue-eyed soul funk.This is more like folk-soulish stufffor the K-Mart crowd.

I love every single song on this CD and I can't stop playing it. The music is wonderful and the lyrics are just as good. The songs have real meaning (not like most new songs these days). My 8 year old daughter and her friends love this CD too. They sing and dance to it right along with me. (not yet old enough to be embarrassed by mom!) This is a definate must have if you like any of Hall & Oates songs!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Duo Ever!","review":"I have followed these guys for many years. They are great and this album after years without one just proves it. Listening to Daryl's great voice is oen of life's pleasures. Don't miss this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling","review":"Speechless is how the new Do It For Love CD left me. I have always been a huge H & O fan but this CD is the cream of the crop. The songs are very elemental to each other and they all blend beautifully together. After 30 years together the duo's voices are just as strong as ever. Daryl Hall's range of tones is stunning. Breath of my life left me with goose bumps. Man On A Mission really has a distinct sound and quality to it.I love the hints of techno funk dropped here and there through out the CD. Also, the spanish flavor lended to the guitar work in Do It For Love is very refreshing. Daryl & John just keep getting better and better with time. You can just completely feel how they have poured their hearts and souls into this new CD. It will be well worth the wait to see how the duo tops this new CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful look into Islamic terrorist","review":"I was looking for a book that would give me a quick overview on the Islamic religion and put what is going on in Iraq in prespective.This book is to the point and gives general, as well as detailed information, starting with Mohammad, the Quran and what the radicals like the 9/11 hijackers think about the US and rest of the world.Highly recommend for anyone interested in learning more about Islam."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG MISTAKE","review":"I purchased this and loved it.

This was disturbing to me and I started doing more research, coming to the conclusion that the EARLY Klan was not what it became later. I thought this book would be helpful.

Unfortunately, I was unable to survive the author's total absence of writing skills and just could not force myself to finish this boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BOOK WORTH BURNING","review":"The only worth of this book is its place in American prejudice, hatred, bigotry, and bad romance writing. After that, it could be a text for the W. Bush administration. A mediocre writer at best Dixon was, and he borrowed the contemporary writing of his day (romance) to aid his hideous propaganda. As a side note, I read this book in a graduate literature class on racism and southern writing. So.

I'm a huge franchise fan and spend at least as much time dealing with that aspect as actually playing the on-field game. The franchise in WSB 2K3 is a big dissapointment. They've added a coaches aspect in which you need to hire a manager, pitching & hitting coaches and a scout. All the people are fictitious and it's really more of a nuisance than anything.Gameplay itself is a nightmare. It is produced in a way that makes it look a little more like a TV broadcast than other games, but the positives end there. The players move very stiffly, the graphics are shoddy and the pitching interface is less than intuitive.Don't waste your time - All Star Baseball 2004 is a far superior game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"Some of the comments about the graphics being jittery at times are noticeable are true, so if that is what will ruin a game for you, rent it first. But if you're looking for a game that gets you as close to real baseball as any game I've played, then this one's for you. The franchise more than makes up for the minor shortcomings in graphics, and the ability to save your franchise in the middle of a game is a wonderful feature. Can't believe that all baseball games don't have that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great baseball game!!","review":"This game is awsome. There are legends like Nolan Ryan, Mike Schimdt and many more. The pitching is realistic and you can play the game like you're watching it on tv.The thing I hate about this game is that when the other team gets a hit and you're fielding The guy takes so long to get it out of his glove and throw it in.

I've felt mentally and morally sick working in higher education for close to ten years now and just thought I was crazy. Gatto confirms that it is the system itself which is sick and that the people who run it and benefit are not honest and honorable people and one could fairly label them pathological, I'll even label them as pedophiles for raping the minds, spirits and souls of students. It's rare to see a man speak so truthfully and forcefully and passionately about what is missing today; honor, principle, character, creativity, imagination, independence, and dissent. I'm amazed this man hasn't been assassinated for exposing this dirty game. This book goes way beyond the narrow scope of education, he taps into a world view and value system which is heartening for me, he helps me understand why and how the world is so screwed up. This man should run for president in my opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise!","review":"Superbly written, vivid insights, and good secondary sources mark the pages of this fine achievement.

Most readers though may find this book largely pointless because nothing is sourced.There is no bibliography. Quotations are not cited.For example I was reading on page 40 that Max Mason says the new education model is for 'the control of human behavior.' When I read this I thought \\"wow that's interesting.\\" Then I proceeded to find the source of this claim. This is what I found on page 391:'Should I now attempt to dazzle you with this grotesque assemblage arranged into a formal bibliography.

I had a rough time with public factory-style permission-to-urinate-denied \\"wut parentz?\\" schooling and I agree with much of Gatto's assessment. But I have trouble believing this book amounts to right-wing agit-prop, or maybe just Old Fart-isms, enveloping some worthwhile history (e.g., his section on the Gary plan)--history that Gatto unfortunately mixes with self-admittedly \\"speculative\\" narrative--and Gatto's actual sympathy for children and education."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Must Read book!","review":"The amount of history presented in this book is almost overwhelming. At the same time it is compelling to read. I could hardly put the book down.I had no idea how much social engineering takes place in our government schools. This is an eye opening exposure of the hidden agendas that have and are driving our educational system.I disagree with the first reviewer. Corporal punishment in schools of old, is briefly touched on in the beginning of the book.It was not a major position of any kind. I wonder if he/she read more than just the very beginning of the book.If you were educated in the public schools then you should read this book.

The roots mostly center around the Prussian military system, from which Horace Mann had his \\"great\\" idea.In my experience, school was a device which was too easy yet I spent 1000+ hours doing needless homework for.

It also tends to be incredibly choppy, with thoughts coming and going like bad housegeusts. Lastly, it has all the faults one would expect to find in Montagu: he sacrificed his science for politics, and thus there are many times where he wildy exhorts his point of view or uses ad homineim's against his opponents. The reason is the book was not written to explore a phenomena, but to convince people that some things are wrong and other right morally. So his science suffers.

If you do not want your child to be exposed to the God, Jesus, Hell, Armageddon & Damnation themes, you should stay clear of these videos. This franchise should be listed under Christian or God and Spirituality videos.I am not an atheist - but if you actually see some of the stuff they come up with in some of the Veggietales - your jaw will drop open.This is a very cute way to program an agenda into a small persons head - not the type of stuff many of us want to expose them to and it should be openly labeled as Christian Children's Movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Sunday School as well as at home!","review":"I teach a third grade Sunday school class, and I always use a Veggie Tales video if there's one to fit in with our lesson. Today, as a prelude to Thanksgiving, we watched Madame Blueberry. The kids loved it, and they were able to apply what they saw to their own lives (\\"hmmmmm, maybe I don't need every Pokemon trading card\\"). I wish QWERTY had used an additional Bible verse about thankfulness (in addition to the Proverb on greed), but that's the only thing about this video that wasn't perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the BEST!","review":"I have to admit it... we have no small children living in our home, yet I own every Veggie Tale released to date! Sure kids come over and it's nice to have a great video for them to watch... but these are for MY viewing pleasure! Madame Blueberry is my personal favorite. The message is perfect for our overly materialistic society (myself included)and the phrase \\"But... I don't NEED a toaster oven!\\" is tossed around whenever we find ourselves contemplating a major (non essential) purchase. And don't underestimate the age range, I've witnessed a room full of 'youth' from two year olds to college students not only watching Veggie Tales, but singing along (so they've learned the words somewhere!) Sure, buying this video isn't going to MAKE you happy, but the message will give you great directions on where you can find a VERY happy heart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not that good for adults.","review":"I have loved every Veggie Tale up to this one.

Our whole family loves Veggie-Tales! The computer animation is superb, the humor is clever and witty enough for adults to appreciate, the songs are catchy, and the style is refreshingly wacky! In this episode, Madame Blueberry is taught an important lesson about materialism; namely, all the STUFF at the STUFF MART, CAN NOT buy her a happy heart; (and no, HAPPY HEARTS ARE NOT FOR SALE, IN AISLE 3)! My five year old thinks this story is hysterical, and enjoys watching it over and over again! Is the message of the movie getting through to her?

Maybe a diffuser to eliminate the effects of the pop-up will impove the results.While it does what it said it would do, in order to do what I want to do, I need to upgrade my whole system.

When did they ditch those guys?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet Valley Twins was much better...","review":"I only read half of this book, since it was boring.

That's totally unrealistic. I'll stick with the old series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has this guy worked in the industry?","review":"I have been working in the printing industry for many years. I can tell when someone has actually worked in the industry or just teaches the subject. This book has many flaws due to the author only having classroom knowledge on the subject. I brought this book to my employees and we found ourselves laughing out loud. This book spends too much time on small details about paper and printing that are never used. It simply makes the subject harder than it actually is. The book seems like it was just thrown together with poor quality black and white photos used as illustrations. I found words in bold print with little or no definitions next to them and could not be found in the glossary as well. I bet that the only place you would find this book being tought is in the author's classroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Who Knows","review":"I have sat in the author's classroom while he used this book to teach the class and I must say that I agree with the other reviews. I have since then gone onto graduate and I am now working in the printing industry. I have never been asked to use any of the information I learned from this book while on the job. Not only did I feel short changed by buying this book but I also had to pay for many of the author's classes that also gave me useless information that would only come in handy if I owned a time machine and was able to go back to 1970 and work in the industry. What I did with this book is I gave it to a student who had not taken the class yet but I made them promise that they will also give the book to someone else for free when they are done with it.

I have to say they do not smell so great to us humans, but apparantely they smell heavenly to the dogs. So keep them somewhere that you don't have to smell them. We keep them in a plastic storage container in the garage, but it is high up on a shelf so that neither bug critters or hungry dogs can get to them. We did have them on a lower shelf and one of our dogs just helped himself while he was out there enjoying a steak bone. I guess it was his desert after desert.

Children are like sponges and therefore it's terrible for them to hear grammar such as \\"we got\\", \\"yup\\" and \\"tell me 'bout.\\" I also found it unnecessary for one of the child characters in the book to discuss being evicted and her daddy being unable to find them a place to stay. The book states that Christmas is Jesus' birthday, when in fact that is not true. Since this is a book about Jesus, it should not state that one of the characters were \\"lucky\\" to have received some money. It should state that the child was \\"blessed.\\" Finally, I would suggest alternate reading material for a child learning more about Jesus and proper grammar."},{"rating":"2","title":"With limited onboard boat storage, this helps with keeping life jackets ready, dry and available.","review":"We use them to store 2 offshore life jackets and misc equipment.

It is nothing more than a recast of their 30-minute TV show where you watch two people create a mosaic table. They talk very fast at times due to the short amount of time. I bought this TO LEARN, for more detailed explanation on the how and why rather than just watching excerpts of time-lapsed work and hearing about how brilliant they are. I expected more from well-known names in the industry and feel that they are taking advantage of their reputation to charge full price for a TV recast and pretend it is an instructional video. The DVD is worth something, but certainly not the price they are asking. If you want a good stained glass video, check out Michael Dupille's Beginning Fritography. That is excellent!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So many things wrong","review":"This game is sooo bad. The makers of the game went to so much trubble to include extensive attributes for all players but once the game starts, all the players run atthe same speed, all the batters have the same shot at a HR, all the balls hit are of the same trajectory and all the pitchers throw there own pitches at same velocity.

In the beginning larry is in a cafe, it is late at night and the cafe is empty, he is sitting at a table crying hitting his head on the table, the waiter, says hey buddy are you okay? And it just gets worse from here. The wallowing in crying, and sadness continues throughout the entire movie. It takes places, the entire movie, while larry cries sitting at this booth, reflecting on past veggie tales episodes played on the restaurant juke box, the past epsisodes are good, but my son couldn't get past, momma Larry sad. What's wrong momma? It was not a good veggie tale.

There are just too many repeated songs in it from the Silly Song countdown to hold a child's attention that long. I really wish that they would have gone more into the storyline of Archibald cancelling the silly songs. It's hard to explain all that to a three-year-old - the plot really isn't that well explained. They missed a great opportunity for a really funny video. It just wasn't as developed as the rest of their videos have been. Still, it's definitely a better bet than buying some of the other stuff out there for kids.

It was too dangerous for her to even eat, I was afraid she would choke on it, she is a small Yorkie.The other thing is the ear STUNK. Whatever smoke stuff they put on it, got everywhere.

It was an easy read and easy to understand, but not overly interesting. It is a typical sociology book. Most people who buy this book will be students required to purchase it for class. However, if you are the rare person considering this book as an addition to your library, I suggest rethinking your decision. I suspect that the people who find this subject matter interesting already know everything in the book. It is written on a very basic level.If you are looking for a book to improve your marriage, look elsewhere. This book offers theoretical ways to have a successful relationship, but like too many sociology books it has little practical relevance. For example, this book teaches that a successful relationship will have optimal balances of cohesion, flexibility and communication. While that principal is probably correct the application is vague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservative and Boring","review":"I had to use this book for class. It is a extremely simplistic book that reads much more like a high school text then something intended for college. It was generally uninteresting. The authors are obviously fairly traditional in their views of family relationships and the whole text seems out of date for today's society. There was no information in this book that isn't just common sense. Also, there was an over emphasis on the positive of family relationship, which though warm a fuzzy, is not particularly relevant or helpful. I spoke to the department chair at my college about this book and they will not be requiring it next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too urgent for replacement","review":"I have ordered eight copies of the book as above.

The light flashes on briefly if you tap the top of it, and then it flickers on and off. Additionally the new bulbs I put in about 2 months ago are already very dark on the ends.

The range is worse than my cheap 900Mhz phone, it doesn't even reach all the rooms in my house, let alone the backyard. The voice quality is poor as well.

It sounds like a cell phone on both ends. The battery life is awful, so I'm always tethered to the base, which defeats the whole purpose of a cordless. The phone also \\"crashes\\" quite often. Phones aren't supposed to crash! It takes a lot of coercing to get it working again after this happens. Also, to change any setting, to redial a number, or to access a speed dial number, you have a to through a whole maze of menus. It takes four button presses to redial a number! You have to confirm it and bla bla bla, it's like I'm using a computer. \\"Are you sure you want to redial?\\" Wow.Overall a very fickle, poorly designed phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features, but it keeps breaking.","review":"When I first got this phone, I was in love with it. It was the perfect thing for our apartment. I needed a phone in the second bedroom, but I didn't want to run a new jack in the room because there was too much furniture that would have needed to be moved. The supplemental handset which doesn't need a phone jack worked out perfectly.The first week we had the system, the main handset broke when the power button got stuck. I figured this was a fluke and that someone was probably just too rough with it. Amazon quickly replaced the dead unit with no problems.Now after a little over a year, the replacement handset has broken as well. It won't even turn on. If this was a cheaper unit I'd say ok - you get what you pay for, but considering the price of the system, I think you should get much more than a year's worth of use out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this phone","review":"I had such high hopes for this phone. It looks nice, the satellite phone units are cool. Unfortunately, they just don't work.

This phone is a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of money for a lousy phone","review":"This phone has been very disappointing. The range is less thanthe Sony 900Mhz that this phone was supposed to replace. Battery life is very low. The worst problem is the intermittent audio dropouts. It'll work for a while, then the person on the other end only hears every other word. I've hear rumors that there is a poor design of the contacts in this phone, but find no solid proof. The replacement phone that Siemens sent had the same problem. On the bright side, Siemens agreed to send a 2420 to replace this piece of junk. Good customer service, but a lousy phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice phone, low battery replacement cost, what... NO MUTE???","review":"Ok, this is a nice phone for ($). Got it from ... for ($) with a ($) rebate from Siemens.The primary reason I selected this phone is because of the relatively inexpensive battery replacement. VTech wants ($)per battery for my old 900 MHz phone - that is criminal. Using AA batteries guarantees that the Siemens 2400 series will have minimal maintenance cost.BUT.... what systems/marketing genius decided to leave out the MUTE feature? I attend teleconferences where it is mandatory to use mute to avoid feedback from 20 other attendees. Also, it is just common courtesy to mute before flushing the toilet!

I live in an older (100-year-old) apartment, and you could hear static on the phone from the kitchen on the other end of the apartment. Not precisely what I was expecting from a 2.4GHz phone! People could tell when I was wandering about the apartment.And then the batteries started dying. I used to have a VTech analog digital, and after about 3 years the batteries started only giving me like 4-5 hours of use. At this point, I'm lucky if I have time to check my voice mail before my batteries completely die!

We find ourselves shouting, \\"We can still hear you, don't hang up\\" as we run for our old corded phone in the basement. We replaced the NiCad batteries in both handsets, with no improvement.We had a replacement warranty and will now give the Siemens Gigaset 4015 we received a try, but I find myself wondering if we might be better off with a Uniden TRU448-2, an AT&T 2255, or a VTech VT2461."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of money for a poor product","review":"Don't buy this phone!

With both handsets, the conversation breaks up and people can't hear us. It seems to depend on how we hold the phone or if we touch the back of the phone during a conversation. How can you NOT touch the back? It's tricky, let me tell you!

Surely Charity could have come up with a few more verses for each song. There are some Blind Boy Fuller songs covered by Charity, but they look truly poor compared to the originals.

Unfortunately, I was let down in a huge way. First of all, there are only 10 entrance videos! Just 10! No DVD extras, nothing! For anyone who's interested, here is the entrance video list:The RockVince McMahonKaneChris JerichoEdgeKurt AngleThe HurricaneBilly and ChuckTriple HThe UndertakerWhile this is not a bad line up, the WWE should realize that instead of paying [money]for the DVD.

As I watch the DVD, the videos loop and aren't even the official one, it has new clips that don't even have in the ones they use in WWE TV shows. There are only 10 videos and this video is 30 minutes long with no special features (other than re-arranging the video, who cares?? lol) The video is 30 minutes long and not worth it. If you already own WWE RAW for Xbox you can watch the wrestlers AUTHENTIC Entrance Videos and instead of watching just 10 on the RAW for Xbox game you can watch like 50 of them. Now don't say I didn't warn you, This is probably why the DVD is so cheap, but believe me...the [money]can be used for something even better.

You might aswell get a videogame like Smackdown 4 on PS2 or RAW on X-box and watch all the titantron video's on that (I know for a fact that X-box RAW has at least 40 entrance video's). Presuming each titantron video lasts an average of 90 seconds (they loop), then this means they could actually fit 120+ different Superstats titatantron video's on one Disc with sound.

While each 3 minute video has high production values and is good fun, it's hard to believe that the WWE couldn't find it in themselves to deliver some value for money by cramming more than 10 videos onto the disc.

Why would I pay money to see 10 videos that I see on Raw or Smackdown anyway? Just buying almost any other DVD gives you your share of these 10 videos, that nobody cares about in the first place. Why not add a highlight match for each superstar \\"Ramped Up\\" features as an extra? Why not fill the DVD with videos', as a DVD is obviously capable of? Because WWE wants to make more volumes.

Although it laughs at the idea of a creator it's respectful about the idea that there could be a supreme intelligence.

Not only are the radio tracks good (like everything to everyone and father of mine), but songs like White Men in Black Suits and El Distorto De Melodica (a favorite of mine) are great too. Buy this now, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-beat alternative with interesting variety","review":"So Much for the Afterglow is one of the best selections of alternative music today. Like most alternative - in my opinion - it is easy to relax to, but it also has a mostly fast, upbeat tone.My personal favourite song is So Much for the Afterglow. It combines Everclear's usual tone with an interesting Beach Boys-style melody at the beginning. The song then becomes fun and upbeat, though with a somewhat nostalgic tone.The only problem with the album as a whole I found was a somewhat depressive feel to the lyrics-specifically in the songs Father of Mine and Why I Don't Believe in God-which takes away from some of the cds upbeat tone. These songs, however, are still very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much For The Afterglow is the BEST CD EVER!!!!","review":"I LOVE So Much For the Afterglow! All of the songs rock, especially Everything to Everyone!I have all of Everclear's CDs, and this is by far the best!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i didnt like it","review":"ive read some of the 1-star reviews out there. theyre all right, everclear is nothing but three-chord songs with no creativity. but i dont hate it, i just didnt like it. i bought it, listened to it, then sold it. this is just typical mainstream nothingness. very little creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a song about Susan...","review":"I am sure if you are considering purchasing an Everclear album you have heard their music on the radio so I will get strait to the point. \\"So Much for the Afterglow\\" draws the line between radio-friendliness and artistic expression; combining meaningful lyrics with catchy tunes. If you like the Everclear you hear on the radio, then you will love this album. It is tremendously easy to listen to and very likeable. It is a necessity for every Everclear fan, and should be the first Everclear album that a new fan buys. This is the happy middleground between alternative/grunge and pop rock. It is a very solid and consistent album, which makes it enjoyable to listen to the whole way through, but this also lowers its replay value slightly. Personally, I prefer the albums \\"World of Noise\\" and \\"Sparkle and Fade,\\" but this is a very good album as well. It is a 'gateway' of sorts not only to the other Everclear albums, but other grunge/alternative/punk music as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of the Year","review":"For those reviewers who think Everclear is simplistic, then do yourself a favor - read the lyrics to \\"Father of Mine\\" out loud without any music. Then you'll learn that this band is actually writing excellent poetry. For those of you who say Everclear only has a few chords...well they could be like everyone else and, instead of recording what a three person band actually sounds like, they could have overdubbed and computer programmed their music. I'm glad they didn't. This is a gritty, yet soaring album - virtually every one of its songs is amazing. This is one of the best albums to come along in a long time from one of America's most promising bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Father of mine was the song that sold this CD, but other underdog songs like everything to everyone are just awesome and they get better with every track!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Afterglow is the best one yet!","review":"This CD is the best yet of Everclear's work! You die hard World of Noise and Sparkle and Fade people don't know what you're talking about! This CD is one of the best of this decade! I bought it 3 years ago and I STILL don't get tired of hearing every one of those songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A non-rave-but-still-good review","review":"Is it possible for us denziens of the 90's to create a decent review with a minimum of slang and some semblance of intelligence? This CD's grunge tone is not afraid to broach folk at time, as \\"Father of Mine,\\" does. However, try a few other tracks besides the ones overplayed on the radio. The lyrics are expressive, creative, and relevant to young modern life with it's moments of bliss and more common moments of confusion, pain, and loss. Art's voice is distict, moving, even a bit amusing. I give this album 4 stars because I feel that while this album will appeal to the majority of us grunge fans, it will not appeal to all listeners, particularly Vivaldi fans. I count it among my favorites because it holds more intelligence and genuine understanding that most grunge bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"nearly flawless (better than their last one)","review":"i just got this cd a week ago and i listened to it in the car on my way back home. i already knew some of the songs:so much for the afterglow, i will buy you a new life, normal like you, father of mine, amphetimine, and sunflowers. i like all of the songs on the cd (except for maybe one or two). if you want some great alternative music, get this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is an awesome CD!","review":"this is my favorite cd, and everclear is my favorite band! they're so much better than those new boy bands like n sync and backstreet boys who think they're all that. what would we do without great alternative bands like everclear? they should go on tour with either hole, eve 6, or green day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everclear rocks the boat","review":"How on earth do you correctly say Art's last name?

All the songs are great. I can't chose which ones are the best cause they all are. If you want a new cd that you can listen to again and again, this is definitely a must get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everclear is the #1 band on this planet.","review":"In every single one of these songs you can either relax or freak out. If you are feeling upset Art Alexakis can bring you pissed off lyrics that bring out the rage in anyone. Or if you are feeling laid back, the melodies just help keep the mood cool. I am a major Everclear freak and a strong supporter of their music(at least in my head). I hope you can enjoy the music as much as I do. Just remember that the songs can mean whatever you want them to mean. At least I think that is what Art would want. Hahahaha"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE GREATEST CD'S I'VE EVER HEARD!","review":"I am a music lover who usually will jump to by a CD after I hear a song that I really like. Unfortunatley that is why I have hundreds of CD's that I can only listen to a few songs of. But this album is truly the best CD I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. It is pure greatness from the first song right down to the end. And wait until you hear the great instrumental on this CD. I recommend that you buy this CD right away. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's alright, but sadly boring","review":"Now, I mean no disrespect to Everclear but why when I play the chords in, \\"Everything to Everyone\\", can I sing the words to \\"Father of Mine\\" and \\"I Will Buy You a New Life\\"?? Everclear needs to think a little harder about their music before they write it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best CD I've ever heard","review":"The first time I heard Everclear I didn't really care for them, to be quite honest. But after hearing some of the songs they released from this album I became quite intrigued. I fell in love with Father of Mine and Everything to Everyone after hearing them on the radio, and decided I had to buy it. So buy it I did, and I was totally blown away. Every track on this CD from the first (So Much For The Afterglow) to the bonus track (Hating You For Christmas) absolutely rules. After hearing this CD I immediately bought World of Noise and Sparkle and Fade, and while those CDs aren't bad, they don't hold a candle to this gem. Buy this CD, I guarantee you will love it. I also highly recommend their newer releases Songs From An American Movie volumes 1 and 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshingly depressing","review":"Everclear is the best. I didn't use to like them but my brother bought this CD and ended up hating it, so I bought it from him.The music deals with depressing, real-life topics. I felt a very personal connection to \\"Normal Like You\\" and \\"Everything to Everyone\\". It's cool to listen to songs that have such up-beat music like \\"Sunflowers\\" have lyrics that talk about teenage depression.The only song on the CD I don't like is \\"Like a California King\\" It's really messed up and I can't understand what Art is talking about.Other that that this CD rocks and you should buy several copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Record!","review":"This is some of the best music I have heard, ever. It tells stories and it has meaning behind it. It's differant than the average \\"I Hate You\\" punk rock. Art lets out his feelings and that's what an artist should do.\\"Father of Mine\\" is probably the best song on this record. Art tells his father how much he meant to him and how heartbroken it was for him to leave and also how hard it was to live without a father around. The best line in the song is, \\"My Daddy gave me a name, and then he walked away.\\" Some other good songs are, \\"I Will Buy You A New Life,\\" \\"So Much For The Afterglow,\\" \\"Normal Like You,\\" and \\"El Distorto De Melodica,\\" which is a great instrumental.I give SMFTA *chips a five into a stone block* A FIVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I totally LOVED this one! Sure, Everclear has other stuff out now, but this will always be their best album! The songs are real, and really say alot about life. The guitar work on this is killer! \\"Normal like you\\" is my fave song, and you gotta hear it! Yes, you NEED this one! These are the kind of songs that you find yourself singing years from now! Its really awesome! Trust me on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everclear at it's best...almost","review":"Back in early 1997, I heard a catchy melody pop onto the radio. I was 12 and was just starting to find out what real music was. I listened after the song to hear what that amazing band was...it was Everclear and the song was \\"Everything to Everyone.\\" Since then, I now own all of Everclear's albums and can play most of the songs from SMFTA on bass...but that's not important. The point is, next to Sparkle and Fade, this was Everclear's best album, and was a turning point in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this so much for all the neat phrases in the lyrics.","review":"I love this so much.

Some of it is really depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's to say!!??","review":"This album DEFINATELY rocks. Art Alexakis is a genius, and Greg Eklund's beats may get a bit repetitive, but you just can't get enough! If you like Eve6 or Third Eye Blind this album's for you. But if you're more hard rock than that, you absolutely MUST add their album \\"World Of Noise\\" to your collection. It's dark and special in it's own Genius Hand-ed way. Track 8 Sparkle is an AWESOME song. World Of Noise is by far my favorite album EVER!! And Sparkle and Fade is up there with it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One word....

Especialy the first song (so much for the afterglow)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Everclear album so far.","review":"Everclear has a sound.Whenever you hear a song on the radio, if it's an Everclear song you know it immediately.Even if you don't know THAT song.For example, the songs \\"Everything for Everyone\\", \\"I Will Buy You A New Life\\" and \\"Father of Mine\\" are all variations of a theme.The tempos are all similar: a loping, head-bobbing midtempo cruise.The guitar chord/bass lines are nearly identical: dum-dum-dum-da-da-dumdum.The lyrics, however, are the kicker, and they are what elevate Alexakis and company above the usual radio fodder. They're open, insightful, sometimes raw and often funny.This is the album where the Everclear sound finally defines itself, and the extraordinary number of strong songs makes it a must-purchase.\\"So Much For The Afterglow\\" and \\"Sunflowers\\" are killer tunes...melodic, driving modern rock. The rest of the album is filled out with interesting if not spectacular ideas.This is the one to get, and then pick up their greatest hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys rock!","review":"Art saved my life. I totally relate to everything he sings and he's one of the most honest singers ever. He's also got a fantastic turn of phrase. Lyrics are completely unconventional. My favorite line of the CD is from a song called \\"Normal Like You\\" it's \\"Just because you are Neurotic and Depressed doesn't mean that you're sad.\\" It's very true. No one understands that unless you have gone through it. Have a bad break up? Listen to Everclear. Have a crappy childhood but don't want to whine about it? Listen to Everclear. Just pissed off and had a bad day? Listen to 'em."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have cd.","review":"The cd is a must have for all people who like Everclear. Believe me--you will like it.

As one of the songs on this album was ending, the DJ sang the lyrics to another everclear song. Needless to say, the lyrics fit perfectly. Everclear came up with one decent tune, and put half the songs on this cd to those three chords.When I listen to this cd, I keep thinking that the repeat button is stuck on my cd player because of all the songs that seem to copy each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sophomore Effort From Everclear","review":"Don't listen when people say that Everclear got soft or \\"less punk.\\" While this CD has more lighter songs than \\"Sparkle and Fade\\" I still think it's incredible and even better than their first CD. There are some really classic songs on here that I promise you'll play OVER and OVER. Number 10 (white men in black suits) is incredible and moving. The other songs range from lighter love/life experience songs and some fairly punk/hard rock songs. There's even a twangy country like song in there which is surprisingly good. Everclear fans and people just getting into the band will enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the songs sound the same","review":"I didn't buy this album. Although I don't think it's nessesary since it seems Everclear is planning on airing all their songs on the radio anyway. All I have to say is that I can't believe almost nobody notices that all the sons use the same chords, over and over again. The only reason I gave this CD an extra star its because some of the lyrics are good and were written with a good purpose, although expressed through a bad medium. I honestly think there's room for improvement... A LOT of room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best","review":"I know, everyone likes Sparkle & Fade, which is pretty terrific but this is my favorite!

When we unpacked and shook out the slip, we thought it wasn't even the same slip, but zooming in, I can see that it is, in fact, the same- one can see the edge of the bustier through the fabric of the slip. I think perhaps it is the fact that the image is cut out and pasted on a white background that makes it look more opaque.Basically, there is one layer of nylon, with a draw-string- not even an elastic waistband, and at the hip ONE layer of tulle netting, each tier gathered into the one above. It would not support much weight in a skirt over it- anything more than a filmy fabric will crush it down. To hold a classic poodle skirt shape, one would need several of these, which could be built for about two bucks and an hour's work.

It's one of two genres (the other being light romantic comedies) that studios and independents fall back on when they have nothing of substance to say. But I found THUMBSUCKER a cut above the rest. It's a somewhat idiosyncratic little gem that is well written and credibly acted by an impressive ensemble cast. I was paticularly impressed by Keannu Reeves who as an actor has never been taken too seriously by critics or hardcore cinephiles. He gave a wonderfully nuanced performance of a slightly whacky, but ultimately lovable orthodontist. Tilda Swinton, as always, was superb. And the young actor, Lou Pucci, who played the title role was remarkable. This offbeat excursion into teenage angst and the dark and often humurous corners of suburbia is well worth your effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitter-sweet Tale of Growing Up","review":"Thumbsucker tells the story of a 17 year old who still sucks his thumb.

His collection of rubber duckies isn't enough, he wants all the duckies, no matter who he hurts. Like the other videos, this presents a good lesson without being too preachy or abandoning the scriptural basis. And it's presented in way that is entertaining to young children but still entertaining to adults. The songs are catchy and the humor is sharp. Lighthearted fun without being overly sacchrine. (Also includes another Silly Song with Larry, Endangered Love. Very cute!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great message, and one that kids will easily remember!","review":"This story follows that of King David and Uriah, but in a kids' version that involves rubber duckies. Unlike the bible story, everything works out in the end and Kind David (played by Larry the Cucumber) learns his lesson. The analogy of the rich man taking the poor man's lamb is included in the tale, and I think it is one kids will take seriously and remember for a long time. This tale is definitely a fun one and teaches about selfishness and greed.

And since it's a dialogue-driven film, not being able to understand them seriously hindered my enjoyment, of course. I will say that Benedict is *gorgeous* in this movie-- he plays a young man tragically dying of cancer, and he's convincing in his portrayal of the physical problems his character deals with-- fatigue, debility, severe pain, dependence on pain meds, as well as the expected emotional problems of fear, despair and ruthlessly facing his own demise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for a great price","review":"After all the other games based on the Evil Dead movies, this one has finally appeared and is worth the title.

This game seems like it was rushed.When you have killed a zombie and keep on moving then comes the same zombie you just killed. It is non stop action. But it starts to get quite boring after a half an hour of playing. Most of the missions in the game are quite tedious.

This game is a pointless shoot 'em up where all you do is run around shooting this or sawing that. It's entertaining for a little bit watching the zombies fall apart at the hands(or blades) of Ash's chainsaw. But it's only a matter of time before the gameplay becomes so redundant you have no will to continue playing because all you do is chop stuff up(and what's with the strip clubs everywhere?!).There ARE spells that attempt to add some depth to the game, but when the day is over, you're left with the same shoot and slash garbage you started with when you turned the game on. Anyone into these kind of games should check out the Hunter games instead. They have better variation in weapons, and you can play with a friend.

The renditions of the most famous stuff (\\"La Vie en Rose\\", \\"April in Paris\\", \\"Milord\\") are pretty unique, and you can still never say that Sam Butera didn't put every ounce of his soul into his horn.

The Scott Hall-Bradshaw match was not great but pretty good. Both the Jazz-Trish Stratus-Women's title match & the Jeff Hardy-Brock Lesnar match were pretty much one-sided. The Kurt Angle-Edge match was a smash-mouth,high-tech,back-and-forth,high-flying showstealer. The Undertaker-Steve Austin match was a pretty good brawl and could have done better without Ric Flair as guest ref. The World tag team championship match was a solid,high-flying,back-and-forth bout.

The Wizard makes his first appearance, Per Degaton's time traveling causes a number of problems for the JSA, and the epic Injustice Society storyline are all in this volume.

Bonzai is one of the smallest flash drive I've seen, and even better yet, this is upgradable. 32MB SD came with mine, and I've put in 128MB SD now (I put the old one in my DV camcorder). When the price goes down, I'm planning to get 1GB, and put the old one on other devices I have.For those who use this as an SD adapter to download pictures, MP3s, etc, I'd use PCMCIA adapter - much faster, and don't need to take off the plastic cover of Bonzai. It's true that whatever moving parts will likely get lost - I lost my cap. However, a call to Simple Tech quickly solve that proble.

I decided to just break it off, and now it's not a problem anymore. However, some dirt and dust can get inside more easily now. The great things about this device are fast data transfer (I'm using a 512MB SD card), and a spring-loaded memory card slot! When you want to remove your memory card, just push it in, and the spring will release the card. I've seen similar cards where removal of the memory card is difficult - this one is a breeze.

Now I just put the new one in as a disk drive. 1GB for next to nothing, which is quite a deal.With the Bonzai, I just stick a new card into it and place the Bonzai into a USB port and it just works. It works with Windows XP, Mac OS X, and Linux. I have amazed people in places like P.R. China, Australia, Austria, and even the USA with swapping other people's SD cards for mine in the Bonzai and, voila, it just works.For the price, this is one of the wonders of the electronic world.

These two structures appear only to serve the writer's thesis: that medieval christian aesthetics are light and harmoneous geometry with harmonic ratios. The pictures in this book are B&W; concetrated in the middle and offer no advantage on what you could find on the internet or other books.To conclude, this book is for academicals and scholars and not for the general audience. For an introduction to Gothic architecture I suggest Christopher Wilson's \\"The Gothic Cathedral\\" (with only B&W; pictures unfortunately, but still, they are many and are very illustrative) or Ralf's Thoman \\"Gothic\\" with many colored photoes.Reviewed by Zachi Evenor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally useful","review":"Books on writing are usually ho-hum for me, as I am a writer with many publications and many years experience and have taught writing in various venues.

Ha! Not so; this book reminds me of them, stirs me up, and has already helped me liven up a couple of works in progress.Altho this book is focused on nature writing, most of the principles discussed apply to writing of any kind.

Bob isn't here at all. There are a few songs, but they are definitely not what you'd expect from Big Idea. There are basically only four characters, Mr. Nezzer (King Xerxes), Esther, Mr. Lunt (the king's right-hand man), and Pa Grape (Esther's cousin Mordecai). There's also Jean Claude and Phillipe, the French peas, but they aren't even important to the story. There isn't even the famous VeggieTales theme song, the story just starts.

There was virtually no humor. And where was Bob & Larry? Bob wasn't in the movie at all, and Larry only a very minor role as the king's scribe - he barely even says anything. There was only one \\"silly song\\" which wasn't even catchy (unlike The Bunny Song and Song of the Cebu and my very favorite, Larry Boy Theme Song). Where were the recurring characters like Laura Carrot and Junior Asparagus? All I can say good about this one was the animation was excellent, but besides that, this didn't feel like a standard Veggie Tales... and by all means, avoid Big Idea's new series, 3-2-1 Penguins. What happened Big Idea? I know I saw Phil Vischer's name in the credits..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucky...don't waste your $ on these.","review":"I thought these would be a good deal since they aren't as ugly and just as safe. Wrong. When they came, they were scratched from only the packaging. I thought I could deal with it, but when I started doing dental work they wouldn't stop fogging. Then on the way home I dropped them about a foot and they got scratched in 5 other places! They may look stylish and sleek, but don't waste your time or money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description is Misleading","review":"The item is great, but the description this company uses is incorrect. It is not a set of 4. It is one pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Henckels Fails to live up to Standard","review":"After receiving this set I was surprised to see that half of the set (the 8 steak knives) were so poorly made they probably wouldn't cut bread, let alone a steak or tomato! The solid stainless steel, serrated-edged knives are made in Korea, do not have matching wood handles or high carbon steel blades like the rest of the traditional Henckels knives in this set. I sent an email to the company and received no response either. They definitely need to improve the quality control on this Korean supplier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Well, I bought this set without researching the difference between international set and real set from Germany.The kifves were rather dull, and its cheap price indicated its quality. I regret to jump up and bought the set at the department store.I am aware of how expensive the products from Germany, although it would be worth collecting the knives from REAL henckels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Asheron's Call: secrets and strategies","review":"First of all this book does a thorough job of giving you a complete overview of the WORLD OF DERETH. I found this book to be indispensible for creature weaknesses and strengths.Second, although the book was a thorough overview it does not cover the \\"secrets\\" that is implied in the cover. I understood that it would give me the spells I needed and secrets to the game. The only secrets that I would have not found were the Microsoft Easter Eggs built into the game, this did me no good.Overall this book does a great job of giving you the portals, lifestones, dungeons, and points of interest needed to the new game player.I would truely recommend this book to the new player to the world of Dereth but as I am an intermediate player the book serves a medium amount of interest to me but none the less a true necessity for the new player."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money","review":"I bought this book when AC first went gold. I had been playing beta since early beta 0. Most of the information i was looking for is incorrect in the book because it is based on the world as it was in Beta 0. Lifestone locations were dramatically altered due to the issues resulting from population masses, they are no long located in the center of town (where the book places them). Town portal locations are mostly backwards (the destination is really the origin) and some are just bad. Dungeon locations are also not so great...download ACExplorer, it's free and it's more useful that this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"strategies and secrets\\" is false advertising.","review":"This book spends a lot of time teaching you the same things you would learn if you spent 5 minutes playing the game. There is a couple sections that are a nice reference, but even they are outdated. There are very few maps, and the ones that are in there are outdated. Although there is a section that explains majic and is a good reference for spell components, There is NO SPELL GUIDE, which is one of the reasons why I bought the book. Sure, I could get it online, but I wanted it in hardcopy. I was just a little upset because the word \\"secrets\\" DOES NOT IN ANY WAY APPLY TO THIS BOOK, AND USING THE WORD \\"STRATEGIES\\" TO DESCRIBE THE BOOK IS REALLY STRETCHING IT. The author seams to want to write an expanded instruction guide. It seams as if he didn't want the book to be a spoiler, even though it was plainly advertised as one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Helpful but slightly out of date","review":"Due to Recent Additions by the developers at MS. I noticed that some of the Coordinates are incorrect as far as finding lifestones and portals. However, This book offers great information as far as character generation, location of Dungeons, and the how-to's of playing this game. I would recommend this book to anyone new to the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"I have ordered these types of chocolates before(Weinbrand Bohnen Brandy Chocolates) and these were fantastic, they had great flavor,were very fresh(sometimes they dry up if they are older),and were the perfect size(some larger ones are too big and the liquid can run if not all in your mouth),the chocolate as well as the brandy were of high quality and very tasty...

I ordered these very close to the holiday and they arrived earlier than expected!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drying Paint would be Preferable","review":"I wanted to like this film, I really did, but it was the slowest moving film I've ever seen. Potentially a good story, it was spoiled by poverty-stricken dialogue, long pauses and a lack of action. Charley fell in love with Eban but it was impossible to figure out why - Eban had a black hole where his personality should have been and \\"scintillate\\" was clearly not a word in his vocabulary. Most gay teachers are quite charismatic; not Eban! Could do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER![...]","review":"I have NEVER seen a movie so poorly written, so basic in it's storyline, and with such hideous acting. If I actually believed that the actors could read I would say that someone was holding up que cards for them throughout the entire movie, that's how poor their \\"acting\\" was. I read somewhere that the creator of this piece of trash found one of the main \\"actors\\" sitting on a park bench and offered him the part. I think that it may be the only way that the creator of this movie can get dates; 'hey guy wanna be in a movie, I'll make you a STAR!'.I don't want to spoil anything for anyone that will watch this movie so I won't mention any scenes but I do suggest that someone, if only one person, trust my opinion and not bother to waste their time with this movie.I almost forgot to mention that after watching this movie, waiting for it to get better (it did when it was finally over), I took the case and dvd and threw it into the fireplace. Burning this movie gave me much enjoyment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase this movie","review":"This movie is very quirky but have to agree w/ other reviewers on the content of the movie. This is a movie about a serial child molester and not the tender love story the case and some reviews I have read made it out to be. This is not gay cinema and plays more like a NAMBLA fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of slow moving... found it a bit creepy","review":"Just a very slow moving film..... thought it would be better than it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting , different gay film","review":"I really enjoyed this film. It's about consentual love between two males. I know it is not everyones type of film. Some folks I know are upset about the age difference, like maybe 30 years ago the same was said about a black/white relationship. Charley is not forced into a relationship and is a 15 year old that makes up his own mind. It's a small indie film, character driven. That's nice after so many razzle dazzle special effects films. A welcome edition to my dvd collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you all thinking?","review":"I tell you what, this was not what I was expecting and at 22$+ I am less than satisfied. Who wrote the reviews, the film makers? While the story line wasn't a complete loss, the acting and method in which the film was brought to life needed some serious help. I don't know what I expected, but I know it was more than I got. Rent it, save yourself the headache, I have a copy for sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing conventional here","review":"This was a pretty good movie. The plot was excellent. And it's nice to see something that doesn't fit into any existing mold. The part of the 15 year old was perfectly casted & acted. The 29 year old was not well casted nor acted- thus the 4 stars. He was unattractive, soft-spoken and weird. If you are looking for nudity skip this one, there's not much. Worth watching overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy something else!!","review":"Cinematography: This movie looks like it was shot on a home video camera. Acting: I've seen better acting in a 1st grade play. Story: With more work and effort the concept may have worked but as it stands, poor at best. I pruchased this video because I made the mistake of only reading 1 review... which happens to have been the only person who liked this movie. I disliked this movie so much that I actually logged on after watching about 3/4 of the movie to write this review. Save your money for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I almost bought it...almost","review":"I almost bought the plot, but I couldn't help noticing how ugly Eban was. He screams creepy with his trashy unshaven face and tingle in his voice. Charley was certainly cute, but he was also 15. This is a very hard movie to produce in America with all the laws and stuff, and really just needs a better Eban. Not really worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST","review":"This is one of the best films , well shot good acting i just did not want it to end ,just go out and buy it, its the best film for me this year ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For Everyone","review":"A remarkable film, especially in the current environment of sex abuse in the Roman Catholic Church. Both actors are extremely naturalistic and most convincing. Eban is not especially attractive, but he obviously is attractive psychologically to teen-age boys. This is not pedophilia, however, as Eban's father mistakenly calls him.The film may be too much for many, too harrowing for some. But it is riveting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"\\"Eban and Charley\\" tries to deal with a problem of paedophilia. The result is rather creepy.While watching it, I kept feeling uncomfortable. There were moments where I could clearly see that the people behind the project were trying to justify this deviation.As some reviewers noticed, the choice of main character - the pervert - was a mistake. It's hard to believe that anybody could be attracted to this man (I know, it's not his fault, but...). Moreover, his acting is odd.There are holes in the scenario and they make the whole story less probable to happen.The only positive aspect of this film is the young actor who portrays Charley. As far as I am concerned he is the best of all crew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the main song? DUH!!!!","review":"Okay so where did the main song go???? do not buy the soundtrack people just a waste of money the song that Eban singed to Charley isn't included in the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paperback scan is of little value","review":"I purchased this USGS publication thinking it was going to be a reprint or reproduction. It is a poor quality black and white scan. This makes the color figures in the original publication undecipherable and worthless. Also, the color plates included in the back pocket of the original publication were not scanned, further lowering the value of this product. Other publishers make this publication available as a CD in color for less money. Shop around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to Break-up By!","review":"Compared to other volumes in the ultralounge series, \\"Crime Scene\\" provides some of the more professional, serious music. If you've heard the other ultralounge CDs, you know what I mean. There are a lot of wacky, kitschy, campy, simply funny songs in this series, while this CD is relatively serious, with contributions by names from beyond lounge music, like Count Basie, Vicki Carr and Nelson Riddle; many pieces feel like solid jazz rather than lounge.I was slow to order this CD because, given the title, I thought it would be excessively macho, harsh and dark. It's not. It's brassy and bold. One contribution is entitled \\"Music to be Murdered By,\\" but the CD feels vibrant and vital. I think a good subtitle might be \\"Music to Break-up By,\\" because it conveys a swagger and affirmative air."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of nostalgia","review":"It's fun hearing all the old theme songs from crime shows of the past.

However I was disappointed.After the second level I just stoped playing. Not to ruin it for someone interested in buying it still, but you just go on these dumb missions where you chase after a weak machine called an A.R.K. It's pretty cool to be flying over skyscrapers and underneath the city chasing these things at Fast and The Furious type speeds, but it starts to make me feel like I'm watching a dog chase a frisbee. If that makes any sense, I don't know. That's just the way I feel.Whoever made this game didn't put much thought into it, so as a consumer don't put much thought into investing your hard to earn cash on it.

It presents everything from an overview of white and black box testing methods to improving cross domain apps that utilize remoting.

After this they released a remixes and lost songs albums but none of it matched the virtuosity found here. This album is decidedly down-paced from previous efforts by this amazingly talented and highly underrated band. The technicality of the riffs has gone up noticeably and speed has been replaced with a dark eerie moodiness and more of a groove-oriented feel. Search on YouTube to see a handful of people playing these riffs to get an idea of the sheer technical complexity to the songs, namely odd-meters and lots of syncopated rhythms. Fans of the previous albums won't be disappointed as the solos are simply home-runs on this album, most notably the one from \\"Internal Conflicts\\" which is arguably his best ever. Recommended for all fans of Corner or technical thrash metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is actually worth 10 or 11 stars","review":"I am tempted to write several reviews, all giving this album 5 stars because I simply must convince you how much you need to buy this. I originally had this on tape and I listened to it so many times that it became so warbly I was forced to buy the CD. This album has gotten me through so many hard times, long drives, flight layovers and bad relationships, that I cannot express it in the maximum of 1,000 words. I will simply leave you with this: I cannot think of a single person who /wouldn't/ love this CD. Buy it!

It has NO aftertaste and I have enjoyed it in my coffee and cereal. I got a shock today. I went to purchase if from Raley's--not there. I went to two Save Mart stores, and Safeway--gone. No one is carrying this any more. They have some substitute crap in its' place. I will not stock up from this site. If you wants yours, you had better find it and get it QUICK! I don't know why the stores stopped carrying it, other than to carry their own brand, or a wanna be substitute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for newborns","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who commented that directions would be helpful and should be included, but it doesn't take a degree in rocket science to figure out how to \\"install\\" the headrest. Once hooked in, it stays in place and I have never had to re-adjust it. You must put both headrests in to secure it for a newborn's head.The headrest is great ... it keeps my newborn son's head stationary & from rolling around in his infant seat. Our infant seat goes in the car and in a jogging stroller and I've had success with both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. We used a blanket instead.","review":"We took this back before our baby was even born. It seemed very flimsy and it seemed to shift even before we put our baby in it.

My daughter weighed 9.5 lbs when she was born, we were in the parking lot of the hospital having to take the inner pillow out, because she couldn't fit in it.

That happened twice and it was gone. Plus she looked more comfortable without it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont' waste your money","review":"I bought this for my son's baby car seat because I would find him with his head bobbed to the side when I checked on him. It looked very uncomfortable. Hoping that this would solve the problem I bought this item. I have to say that it is a waste of money. There are no instructions in the package, thankfully it's easy to figure out. I installed it both as a single and also as a double and neither variation supported my sons head properly. I would still find him with his head bobbed to the side and looking uncomfortable. If I had the packaging I would return it. I will try it as he gets a bit older and see if it works better.

This book is an extremely difficult one to read. It is very complex with deep concentrated reading necessary in order to comprehend half of what is being presented. The flow of the book is extremely poor, constatnly jumping around from one topic to another without any decent segues. The case studies presented are extremely outdated and do not help much in understanding the topics being discussed. They are not explained well enough to show the relevance of the case study, and they are not tied into the discussion and used effectively at all.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND","review":"When a friend loaned me a copy of this first in the series, our then 3 1/2 yos was not communicating or initiating conversation. When my son watched it the first time, he got off the couch, went to the tv and (copying what a child did in the video) he pointed to the TV, and SAID, \\"What's this?\\" then said, \\"it's a tv\\". I could have cried hearing that from him. This video caused my son to parrot the things he heard, but not just parrot, but to apply everything he saw to real life and in the right context. Our son went from a seemingly low functioning non-verbal, to a very high-functioning child who is mainstreamed and doing beautifully. We now have an almost 2 yo who is so far non-verbal. And unfortunately misplaced our volume 1, and i need a new one, because i know this video works. He enjoys watching the other volumes. I highly recommend volume one as being a vital place to start.

The infant seat that they gave me for my son did not com with a headrest. I had bought to others form different makers and he hated it. I even tried the rolled up blanket and he would move his head and arms until he was able to drop them. In my case I used the larger headrest for the car seat. He is still able to move his head which is what he likes with out letting him bend over into a ball.If you have a fussy baby and you have tried everything try this and see if it works for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well for newborns","review":"This double headrest really works well for newborns. You do have to use both headrest for it to work, but that's not a problem.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"This book is written well enough and it's interesting enough, it's just not what the cover says it will be. It's not about Tolkien's and Lewis' relationship. It's a side by side mini-biography of both them, but there's very little about their actual friendship. I've read bios of both of them and I was really excited to focus on their relationship, but this book doesn't do it. I feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"cloying","review":"The book is over-long, and in many stretches is painful to wade through if, like myself, one is not an evangelical Christian. The author's sympathy w/ Lewis' view of Christianity came across to me as cloying, fawning. I read this primarily to gain an understanding of Tolkien's antipathy toward Lewis' Narnia books. This author merely paraphrased Tolkien's words, w/o further explication. It was my impression that this author simply did not understand Tolkien's objections/was mystified that anyone could come to Tolkien's conclusions. Others clearly appreciate this author's efforts; I got very little out of it, though I stuck it out to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"plant pathology book","review":"i'm an agronomist work in fields with agricultural company work in buyer of seeds,pesticides,fertilizers,and another agricultural materials companies. then i need a color plant pathology book associate with color pictures that help me to deseases symptoms.thank you too much....Feras Al-Karmy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay if you like that slimey feel ... does not sink in","review":"I don't care for creams which sit on top and just slime.

My lay person estimation of the amount of calendula in this cream has to be skimpy. Calendula is a known itch killer yet this product produced not relief for psoriasis in terms of itch relief or reducing redness.The product leaves a greasy coating on the skin which transfers to clothing or bedding. It doesn't seem to absorb into the skin as other creams do.

When I opened the jar I could tell this cream was extremely high quality. It doesn't have the appearance or consistency of \\"commercial\\" creams and when you apply it, it absorbs into my skin so smoothly. It is the middle of a Minnesota winter and my face and hands feel very soft and moisturized. The calendula is soothing and the oils are blended for the smoothest application. It is more of a heavy overnight cream and I would be hesitant to put it on under my makeup during the day, but it is perfect for overnight. It seems too heavy to put around my eyes, but it works well on the rest of my face, neck, and hands. I'm sure it would work well on any area, though.

I've been to Lopez Island once (never to the farm itself) and it's a gorgeous place full of friendly people.I wish the container traveled better!

Stated in the most simplistic manner, metrosexuality is no more than a polite man who understands how to dress and appreciates the finer things in life. In a nutshell, a metrosexual is what used to be known as a gentleman. The term gentleman may not be politically correct or interesting enough to sell books in a day when the new straight is gay. So to sell this lifestyle book, the author has capitalized on the latest social trend.In general this is a hip and fun book. I'd recommend it for the young man whose upbringing didn't include, for example, exposure to manners, tipping, wine selection, or dress. In general, this is a \`how to' lifestyle guide for dummies. It isn't a serious guide to style. So, if you are serious there are far better style books or magazines to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful, but...","review":"This book is full of useful advice, but do not mistake it for instruction on how to become a gentleman. Despite what one would think, I have come to appreciate this term \\"Metrosexual\\" as it distinguishes those who use manners and the appearance of urbane sophistication for their own self-advancement from true gentlemen. True gentlemen show respect for themselves and others, bringing the light of civilization to a darkening world, and leaving society better for their efforts. A gentleman's manners, urbanity and consideration are a lifestyle, not a mask that is donned for selfish convenience.Thus, if one is seeking to become a metrosexual, this book fits the bill. If one wants to be a gentleman, keep shopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guys, good manners help you get laid!","review":"If it were up to me, I'd make this book a mandatory read for all men! Gentlemen, to get your attention - you read this book, your chance of getting laid will increase by that much!!!And I'm not kidding, I'm speaking as a woman who's being on disastrous dates, where men didn't know how to dress or groom themselves, or how to eat properly, or how to read the vibe from their date. This little handbook will give you almost all the tips you need to know before going on a date. Of course it really covers more than JUST that, but I hardly think any man cares to improve themselves in anyway if that doesn't help with his chance of getting sex. The book touches on books, arts, music, grooming, dressing, romance and sex, etc.It's fun to read too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men's basics, not more","review":"This book is about basics, everybody should know.

Think of it as no more than a slightly updated version of another etiquette book. On principle, however, buy something else (like \\"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy: The Fab 5's Guide to Looking Better . . .\\") that isn't veiling 'basic etiquette' with a term that is intended to cash in on a reader's desire to feel cosmopolitan.It has useful information, but no more than any other etiquette books, and certainly isn't as comprehensive as others (such as the \\"How to Be a Gentleman\\" series).You'd be better off with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff - someone's idea of a stocking stuffer","review":"First of all, let me announce to the world that yes I am a metrosexual! It is a label to be worn proudly. You don't have to be a jock to enjoy sports and you don't have to be gay to enjoy clothes and taking care of yourself.This book though isn't particulary enlightening. It has been written by someone who has hung onto a new phrase but is clueless as to how to write well. Its advise is boring. The humour isn't funny, if anything it is a little bit smug.

It appears the quality of the materials and construction are just not the same as my Eddie Bauer mug.

Sam Fisher is now available to everyone for a fraction of the original price and man, you get more than your money's worth! Splinter Cell's graphics are beyond belief. All the detail is hand-drawn! You can count the hairs on Sam's head and you can see the stubble of his beard. The controls are easy as pie (if you've ever played Hitman 2, then you'll notice that the controls are almost the same). The camera movements are perfect. You can rotate it in any direction and not bother Sam at all. I could go on and on, but just read the other reviews if you don't believe me.

It will also get 30 additional minutes of cinematics, and a completely new four-minute intro with music performed by the Prague Orchestra. Ubi Soft also said they will support Dolby Pro Logic II sound, so anyone with a PLII sound setup will really appreciate this feature.

It takes a little bit of time to get used to the camera, but after that it will amaze you. One thing that I was disapointed in was the lack of a variety of guns. It is based on all stealth.

The storyline is interesting, but not terribly original. What is fun is watching the 'News' in the Splinter Cell world.The action in this game is similar to Metal Gear Solid 2. Even though this not as advanced as MGS2 as ar as character moves go, it still has plenty of cool moves. Guns are sparse, but you learn to love the ones you get.

The screen may be small, but it's beautiful, the keyboard is not as cramped as it should be for a computer of this size/weight and, by far the best part: it is incredibly light at 3.6 lbs. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5: the touchpad is a bit 'jumpy', though that can be fixed with methods found in online forums (I did and it now works well). The built-in wireless, like most, is fairly weak, but that can be taken care of with a 20 dollar wireless adapter.

Another great track is DJ Jeff's energetic \\"Change the Scratch,\\" where one sample (\\"To be a DJ/ you gotta be the best/have your own kinda stuff/not like the rest) is worked over and over again with multiple styles of scratching (Not like I know what they're called).

Side two is pretty decent as well. A band you need to explore, and why not start with this fabulous introduction to this legendary band.

The new tracks added to this album \\"Everybody Is A Star\\" and \\"Thank You Falettinme\\" were also monster hits. A lot of artists tried but couldn't duplicate this success. This album also pioneered Larry's thump & pop bass playing technique which was imitated by an infinite amount of bass players."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say","review":"That wasn't already covered by the previous reviewers but, I love this album and would recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"can black mothers raise our sons","review":"I thought this was a great book.So many mothers are forced to raise their children alone.I plan to give this book to every single mother i know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Functional","review":"This is a $4.00 device selling for 43 bucks. The frame is flimsy, and the \\"blade\\" is a joke. The \\"cutting edge\\" is nicely rounded over and painted, so as to assure it won't actually cut anything. Trying to tear off a piece of kraft paper with anything resembling a straight edge is an exercise in frustration. Amazon should decline to sell junk like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great time saver for gift wrapping","review":"This paper cutter can certainly be used for kraft paper and art paper.. but I bought mine for giftwrapping. I am so happy with it. It's relatively light weight without the roll of paper on it- but certainly sturdy enough for the pulling you have to do to tear the paper. If I had one complaint, it would be that I hoped for a slightly sharper cutting edge- this one relies on a good firm hold with one hand while tearing with the other. I used it all through this past Christmas season's wrapping and was so happy to not have to fool around with scissors! Hope to be using it many years from now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta have this!","review":"I've got this on LP in the states, but I no longer live in the states.

I don't mind offensive content in the least (many of my favorite series are extremely offensive). But this series seems to hold to the idea that offensiveness itself is somehow hilarious. Maybe that works if you're in Junior High, but for the rest of us, you need to actually add humor to it, _then_ it's hilarious. Didn't laugh once.And to add insult to injury, the animation is just ridiculously bad. I don't mean the ultra-simplistic art style - that I don't mind (and kind of like). I mean they do as little animating of the artwork as humanly possible (lazy), so it winds up looking like some paper puppet show an eight-year-old could do.Obviously, you could say the same of Shin-chan; but the difference is, they made Shin-chan funny enough to compensate. That just isn't the case here. It felt like listening to someone tell jokes at a party, and the guy telling the jokes obviously thinks he's hilarious as s***... but no one else is laughing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub: Great, Dub: Does not exist","review":"No seriously. I just pretend the dub never happened. The sub is great and the show is really funny, but the dubbed version is just TERRIBLE. Really terrible.

They screwed up not just the subbing (subtitling is not well done) but dubbing - the English cast and translation is horrid!They took what was a trashy show and threw it to the bottom of the gutter. There were more f-bombs in the 1st episode of the English translation than just about the whole original series. It lost is humor after 5 minutes. So sad.The original cast was 100 times better. I don't think the folks at funimation even speak the original language if this is how they translated the sub-titles. Pathetic.*sigh* Poor Panty, poor Stocking...poor Garterbelt!

When the main characters excrete profanities in English while the rest of the dialog is in Japanese -- it feels like they are just showing off, being cool. When you hear and endless stream of English profanities -- they are not being cool, they are simply base.I have no idea who the intended audience for this show in US is supposed to be. The characters are completely unrelatable -- bratty, inconsiderate, shallow, selfish and rude Angels with a typical over-inflated sense of entitlement. I really hate this show and regret this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such great voice acting and extras!!!","review":"I received my copy 2 weeks early from rightstuf.com. They really got the right people to voice the characters. Love all the extras that came with the dvd box set including a heaven coin & 8 extra short mini episodes that were weird with a mixture of gross to say the least. The dvd art along with the nice art on each dvd case along with the extras and the awesome job the VAs did with the voices made this box set worth the $38.99 for me.Watching the subtitled version so many times before this came out; I'm glad I can finally enjoy the episodes in english because of such excellent voice acting, which is very rare in anime.If you're a Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt fan get this set! it's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt: The Complete Series","review":"This series is one of the best shows I have ever seen.

HAS to be a great bluesman. The refreshing fact is that this album features Homesick, advancing in years, which you won't be able to tell by the music, as the featured artist, lending credence to the fact that he was, is and always will be a headliner in his own right. The highlights are \\"Mr. Pawnshop Man\\" and \\"Bein' with the One You Love,\\" stellar examples of solo playing. If one were to fish for a weakness in this otherwise glowing album, it would be that \\"Highway 51\\" tends to trail off towards the end.

I'll tell you one thing, you never realize just how many four letter words there are until you play this game and you are guessing but you can't score.It is a thinking game, and unless you are an English buff or just love words, it is a game that can have you stumped quite often."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun way to get kids thinking","review":"This game is terrific for kids. They love the dispenser and the resulting surprise of the letters each turn. It has turned out to be a fantastic way to get my son thinking and forming words quickly; something he has difficulty with usually. I gave one to his teacher and they use it in the third grade with great success, and fun, regularly.There are many ways to vary the game such as requiring a minimum number of letters in each word (for example,no three letter words).A great way to encourage children to make firends with language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"I'll be the first to admitt that I'm not a big word game person. However, I have friends that love the word games, so I make comprimises. I found this game was slow and boring.The game gives you a set of letters and the object is to shout out a word that starts and ends with the letters given for each round. I only played this game with 1 other person, and it may be more fun if you have a larger group. However, we were stumped on a lot of combinations and/or took quite a bit of time to anwser. This made the game very slow and not a barrel of laughs. I like to be entertained when playing a game, and especially a party game, and this to me was simply boring.Final Verdict: Probably a good teaching tool, but there are much better party games out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Game for Teachers","review":"I use this game in my language arts class with much success. It is excellent for vocabulary development and spelling. If there is a disagreement over a word, then my students will go to the dictionary - great reference skills practice! While I can see how much this game benefits my students, they are focused on how much fun they are having. If we have extra time or a special day, they will beg to play Smart Mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"cracked bottle","review":"Bottle was improperly packaged and arrived cracked on the top with shampoo oozing out. Part of the box was soaked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed, full of jargon, arrogant","review":"Contrary to the editorial reviews, this book is full of jargon, it's disjointed and superficial (probably partly due to its breadth), the concepts are poorly explained, and Bronner gives no concrete examples to illustrate the concepts. I have read approximately 40 books on critical theory. This is the worst I have read so far. Kellner, Held, Jay, and Geuss are far more accessible -- they write as if they and their audience share the same language and expectations. The book does have one redeeming quality: Bronner critically evaluates the logical coherence and contributions of various critical theorists in a manner that is not likely to be found in other works. But even for this, be prepared to strongly disagree with Bronner on any critical theorists you happen to have read beforehand."},{"rating":"1","title":"wide ranging, yes, but ultimately the work of a dilettante","review":"I found it rather odd that a work of real merit could spring from an author who has no familiarity with subject.

Second..the butterflies were not evenly spaced. Four of them were at almost the same level and bumping and the bottom one was four inches below the next one up. Poorly put together. I bought this one to see what they looked like before ordering any more. I won't be ordering any others due to the poor construction.

The cost was a few dollars more than when I ordered them directly and not through Amazon. My complaint is that the company sent me only one brief that had been removed from the Bali package of two so I ended up paying more than double for one brief. I called the company and customer service agreed that one package containing 2 briefs should have been sent. The Bali briefs are no longer available. I returned the brief and got a refund however my shipping cost of $5.99 was not refunded. Needless to say I am not happy with this company that sells products through Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Sun-tzu should be required reading for every high school student.

This game is fun, but it has it's issues. Worth playing, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and $$$","review":"I was expecting much more from this game based on the rep of castlevania. Unfortunately, this game did not even come close to my expectations. The enemies are replicated throughout the game, only they level up as you do. If they weren't hard in level 1, they won't be hard as a level 25 or 30. The replay value of this game is 0 because for the most part the storyline won't change based on certain actions you take."},{"rating":"1","title":"It starts out ok, but the last level is a whip to your face","review":"Castlevania has long been one of my favorite games, the original, the third one, super castlevania 4 on the snes, and finally their sgt. peppers, symphony of the night. This game drove me gradually insane throughout. They keep using the tired metroid formula (using your newly found abilities to access new areas of the game) which was introduced in 1985(!!!!!!!). The end is an equally punishingly old-school romp where they make you not only fight every enemy again but also give you some 4 stage end boss that just keeps regenerating itself (ugggggggggg). Can't they move on from this 20 year old game convention? The N64 games were more fresh than this, and everyone hates them. But this is rated as a step up somehow. Overall, the antiquated design and slow pacing put this game securely in it's coffin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not worth the money","review":"The one major problem that I have with this game is that it seems very short and small. Compared with the other games in the series, Curse of Darkness doesn't have as many secrets or hidden items to find. For example, you could spend months trying to acquire all the extra stuff in Symphony of the Night. And Lament of Innocence had hundreds of hidden items. I don't think that the replay value of this game is very high, and the gameplay controls (especially the camera angles) were not very smooth. I got the feeling that Konami rushed this game to get it to market. The storyline wasn't as interesting as previous games. Even when it is considered independently of the other series games, it just isn't all that great. I think that the money could be better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shipping - almost great gaming","review":"The shipping on this product was actually very fast and good, no complaints on that end. However, having come from Lament of Innocence, I felt very let down by certain key elements in this game. Movement felt a lot more sluggish, and the big thing that really eggs my opinion of this game is that some status effects are permanent unless you have a support minion - so if you are stunned and all the enemies are dead, consider restarting because I've waited 10 minutes for the main character to come out of it. I give it a four start rating mainly because the game as a whole is still worth playing in my opinion, and because the shipper did a really great job of getting this to me promptly. Just be sure that if you buy this game to look up online or in a manual how to get the best status protection or cures because otherwise this will be a very rough ride at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not and RPG","review":"I liked this game for the most part but think the \\"rpg\\" elements, combining and the buying and selling a bit much for a what is basically a good old fashioned hack and slash. The hacking and slashing was great and the bosses were a good challenge but picking up drops and finding weapon upgrades in a secret panel or chest etc. would have been better in my view. Graphics are nice and controls are tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but not great!!!!","review":"this game is just like any other of the castlevania franchise....the plot is way to simple and not intriging at all...your girlfriend gets killed by the bad guys and you want revenge....WOW!!!!!!!!!!

It was mach more fun on Nintendo. When I bought this game I expected it to be like the old ones I played, but it was not as near as fun as the 64 Games. The playstation 2 castlevania games have no direction at all. You just are lost and walk around forever. Theres nothing great about it.

The presentation is uneven and disorganized and over half of the examples do not work correctly. The author apparently used an early beta version of 10g - so the screen shots and directions do not correspond to the actual product; with patience one can follow the examples.

The examples don't work; on another page we are told that if you double click on a combo box that certain code will be generated. JDev doesn't generate the code.

The middle of this book lags: the story slows down perceptibly as the reader is given details of the medical profession and the state of medicine and wedding announcements and architecture and other aspects of the Victorian setting.

It was a little redundant in places, but overall an eye opening commentary on what can happen when society makes judgements based on race and class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did this book not win the Booker?","review":"Julian Barnes is a like a master fly fisherman telling a mesmerizing story about two Edwardian fellows simply named Arthur and George [there is a secret to be had here], while tantalizing the reader with dips, long casts, hints and feints until the fish - the reader - is snagged by the characters, the story line, the courage of conviction, the folly of human prejudice and the magnificant writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond poor shape","review":"I had read this book from the library...and found it to be perfect as a gift for my Grandfather.

Filthy pages and binding, the back cover cracked in half and random markings throughout...I guess this experience taught me a lesson. Buy new for gifts. I will say I received said product in a timely manner and the price was definitely right, but not sure I'll use this seller again.

Just the first story will be enough to remove any doubt he is a writer worth reading3)If you've read Barnes' \\"England England\\" and couldn't finish it, as I couldn't, don't worry - Barnes is back in excellent form.4)If none of the above apply, please refer to some of the at times touching reviews that follow just below."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sense of an Ending","review":"I selected this book because I loved The Sense of an Ending. Arthur and George needed major editing. It plods on forever. Finally at about 70% it started to pick up. It goes over and overthe same case. I'm going to finish it because after investing so much time, I would like to know how it plays out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable case study","review":"Those drawn to the subject of the book -- Sir Arthur Conan Doyle -- should not be misled into thinking this is a Sherlock Holmes crime study. Doyle and crime are central to this intriguing book, but more to the point is a sharply detailed study of Edwardian English life. Two men of very disparate backgrounds and temperments are thrown together by a miscarriage of justice and the attempt to put the matter right. Barnes is outstanding in his look at two middle-class English families and the effect that the series of bewildering crimes has on each. The pleasures are more in the characters and day-to-day life than in any brilliant case investigations."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARTHUR AND GEORGE","review":"TO MUCH DETAILS TO MAKE THE POINT. NOT WRITTEN SMOOTHLY, FELT LIKE IT WAS TRANSLATED FROM AN OTHER LANGUAGE. NOT FINISHED, ARTHUR AND GEORGE ARE JUST NOW MEETING."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you did not know about Sherlock Holmes","review":"When working on a jigsaw puzzle have you noticed how hard it is at the beginning of construction, it is unclear what the actual picture will turn into and as you approach the end the pieces fall into place quickly and clearly. This book is like that. Julian Barnes feeds you information on a \\"need to know\\" basis. All of sudden, you are illuminated!! Author is Sir Author Conan Dole, George is east indian...and little by little the pieces begin to fit and you are hitting yourself on the head thinking, \\"I should have known this...\\"Yes this is a book that resulted in \\"googling\\" for background information on the story and characters and I learned that it is the story of Sir Author and George Edalji told in increments.I did not read any reviews prior to reading this book--it was a Booker Prize winner and that was why I had downloaded a sample. The sample had me hooked.This is the second book I have read by Julian Barnes and so far he has not disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real pleasure","review":"Buy it. Read it. Enjoy it. A real pleasure for Mr. Barnes' fans, as well as anyone who's read and enjoyed Sherlock Holmes or any other of Conan Doyle's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great read","review":"I ordered this book from the library, and when it arrived I had forgotten what it was about. Therefore, I was well into the book before realizing that Arthur was Conan Doyle, and that the book was based on historical fact. It is so well written as a novel, that it would be unnecessary to know anything about the real figures in the book, but knowing a little makes the book even more rich and complex. I stayed up late reading about George's persecution and woke up the next day worried about him. My son got to watch a lot of TV today while I rushed to finish this book (I hope he doesn't read my reviews someday and realize he can get away with anything if I have a good enough book...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"FRS","review":"Julian Barnes is a great writer, but this story goes on & on...and to what end.

Within seconds you're drawn in and although I knew who Arthur was I did not know of the George Edalji case.Mr Barnes is such a skilful writer that it beggars belief. Any pretensions of becoming a writer yourself are quickly dispelled when you experience the masterly way this author uses the English language. Irrespective of the subject matter this author is a joy, and an instruction, to read. But here we have a fascinating and so-believable insight into the minutae that constitutes this miscarriage of justice; solved by the creator of the world's greatest detective.I really cannot praise this book highly enough, in fact I have bought a number of subsequent copies as gifts for friends and family and all have been as equally impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read, maybe a bit lopsided","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit, my first foray into Julian Barnes' territory. I must agree though with some earlier comments which suggest that George is the more interesting character, given short shrift by the author in favor of the larger, more blustery and more famous figure. I didn't always find the character of Arthur convincing and felt at time that Barnes was weighing the chapters too heavily with factual researched information of the period and the man. I also was left unmoved by the love affair, which I just didn't really give a hoot about -- I would have much rather Barnes delved more deeply into George's literal-minded and curious ways of behaving. Still, a pleasant and involving read. I could have happily read another hundred pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"HA!","review":"I'm sorry, I just had to say that was the funniest review I have read in a long time.

This album I've listened to a bit less, but they still rock. I had to write a review due to the previous reviewer who critized the vocals. D. Fairbanks has extremely distinguishable vocals which stand out in a sea of mundane efforts! In fact, his vocals are one of the primary reasons I love this band and I just can't imagine changing them! It'd be like Nirvana without Kurt, Wilco without Jeff, or Beck without Beck - it just wouldn't be Soulfood '76!!!! Most of the vocalist I've mentioned would never succeed in a band like Journey or on a TV show like American Idol, but these guys have unique voices which make them stand far ahead of any polished singer!!!!! In addition to the vocals, the music is absolutely first rate, great sound on the drums with a \\"retro\\" feel, great guitar riffs and great guitar tone with just enough \\"fuzz\\" and even the bass lines are memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm a disapointed fan","review":"i've seen soulfood live as many times as i've been to the dentist. let's face it, they rock with funkalicious domination.

First, the predrilled holes aren't right for me, so after trying to drill my own, and not doing a good job, I ordered another cotton strap that is actually adjustable. See my other reviews. Second, the other side is really tough to slide in and out of the scroll. But, if you just have to look good, this is the one to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice basic strap","review":"This isn't an overly fancy strap, but it's wonderfully utilitarian.

I really should have smelled directly from the bottle before spraying it on my skin. It is HORRIBLE. White floral scents are generally not my thing, but I can usually tolerate them. This was the worst perfume I ever smelled. It's way too powdery and it smells so cheap. I was stuck with it on my wrist all day and it kept making me sneeze. Disgusting. Not worth the money at all.

It's heavily layered with Australian actors and I enjoy seeing the mix of fresh faces to the screen.The premise of a rouge US President causing a nuclear exchange while a US sub commander questions his oddly routed instructions to fire is an interesting twist. The questioning of orders gets the captain called a traitor and brings his sub under fire from other US forces. Hence a cat and mouse game of survival between the US sub commander and opposing US political/military forces. The high-stakes are increased by Russian and Chinese involvement.I like this series.

This is a very big problem with ABC, and it is also one which makes me wish Amazon wouldn't even carry their shows since there's nothing like owning a show that is getting cancelled before it even gets started, Overall, this is a 5 star show, but considering they are just going to throw together a lame duck ending at the end of season 1 if we're lucky, it gets 1 star and this is the last ABC show I will be purchasing.

In this episode we take action drama, adrenaline, guy show and cuddle it a little, make some very feminine slow, shocking day time soap opera drama. Maybe to attract more women? I am not sure, whatever it is, if you follow this with the same kind of trash, you will likely tank this series very quickly. It's as if the writers took a break and the overly effeminate romance novel day dreaming secretary got to change the pace and twists in the show.

One has Pele attempting to lob the keeper from beyond the halfway line. He misses the post by inches.The other is an unreal dummy he sells the keeper that also results in an oh-so-close miss. This move is pure genius and you'll be replaying it over and over.Anyway, this video just oozes with incredible skill and flair of those great Brazil sides (mainly the creme de la creme 1970 side and the unlucky 1982 one).

Secondly given a sequence of Hebrew consonants there is room for interpretation meaning they can get many words from the same sequence of letters. Given such a huge playing field and a computer they can find what they want. I could go on but this book isn't worth it. The only other thing to say is that it is quite boring, many examples over and over with the same emotional padding to explain them. It's a bit like a tabloid article that is drawn out.

There is more here than coincidence, and the more I read, the more I became convinced that a pattern has been discovered that defies a random-based explanation.

You'll have to look elsewhere for reasoned debate.Are the Codes true? I have no idea.

Most of the examples utilize foreign words, such as English, transliterated into the hebrew. Because there is no fixed rule for such transliterations, these codes are complete garbage. By adjusting the Hebrew spelling to suit, one could find a code. The Rabin will be murdered code (the word Rezach means murder) is entirely in hebrew, but I didn't see any statistical or other mathematical treatments to demonstrate that this is not the result of chance.

They worked great for a few months and then both stopped working for no apparent reason. Too bad because they were very convenient and helped put an end to people leaving the lights on when not needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"This product worked in our closet intermittently for 3 days, then it completely stopped sensing motion at all. If the switch is on, the light is on. If the switch is off, the light is off.Terrible product experience. I'd suggest avoiding this one completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for only 2 days.","review":"Ordered the item from Home and Beyond through amazon.com. Only worked with incandescent bulb. Might work with fluorescent bulb greater than 25W, but could not try because it broke after two days. Sent two RMA requests, did not receive any response from Home and Beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after a few days, DOES NOT work with CFLs","review":"The product was problematic at first because it doesn't work with Compact Flourescent Lights, which is all I have in my home. But the one star review is because when I did put a regular bulb in it, it died after just 2 days and I had to return it. For the two days it did work it was fine - a slight delay before it would recognize the motion but was useable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit just stays on","review":"The unit stays on and never shuts off. I mounted in an uncover ceiling light in the basement. Quality control lacking.

I took it to the music store to get tuned and they said it was very cheaply made and only to be used as a toy not for lessons. They tuned it as well as they could but it doesn't stay tuned... have to keep tightening the strings over and ove. It doesn't sound good at all....Also, the case busted open at the seams on the bottom when we zipped it up!

Having discussed several issues with him I can tell you that he is prone to making wild accusations and unsubstantiated claims. In addition, when faced with verified facts he merely ignores them if they do not support his position.Straw Man is not a tome that is to be trusted. No matter how interesting you might find the book, the author is comfortable with lies, deflection and subterfuge. A boulder of salt is required when Vaughn A. Carney is involved.Sadly, Amazon requires one star or I could give this book what it deservesSadly, this is a book destroyed by the lack of character of the author. Save your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal Cruelty involved, negative 100 stars","review":"I did not like this movie, it was very long and went through too much to make its point. My biggest dislike was the fact that dog fighting was not only a part, it was treated as being condoned and animal cruelty in any form is wrong. Why animal rights' groups like PETA are not in full force codemning work like this is beyond me, but to use animal cruelty and abuse as a vehicle to tell a story is wrong, unethical and uncompassionate. I would buy all copies in order to destroy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick, violent and twisted","review":"A graphicly violent and bloody film about professional dog fighting. It seems obvious that animals were tortured and killed in the filming of this movie. I was so sickened by its' offensive content that I couldn't watch it all. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Brain ...!","review":"Judging by the great reviews and all the awards this film has won, I thought I was in for a treat. I got a trick instead.No deep message, no entertainment value, no thrilling scenery or sets or artistic performances -- what's left?A bleak, dreary view of thugs, crooks, cheats and low-lifes in Mexico. If you revere the hard-work ethic, high standards, moral judgement and responsibility, you'll probably be disgusted by this movie.What's truly frightening is how many critics and film festivals have named this \\"Best Film\\". Society's in real trouble if this is the highest form of motion picture art that we can attain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walked Out","review":"I went to see this at the movies and walked out before the half point. Maybe I'm to conservative, but this movie is not to far off from a porno flick. Adding on to that it was just to bloody for me. I know people who loved it but for me it just showed way to much sexuality. This is a Rate R film that you shouldnt let kids see for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amores Perros","review":"I'm not sure of what I was expecting, but the movie was ok. It was in Spanish with English sub titles. I missed some of the movie because I was reading the sub titles. It would have been nice if you had a choice to hear it in English. The movie was a little hard for me to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"The CD was Damaged I had to return it.","review":"I couldn't make the DVD to work either in my DVD appliance or my computer.

Since it was made in Mexico, so there would be no animal right fanatics protested or complained about the cruelty of the dog fights. It's dark, hopeless, very noir movie. My, realistic life in Mexico is just so misery, desparate and hopeless. I Kinda like this movie a lot. But think it twice, I won't try to watch it twice, 'cause it's very dark and suffocating."},{"rating":"2","title":"best mexican film ever!","review":"amores perros is the best foreign film i've ever seen with an excelent storyline that will keep you out of your seat since the very beginning. I am excited this a mexican film it can show what we can do, it shouldn't all be about american films there's great latino director's out there that don't give the \\"stereotype latino roles\\".

Each of the characters is wallowing in their own troubles so much that they don't see the troubles they cause for themselves.That being said, did I enjoy it? Yes absolutely. While the images are extremely graphic, the stories make it worthwhile.Also as a side note, this DVD has several extras (featurettes, music videos, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A dinamic Treat!","review":"This film wont let your eyes go. Its movement, and an almost surreal sensibility, that juxtapose the contrast of its characters against settings that are most unexpected. Amazingly real at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAW , ELECTRYFYING, BLOODY, GUTSY, BEST FILM OF THE YEAR","review":"THIS MOVIE IS GREAT. ITS AWSOME.

GRACIAS A TODOS LOS CABRONES QUE ACTUARON EN AMORES PERROS LOS AMO MUNCHO >>>>>"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well executed drama of intersecting storylines","review":"The way this film is done, you're introduced to 4 separate stories: a man who lusts for his brother's wife, a kid's life dog-fighting, a homeless man life-story, and the story of model. All of these stories are braided together throughout the film in interesting ways. None, of them are too happy -- but the movie is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD version is not the same as theatrical release???","review":"I loved the move when I saw it in a theater, but the dvd seems to lack some of the scenes. For example, there is no scene showing the song La Cumbia Del Garrote. If you have a soundtrack, you'll see this title on the list. Try listening to it and than try finding it in the dvd version. I couldn't find it. Is this just me? Has anyone esle seen both versions of the movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M OBVIOUSLY IN THE MINORITY, but I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THIS MOVIE.","review":"I do like dogs. I do not like Dog fighting. But that's not why I don't like this movie. I recognize life outside of where I live is Different in many ways; culturally, socially, Economically. I can accept ALMOST anything, if well done, or provokes thought or teaches or is just plain pleasing or entertaining or amusing or presents a reason to pay attention. This one is ugly and was a waste of time. The movie consists of three stories and only the third showed me anything, and not much there. I really didn't like the other two. Lo siento.I got the movie as a result of an opinion from a good friend and the rave reviews. Lo siento ultra vez. I know this is a very early venture for this director and he went on to do acclaimed work (I really liked Babel). It doesn't even work as an art/indy film for me.It is difficult for me to conceive how anyone could say this is their favorite movie. Now, that provokes thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"***Outstanding, but very violent***","review":"This film is Iñárritu's most outstanding work. However, viewers should be aware that it may be very violent and disturbing for animal lovers. I am a dog lover and found many of the scenes to be gruesome. With that being said, one must view the film considering various cultural aspects. While I suspect the film's claim that no dogs were harmed in making the film is not entirely true, from a creative film-making standpoint it is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent and sad","review":"I liked the acting but this was very violent and tough. I can't recommend it to people."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what?","review":"This may be \\"how Mexico really is,\\" but its not a good movie. After reading all the great reviews I was expecting much more. But like 21 Grams, it is just a movie about people you don't really care about because you don't get to know them well enough. You feel like a voyeur on other people's miserable lives and you never get inside their heads enough to really care. Its like watching a sit com, just splashed all over a big screen. There is too much violence without a point. The acting is good but the stories are blah, especially the middle one, and the themes are not developed very well. Its too much \\"film-making\\" without anough story. The style doesn't hook into the story and there is very little emotion generated. I simply didn't care, and I would never want to see it again.Y tu mama tambien is much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amores Perros","review":"Although the underlining plot of this movie is intriguing. The movie is extremely violent and uses language that is beyond inappropriate. I just don't see any reason to expose myself to something this cruel and had to leave before the movie was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Brutal, long, drawn out waste of time!","review":"This movie was gory, vulgar and offensive on every single level imaginable. It was uncomfortable and unsettling to watch. The plus side is that the characters are developed well. You find yourself really caring what will happen to them & this is the catch that keeps you from turning it off completely. But the ending was beyond dumb and made me disappointed that they didn't just give the money to poor people in Mexico instead of making this brutal, long junk! You are going to wish you could get 153 minutes of your life back after waisting your time viewing this dross."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amores Perros","review":"Bleak and brutal, Iñárritu's \\"Perros\\"--literally, \\"Love's a bitch\\"--takes Tarantino up a notch with a story of crime, betrayal, and abuse set in the rough-and-tumble slums and posh, sanitized condos of Mexico City. Filmed in grainy light to accentuate the hard edges of the story's interconnected plots, \\"Perros\\" is at once jolting and unsettling, opening with a tour-de-force car chase that not only rivals \\"The French Connection,\\" but sets in place the tone and sense of desperation embodied in the film's other theme: the anguished nature of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, almost-perfect","review":"PERFECT: the original and compelling characters, brilliant cast, interwoven plotlines, great dialogue, masterful film editing and camera work, the irresistible charging-bull energy and momentum throughout most of the film (this energy reminded me of Martin Scorsese's \\"Goodfellas\\").ALMOST-PERFECT: the middle sequence, about the perfume model and her married lover, drags on and on. Thankfully, this is the only part of the film that was a bit slow and belaboured.Incredibly fresh, one of the best films of the last 10 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"No English audio track","review":"Beware, that this DVD does not have English audio track despite its Amazon description. This is an outstanding movie, but Amazon has wrong data and issued a full refund for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me!","review":"Ugh. Guess I hadn't read enough about this movie. It's definitely not for me. In fact I walked out after 30 minutes. If you like dogs and babies and don't really enjoy watching bad things happen to them, you might not like this either. I do think it was well done, and it's very intense -- just not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"big fan of movies that depic cultural realities","review":"Amores perros is a movie that depicts a specific (3) story of typical lives of society in Mexico city. I really like these movies that will conserve through time the culture that is hard to describe in other arts.must watch for those who love to understand this culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price, good movie","review":"We had been looking for this movie for a while and well the price was good and delivered on time. I recommend the movie and purchasing with amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"good film but not as good as CITY of GOD","review":"i bought this dvd after reading all the reviews it was ok it had its intresting points and twists of fate. but i thought some of the stories lacked depth. it is one of those plots that shows the ending and then you piece togther the beggining much like momento or city of god. which was a far better film in its developement of characters and content. it is a movie worth watching but if i had a choice i would go with \\"City of God\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Weekend Read","review":"A great book to read on a rainy weekend stuck inside. The storyline for the most part was a good one. I just was a little disappointed that Max & Jamie was not included in this one like the rest of the FULL series. And what Happened with Dee Dee and her nutty assistant.Still worth reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unbelievable","review":"If you are reading this book as an individual book, then it's okay I guess. If you are reading this book because it's supposedly in the series about Max and Jamie Holt, then don't waste your time. This book was absolutely ridiculous and completely unbelievable. I mean, really, two people who meet because a killer is coming to harm his old girlfriend fall in love, have sex and decide to get married in the span of 2 or 3 days? Come on now! And where the heck are Max and Jamie????? Isn't this series supposed to be about them?!?! They are trying to have a baby, but there is next to nothing in this book about them. I am VERY disappointed in the 5th and 6th books in this series. Full Bloom had little to do with Jamie and Max. Full Scoop has nothing to do with them. If Evanovich doesn't bring back the true characters in this series, then I'll not continue reading it.Overall, this book was silly and ridiculous. Completely unbelievable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute.","review":"This is a cute story line with a hint of suspense.

Sadly not the case. It took tenacity, if not OCD, to finish it. The characters are poorly developed, the plot smacks of artificiality. Overall, I felt it to be a romance novel posing as a mystery, with mediocre writing to boot.My impression is Janet Evanovich's role is only to make the book more marketable. She could not possibly have played a major part in its creation! So who is Charlotte Hughes to pull this off?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Janet write this?","review":"I really enjoy book series' -- that familiarity of characters and such. However, this book seemed a little disjointed and there were times I had to reread a few paragraphs because the flow was just not there. I have to say after reading nearly all of Janet Evanovich's books (including her romance titles from years past), this book did not seem consistent with her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"cure for insomnia","review":"I am a fan of Janet Evanovich's writing but this collaboration was one of the most boring books I almost read. I felt as though it was written by rote to meet a deadline. Definately give this one a pass, as for it being \\"brain candy\\" it's definately the discount bags of candy no one ever buys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely One Star","review":"I listened to the audiobook of Full Scoop and was bored within the first 20 minutes. It was very predictable and the main characters did not have any chemistry. I have enjoyed some of her other romance books, including her Stephanie Plum series, but this one was a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations. This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series.
