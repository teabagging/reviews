I know people say chipmunks may not live when relocating them because they lose their food stored in their tunnels, but I believe it is better than flat out killing them.

Unfortunately, the quality of Havahart products has declined over the years, so if you want to catch more than one critter, better buy several.Today, the 0745 trap I bought 4 months ago became useless when the clip that locks the door shut after a rodent has tripped it simply snapped off, rendering it useless.I don't mind having to bend Havahart's highly-effective mousetraps into shape when they arrive.

I haven't caught the rat yet, but I have caught 1 chipmunk, and 4 squirrels (or maybe 1 squirrel four times, they're curious but apparently not very bright) in two days. The trap works well - I didn't have to modify it like some reviewers had to do. It's a good design, and sensitive enough that even the chipmunk's weight tripped it. The solid top plate reduces your chance of getting bitten by the inmates, too. The rat's days are numbered..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well After Some Modification","review":"This device works like a charm once you get it tuned. The trigger plate's rod was a bit too long and it took too much force to trigger the trap. After I filed the rod down a bit, a chipmunk's sneeze was enough to spring the trap and I've been able to catch 2 -3 critters a day. I live in a high chimpmunk zone, so I'm ordering another trap.One other thing: squirrels tend to like the same bait as chipmunks, so I've caught a few of those too. These guys are capable of bending the door lock, so be prepared to have to bend it back (a long screwdriver works) before you can release the squirrel. Also, one chipmunk was smart enough to roll the trap in order to shake the bait loose. A heavy rock or tent stakes solved that problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely unbelievable","review":"Tried all kinds of traps, nothing worked for these tiny chipmunks.

Since then, I either find the bait gone, door down, no chippie, or I find the bait gone, no door down.I think this trap is not good for heavy work - lots of chippies. Chipmunks are very smart and resourceful and figure it out.

As such, his academic approach seams to be very well designed to take you from the beginnings of Bossa Nova, into the more complex rhythms in a logical, progressive manner. My impression is that he is well familiar with the learning process and knows how to nurture it. He uses tablature, which on the one hand tends to tolerate the aweful illiteracy we find in so many guitarists, but on the other hand I guess if you want to sell guitar books, you have to include that majority of guitar players who are unable to read music. I recommend this book to my guitar students as a great latin resource, even though I wish educators would stop catering to illiteracy by using tabs; it's like making ebonics an official language so ghetto kids don't have to learn real English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow","review":"This study guide is easy to follow and gives you plenty of practice.

So I was rather surprised that it really filled in all the blanks left by the text book. This is a study guide. It is not a replacement. What it helps with most for me (so far) is sentence structure and ways to practice ASL. I wouldn't really recommend one book without the other. It has really helped improve my retention of this language.The study guide, like the main text is spiral bound and lays flat. The drawings are the same used in the main text. Drawings can be hard to follow at times, but these are pretty good. Keep in mind internet wasn't really available when this book was written. I use free online ASL dictionaries to help illustrate the signs so I can really get them right, instead of just relying on the drawings. BUT those dictionaries alone won't teach you the language any more than Webster's will teach you English. So you need all three resources in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely helpful","review":"It's definately a help in getting the grammar correct.

No climbing enthusiast's library should be without this book. The photograph of Rebuffat which graces the cover of this book is alone worth the price of the book.Rebuffat is positively poetic in his description of various climbs. The reader almost feels as if one were as one with the mountain. A purist, the author climbed not for the glory of it, but for the sheer joy of the brotherhood of the rope.

I did try a test by filling the inside with water and does leak out very slowly (but can it leak in?). It is wider than a 9\\" springform (about 11\\" outside diameter) and the ceramic base is on the heavy side (it is thick ceramic).UPDATE: It is definitely not water tight (one cheesecake down the drain).

Too much footage of kids jumping around (\\"dancing\\").This could have been so much better if they had simply pieced together upbeat musical muppet segments from everyday episodes. We are much more entertained by the wit and energy of the daily musical segments on any given Sesame Street episode. We want to see singing pigs, dancing monsters, horn-playing muppets, guest singers... you know what I mean if you watch the show.Skip this video. It's lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring; too little action and interaction; no age likes it","review":"We usually love Sesame Street and the title and description of this video made it impossible to pass up. We do not own or watch many videos, but this looked so good! It was such a disappointment. Our toddler daughter lost interest immediately. The only song that was fun (and now the only one we play) is the \\"Birthday\\" one; the animal noises in this one are fun for a younger toddler age group. The video is condusive to nearly NO interaction with the live audience (the dances and songs are boring), and it is too chatty (and the conversation is boring). Sad. It had such potential!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"There are so many things that I do not like about this video, BUT, I have a child with Autism and this helped her put multiple steps together and increased her vocabulary.I put it in and go to the other room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this for my granddaughter based on so many glowing reviews. I found it to be boring, the DVD skipped and fragmented. As someone who studied dance for many years, this was a very misleading title and more like gymnastics than dance. I'm sorry I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"My 2 year old daughter loves to dance along to this DVD. She has the routine of the first dance memorized, and it's so cute to watch her do the dances. It's a great way to get your child to exercize, and stay entertained. Usually, she gets sick of these DVD's rather quickly, but she's watched this one about a hundred times, and still loves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dance Teacher- annoying","review":"We have a couple other musical Sesame Street DVDs & Videos- I have a really hard time watching this one, and my 19 month old daughter doesn't pay much attention to it (and she loves to dance along to most anything)... The \\"Dance Teacher\\" is rather annoying & doesn't have a good singing voice. The scenes without the teacher are OK- where there is dancing & singing with other people. I wouldn't recommend this DVD- there are better choices out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"very out of date","review":"Quite disappointed in how old this video is.

Now that my 3rd is getting into the Sesame Street age, she loved it to wearing it out, so I had to get the DVD. I hum these little songs along with her for hours afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not worth the money","review":"My 19 month old son loves Barney and sits through full hours of Barney. I don't think I got more than 5 minutes from this tape. I wasn't even entertained. I lost interest myself and I'm an adult. It was cute and had it's moments but I wouldn't say it was worth the full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly dull and annoying","review":"My son owns quite a few Sesame St DVDs but this is by far the worst one. The dance teacher is dreadful - she has a terrible singing voice, and her speaking voice is pretty annoying too. The plot is very dull and most of the action takes place in a dance studio/classroom. Mostly it shows children, not much of the muppets. The dances themselves don't have interesting moves, and the songs are not at all memorable for their tune or their words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find items are always available on Amazon","review":"VHS is hard to find and I can always find it here.

Great exercise can be accomplished without the kids being aware that that is what they are doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Unfortunately, this tape did not live up to the quality of other Sesame Street tapes I have seen. The beginning of the tape is long winded and the toddler watching, who loves to dance, lost interest before the dancing began. The excercise leader seemed more aware of the camera than of the children. Once you get past the intro though, it does improve somewhat. All in all, I'd pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video","review":"This video is really great. My two year old loves to exercise but the videos that I have are made for adults, so this was great for her. She loves all the different dances and the fun characters that are on this video. I just love to see her exercising and having fun at the same time. This video teaches her that taking care of herself can also be fun and feel good. My one year old even stomps around and does some of the dances, she is already enjoying the video and will probably just enjoy it more and more as she gets older and more able to understand it. And it is a great alternative to TV and sitting around watching cartoons! Buy it and get your kids of the couch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other sesame street videos","review":"The fun of watching Sesame Street videos is that they are often as entertaining for the adults as for the children. This video got old on the first viewing. The reason? Celina. She was chewing the scenery and her loud screechy voice and off key signing made me run for the remote. Unlike other Sesame Street live actors who let the muppets do their thing, Celina seems intent on taking center stage and manages to overwhelm both the muppets and the room full of kids. My mom, who was in the other room, remarked \\"her voice gets on my nerves\\". My son wanted to me to stop the video and put in another Sesame Street video. Gladly. The good things? There were a few muppet songs that appear on other tapes and Sesame street always has a multicultural cast. Parents, you don't want to watch this one over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible to the English ways!","review":"A pleasure to read and to smile at some of the most British ways of seeing life and smelling the weather!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally I make sense!","review":"When you are an ex-pat for a long enough time you begin to wonder what it is about you that is so different from everyone around you. Why do I share with delight that the big name-brand purse I'm carrying, and was complimented on, was bought at a discount store and get very odd results? Oh, I'm just being English. Why am I so frightfully horrified when people ask me how much I earn, or how expensive was my car? Oh... I see. I'm just operating under different rules. I've heard, and so far I've seen it to be true among my other English friends, we have trouble assimilating to other countries with the same ease most any other immigrant does.

There're some interesting explanation on why British ppl are so uneasy socializing, talking about money and may sometimes talking in the opp way (hypocrisy).

An amazing find!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"there were maybe four \\"insights\\" on the English...the rest you could figure out yourself by people watching for a few minutes. The book was long winded and repetitive beyond belief. Is a recap really necessary at the end of each chapter? The book could have been a third of its size and price. It reminded me of those school papers we all wrote that required a certain number of words and we basically rearranged the same data over and over to meet the criteria. I was so looking forward to this book and cannot think of a book I have been more disappointed in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Verified Purchase","review":"Watching the English: The Hidden Rules of English Behaviour\\"Sorry,\\" but I found the book somewhat redundant.

While claimig to cover all bases, the emphasis is on 'suburbia' and, despite a struggle to avoid this, the tone is irredeemably middle-class.The popularity of this book is difficult to understand, but this reviewer suspects that the appeal derives from a readership that is itself both anglophile and 'middle-class' in outlook. The expression 'ango-saxon attitudes' springs to mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I won't forget this film","review":"I didn't know what to expect from \\"The Wild Hunt\\". But I didn't expect it to be so harrowing, and so devastating. Having seen a few documentaries about real life LARPers, the concept is familiar to me. But this is a fictional story. The main character is a very likable, attractive guy named Eric, who crashes his big brother's weekend LARP event to find his runaway girlfriend. He just wants to bring her home, and thinks this is all pretty ridiculous. You probably will, too. But there is something deeper at work in these people; a longing for a greater purpose outside their everyday lives, for sure. But in addition to that, the event becomes an outlet for darker, more horrifying tendencies in others. Although the plot is very unlikely, and out of character for LARPers, who are known for being bookish, detail and rule oriented, you could say this is a nightmare scenario."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and stupid","review":"Both my wife and I are into gaming, but not this type of dress-up/act out gaming.Unlike some other reviewers here, I didn't think the \\"players\\" gave it their all. They were ignoring \\"game decorum\\" every 10 seconds or so, so it really made everyone look half-hearted and silly. There were a few comedic moments here and there which were ok, but the drama was totally uninteresting. Maybe there is a good story here somewhere, but neither my wife nor I could get into this film.A big thumbs down for us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Lock for the Price","review":"I bought this lock after looking at a few different companies. I felt this one would be of the best quality and build for the price. It is not the same quality as the Reese Key Lock I have for my hitch receiver, but it will do the job.

I got the feeling that it was more \\"forced\\" than written. Kind of like being at a party with someone who wants to be the center of attention, who is trying desperately to be funny, but just isn't. I really wanted to like this book, and the artwork by sick kids was heartwarming, but the book itself left me feeling like I'd wasted my money. Erma Bombeck she IS NOT! Not even close. I couldnt help but notice that the author left a review here on her own book!!! And wrote it as if it were being written by someone else! Whats up with that? That should not be allowed, Amazon. All in all, an amateurish, disappointing book"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT!","review":"I loved the book, Hugs, Hope, and Peanut Butter!

I was ready to buy a new printer, because repair cost more, when I discovered via online forums other customers with the same printer had experienced the same problem.The solution is to remove the formatter board, bake it at 350, propped up on a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil; then cool for 30 minutes before reinstalling. When I first saw this solution, I was doubtful. But it works!According to the forum contributors, HP tried a new cold solder method on the formatter board that doesn't hold. All it needs is heating up. HP should let customers know about this. It would save landfills from 1000s of perfectly repairable printers! Shame on you HP, for not letting your customers know. Otherwise, it's a good printer. They just need to tell their customers how to keep it working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formatter board yet no recall?","review":"Same problem as has been reported here by others. Worked perfectly for about a year and then the indicator lights started to report 'toner low' 'paper jam' although these were not in fact accurate indications. The printer began only printing one job and then had to be 'reset' to print ONE more job and now it doesn't print anything. This has been diagnosed as a 'formatter board' problem and is very costly to repair. Again, warranty no longer in place. Having spent $500.00 for the printer and relying on HP's positive reputation I'm surprised and disappointed that there has not been a 'recall' for this equipment?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"works well until it fails","review":"This is a nice double-sided printer while it works. Unfortunately it seems to happen to many users - including myself - that soon after the warranty expires the printer breaks down with an issue acknowledged by HP: a faulty formatter board. This leads to the printer not printing anymore, the paper jam light coming on constantly, and nothing to be done but to replace the formatter board at a price of over $100. I did that, and the problem recurred in one of my printers, and has also affected a second one. Apparently 10-20% of this model are affected, yet there has been no recall. I would stay clear of this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it fails.","review":"I have owned many HP printers for years. I've never had a problem with any of them until this one. My formatter board failed just outside the warranty. HP doesn't stand behind this product and says you can have it serviced at your cost. All that you have to do is google search for formatter board problems with HP P2015 printers and see what you get. I told the tech support guy that I'd take my chances on baking the formatter board in the oven as recommended on the internet. What do I have to lose? HP knows of the problem with this product and they fail to stand behind it. This will probably be my last HP printer purchase. I would definitely stay clear of this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"caution","review":"For a printer of this cost, one expects it would not be so difficult. Basically, this printer works only when it wants to. It does not matter if it is networked or using USB-the consistency is poor. The \\"printer offline\\" message comes up more often than not, even when everything is fine! According to various help sites I have looked at, this is a common problem with the 2015 models. I beg you to use caution in considering this printer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well...for 18 months","review":"This printer has only served to convince me that HP products have really been going downhill.

The quality wasn't as nice as some laser printers, but it was fast and a great bargain. After a year of use, however, it just stopped working. I spent time with the service center and was eventually told that it had a bad formatter board and I could replace it for $100. Since that was cheaper than buying a new one, I decided to give it one more shot. It's been 4 months and it just went out on me again (one month past the warranty). I was printing for my class tomorrow and it just stopped. Now I'm getting the amber light error message that it's out of paper and ink, neither of which is true. I'm totally soured on HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"only had this printer for less than 8 months","review":"After 8 months, the printer failed. So far, this apparently happens to most people, and some people have found success with getting a new DIMM with new firmware. To me, this is absolutely ridiculous. For how much I paid for this thing, it shouldn't just stop printing. There is a problem with the power save where you have to manually power cycle the printer to get it to print. And sometimes that doesn't even work. Very frustrating. I am going to have to buy a new printer now. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printer Not Vista Compatible","review":"The printer works great with my computer running XP SP1, but is not compatable with a newer computer running XP or any of my laptops that are running Vista.

I went to the HP website and using their live help feature asked if the P2015 printer worked with Vista. Absolutely they said. They lied. I purchased it and tried to use the CD to load the drivers. The install program would not work. I tried to install the HP software \\"toolbox\\". That too does not work with Vista. No where does HP advise purchasers that to use the printer one must download the drivers from their web site NOT the CD. The printer works fine (its okay, not great, maybe a 3) but to have the manufacture simply mislead consumers regarding its use is unforgivable. I am familiar with HP downloads as I have several hp products so I knew where to get the drivers. But to ship this product as Vista certified and to just ignore the fact that the software is not compatible is criminal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible with Vista","review":"Just purchased this printer based on good reviews. Needed a solid, duplex capable printer, nothing fancy, for medium volume printing. The CD immediately indicated that i was lacking a dll file. I am running Vista 64 bit currently. Tried windows update and the HP website with no success, as their 'updates' either don't run on my machine or keep referring me to the other (windows and HP) in a circular fashion. Have run into a few other reviewers (including one on this website i wish i'd read before buying) indicating that it's a Vista incompatibility problem. Further research shows that very few printers are Vista compatible, much less one that duplexes.

Specs at the HP site stated that the 2015d is \\"certified for Windows Vista\\" and is \\"Windows Vista ready\\".

HP sent me a replacement unit which also broke down after a month. It was same formatter issue both times. I'm terribly disappointed with this product. Not something that I expect with HP's reputation. It was a charm while it worked but terribly unreliable. Phone support while helpful was a nightmare to navigate through. I had to repeat my problems to 4 different people and stay on the line for over an hour.

Dalkey retells the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale of the nightingale, changing the setting to Japan (because, she says, she knows more about Japan than she does China) and extending it to novel length.A fine little work it is. Dalkey has taken the cast of characters form the tale, expanded on it, and fleshed out the existing bunch to give us a fine little tale. It is well-paced, intricate, and a joy to read. Along the way, the reader alsogains some knowledge of various Japanese cultural traditions. Quite fun, and highly recommended. ****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but with some notable errors","review":"I am rather fond of the story of the Nightingale (I wrote a modernized version for a Spanish class which went well), and looked for a copy of this novel for a long period of time with no success. I finally found a copy in Ashland, Oregon, while on my first visit to the Shakespeare Festival (amazing, just amazing, though this is a side note), and read it on the long trip home. I had no problems with it then, and enjoyed the story, but now having read more about Japanese folklore and spending time with people who speak Japanese, it is harder to thoroughly enjoy. \\"Kitsune\\" and \\"Hidoi\\", for example, would certainly never be used as names, and the moon deity Tsuki-Yomi is male, not female.

From what I can tell I would be better served to skip this novel altogether.I enjoyed all of the previous Clan Novels to a varying extent. I enjoy the intrigue, character development and action that is found in varying amounts in other World of Darkness books. However, this book is just tedious and completely unenlightening.There seems to be no plot and we do not seem to learn anything useful regarding the series.

I've never seen an author try to use so many words to discribe the irrelevant. The chantry seems to be run like a one room school house, complete with crying children and story hour. Trying to pull some meaning from the events is further confused from the chapters needlessly jumping back and forth in the story line. This is the single worst book I've read and is greatly over-rated at one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost 2 stars.","review":"I don't think this book was QUITE as bad as Malkavian or Giovanni, but it's darned close. A couple of the characters are actually mildly interesting. which is what makes it better than Giovanni, and it isn't QUITE as inexplicable as Malkavian, although it's distressingly close considering that none of the characters are comlete, utter raving loony-tunes. But like Giovanni, and unlike Malkavian, it didn't seem to advance the overall plotline any, so all in all, it was pretty worthless. Certainly utterly worthless if you aren't trying to read the whole series, or if you aren't familiar with the White Wolf \\"World of Darkness\\" Vampire games.

Choosing the quotes to use is great for sparking conversation- whose point of view to use, which details are the most interesting / relevant. Being asked to go get things for different characters in order to get them to talk is an amusing sidelight, but the laying out of the paper- and seeing how many papers they have sold really gets them excited.

The ending was lackluster and bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I found this book a great disappointment. The previous book by the same author was good, but this one is best described as a book you can't wait to put down. If it were not about the Puzo characters, this book would never have been be published. Save your time and money. Forget about it! The only thing you'll get out of this is that Tom Hagen was killed by Nick Geraci by way of drowning in a car. That's it.

And what was with the whole Christopher Columbus movie fiasco, except to fill pages? I got the Osama reference - who wouldn't, as we were hit over the head with it - but missed the significance (if any) of that \\"movie\\".

For whatever reason, I still expected to be disappointed by this one. Rest assured--GODFATHER'S REVENGE is at least as good as Puzo's original, and even better than the first sequel. And the storyline is full of surprises--I don't want to be a spoiler, but there are so many good twists, self-contained in this story, that it almost doesn't matter if you've read the previous books.This is a very satisfying novel; what's going on beneath the surface makes this almost a literary novel--it's a page-turner, but at the same time a book I'll definitely go back and read again.

But no such luck. It does bring in a couple of distant channels more consistently than my rabbit ears, but fails to bring in three public TV digital channels that the rabbit ears capture. I moved up to the Winegard SS-3000 amplified antenna, and that did the trick, although it seems overpriced. Reading the reviews here, it makes me wonder how many people assume that they need a digital antenna to bring in digital channels and never try their old one, since the old ones seem to do almost as well with most channels."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than $10 basic antenna","review":"I'm from Orange county, California.

Much to my surprise I picked up 3 UHF stations I didn't know existed, but not the 3 network stations I was hoping for. 2 of the unknown stations were in Spanish.The stations were channels 27, 27-3 and 26.

This antenna is worry free, I get 100% signals and get 33 channels in NY Metro area. This is highly recommended.

A couple of clamps, an electric drill and a 1/4\\" bit made it all work out for less aggro than returning the thing. But didn't leave me particularly well inclined toward this particular antenna.The antenna also has an all-weather rubber cover to protect the coax connection to the balun. Ours isn't installed outdoors, but if it had been I would have complained that the cover doesn't appear flexible enough to slip over the coax connector. So you would need to slip the cover over an unterminated coax cable and then install the coax connector before connecting the coax to the balun.Other than that, the antenna seems to be quite sturdy and works well enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought this to replace my old outdoor beam antenna. First I tried this new antenna. The signal strenght was half what it used to be with 4 fewer channels, even after rotation it 360 degrees. This is definitely NOT omnidirectional. Second, I tried both antennas together. It was slightly better, but signal strength was still lower than usual. Finally I connected my old antenna back again and got 4 more channels back again with the most signal strength and best reception. I'm going to try this antenna inside on my TV in the guest bedroom.

I Bought the Eagle Aspen about a month ago, installed it in the attic and reused the 20+ year old RG-59 cable and connectors. Reception is excellent on all three floors and I don't have to adjust a thing! I helped my dad install his Radio Shack antenna in March. Both antennas seem to perform equally as well, but his needs an amp and is wired with the better RG-6 cable and quality connectors (not bashing the Radio Shack antenna as it worked well also, but the antenna itself was 3 times the cost).

It did improve viewing quality, but not to any degree that I had hoped for. My problem with digital tv is that the picture quality is good until it breaks up into tiny squares or freezes up and that includes the audio. I thought that this antenna would do the trick, but it didn't completely fix the problems which make viewing any program quite frustrating. I never had this problem with analog; just had crappy reception.I have since purchased the amplifier to improve quality. Again, not a complete fix. And, with the amplifier, the picture quality is now diminished with faint lines that were not there before. However, I do have less problems with the picture freezing or breaking up.Still, with my costs of buying the Tiva box, the Aspen antenna, and the amplifier, I was really hoping for a better user experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"So, I got mine and assembled it, tried it indoors and it was pretty much the same as when I was using some rabbit ears.The coax plug in part isn't very accessible.

In Phoenix statons 8, 10 and 12 have gone from UHF back to their VHF channels using new HD transmitters which makes this antenna worthless.

My house is about 20 miles from the main TV tower farm in central Iowa and there is another house totally blocking my direct line of sight to these towers, but this antenna works like there is nothing in-between my house and the towers. I even picked up a remote station in a different direction about 35 miles away from my house. Over in all, this thing should have received five stars from me if not that it came missing one screw for mast installation! I ended up just removing the whole back rack and screwing this antenna directly onto my outdoor sidings using two wood screws.

I set the antenna up [...] and proceeded to program received channels. Once I was finished, I ended up with 2 less channels than I got with my $10 RCA rabbit ears! I tried it again after moving the antenna to different positions. The picture wasn't any better. I live in a metro area with most stations within 30-40 miles.

It is designed for UHF frequencies - I believe that is where all current digital channels broadcast.These functional antennas look very industrial, so best out of sight.

(Lay it flat!)","review":"After determining that my local broadcast towers were 18 miles away,(not sure what site I used to determine this, but [...] says different) I figured that a directional antenna like this one would do the trick. It worked, but always with artifacting/blocking/interference. Until I laid it flat, that is. (e.g. on the grid part, with the two 'V' shaped parts facing up) Now there is rarely any interference, and all local channels come in great. Obviously I didn't need a directional antenna at all, but laying this one flat effectively makes it omnidirectional. I haven't removed the grid part and tried it that way, but it's easily done by removing 2 bolts.

Why not be forthright and honest about your intentions from the get go? I appreciate the support for Israel but am very offended by the sneaky way this film goes about proselytzing.

The big problem is the volume control. Polk decided to utilize (+)/(-) buttons for this feature, rather than a continuous control. The effect is that low-level listening (I bought this for my office) is almost impossible. The speakers are either too loud or too quiet. The control itself seems pretty flimsy, since the first unit I received was defective and had to be returned. Polk seems sort of confused about the issue, too. The one-page user manual that accompanies the unit states that the user may have to adjust the iPod volume, along with the miDock volume, to attain a satisfactory volume. The various iPods I've tried on the unit have no effect on the volume (regardless of the iPod volume)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough info","review":"This book doesn't have enough recipes or enough ways to use essential oils.

Apart from a few too many typos and other printer's errors, this book is an easy to read and thoroughly indexed work for your movie masters' shelves. I was alternately thrilled and awed by the sheer number of people Karloff touched - professionally and personally. Gordon Shriver managed to meet or otherwise correspond with literally dozens of them; their kind and candid obseervations and charming anecdotes bring a fresh perspective to a movie star much maligned. In light of the most recent retrospective of Boris' work, shown at the Film Forum, NYC, this loving tribute will be most welcomed by karloff fans old and new everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karloff Biography","review":"A beautifully written biography, the author explores with much affection the actor whose personal life was juxtaposed to \\"the monster\\" he is best known for portraying.

I would highly recommend this as a helpful commentary on the letter of James. It contains a lot of information while not being overly technical. It is well presented and easily accessible for all types of people. Obviously you will not agree with every single thing he writes as will be the case with every commentator because none are perfect. The purpose of commentaries is to provide you with someone else's exegesis and research to help you more thoroughly wrestle with what the text of the Bible is saying. I think you will find Moo to be someone who is trying to faithfully exegete and comment on the book of James.

He didn't seem to care that he didn't see a preview, but never asked to use it again after we downloaded the first batch of pictures and no one could tell what was in them. I uploaded some examples.The viewfinder is not lined up with the lens so even pictures taken by an adult are bad and cut off. Indoor pictures were just terrible, outdoor pictures wouldn't be too bad if viewed only in small preview size, not printed, and if the viewfinder lined well enough to get pictures that weren't all decapitated and the side of the image...shoulda just given him my old digital camera and bought a new one for myself..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - not even worth a quarter!","review":"Awful, Awful, Awful - it should be illegal to sell something this cheap.

I don't know what people expect for a thirty dollar camera, but, reading the reviews I think a little to much. I would compare this camera to digital cameras five years ago, they worked fine just a little slow. You have to hold it still a little longer than new cameras in order to get a clear picture, but again it's only thirty bucks. We're not huge Disney fans but being able to add characters to pictures is also fun, it IS intended to be a childs camera. Good buy overall I think.

He didn't seem to care that he didn't see a preview, but never asked to use it again after we downloaded the first batch of pictures and no one could tell what was in them. I uploaded some examples.The viewfinder is not lined up with the lens so even pictures taken by an adult are bad and cut off. Indoor pictures were just terrible, outdoor pictures wouldn't be too bad if viewed only in small preview size, not printed, and if the viewfinder lined up well enough that at least an adult could capture what they were looking at, and not decapitated lopsided pictures...shoulda just given him my old digital camera and bought a new one for myself..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"This product would have to be promoted four levels just to reach the designation \\"Garbage\\".

When the flash is on it washes everything out, when its off you can't see the subject at all if the picture is taken inside. We have not been able to try it outdoors yet. My son was able to figure out the features and it is easy for him to use. He enjoys the camera and doesn't seem to have any complaints about it.

Once we saw the pictures we were so disapointed, all of the outdoor photos (about 90% of the pictures) had an overhelming purple hue to them.

First off, it was SO difficult to understand the \\"overseas\\" operator that I had to ask for an on shore operator.

She speaks in her own voice, seemingly without the interference of colleagues or editors, leading us through her favorite recipies. As always, she complains about the difficulties of finding true French ingredients, such as sorrel or creme fraiche, in the US.

How do you get from one posture to the next? The essence of taoism is change, and these postures are static. Even if it was a video, it's pointless. You need a teacher to hit you!

Very reliable, rarely fails to print on the first try. My biggest complaint would be the location of the power button. This is a large (and tall) printer, so if you put it somewhere with limited space, the power button is hard to access. Lights on top are not labeled or marked clearly at all.

The instrumentation is not entirely typical, featuring the bandola (a kind of a lute), guitar and some flute rather than the more standard clarinet or accordion. The mix of Cumbia and Merengue makes for a great party-dance tape. At the same time, the high quality of the musicianship, the arrangements , and the clarity of the recording make for a great listening experience.

On one hand I love the idea (hold a nation-wide photography contest to produce a book featuring American children as taken by moms and dads-basically amateurs), but the book fails miserbly on the execution. The book is cheaply made and does not do justice to the photographs. Some of the photographs are rough to begin with while others with high potential suffer from the super-poor printing. The worst part is the price. I usually associate with the likes of books by Aperture, Phaidon, etc. and even their good stuff doesn't cost [this much]! Save your money. If the publisher could have faithfully reproduced the photos and packaged it appropriately that may have justified a book in [this price] range, but honestly this book should be selling for [much less]."},{"rating":"2","title":"These books are terrific!","review":"I have a co-worker that raved about this book when in come out and I finally got around to ordering a copy.

All you have to do is go to: www.tradingmarkets.com/.site and view his archives.Even Dave Landry will tell you that NO STRATEGY works all the time. Nevertheless, his methods make a living for him and he is a great teacher. His approach works when the market cooperates and this is not a book filled with hype.

Not so much because of what the verses of the Bible say (which is why traditional gets the 99.9%) as out of an emotional hope that they are finally punished enough. Several of the writers admit that the traditional is the only way to go, but feel the emotional tug of the annihilational.

As Dorfman goes back and forth between doctors and charlatans looking for a cure to his unknown ailment, he enlightens us about his past and his childhood, which of course, involves his somewhat strange parents. John Blumenthal has written a hilarious novel with a refreshing originality. I pictured the protaganist as a Martin Short type character that he had played in the movie 'Inner Space'.One complaint I have is the quality of the publishers binding. The book was starting to fall apart when I started reading it and I had to treat it with great care to finish it. Not to worry. With the quality of writing that John Blumenthal is coming out with, I see a bigger and better publisher waiting in the wings.Highly recommended for fun and laughs.

Will Dorfman's script ever make it through the Hollywood runaround and onto the big screen? Perhaps, that is, IF he can put his imaginary illnesses aside for five minutes. While, at times, Blumenthal's characters give you a neurosis of your very own from their constant worry, \\"What's Wrong with Dorfman?\\" is a hilarious and entertaining read. Blumenthal's writing is witty and fresh and his characters are enthralling. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"Martin Dorfman's quest to find the source of his mysterious illness leads him to doctors, psychiatrists, and new-age healers in a therapeutic theater of the absurd only slightly less bizarre than the Hollywood studios where he tries to earn a living as a screenwriter. His journey proves painful, physically and psychically, but Blumenthal nicely balances Dorfman's suffering with sharp wit and moments of outright hilarity. His insights into the angst of Baby-boomer middle age will resonate with anyone who has faced the dilemmas of aging parents, demanding children, failing body, and failed ambitions. WHAT'S WRONG WITH DORFMAN? is a sad, funny, and ultimately wise novel about confronting and accepting one's past while trying to stay afloat in the present."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL !!","review":"Single camcorder recording; one angle, unintelligible air mic sound all along the dvd.

Thankfully I didn't purchase it; I was not very pleased with his methods. Obviously they work for some people judging by other reviews, but my children do not respond to this type of tactic. I prefer to display the kind of behavior I expect from them, and they learn to emulate me. I don't want to throw myself on the floor in a pseudo-tantrum and give them the impression that that sort of behavior is acceptable. I did glean a few good tips from this book, but all in all I was glad to see it go back to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous","review":"I tried reading this book and using the Fast Food Technique repeatedly with my high energy, very active 2 year old.

I just couldn't take it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't read it, but a word of caution anyway...","review":"I have read in a few reviews that one of the suggestions in the book is to lock your toddler in his/her room. I don't know if the suggestion includes the parent/caregiver being in the room or not, though the sense I got was that the child would be alone. In many states, locking a child in a room is considered abusive and is a cause for a call to the state authorities or child abuse hotline. Not saying that parents who might follow these suggestions are knowingly trying to harm their kids, but please know that certain states might view certain things as abusive. Check it out in your state!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I recycled my copy","review":"I bought this book thinking that I had heard good things about it, but I must have been mistaken.I found \\"Happiest Toddler\\" to be badly written, and that's just the beginning. The only reference made to other parenting literature or research was to his own previous book. That's sketchy.My problems with the material presented range from mild irritation with the idea that kids should have their tantrums mirrored back at them to full on nausea at the suggestion that if a toddler has a tantrum in a store it's a good idea to lock them in the car until they calm down.A few helpfull ideas, like using \\"magic\\" to help young kids with their fears, do not a usefull parenting book make. I was disheartend to learn that this book is a national best seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy","review":"I am going to be very opinionated here, but just to make the point to you of what it is like. I could not stand this book. I thought the ideas were LOONEY! They recomend that when you child has a tantrum, you join them to help them understand that you understand, even in front of others. Ha! No thanks. I do love my kids, but I also would like them to learn what is correct behavior in front of others. They do have to grow up eventually!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Happiest Toddler on the Block","review":"This book was awful. We bought it to get some insight into how to help our toddler behave better and felt that all we got was a comparison to toddlers and evolution. The comparisons this author made were very strange and unfounded. They had nothing to do with reality. He also wanted an adult to talk \\"toddler talk\\" to the toddler instead of regular English. I would not follow much of the advice given in this book. He did not recommend a way of raising children that made the adult an authority figure in the child's life which is something that is essential to raising happy and well adjusted children."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book saved my sanity","review":"It was so frustrating and at times embarassing trying to deal with my daughter during her tantrums because I was trying to talk to her calmly as if she would magically understand me and stop fussing. Dr. Karp's book had a huge impact on me because it made me realize that I'm dealing with a little \\"caveman\\" and adult logic just won't work when my little 2 year old is super agitated.With clearly stated steps to follow, this book has really made a difference. It was a little awkward when first trying the techniques, but after very little practice it became second nature. Using the toddler-ese and short repetitive phrases, while mirroring my daughter's feelings has nearly cut out tantrums altogether. She still gets upset but it rarely escalates out of control anymore. There is a lot more peace in our family now.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happiest Toddler","review":"This book was very entertaining. Although I don't think that I will use all of the advice (I'm having trouble acting like a prehistoric person!!!), I think that it is very good advice. My one year old points and \\"uuughs\\" all the time, just like the book describes. This book has made me appreciate the \\"evolution\\" of a child, and how every change is unique and should be enjoyed. You never know, it may catch on for me too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"Here is the book, in summary:Your child acts like a caveman and pretty much is a cave man in every way. You act like a cave man too so that he understands you and he is happy.Read the above paragraph 500 times. The end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't have success with this technique","review":"Although there are some good common sense recommendations on how to connect with your toddler in this book, I found \\"Toddlerese\\" to be ineffective. In fact, after several attempts I found it agitated my 19 month old (who is generally a pretty \\"easy\\" kid) even more when she was upset. I think the Baby Whisperer for Toddlers presents more effective methods built on respect for your child and your role as parent. At the end of the day I still find that making eye contact with my daughter and calmly acknowledging her needs is the most successful way to communicate and calm a tantrum. We've also had a lot of success with simple sign language, which allows my daughter to tell us what she wants - she has a strong vocabulary - but we continue to use sign language successfully. My recommendation is to skip this book and stick with the Baby Whisperer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christians beware...","review":"If this book has helpful parenting advice I was unable to get to it. I couldn't get past the first chapter which gives a very detailed 'historic' account of the evolution of man from fish with gills through thought processing human and compares the gestational period from conception through age 4 as a mirror image of mans million year evolutionary process. As a creation beliving Christian I cannot stomach such 'factual' writing where evolution is concerned and had to put the book down. I was very disappointed because it seemed that it might have made some good points otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative","review":"Good book, puts things in a different light. Helped me communicate with my toddler better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The talk infuriated my toddler","review":"This book simply didn't work for us. Many times my 2 year old son would throw a tantrum because he didn't know what he wanted. Example: \\"I want juice Mama\\" I give him the juice. He falls out on the floor crying. \\"I don't want juice anymore.\\" I take juice and put it on the table. \\"I want juice Mama.\\" AAAAHHHH! I couldn't \\"caveman talk\\" because neither my child nor myself knew what he wanted. The other parts of the book were to shallow. I really liked John Rosemond's making the terrible twos terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"I laughed a lot . . .","review":"You'll either love this book or you'll hate it, really. It is so laughable and ridiculous at times, it should also be shelfed with Calvin and Hobbes. The author, to his credit, is trying hard to be cute and funny by describing toddlers as \\"charming child-child\\", \\"knne-high neanderthal\\", \\"clever cave-kid\\" and \\"versatile villager\\". But that is all this book is. Cute and funny. The information and suggestions provided are pretty useless to anyone that has read any other parenting book. Nothing new or orignal here. The pace was tiresome and repetative.I was personally really annoyed with his metaphors. I'm pretty sure my daughter would be offended if she could comprehend it. I feel the same way about caveman marriage advice as well.The chapter that really got me was called, \\"Modern Life: The Nuclear Family is Normal--and Other Myths\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda So-So","review":"I agree with those who said that Happiest Baby on the Block was so extremely helpful, and this one only mediocre at best. For us, anyway. After stopping a few pages into this book, I have tried to read more of it on several occasions but haven't managed to stick with it for very long. I guess we were already doing \\"toddler-speak\\" on our own, so it doesn't seem like a revelation to us. With Happiest Baby I thought it was all the precise details of his explanations that were so helpful. For what I've read of his Toddler book, it didn't really expand on the basic idea already presented in a basic synopsis or even many reviews of this book. If you get the idea from the description of this book, you may already be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I'm not a cave dweller!","review":"This book was REALLY not for me. The whole premise is that toddlers are like little Neanderthals, and you have to speak/relate to them accordingly (e.g. barking, \\"ANGRY...you want OUTSIDE...OUTSIDE...OUTSIDE, NOW!!\\" at your tantruming toddler who wants to go out to play). As if that isn't strange enough, the author takes things even farther, suggesting that parents actually furrow their eyebrows, bare their teeth and GROWL at children when they misbehave. The whole thing was just way too far-fetched for me. I honestly started to question the author's grasp on sanity. Apparently these methods work for some families, but if you're like me and the idea of barking and growling at your baby turns you off, you might want to look elsewhere for a parenting guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"great ideas","review":"this book is filled with great suggestions for all ages for handling difficult behaviors and discipline without spanking.I have really enjoyed reading it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intruiging Theory","review":"This book came at a time when my daughter was just starting to have some issues. Although I would not follow every piece of advice to the letter, Dr. Karp gave me enough information to adapt it to work for my child. His theory regarding evolution is enough to warrant reading this book!! I would recommend this to any intelligent and open-minded parent looking for non-judgemental advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toddlers as Cavemen?","review":"This books represents a disappointing trend in parenting. Comparing Toddlers to \\"Cavemen with undeveloped brains\\" is disrespectful and unneccesary. I disagree with his basic tenant of talking down to Toddlers, or using his 'toddlerese' to talk with children. Parents need to continue to model socially appropriate behavior, not imitate their children's tantrums. Check out anything by Magda Gerber, or \\"1,2,3, The Toddler Years\\", by Irene Van der Zande, for a respectful and effective method of helping children with their big feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the baby book...","review":"I loved Karp's baby book!

Unfortunately I have two copies because somehow I ordered them wrong on Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I was so excited about the title of this book but I was terribly disappointed once I began reading. I really could not get past the repeated references to monkey-cave-whatever children. I know I am raising a human being! My child is not \\"evolving.\\" She is growing and learning.

Monkeys and cavemen, I wonder how Nanny 911 would handle Dr. Karp and his children in his home. I guess it's how one believes if we came from Adam and Eve or monkeys. I'm having problems with his approach, if the ideas presented in his book create the kind of relationship I would desire to have with my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Although there were some good ideas in this book, I found comparing a child to a 'neanderthal'and all the prehistoric parenting talk (as if we are training chimps) a bit disconcerting. I also didn't care for suggestions to use 'magic words, magic or invisible protective suits, magic water, secret super spray, talismans, etc\\"., as a means of calming bedtime fears. The author tells us to 'growl' at our prehistoric toddlers to show them we mean business. He even suggests learning to growl convincingly by practicing in the mirror. Neither we or our children are animals. We are people, made in the image of God. We don't need pagan rituals (offering cookies to the smoke detector alluded to in the book), magic of any type, or animal training techniques to raise our children. I find much of this book ludicrous to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very surprised with the author's suggestions....","review":"I felt that the author's suggestions for communicating with your young toddler were VERY unnatural and impractical. Throughout the entire book the author compares the child to a caveman and suggests you communicate with your child by grunting. I found a few helpful points but I definitely needed to read far between the lines to get anything out of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"overboard on the caveman theory","review":"Im sorry but if i had known that this entire book focused NOT on developmental aspects of a child, but rather how my child is like a monkey or cave person then i would have not gotten it. The entire book practically focuses on that point. Not sure if the author is just trying to be funny; which he wasnt, but it takes away from the whole point of the book. If you are looking for a book that helps you to identify your HUMAN child's personality traits, developmental milestones and how to understand/nurture them, then this is not the book for you. If I wanted a book that just displayed the author's opinions on human development then that is what I would have looked for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"I found this book to be useless for us. Complete waste of money. Not at all what I expected. If your toddler has daily all out 20 minute kicking and screaming tantrums this method could be helpful. If not don't waste your money. Also it is very drawn out...the whole method could be explained in less than 10 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single Parents Need Not Bother","review":"I have read this book cover-to-cover, and I have to admit that the ideas therein sound good. The logic might work, if you are one of Dr. Karp's ideal parents who stays home with your toddler all day, every day. Working parent? Single parent? You'll just be frustrated that he offers no insight. It's almost like you don't exist. Certainly doesn't allow for the possibility that his methods could be adapted for these circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidest Book on the Block","review":"We really liked his Happiest Baby on the Block book so we bought this one very eagerly.

Recapitulation theory is bunk (just do a google search for \\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,\\" the book's main tenent, and you will see), and the book is completely based on this baseless theory.Speaking to your toddler in short phrases that s/he can understand? That should be a no brainer. Why this is a revelation to people I cannot understand. Speaking to your toddler as if you are a caveman? That is crazy. I refuse to act like a primitive version of a human in the grocery store instead of modeling appropriate behavior for my child.Any book will have nuggets of wisdom.

However, for my taste, there was too much descriptive. I didn't feel I needed to know where he ate, what he ate, what street he turned down or how the town or city was years before.

I found myself reading this book more slowly than normal, since I wasn't too thrilled with the particular descriptive part of the story.

I first was in Phoneix in the 50's and again in the mid-80's and be captured the ambiance and character of the city, as it use to be. Therefore I could relate to the changes of how he sees it today. This is important to me when I am reading, I like to feel like I really am in the place and in the moment. Of course, the premise and characters keep me reading.I liked his characters, they were well described and fit their roles in the story. It was unique and kept me wanting to know what would happen next. There was suspense, twist and turns, and it came together with a nice surprise in the end. I would read this author again and I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish it...","review":"I was excited to read this book, due to it's location.

I realize that knowing a bit about the setting made it more enjoyable, but the story itself was really compelling from the very beginning.I enjoyed the characters, even the ones who are not exactly all (obviously) good \\"guys\\". There were enough twists and turns to keep me guessing throughout, and, since I just stayed up all night finishing it, I guess you can say it kept my interest.I've read the other reviews and I really don't have too much to add here except to say that I enjoyed this book so much I felt I HAD to write one of my very INfrequent reviews.Thank you Jon Talton -- you surely have a new fan! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"...........","review":"Lame, anyone who buys this is clearly an idiot.

Glenn Gregory from Heaven 17 e.g. lends a hand giving the sound often a lush feeling. On too many tracks Martin seems to be trying too hard to give the sound some edge. It is the more relaxed efforts that shine and shine they do in epic proportions. Stranger Things is as catchy a pop tune as they come, yet could be classified as easy listening. The title track, however, is the album's gem. One can listen to it again and again without getting tired of it. With enough marketing ammunition this track could easily become a huge hit appealing to a wide spectrum. Really, the album is worth purchasing for that single song. There are other good songs on the album, but programming the CD is still a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but I like it.","review":"I ordered Skyscraping because I'm a huge ABC fan. I recently got their 2008 CD \\"Traffic\\" that I like much better, but this CD is not bad, just completely different from the usual style of the band. Once again Martin Fry is in full vocal form. I love his voice and never tire of hearing him sing. His writing style is fantastic as well. He explores relationships and the material is never stale.If you're looking for a \\"Lexicon Of Love\\" followup this is not it, but if you want to listen to a different side of ABC while enjoying the always amazing Martin Fry then don't hesitate to pick up Skyscraping. One thing,the art work is awesome. I have no idea where the locales are that the photos of Martin were taking, but the architecture is stunning. All around \\"Skyscraping\\" is fun and the new style is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"Not as great as others discs by ABC, but still very enjoyable, especially the track \\"Stranger Things\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily his best since the 80's- Martin Fry STILL has it","review":"Don't be put off by negative reviews. This CD is pure Martin Fry- lyrically and vocally. To say that Mark White is missed here is to vastly overemphasize his importance to ABC, particularly on their best efforts. Most new wave fans know that nothing will ever equal \\"Lexicon of Love,\\" which was labeled upon its release as \\"the perfect pop LP\\" for good reason. But listen to this collection of tunes with a critical ear and you'll find moments where song really meets sculpture. Certain tracks (Skyscraping and especially Stranger Things- buy the acoustic version if you can find it) on \\"Skyscraping\\" truly demonstrate how much Fry cares for his fans and his art. The lyrical thoughtfulness is evident, even on the faster, more processed tunes. Now, if you like \\"Abracadabra,\\" you might be unhappy. But if you consider \\"Abracabra\\" (or \\"Up\\") classic ABC, you probably aren't familiar with what ABC is about: Romance & Sophistication."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Having been one of only about eight people on the entire planet to own all of the ABC albums and willingly admit to doing so, I really looked forward to the release of a new ABC album - particularly since their last album, Abracadabra, was easily their best.Unfortunately, with Mark White out of the picture, ABC falls flat. Even the best moment on the album, \\"Stranger things\\", sounds stilted and artificial, the equivalent of trying to bake a cake based solely on a picture of one. Sure, Messrs. Fry and Gregory toss in a few recognizable motifs from ABC past, but this just adds insult upon injury.Save your money. Buy the remastered editions of the first four albums instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Movie of a Dedicated Missionary to China","review":"This movie is a true story about one of the most dedicated missionaries of all times!

The message on jackleg preachers is clear and has been told by several other authors, but in a more upbeat and realistic fashion. I would suggest the Reverend Curtis Black trilogy series by Kimberly Lawson Roby instead. Also, I've come to find out that even though members of a church know about their pastor's downfall or thorn in his flesh (sexual abuse, sexual perversion, etc.), they accept it and turn their heads. Now this is what needs to be exposed. Someone needs to write a novel about this because this has yet to be written."},{"rating":"2","title":"When worldy desire seeps into Gods house, faith is stretched.","review":"The Amen Sisters a novel by Angela Benson is a wonderful story of faith, betrayal, and trust.

Dawn Amen-Ray brings her sister into her home after the ordeal, but she has a secret she doesn't want her sister - or anyone else - to find out!

One of my dislikes would be the ending because everything falls apart.I think that if you enjoy books that pull you into all the drama, as if you were there than this book is perfect for you.

However, this book is great on its own and is filled with a lot of great ideas and information (including where to find materials, as well as a glossary of terms).My only real complaint is the construction of the book. While I don't mind the binder style of the book itself, I don't understand the thinking behind the cover. It's basically cardboard and the way it's connected, it's bound to wear out and fall off after repeated use.

He made sure that he reviewed the reviews before the purchase and all turned out very good....but not really, both dryers are not working as of that same day of first use for one and the other about a few days later. Both time of usage my clients were sitting under them drying and all of a sudden we hear a loud noise from the hood then it turns off leaving my clients with a BAD HAIR DAY!!!!!! NEVER AGAIN...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one BITES the dust!","review":"I was so excited about receiving this dryer based on the positive reviews. However, my experience was more like the negative reviews. At first the dryer worked ok. The design is poor and the pole to keep it up is too heavy for the knob that holds it in place so it was not really portable. The high heat setting was very hot and the low heat setting was cold. After the 6th use sparks started to fly from the unit when on high heat. It shorted out completely after the next use. The return policy was less than 30 days, and I wouldnt have been able to get a full refund. Not worth it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Choice","review":"This dryer out beat the hard hat table top dryer any day.You can adjust the dryer to any height and slide your chair right under it. It just that EZ. It dries faster! It is a good investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legs Won't Stay Still","review":"This dryer is great and gets super hot which makes for quick drying time however the mobility of the dryer is NOT AT ALL FUNCTIONAL! The dryer has roller wheels that are detachable so after which falls apart on you so easily. I would not purchase this dryer only for that purpose but if you think you can get around that issue then go for it. Also that little issue is not kid friendly so BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"try another","review":"It works bu not very sturdy. Hood disconnects from pole. Order another from the company. Same problem. Wishes I ordered from someone else;. Not worth the money. I used tape to keep the two parts together.

I just wish it had a timer, that would make it perfect for me. Otherwise, great product would definitely recommend if you don't mind keeping your own time."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"I was hesitant to purchase this dryer after reading some of the unfavorable reviews but I'm very pleased with it so far. I can't vouch for the longevity yet, time will tell. It was very easy to assemble but not super sturdy. I'd recommend being careful while assembling. As I was attaching the legs, a small plastic part of the wheel lock (lever) broke off in my hand. I was bummed (that's why my rating is 4 stars) but the broken piece doesn't really affect anything as far as my needs are concerned. The dryer itself works really well and the high/ionic setting heats up quickly. Has a slight rattle sound when I first turn it on but it's not bothersome in my opinion. This dryer is perfect for my deep conditioning treatments and the adjustable height is nice. Makes it easy to position behind any chair. Also love the \\"Purple People Heater\\" logo - cute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Really like this dryer.. I looked at nothing but the comments before purchasing and a lot of people enjoy it also, which mademe comfortable enough to try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, good product","review":"Received this item promptly--- Easy to assemble- I have used it several times with good results- Seems to make hair very shiny and it looks better after drying-- Adjustable hood makes it very comfortable- I either use my computer or read while drying my hair- Only \\"knock\\" is that on high heat it is quite warm- Of course, after the summer this will be less of a problem. I am very satisfied with this product- and the price was outstanding-"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL CUSTOMER MANUFACTURER CUSTOMER SERVICE","review":"I bought this dryer and was so excited when I got it! It worked well just long enough for the Amazon warranty to expire. Then I had to deal with Helen of Troy-their customer service is awful! I sent the dryer to them and it took them a month to acknowledge receipt and then said that it was on back order. When I called to inquire about the b/o status they said they didn't have any idea when another would be in stock. I requested a refund and it took over a month to get the check. Now I am in search of a better dryer! BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run screaming from this dryer!","review":"Broke within a few months (the plastic part that connects the hood to the stand) and awful customer service from the distributor \\"Helen of Troy\\". I refused to give them another penny for shipping and repair so I got a connector from Lowes to hold the hood onto the stand. THEN, the heater broke and now I only have cold air.

It does not dry evenly, it leaves extra crispy dry pieces of hair, especially when one turns on the \\"ions\\". Additionally, the plastic piece that holds the dryer head to the pole broke within 3 months of non-heavy use (and, no, it was not dropped). It is extremely loud, so you cannot listen to the television - even on volume 70. I should not have been cheap, and should have just spent the extra hundred on a better dryer. BTW, right now I am drying my hair by angling the dryer head on the edge of the bed and my shoulders. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dryer falls over once in a while, poor design","review":"I bought this dryer for my salon studio because of the excellent price. I rarely use a dryer of this sort as I prefer to use the more gentle thermo-stimulator instead. Anyhow, I am not sure if a piece was missing when I bought it, but I put it together and occasionally it just falls apart at the bottom where the plastic legs snap into the base. I am glad this hasn't hit anyone in the head as the top is quite large. It is poorly weighted and poorly designed in my opinion. I am considering supergluing the entire bottom together, which would make it no longer portable, but could fix the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will love this dryer!!!","review":"I love this dryer. It works really well, fast and high quality. Just make sure you have a comfy chair and you're set."},{"rating":"2","title":"punishment into fun!","review":"This toy is great! We liked it from the start. I also tried to punish with it but found out that it is too fun for that. My son didn't get schoolwork done in time so he had to study for a half an hour after he finished his homework, when the time was up he wanted and continued playing with the turbo twist spelling for another 30 min or more before he finally had to put it away to go to bed. Thanks Leap frog for a way to finally make spelling fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the hassle","review":"This toy is a complete pain to set up! .... My problems occured with transfering words to the cartridge. I spent nearly 3 hours trying to get this to work. 1 hour with the service rep, who had no idea how to correct the problems, and 2 hours for myself. The toy does now work with the leaplink, and it was worth every hair that was pulled out of my head! Its a toy to keep my 7 year old's attention, and makes it fun! Just be prepared for some starting troubles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spelling Check","review":"My seven year old first grader received this gift for Christmas. Although she didn't \\"wish\\" for it, she does enjoy it. She brings it in the car all the time and plays with it. Sometimes it is difficult to hear what word the computer is asking the child to spell and that does present a little frustration. She is working around that however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy.. but hard to understand/frustraiting","review":"My son does like this turbo twist spelling a lot. He is 6. Really the only problem I have with this is that occationally the words or letters or sounds they say are hard to understand. That makes my 6 yr old frustraighted because he KNOWS how to spell the word they ask you for, but neither one of us could understand what they were asking for exactly. So he would put the wrong one in. EX. The toy would give the hint that the letter makes a VVvvv sound... but we both hear Bbbbb sound. So he gets it wrong. The voice is not very clear.Other than this, it's a great buy! The games are fun to play when you can understand it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"we love it and get wonderful results","review":"My son was having so much trouble with spelling. He was forever getting poor grades when he would get his test each week. I bought him this along with the mind station so that I could download his list each week to practice. When we told him that he would have to play games for homework he loved it. Now every week we download his new list to the toy and make a game out of it. The weeks that he has more trouble I can check his progress and see where he needs more help too. He takes it everywhere we go (sports, errands etc.) and every spelling test since he has gotten the Turbo Twist Spelling he either gets all the words right or maybe (rarely) one wrong. He and his sister both fight to use it. I have now gotten an extra cartridge for her list too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The big test","review":"I had this big test and i did not know how to spell any of my spelling words! I was so nervous! Then a week ago i saw this thing on the tv and it was called Turbo Twist spelling! I was so excited, so i went online and i went to the site and i got all the information on it and i bought it off the internet! On my test i got a 100!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner at last","review":"We have ben disappointed with all of our other Leapfrog products. They gather dust after the first day. This one has completely captured our five year old's imagination though. He takes it with him everywhere and ahppily practices his spelling words and the other games. He has ramped up the level on the hang-man type game to 36 becuase he like figuring out the long words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Additional Cost Involved","review":"For those of you who are looking to purchase the Turbo Twist Spelling, Math or other products; please be advised to visit the website at www.leapfrog.com first. The packaging shows that additional downloadable material is available from the website which adds new spelling words and games and gives you the ability to download your child's school spelling list. I was led to believe by the packaging that this was included in your purchase price but it is not. You must purchase this additional information at what I considered to be a high price considering the price of the product itself and the additional equipment that you must purchase to complete the downloads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Learning Tool","review":"We bought this item for my son last Christmas, but it wasn't until this year, when he entered the first grade, that he actually started using it to help him with his spelling lists. Being able to download your own spelling words is fantastic. The website offers generic spelling lists according to grade level that you can download. With this toy, my son can study in the car and at other times when I'm not around. After he's done studying, I can print out a progress report to see in what areas he may need help. Be careful not to \\"slam\\" the big button on the end when entering your answers. It has broken once, and luckily, my husband was able to take it apart and fix it. The Turbo Twist Spelling has great features like a \\"repeat\\" button and volume control. It says encouraging phrases and can even address your child by his first name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassle","review":"It is a major hassle to download the spelling words each week. You have to buy a special interface for the computer, you have to pay to download words, you have to navigate the horribly slow leapfrog site, and you can only download words \\"approved\\" by the experts at LeapFrog. Every week, between 6 & 30% of my son's spelling list is not on the approved list. Tech support is very uninformed on the product, and although they claim you can e-mail them to have words added to the list, there is never any response or action taken as a result of these e-mails. I am generally pleased with LeapFrog toys, but this one is a huge dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Do You Spell \\"cool\\"?","review":"We gave our 5 year old Turbo Twist Spelling a week ago. Already it is proving to be one of the smartest buys we've made. He had no trouble getting started without adult help. Major points awarded to Leap Frog for including a headphone jack and a wrist strap. Now that he's up to level 5, it's a fun family activity as he requires a stand-by helper for the tougher words. [the price] seems a little steep but is worth it when you consider the expansion capabilities possible with the Mind Station and available cartridges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Educational Toy","review":"I purchased this toy for my 5-year old son last month. The toy itself was fun to play. And the quality seems very good. But my son got bored after two weeks. The problem is the limited vocabulary. Though it is intended for 7 years and over he knows most words already (he is reading grade 3 material). I am thinking about buying him a Leaplink so it can be connected to the internet for downloading additional vocabulary. But I am still hesitating after seeing those negative reviews for the Leaplink."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful product!","review":"This product helps you soothe yourself after a long day at work, or just subsequently lugging the kids around from one function to another. This item allows you to not only exfolliate the dead skin cells and hard callous skin off of your feet, but it also brings on a soothing touch as you use the brush on the other side of the product to aid in the rinsing away of the granuals left by pumice stone.

Just listen to that guitar chucka chucka. Those horns blaring. That spoiled, preppy boy voice. Hey, these guys wore cable knit sweaters and had sun bleached hair parted on the side! This is a wild album, very smooth, kinda funky. Best know for \\"Love plus One\\", although \\"Boy meets Girl\\" blows by it with a revved up beat and hyperfast guitar. BONGOS! If you like one song off this album, you'll like the rest. Lucky for you it's available on CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick and the boys were great!","review":"Ah, the early '80s. Lots of cool stuff was floating around then, including this album. I bought it when it came out, and still have the vinyl album (so can't comment on the extra tracks on the CD, but they don't look like too much of importance anyway).I still love those horns, that tight rhythm section, the preppy sweater look, the great sense of FUN that this album projects. A lot of '90s bands need to get the clue that there a lot of us out here that do not care for the depressing, downer stuff (or the \\"pissed off\\"-sounding stuff) that they are dishing out now. Let's have something more POSITIVE.In the meantime, pick this album up. Great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent music from the 80's if you can believe it!","review":"I have this album somewhere in a box in a storage place.

The story focuses on the title character's mysterious malady. Every seven years, he falls into a trance-like state to emerge with one of two alternate personalities. This book has it all - insanity, death, a secret chamber, a ghost, revenge, duels, a court trial, star-crossed lovers, and a grisly ending. A must-read for fans of strange or gothic literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone interested in the origins of life","review":"Unlike most of the books which deal with theories of evolution, this one takes an objective non-partisan approach. The author sticks to the facts and depicts an incredible array of behaviors and facts regarding just about any life form found on earth. This can be sometimes a bit tedious, most of the time very interesting though. I do not think the style is appalling, it is scientific and precise. Chapter 12 (evolution and humanity) could justify the book by itself. I command the author for his amazing and thorough scientific approach, as well as his philosophical insights. In my search for truth and virtue about the humane, i stumbled upon too many one-sided books, and the more thorough i became the more confusing everything grew. I could have just bought this book. For it is also a book about faith, and what it means to be human. Mr Wesson, thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performed flawlessly","review":"I picked up two of these for $50 each and they worked great. I currently live in CA but being from MS I know what a hard rain is. These bags were purchased for a trip back to MS so during the 3800 mile rount trip we certainaly experienced rain. Of course I was worried when we hit the first hard rain, hard enough that cars were pulled over to the side due to lack of visibility, but after seeing no rain made it in I did not worry for the rest of the trip. The bags are easy to pack and transport. The outside cover fits snuggly around the bag and we had no flapping issues.If your considering this bag then stop considering and get it but don't pay the $114 asking price here. Got mine on ebay for $49 plus shipping so I was able to pick up two of these bags for just slightly more than they want for one here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Date","review":"This was assigned as a textbook for my Grad class.

The book is filled with facts and opinion polls, which only reveal the fickleness of the American public -- claiming that public schools are deplorable one year, and excellent the next. The authors inform the reader of what reforms didn't work, but offer few ideas of how to implement change. The book has potential, but falls unfavorably short of expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book for a report but not for pleasure reading","review":"I am a college student majoring in education and I was required to read this book for a coarse. This book focused on different reforms that were introduced over time and their success or failure. I did not enjoy this book. It was very difficult to read. It mainly consisted of facts and statistics which made it extremely boring. The author could of used more examples and a more familiar language to make the book less challenging to read. This book would be good for someone doing a report on school reform, but not so good for reading from cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Brief Intro to Educational Reform in the US","review":"Tinkering Toward Utopia is simply the best brief introduction to the history of educational reform in the US available. Anyone with a genuine interest in historical explanations of why grand schemes of school reform fail and why \\"crisis\\" is the way the US has tended to view its need for school reform, will be rewarded by this clearly written account. The book substitutes complex historical analysis for the usual simple-minded polemics of writing on education, but the authors do not weigh the book down with a lot of historical evidence and inpenetrable footnotes. I highly recommend this book for anyone who cares about the prospects of reforming public schools in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, non functional","review":"Don't buy it!!Only the setting to lower your voice works... somewhat.The other settings are useless.

I joined the Sci Fibook club for 10 cents in 1966 because it was a featured selection at the time. I went on to read many more great sci fi stories because of that. Another great affect after reading the book 10 or 15 times, I started looking up the parts of the body described in the story and by age 12 hadpretty good understanding of the anatnomy of the circulatory system. I knowit looks like a b-movie now but in 1966 it was the best high-tech looking movie around. The basic concept still is still facinating, going a long voyage without leaving the room.

It was so irrelevant that the movie never bothered to tell us whether the man was saved, and nobody cared. He was just an excuse to make a movie about traveling inside the human body.So we get to see red blood cells floating in liquid. We get to see the inside of the man's ear. This and that. Actually a fairly dopy movie.They even gave us a bad guy. One of the micronauts is a saboteur.The movie fails to give me the feeling that it takes place inside a human body. The plot fails to grab me. But it's a novel idea anyway. If a college kid put it together I'd say the kid did a fairly interesting job for a college project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quad Sci-Fi DVD set 17 review","review":"This set is a bargain for sci-fi and sfx movie fans.The Lost World, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,and Fantastic Voyage are sci-fi classics and hold uppretty well with age. The Towering Inferno does looka little out of place compare with other three.And the sets and clothes do look a bit dated also,but the movie is still fun to watch with allthe \\"old movie stars\\" doing their thing.

Unquestionably one of the most stylish and talented white soul divas ever, the robustness of this album is something to savor from beginning to end, and it shifts flawlessly between the shimmering ballads that she's best known for and a few slightly more uptempo but no less stylish dance-poppers. The beautiful ballads \\"I Give You Everything\\" and \\"Goodbye\\" are particularly good, though there is no song on the entire album not worth hearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"overcharged for shipping","review":"I ordered more than one of the product and they more than doubled the shipping charge even though the product arrived in a single package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Risotto of All Time","review":"If you like Lipton chicken noodle soup, or a close facsimile, enjoy this hot garbage that the fine people of Alessi Imported dish out and claim is \\"Italian\\".This would be true if \\"Italian\\" meant salty bile.

Operating in a region that gives him his name. Doc and his crew become embroiled after they find out about a ship that is 'on his list of scalps'.The Ogre himself manages to fight Doc to a standstill, in a man on man hand to hand brawl. Both Doc and Monk run afoul of a group of Amazons, victims etc. of the Ogre and his depradations.The titian-haired Kina la Forge would probably get along well enough with Belit, that is for sure. This character and her band add a little more interest to the book, raising it to rate above average. After disentangling themselves from such feminine hindrances, Doc goes on a one man assault mission.In the end, you wonder if any beasts of the deep enjoy roasted Ogre?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book started off really well. The story of Hanna was riveting. As I read on to discover that the narrator was Johanna, the grandaughter, I became totally disenchanted. What person could recreate the story of their mother AND grandmother with such rich detail with only old photographs and newspaper clippings? Who can look into the heart of another and know how they feel, especially when that person has passed away or is lying in a nursing home mute and unresponsive? I highly doubt that even with all of the diaries in the world someone could tell such a story. I was very disappointed with this book and have to agree with one of the other reviewers here on another point...Hanna only had one daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generations anchored together","review":"The captivating story of three generations of women and their families. Culture, current events and circumstance determine their options but the force of each woman's personality and character defines the ultimate shape of their lives. Beautifully written.

For a few days and nights I lived with Hanna, Anna, and Johanna - all three of them remarkable women in their times. It is very much a \\"women's book\\", I cannot picture men liking it that much, because they don't know (and they CAN'T) anything about the sometimes difficult relationships between mothers and daughters. This book even taught me a lesson: talk to each other as long as there is time, don't put it off. It's a wonderful book that makes you laugh and cry! withought being KITSCH."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any grandmother, mother or daughter","review":"\\"The years came and went, the children came and left. The worst of getting old is not tiredness and aches and pains, but that time rushes on, so quickly that in the end it doesn't seemto exist. It's Christmas and then it's Easter. It's a clear winter's day and then a hot summer's day. In between is a vacuum.\\" The writing is beautiful, the characters unforgettable, a wonderful generational story. A bit confusing at first, trying to keep track of who's who, but worth the effort. No matter where in the world, this story shows the great opression of women throughout history and their roles as mothers, wives, daughters and granddaughters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I read the reviews before wasting my money","review":"I was excited about this book but by page 100 I was done. It was too much work keeping track of characters that are not interesting. The awkward writing style is impossible - it must have lost something in the translation. Wish I'd read reviews before wasting my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated and confusing...","review":"When I read the book cover and the fact that it is #1 International Bestseller, I couldn't wait to read Hanna's Daughters. I love to read and I gave this one my best shot, but somewhere around page 200 this book became a chore. It had such potential. I'm wondering if something got lost in the translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"I found this story so moving. It made me realize that no matter who you are, mother or daughter, father or son, each of us is a Real person. We all have stories of love, fear, anger, etc. to share AND we should share with our family members. A very emotionally filled book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragmented, disjointed POV as well as in its telling","review":"Love generational, historical books that weave families and events. Unfortunately this one reads like a series of unconnected sentences with unrelated facts. I felt that none of the characters were developed to the point that they were real."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society","review":"Interesting book. I learned a lot about the Island of Guernsey and World War II's effects on it and the inhabitants.Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money.","review":"I cringed while trying to get through this tedious book.

Better luck next time Ms. Fredricsson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanna's Daughters is a wonderful book to share with the women of your family.","review":"Hanna's Daughters is a wonderful book to share with the women of your family. I loved the three perspectives of Hanna, Joanna and Anna. I love how it shows evolution of society and practically women's roles over the span of the last three generations; the industrial revolution, first and second world wars and sexual revolution. This book will help women understand their mothers and their grandmothers. I love this book and have read and reread read it on several occasions. The only issue I have with this novel is that the translation is at times poor and the syntax and sentence structure seems inverted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Point of View Changes","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, but after three weeks I was only on page 188 and still couldn't figure out who was telling the story. Flagrant POV shifts confused me and two-dimensional characters made me feel as if I were \\"looking\\" at someone's words. Just couldn't connect with the time or place or feel empathy for their woes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder if it was as depressing to write as it was to read?","review":"The front of my cover reads \\"an uplifting family saga\\", but I found nothing uplifting about it. This was one of the most depressing and dull books I've read in a while. Perhaps it has some redeeming value as \\"literature\\", but an enjoyable read it is not. Hanna, Johanna, and Anna are mothers and daughters who are, simply put, always sad. The idea of happiness is occasionally contemplated, but then decidedly dismissed. I read to the end just to see if anything was ever going to happen. Finally something did. They died."},{"rating":"1","title":"A drag to finish","review":"There were too many characters that were similiar. I couldn't keep up with who was who and after awhile, I just didn't care anymore. I read this book for a book club and felt obligated to finish it. I don't understand why so many readers connected with the characters. I guess I'm in the minority though."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate mess.....","review":"I found this book so badly written (or translated, at the very least) that it actually made me angry. Such poor use of language, and the attempts at dialect were plain embarrassing. I only persevered reading it because of a friends' recommendation, and it got worse as it went on.The content of the story, if you could find it, was passable, and might even have made a good book! but the way it was delivered was a huge handicap. It is a very sad reflection on modern life and literature that women are so desperate for a discussion of womens' roles and relationships that a work so lacking in skill with language,structure and characterisation can become a popular hit.Perhaps these women have never read anything of lasting merit to recognize the truely mediocre (if not the execrable) when they see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing characters, confusing read at times.","review":"I found this book very good and eagerly looked forward to reading it in the evenings. I became absorbed with the characters and the stories they told. I did not find so compelling the ties of mothers to their daughters. The first half of the book I found confusing, and had to really think who was who. I also could not understand at times who the narrator was. I did not understand the fascination with the 'sofa'. I will read it again sometime in the far future, as it wasn't a bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"Could not keep track of who's who. Back and forth in time with like names: Hanna, Johanna, Anna etc. Both me and Mom (avid readers) got tired of trying to figure out who's who. Hard to read in bed at night, usually gave up and went to sleep"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant or just so-so","review":"The book contains an interesting collection of short stories. Being a SF master, Aldiss cannot escape the fate of old-fashioned writing. His style resembles the \\"Classics\\" of SF, and is not to the taste of the Matrix watching generation.Just like what others had said, the first three \\"Supertoy\\" stories are good, then the rest becomes rather irrelevant. Kubrick and Spielberg seem to have good taste, in mainly adopting the first story in the excellent movie A.I. It's worth buying the book just to read the first story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Book If You Are Drawn To It Because of A.I.","review":"Although A.I. is based off this book, it should be noted it's loosely based. The short stories in this book that are on the supertoy theme are only a very small portion of the book. They do not lend any insight, (as many other book which movies are based off of do), to what was going on in the movie or provide any answers to the Kubrick/Speilberg turn of events in the movie that made you wonder what was really going on in their heads. This book may in fact be an excellent book, but I only bought it for the basis of being the basis for the movie and was sorely disappointed. If only I had known it provided nothing much to A.I. except a very loose plot for the beginning of it and some names. I know this isn't a glowing review, but I only wish I had known it didn't give me that information before I had bought it and perhaps I'll prevent this book from being bought by a reader who can't appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A.I. is the best of the stories in this collection","review":"The three short stories that make up what we all know as A.I., are the best of the lot in this collection. As Kubrick told Aldiss, he either writes exceptionally, or just so-so. Go see the movie. It does deviate from the short story; but, is well worth the nine bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I bought this book based on the connection to the movie A.I. I am always interested in how a science fiction story or novel has been converted to the screen. I was suprised to find that all the stories except for the cover title were written recently, rather than in the time period of Supertoys, which was 1969. I have read a little Aldiss over the years and find him an OK science fiction writer with novels like Helliconia Summer. I thought the other two Supertoys stories, while written 25 years after the original, did a good job of keeping the tone of the original, they just weren't that interesting. The remaining stories were not enjoyable to me at all and I finally gave up without finishing the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great...","review":"Like many here, I found this book because of the connection to the film A.I. However, even though the film itself had it's own flaws, the story it was based on was lacking itself: no obstacles, albeit potentially interesting characters, and not a very satisfying conclusion...having me asking \\"And...?\\"\\"Supertoys Last All Summer Long,\\" the lead story, was followed by two other sequels in the same book, but they also don't really have anything to say, no characters to latch onto, and no satisfying conclusions. Unfortunately, this basically describes the stories in the book overall.Writing short stories is difficult: Having a beginning, middle, end...and feel \\"done;\\" and, as aforementioned, having characters that we as readers find interesting and remember. However, the stories in this book read as if they were ideas that still needed developing."},{"rating":"1","title":"only \\"supertoy\\" is worth to read","review":"The supertoy story is quite different from the film, but I still love it because it gives another angle to see what happens to the the supertoy. In actual fact, I love this more than the film. However, the rest of the stories are horrible. Maybe the author want to espress his worries and negative views about the future of human life. However, he kept repeating the same idea all over the other stories, which really makes me fall asleep. Some of them I think they are NOT stories but simply author's theories about future and the bad sides of human beings. Sometimes it is really hard to understand what the writer want to say. In my point of view, the publisher just put all those stories together and make a BOOK to sell. Only the few pages about the supertoy is worth to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's better to laugh than cry!!!!","review":"Whether you are in the corporate structure or at a mom-and-pop shop you can learn from and relate to this book.Mr. Talbott utilizes a swift and humorous pen to teach and entertain page after page.

I am a great fan of Counting Crows, and Raslo is moving in a similar direction though, if anything, has taken wordsmithing to the next level. The more I listen, the more layers are revealed. The arrangements are simple - though in some cases a bit forced - but the fundamental songs are gems, pure poetry. On first take, \\"Bleed me dry\\" has the hooks, but after a while it's songs like \\"Woman from Nashville\\" or \\"Letter to Sheye\\" that really touch you. The last song \\"Drifting\\" is a wild, Bukowski-esque story that just blew me away. The live spoken word pieces are pretty lo-fi, but the dynamic of the performance comes through. For all its rough edges this, for me, is a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds great.","review":"Very pleased with the sound and performance I am getting out of this muffler.

Currently this topic is the focus of much interest and is one of the most active areas of marine mammology research. Richardson et al. do an excellent job explaining the technical information, and have organized the book chapters in a logical sequence.

She was raped once, but she obviously got over that by the time that she was forced to publicly have sex with the \\"hero\\". The sex was boring, not at all hot. The repetitive use of the terms passion whore and passion nipple were beyond ridiculous. The story didn't work because there was NO chemistry between the couple and the plot was undeveloped and ridiculous. The plot could have worked with more detail and character depth, and the sex could have benefitted from the same. This book was bad enough to deter me from purchasing any more of Ms. Devine's books. There are definitely BETTER erotic and paranormal novels out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it if you don't like explicit sex in your books!","review":"Sex, sex, sex, a little plot, more sex, vampirism, sex, paranoia, kinky sex, debasing sex, and other variations on sex, but it's mostly sex. And very explicit. But, then, I'm sure some people like that. This should be sold as erotic romance or erotic fiction, not historical romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"absouloutely awful","review":"This is one of the worst romance novels I have ever read. I am thoroughlly surprised that I finished it, and the only reason that I did was to try to understand the plot. The scenes were poorly described, and the overall book left you with a \\"did I miss something?\\" feeling. The characters were totally bewildering, They were so far off what any human would truly act like it wasn't even a good attempt at fiction. This was a poorly written book all around. I read this book after having heard that Thea Devine was a great romance writer, I am sorely disappointed.

This book was hard for me even to finish and until about the last 50 pages I didn't care if I finished it at all. The sex was graphic but not romantic. I didn't like her vampire theme and the climax of the story (where good finally meets evil here) was just so lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want soft porn versus erotica, this book's for you!","review":"Sorry, I like erotica as much as the next person, but this book should be more correctly labeled for soft porn. In the first few \\"sex scenes\\", I was into it, but after that--I was really turned off by the language and attitudes of the characters. I understand that the beginning called for the way they acted; they were being forced into it by their captors. But after that, their scenes together never got any closer or more intimate. It was the same method and language as if they were still putting on a show for their captor. I have only gotten half way through the book and I am not even sure it is worth finishing. Yes, I want the really steamy scenes - but it is much better reading (for me at least) if there is some sort of chemistry and feelings there, even if they hated each other that would be something."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVEN IF IT'S THE LAST BOOK ON EARTH...","review":"Like others have said the begining starts off at a fast past but after that you feel like you are reading the same thing over and over again, not a very interesting plot. And even the most desperate woman on earth would be bored after the 30th time non- emotional sex spread way too much thru out the story. The publisher who let this go must be jobless by now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"[Bad] book, stupid plot","review":"I bought this book because it was compared with Anne Rice's work. This book is nowhere near the quality of book Anne Rice puts out. It's chapter after chapter of sex with a little plot that has a very speedy wrap-up (as though the writer couldn't come up with anything better). The plot seemed as though it was thrown in to try to make the book a little interesting while the sex was the main part of the story. I would never ever buy another book by this author. This book is not even worth the one star I was forced to vote but that was the lowest one I could give it."},{"rating":"1","title":"undesirable","review":"Everyone on the island, Desiree, near Florida seems to be after Silva Armitage, a penniless, naive orphan being raised with her twin brother by a vodoo priestess.Although Estavez Rodriguez and Pedro Ortega are also after Silva, the incredibly rich owner of Desiree, Brian Cameron, wins Silva by offering to help get her brother out of jail if she'll marry him. Silva is so detached from the rest of the world, she doesn't know what a \\"present\\" or \\"honeymoon\\" is. Brian spends most of the book trying to help her get around in civilization since Silva is hopelessly clueless when they visit modern Miami.Basically, this story just didn't grab me. The posturing and squabbling of the islanders bored me, the heroine was a naive idiot, and the hero was overbearing and self-serving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for fine motor skills and pretend play","review":"The only reason why my overall rating was 4 and not 5 stars is because I don't understand why these are called \\"soft peelable fruits\\" There is nothing soft about them, they are hard plastic. They are attached by velcro and are peelable and come with a plastic knife as well so you can pretend to cut them also. I bought them because my daughters speech therapist had them, I thought they were great for not only teaching the sounds and names of the foods but also for developing fine motor skills cutting, and pulling apart the fruits and vegetables. It is also good for developing pretend play. My daughter is 2 1/2yr and has down syndrome, she pretends to feed them to her baby when I ask her to but when she plays with them and she doesn't know I'm watching she likes to pull them all apart which is great for manipulating with her fingers and building up strength for fine motor development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"My two and a half year old son loves these. He loves the sound of the velcro as the knife cuts through it. The pieces are all big enough so there isn't a choking hazard, but kids still need to be watched closely (one of his friend's put the banana in his mouth and was biting like a rabid dog trying to chew on it). This is all hard plastic so it's very durable, no soft hollow cheapy plastic. The bag is nice too for cleanup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My 3 year old totally got off on this when i gave it to him. he loves eating his fruits and veggies and likes to watch me when i cut them for him, so i thought id get him this so he can pretend to do it himself. its really neat how the veggies stick together with the velcro, then when my son uses the plastic knife it seperates like he really cut it. my only complaint would be that the little tote it comes with doesnt hold all the veggies, its too small so my son can only take a few of them with him if we happen to be going somewhere and he wants to bring them. i wish i had these when i was little instead of those hollowed out plastic ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED it!","review":"My son is 21 months and he loves this product. Initially the velcro is a little tough to seperate the pieces but after the second time it was ok. We spend hours taking the fruits apart by hand and also cutting the pieces with the plastic knife. It's educational as well as he is learning colours and food names and learning about eating pretend food vs real food. I would recommend this for boys or girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"so fun & cute","review":"They look quite durable and are detailed with some of what we do with real fruits and vegetables.

I think the little carry bag and the 'crunch' the veggies make when cut is pretty neat. The onion is a little tricky sometimes and the peas don't like to stay in the pod - not a problem for us - highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"18-month's favorite toy","review":"Got this for our 17-month old son for Christmas. He's hardly stopped playing with it for the past month. I had no idea he would enjoy it this much. He loves to peel the orange, banana, and corn and chop the onion and cauliflower. As he grows, I'm sure he'll get better at putting the peels back on, but he's able to take them all apart and put a few back together. We make vegetable soup and sometimes make deliveries with the veggies in the back of a toy dumptruck. It's hard plastic so it's extremely durable and can be picked up at the end of play and stored in the canvas shopping bag. I like this toy as it is something that can grow with him for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for 2 year old!","review":"I purchased this as a gift for my 2 1/2 year old nephew.

She still plays with it at 5 years old. It's fun for kids to see how some of the fruits/vegetables that adults use come to play. They can see for themselves and actively take part in peeling bananas, taking the pea out of the pod, opening the orange and opening up a peach. It's durable and the shopping bag fits everything nicely and neatly. It gives the kids a feeling of being older and teaches them that fruits and vegetables are fun. I highly recommend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great (tiny!) product","review":"This item is great. The fruit is sturdy, not squishy plastic. My daughter loves these. My only surprise was that the bag it comes in is tiny. I was expecting a much larger bag. The fruit and veggies are great, though a little smaller than I expected. I don't think that's a problem, because it's just the right size for small people!Much better quality than the mass-pack foods that are full of junk foods and are flimsy. These are well made and sturdy, should hold up to lots of playtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this toy","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was 2 - now over a year later she still loves to use it in her play kitchen.

I'm buying it for my niece who is turning 2. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Play Food","review":"The food is pretty realistic allowing you to peel and \\"cut\\" into it with the play knife. I found though, that it had too many parts to take apart. This would be better for an older child - maybe 31/2 - 4. I bought it for a 2 year old and while he loves taking it apart, his mom has to keep putting it back together. It does have nice detail - pieces are held together with velcro dots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for our 2 year old","review":"A friend gave this to our daughter for her 2nd birthday and she loves it!

I received it before I went to teach youth group, so I decided to take it out and play while they ate their snack. They thougt it was great! My toddler loves it. She likes to put them back together, but also try to mix and match. I really love how the hook velcro is yello, and the loop is white, so I can tell her to put the yellow to the white. It is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garden Fresh Fruit & veggies","review":"I did a lot of on line reading to make a purchase that was fun, educational and of great quality. The Kidoozie delivered on all levels. We bought this for our two year old Granddaughter and she loves it. The best part is that some on the fruit and veggies have many pieces and at this point they are a bit too complex for her, so we pulled those aside for the next few months. As she gets a bit older her parents will add these to her kitchen. In the mean time she has quite a bit to play with and loves cutting her own food. The little extra part is she is relating to great healthy food choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun vegetables","review":"I purchased this set of fruits and vegetables for my son and nephew to use at their grandparent's house. I think they are really neat, though my set did not have a pineapple. Both kids are a little bit on the young side to use these (1.5 and almost 2) but they both enjoy them. They like to take them apart, but haven't quite gotten around to putting them back together.They seem like they'll be pretty durable. I like toys that will be used for a long time, so that's a huge plus for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"My 2 year old daughter owns lots of Melissa and Doug products but they can be pricey so when I saw this on lightening deal for $9.99, I snapped it up.

But after reading this one I am forced to the conclusion that Mr. Hogan was doing some bad drugs at the time he wrote it. It is muddy, murky, and overlong.It bears almost no resemblance to anything else he has written.It is confused and confusing. It is boring and unsatisfying.Avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing from one of my favorite authors","review":"Hogan is possibly my favorite Sci-Fi author, but this one does not deliver at all. Had it not been Hogan, I would have quit halfway through, and I have rarely put down a book in my life - especially because I am picky about what I read in the first place.As mentioned in other reviews, it's not only confusing but there is just no compelling story here. Even though we're seeing some familiar characters from previous books, there's nothing I really care about in the story. I don't care about Jevlenese being taken over, I have no investment in them. Nothing is really threatening the main characters until very late in the story - too late for you to care.And the people we are supposed to care about are not likable. The new female character introduced is not compelling either.I SO wanted to like this book, and I struggled and pushed on, but I was only relieved when it was done, not satisfied.

As mentioned earlier, the style may be a bit dry for the casual reader. There are two areas in which I would have liked to see more details:Throughout the book, there are only passing mentions of what is going on elsewhere in the world at the same time. I usually find these \\"synchronizations\\" very useful in a history book.The final two chapters (about the Ptolemaic period and the Roman period) are not nearly as well written or as thorough as the rest. It is as if they were written as an addendum. Hopefully, a later edition might address these issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a helpful narrative","review":"Less a \\"history\\" of ancient Egypt than a collection of essays, presented in chronological order, on TOPICS in the history of ancient Egypt, each presented by a different academic. There is no central narrative presenting the story of Egypt, the topics and writing style are far too arcane for the average reader. I like to think I am reasonably intelligent and I know I am interested in this area, but reading these essays was painful...do British academics have no sense of how to make their material come alive? Perhaps they take it as a badge of honor that only other academics find their material enjoyable. It is as if these authors went out of there way to make this history as dry as possible -- and the disjointed nature of the book left me disappointed.

I am currently taking Intensive Catalan courses, and learned more in a week than I learned practicing with the book. If one is able to aquire a dictionary, and a copy of Xuriguera's \\"Els verbs Catalans Conjugats\\", you will move faster.

He presupposes that reincarnation cannot possibly be true, according to the precepts of materialism, and presents a series of arguments and non-arguments to that effect. While clearly a very intelligent man, Edwards seems to be thinking and arguing on a different \\"plane.\\" For instance, he attempts to disprove the existence of God in his \\"Irreverent Postscript.\\" While myself an atheist, I doubt any believer in God would be fazed by the arguments therein, simply because Edwards is thinking in completely different terms than those with whom he is attempting to argue. In short, you will enjoy this book if you are determined not to believe in reincarnation. Otherwise, I don't think you'll be impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reincarnation: A Critical Examination Proves Nothing","review":"This book did not prove that reincarnation does not exist. I am a skeptic and I did not feel that the book make any good points. The author just stated how others might support reincarnation, but did not make an honest attempt to refute it. I thought it could have been written better. The points used to disprove reincarnation could have been used to 'disprove' anything such as God, heaven or hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reductionistic view of a worthy subject","review":"This book claims to examine reincarnation from a skeptical perspective. However, a true skeptic has an agnostic approach to the subject he/she is examining. One the other hand, Edwards (as well as most of the people who write for Prometheus Books) is a debunker.

Both women seem to have romantic relationships with men in their past or present. AKA maybe Bisexual? Or was this just a friendship movie. I definately saw no friendship with benefits.

I have a feeling that the authors are only good writers and researchers who did a good job in summarizing information about this subject from different sources and make it a book.

Together, they provide a solid base of knowledge to the new bearded dragon owner.One note: Don't feed Kale to young dragons, or as a primary food source for adults. It's been found to bind calcium, keeping calcium from being absorbed by the dragon. This can be detrimental to the development of these fast growing lizards.

This isn't an exhaustive introduction, but a precise one. In it, he describes briefly the preliminary training required (2-4 years is a suggested minimum); then goes on to introduce the topics of religious magic, ceremonial magic, deific magic, necromancy, astral projection, elemental magic, and natural magic. He also provides concise practical exercises that are easy to understand.It should be noted that this book is an introduction, a concise summary of magic. As such, it doesn't go into very much detail on any one topic. But if one is looking for a concise, no-nonsense introduction to this subject, this is a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece in every facet of film making.","review":"A genuine classic of the sci-fi genre, Death Machine kidnaps the audience into a dark world of unfulfilled desires, humanitarian terrorists, and psycho death bots. Brad Dourif delivers yet another oscar caliber perfomance as Jack Dante, a man whose heart is torn between explicit love for his upper management and his primordial urge to terminate all forms of life. A triumvirate of warriors guided by a needlessly painted man must put an end to Dante's wave of destruction--THAT IS THE DEATH MACHINE!!!! And boy, does Mayhem ensue. Stylized with crisp cinematography, a pulse pounding soundtrack, spine-chilling dialogue, and ingenious plotting, Death Machine made its way onto no Top Ten lists of 1995---EXCEPT MINE!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a psycho death bot on the loose!","review":"Wow... This movie was amoung the worst movies I've seen in a very very good way. I agree, the death machine alone makes it worth the rental. There are two characters I have seen before in any movie all together and the rest of the cast I have not. Makes for a good movie in my book. The acting was actually not that bad but the plot was laughable in a very good way. Aside from all of that, my favorite part was the terminology and the quotes that they used. Any movie that can actually get away with say \\"a quad-matrix googaplactic of memory coprocessors\\" deserves some special recognition in my book. This movie is amazing. There is no way around it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourite movies ever","review":"This one is in the Robocop vein of futuristic 'b'movies.Acting is excellent from top to bottom with a lot of original and funny dialogue.The robo creature is genuinely scary .The plot actually makes sense with good motivations.I've watched this many many times.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Firmly seated in the pantheon of horrible movies","review":"Let's begin: this is by far one of the top 10 worst movies i've ever seen.

I hope soon - because my tape is nearly worn out ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"An almost complete waste of time..","review":"The film struck me as quite incompetent in its execution.

It's not half as good as ANY outer limits episode. Poor acting, laughable plot. I appreciate many odd and low budget movies, this isn't one of them. The Sci-Fi Channel wouldn't even play this one at 3 in the morning on a weekday.

His attempts to \\"bring out\\" and \\"socialize\\" Highly Sensitive Personalities, Introverts and those with Schizo-social disorders borders on criminal. Starting with p.231, the author spins a rather slanted bias in favor of extroversion, brashly assuming that introverted patients need \\"fixed\\" if they are to be productive and happy in a group therapy environment. Such gross insensitivity and ignorance is unfortunate, misleading, and inexcusable in a scholarly text such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEORY AND REALITY","review":"Dr. Yalom is obviously an intelligent individual who appeals to graduate students in psychology with little if no knowledge of group psychotherapy. In theory everything is wonderful, interesting, and exciting. In practice, well that is another story. It will be interesting to see how well one is able to translate the book into actual practice where the value and importance of any text becomes glaringly known. Having been a student and clinician and professor, I can attest to the bewilderment students experience when they begin running groups and this book is not one that a novice can fall back on to survive the trials and tribulations of leading groups. It is a good read, like Freud is a good read but needs to be viewed more in a historical sense rather than a practical sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Novel of Psychotherapy","review":"Even though the Yalom's textbook has helpful information, it reads and appears to be written like a very long novel. I would have preferred to have a detailed, concise breakdown of the information rather than a long story like textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORED TO TEARS","review":"It is about time Yalom stopped expending his already out of touch books on group therapy. His first edition was an asset in the beginning development of group therapy but his many editions are just another way of selling books. In many cases his more recent editions give graduate students an unrealistic and often out of touch perspective on group psychotherapy. One only has to watch one of Yalom's group therapy videos to really see the detachment and lack of feeling this man produces in his work. The book was a bore but there will always be those groupies through cognitive disonance who will aplaud its great contribution. I feel sorry for the clients who come to their groups if they model themselves after Yalom. Sort of similar to all those Benjamin Spock babies running around after their mothers raised their kids by his book and are now completely neurotic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is it???","review":"I am writing this review so as to let you know that I have not received the book yet.I do not have any problem with all the other products I am ordering.Please let me know.Thanks a lotKourouni Roula"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"this is a great book for group therapists, a combination of psychodynamic and existential perspectives with a focus on the here and now"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Consistent with the history of Yalom and Group Process books, the current book is strong in theory and with practical translations for readers of all experience levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is the fundamental book for anyone who does group work.

It's not often a novel makes me cry, with this one I couldn' t stop crying, but laughing too.Jewel the heroine has such a wry way of looking at the world that we can identify with her easily, yet she is full of love and does her best to cope like everyone else with some horrendous circumstances. Hers is compelling first-person narrative and the talented author gives her a very strong voice, part comedian part earth goddess, all woman.Every character is a little jewel that sparkles, and the hunky heartthrob Malachi is even to melt your bones.

I will definitely be reading more by this fabulous author."},{"rating":"2","title":"compelling characters","review":"I enjoyed this book with its compelling characters.

The characters were wonderfully exciting and different and had such depth. The ending had me in tears--which seldom happens. It was wonderful.Sadly, there was a middle which was slow and repetitive. Okay, she was worried about her son--over and over and over. Okay, her father wasn't speaking to her and that broke her heart--over and over and over. Okay, Michael's (and Malachi's) father did a terrbile thing, but we hear about how this has ruined Malachi over and over and over--get counseling!!!!!

Really nothing else to say, all is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apt title - forgettable new album from Krauss","review":"I'm sorry to say that Alison Krauss appears to have sold out to pop music - very little evidence of her bluegrass roots despite the great players (Douglas, Bush, Block and other Union Station members). Sadly, the songs aren't particularly memorable though \\"Ghost in the House\\" was worth waiting for. Hardly any of Alison's great fiddle playing or Ron's banjo - the more subtle bluegrass string rhythms are replaced by drums (allbeit tastefully done - like everything else). Technically superb but missing the honesty of \\"That Old Feeling\\" - I'll go back to my Claire Lynch collection again.I Clarke (Bluegrass Fan, N Ireland)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown","review":"I must admit to being letdown by this CD. While I am all for artists expanding their horizons this one does not come across as Alison expanding hers as much as it does her contracting them. As pop goes it is clearly better than 99% of the stuff that gets played on commercial radio, but the majesty of her earlier work just isn't as evident here."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"Yeah, I used this album also. For putting my kids and me to sleep. Where is the old Alison? I miss her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bluegrass but still well worth it.","review":"I've read alot of these reviews that say the album is too pop,too mellow or that Alison has sold out in an effort to go main stream. Well...FORGET ABOUT IT!!!!Alison's contract with Rounder ( so I've read, I'm no authority) is that she must make one \\"band\\" album and one solo in rotation. While the music on this new one is GREAT, it definatley isn't Union Station material, no offence to the boys, but hey it's just not Bluegrass.Bluegrass is great, but I know I like listening and playing a variety of genres, I'm sure Alison feels the same way;she was smart enough to make it a solo effort cause she knows her guys are best on bluegrass.For the hard core Krauss fan, I recommend this album, for bluegrass lovers, look her up next time...she won't disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget about it says it all","review":"A huge Alison Krause fan bites the dust. This cd is DULL ! Gone are the clever arrangements that made the band so popular. It seems she recorded this one half asleep. I knew they were going that way by their last cd, but I bought it anyway. If you plan to buy it, FORGET ABOUT IT !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget About It","review":"It's too bad the first review listed is so negative. I wasn't enthralled with this album the first time I heard it but it is one of those that you have to listen to a few times and then it grows on you and you find yourself constantly humming the songs in your head. The lyrics have true meaning here but my favorite part (right now) is the backup. She's got the best going for her. The last tune \\"Dreaming My Dreams With You\\" with Dolly P. is so perfect for saying 'I love you' to her listeners. I think this is terrific listening music and I'm a fiddler so I know a little about music. Just enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alison Krauss","review":"Lovely sweet voice, pitch perfect tone! You'll love this album! Absolutely splendid backing musicians make this a wonderful combination! Not a duff track anywhere either!Many thanks Alison.

This is where you turn off the lights, you close your eyes, you sit back in your chair, and you let the music and her voice drift you away on paradise island. This ain't no bluegrass release, it ain't the kind you put in your car to get you speedin, this is wonderful, peaceful, relaxing music. It's perfect, there's no weak song, arrangement is perfect, her voice is perfect... This is a masterpiece. Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's won me over","review":"Since I'm not a fan of bluegrass or country music, I had never heard of Alison until this CD. This would be considered by most of her fans to be a crossover recording, but it isn't top 40 pop, it isn't anything categorizable, it's just damn great music. The songs are well chosen, beautifully sung, and the musicians are flawless. I sincerely hope Alison will do more recordings like this, as I for one feel her talents are too great to languish only in the bluegrass genre. If you like Garth Brooks better as Chris Gaines, anything by Barbara Kessler or Lucinda Williams, you need this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different side to Alison Krauss, but an excellent CD!","review":"This is definitely a different side to Alison Krauss. However, it is a refreshing change of pace with haunting melodies and lyrics. I have listened to this album over and over and cannot shake the melodies from my head, and constantly find myself humming the tunes from her album at work. A definite pleasure to listen to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"confirmed country-hater addicted to Alison","review":"I have to admit, I am NO FAN of Country or Blue Grass music, but the honesty and gentle sensitivity with which Alison Krauss delivers a lyric keeps my attention with every song. Alison's uniquely haunting and beautiful vocal style, coupled with her sharp intelligence in production choices makes her newest release \\"Forget About It\\" a superior offering.Sophisticated, elegant, understated, and exceptionally well crafted, this cd shines as one of the best collections of songs to suit a Sunday afternoon, or a rainy evening.Alison Krauss is a treasure! \\"Forget About It\\" is worth your time, and certainly worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"I am a hard core fan of Alison's as I have every album she has done, and I have seen her in concert twice. This is most assuredly NOT her best work. Where did this stuff come from? I am so disappointed, as I feel she has maybe sold out to the money gubbers here, which I guess I never felt she would do. This is fluff music, Alison. Please go back to your earlier works and listen carefully. Now listen to this new album. Ask yourself, \\"is this is the way I want my career headed?\\" Hmmmmm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krauss Has Another Hit","review":"Run, don't walk to the nearest CD shop and buy this album. \\"Ghost In This House\\" alone is worth the walk and the cost. She sang this tune on Austin City Limits program some time ago, and I wept and fretted that it would never be available on CD, but here it is. Thanks Alison!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even a non-country guy likes it!","review":"I'm not a big country music fan and not that knowledgeable about Bluegrass. But, this is an excellent album which manages to straddle both the country/bluegrass and pop genres very successfully. Ms. Krauss has a beautiful voice and the musical chops to match. The album is a bit on the melancholy side, but not overly so. It is melodic, peaceful and well produced. The music is more mature and peaceful than that of many other country cross-overs into the pop realm. Ms. Krauss is obviously comfortable with her voice and phrasing and never strays too far from her roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinking about buying? Forget about it.","review":"So this is Alison Krauss's \\"pop\\" album? This CD has no pop -- and no snap or crackle, either. I grew quickly tired of the whispery whining and mid-tempo, sleep-inducing melodies. There is a sweet gentleness to Alison's voice, but she desperately needs to let her band find a beat behind her. If her next album is any slower, check for a pulse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album isn't even close to her previous efforts","review":"I bought this album, unheard, based on how much I've enjoyed Alison's bluegrass music for years. I own every album she's ever recorded (I think) and expected this to match up. It doesn't come close. It's elevator music from start to finish, although there are one or two memorable tracks on the album. I even listened to it several times to see if it would grow on me but it didn't. The music just didn't inspire me to pay attention. Elevator music. Bah! Alison, where have you gone??"},{"rating":"1","title":"First Kruass CD I have not bought!","review":"This is the first Alison album I have not bought.

I find it to be very calming and soothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHAULK ANOTHER ONE UP FOR ALISON!","review":"If you think that she is one of the best singers out there, then you will like this ablum. Definitely not the traditional Alison, but this is one album that she has worked on for a long time. With the new marriage to Lyle Lovett's bass player, and the new baby being born, she has turned inside for the songs. Most are slow ( and self-expressed by AKUS has being depressing) but in the way which you can reflect upon your feelings. I wished that there was some faster songs, and once in awhile have Alison let go with her fiddle, and of course, her voice. But not to say that this is her best effort towards trying the very industry that has given her 4 CMA's( female singer for the year, single of the year to name a few), Over a dozen Grammy's, and not giving her any airplay. If you are a traditional bluegrass listener, then this is not for you. I liked the way she has gone her own way and keeps trying new things to get listener's attention. Definite keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great women singer, musican......","review":"Picked up this cd just the other day along with Kim Richey and Cherly Wheeler and I really hit the paydirt. This Cd is terrific, so many great songwriters will be proud to hear their compositions take on a new life with Alison's singing and haunting arrangements. I also get goose-bumps listening to songs like \\"Ghost in this House\\", \\"Dreaming my dreams with you\\" (hey Dolly Parton and Lyle Lovett singing back-up harmony! WOW) this cd needs to be heard by a cozy fire in the fall up at the mountains, nice bottle of wine...... this one is a winner, big time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alison as a lounge act?","review":"I remember with almost equal disappointment when Linda Ronstadt abandoned her folk rock roots and started singing torch songs. It was great for the torchy crowd, but disappointing for those of us who remember the Stone Ponies with some fondness.So it is with this latest Alison Krauss CD. Too many jazz chords, too many \\"strings\\" and not enough fiddles. And unlike Linda Ronstadt's record, these aren't even particularly good songs. Just average. Everything from the photography on the cover to the arrangements is just too self-consciously crossover.Unfortunately for those of us whom Alison amazed with her bluegrass albums, this will probably be a great seller and encourge her to do more of the same. That leaves Lynn Morris and Claire Lynch to listen to, and I recommend the latest from both of them more highly than this new one from Alison."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is amazing","review":"Saw AKUS in concert mid February, excellant show, accomplished musicians. They played many cuts from this CD. Several times I heard people in the audience around me quietly say thank you after a song was performed. My thoughts exactly. The material and the performance was unique. She is quite something, she rivets your heart while her incredible voice reaches out to you. What a treasure she is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, diffirent from her other work but still amazing!!","review":"From the moment I slipped it in the CD player I was lost in the lush music and haunting sound of her voice. I for one really enjoy a good sad song and Alison has given me 11 to lose myself in. I don't mind that she has departed from her bluegrass roots, especially since she did such an excellent job of it. It is good to see that she has included 'Ghost In This House'. A song that will send chills up your spine. I have heard her sing it in concert always wanted to have it on a CD.A definte must buy if you really love her voice. I know several people who feel that \\"She could sing the telephone book and I would listen for hours\\", myself included. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet of Alison Krauss!!","review":"Out of all of her albums...this is my favorite. The harmonies and ballads are the best I've ever heard.

Hey, send me a a list of her CD collection, I'm now a fan - she'll cure MY blues I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Alison Krauss please stand up...?","review":"Now don't get me wrong: I like Alison Krauss. A lot. Which makes this release all the more disappointing, since all the bluegrass elements which make Alison Krauss' albums special have been ruthlessly and almost totally wrung out. Although it still doesn't quite destroy the vocal power she can bring to bear, the syrupy backing supplied for Krauss' voice here did at times leave me wondering whether the record store had played some horrible trick on me and put a Celine Dion CD in the box by mistake...Will the real Alison Krauss please stand up...and quickly...! In the meantime, take the title of this one as a piece of advice, and forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop not bluegrass","review":"A disappointment. Does not bear repeated listening. I thought the point of Alison's sticking with Rounder was so that she didn't have to churn out the stuff you can hear on your local country FM station. If you want bluegrass, buy Dolly Parton's The Grass is Blue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bluegrass?","review":"If you like bluegrass music (as I do), and you like Alison Krauss's previous albums (as I do), you'll hate this one. It sure isn't bluegrass. I don't think it even qualifies for what passes as country music these days. I found it practically unlistenable. It's aptly titled - Forget About It."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooo boring!","review":"I remember how much I really looked forward to this CD. There are already some Alison Krauss albums and I love them all - but this one? Its the most boring CD I have heard for a long time. Is there any pop song on this album? Tell me where it is! I have put on that record 5 or 6 times, just to give it a try. But the more I heard it the less I liked it. No uptempo songs, no fun songs, only depressing and whining stuff. And that can only mean one thing: Ill be damn careful with the next album of Alison Krauss. But you sure can forget about this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst CDs I ever bought","review":"There might be a time when you feel really good. You are optimistic, happy and the world is just beautiful. But there is a great way to end all these feelings: Put on this CD! You will be depressed in less than 10 minutes. This is no pop.

Keep away from this CD, it will ruin your day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget About it","review":"Alison has such a beautiful, haunting voice, that I would like to hear it clearer, as with some of the other tracks. I have been in the music business for 40 years, and have made my living at it. As Alisons voice has matured, it like all peoples, needs to have a little more definition, as compared to the really good music in back of her. The voice fills out, as it improves, and if I could hear her voice as clear as some other of Miss Krauss's recordings, I would like it even more. Just a note to try to help Alison....a friend,Jim Whitted"},{"rating":"1","title":"i thought it was terrible!","review":"The melodies on this song were quite despereate.The constant wine of Alison's voice does not give the reader anything to look forward to hearing.Check your pulse before you buy this one, cause I would never purchase a whining CD...not even in a heartbeat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gorgeous Singing; Bland CD","review":"I have been a stalwart A.K. fan since I first saw her perform as a 17 year old. I own and look forward to each Allison C.D. however I have to say She under uses the brilliant Musicians of Union Station on this CD. Allison Krauss CD's are usually eclectic mixes of tempo; both achingly beautiful ballads as well as fantastic bluegrass playing by Union Station, however on this CD, one keeps waiting to hear the inspired mandolin and fiddle playing, and it never comes. Nonetheless since Allison has one of the most beautiful voices in Music today it is still worth while, however I would urge listeners to purchase Everytime You Say Goodbye, Too Late to Cry as well as Now That I Found You to get the full Allison Krauss and Union Station experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right On !","review":"Another great CD by Alison and the men of Union Station.

Arrival is an OK play, but Journey has never been just OK. Neal is Rock solid as always, but Arrival lacks power, and the majesty that has always made Journey music touch something inside us and make us want to fly. The songs are missing the beautiful flow we are used to, there's just no fire works on this CD. Is it because of the missing and much missed Steve Perry? I think so, but not just for his vocals. The three minds that made most of Journeys great music were Schon, Perry, and Cain. Without Perry's input the soul of the songs are in limbo. No disrespect to Mr. Augeri is intended, he sings a fine song. But Arriavl didn't give me goose bumps, didn't give me the thrill I have always known would come when I play Journey. It left me looking for the real Journey I love so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time!!!!!!","review":"This is the album we as fans have waited all to long for.

With a new linep that is 60% Journey, 60% Bad English, 40% Hardline, and former Tall Stories and Tyketto singer Steve Augeri, how could it go wrong. The songs are absolutely awesome. Thanks to napster, i was able to hear all of the tunes 4-6 months before the cd was released. The cd has everything from rockers to ballads. Neal Schon plays like only he can. He can go from playing a beautiful solo to a shredding lead run. \\" With Your Love\\" ranks as one of the alltime best Journey ballads. Augeri does a wonderful job filling some pretty big shoes. there's no lookin back now for the band. Their journey is headed in the right direction.......straight to the top!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"As a devoted fan of both Journey and Steve Perry, I'm the first to admit that I refused to even consider that Journey's new lead singer should be given a chance. Replace Steve Perry? No way! I've seen Journey at least four times in concert, all when Steve Perry was the front man. I recently bit the bullet and sat down to listen to Journey's newest CD, Arrival. OK, I'm eating crow. The CD was fantastic. No, the new singer is not Steve Perry. His voice is close, but there is more of an edge. The music is very similar to the old Journey, a relief to me. It makes me wish I had gone to see them in concert last month in New Jersey. If there is anyone out there who thinks that the new Journey line up isn't worth a listen, take it from me: You'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrival is BORN !!! Rock on Journey !!!","review":"As a longtime Journey fan I can say that this new CD of them is a masterpiece!! Steve Augeri did a wonderfull job and the gitarwork is superb. This CD definately Rocks!!!!! This is the birth on a new Journey era. Music changes in time and so did Journey and they done a good job with this CD. And why is Steve Augeri always compared to Steve Perry ?? They have the same first name but that's all. A true Journeyfan will agree with me on that one.This CD is not only a collectors item and a masterpiece it's filled with emotions,good lyrics,good music,superb gitarwork and it's a perfection in my opinion.And I know lots of you out there agree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"New lead singer probably better than Perry at this point...","review":"The new lead singer sounds very much like Steve Perry. In fact, unless you are a Journey connoisseur you won't even know it's not Steve Perry... He probably sounds better than Steve Perry would have at this point. The songs on this cd are phenomenol. Excellent melody, lyrics, musicianship etc. This is probably close to being the best Journey cd ever, excluding, of course, their greatest hits collections. It has a disproportionate amount of ballads, but that's what we all expect from Journey. And the first song \\"Higer Ground\\" is a decent rocking tune. I feel the cd is simply touching... I was listening to track 8 before writing this review. The ballads on this cd are so good that anyone who dislikes this cd must not have any musical feeling whatsover. Don't get me wrong, Perry's old stuff like \\"Faithfully\\" and \\"Open Arms\\" will always be hard to touch, but this cd has some songs that are right there..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.......","review":"I have to say this new album with the NEW Steve is a disappointment to me. All the hype about him looking and sounding like Steve Perry is nonsense. He doesn't even compare to Steve Perry. This is not saying he isn't a talented singer. It is just that Steve Perry is a phenomenally good singer. After the awesome Trial by Fire I was shocked that Journey went with a new singer due to personal problems with Perry. I think that it is a shame that can't separate business from personal feelings like other have to do frequently in a working environment. I think Perry had a lot more to contribute to Journey if given the chance. I went to see Journey two years back and didn't even know Perry was replaced. Was very disappointed to say the least. Hopefully Journey will come to their senses and realize that Perry is very important to Journey's past and future success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journey is dead.

The songs lack the songwriting talent Journey fans have come to expect. As far as the new lead singer he does sound similar to Steve Perry but that should not have been the case.

Steve Perry couldn't continue for health reasons!! I'm a fan of the ENTIRE group. A band is not comprised of just ONE talent doing all the work. Other band members have sung lead on other albums, so what's the big deal?There's some really great new songs on here. Higher Places, All the Way, and Signs of Life are really infectious. I've Got a Reason, and much more, to listen!The band members have grown up and had wives, kids, and normal lives. This gives them a different set of experiences and provides plenty of room for new material.

A new lead singer for Journey?\\" I asked myself when I head the news. Never could there be a voice like Steve Perry's! That's what I though until I heard \\"Remember Me\\" from the Armageddon soundtrack. Now a few year of waiting have paid off. Arrival has finally been released...and I can say it was worth the wait! Steve Augeri is not Steve Perry by any means, however he is the next best thing. Not like the \\"new lead singers\\" for other bands (remember Johnny Edwards who sang for Foreigner?) Mr. Augeri can belt the tunes out in the Journey style and this CD is as good as it gets. A little better than Trial By Fire and Raised On Radio, Arrival is a winner! Hopefully soon we will hear new solo Steve Perry and have the best of both worlds...Long Rock Journey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album but Steve Perry is missed so much so that......","review":"The album stands on its own as a very good piece of work no matter who the lead singer is. The songs are exactly what a Journey fan would expect, the rockers rock and the ballads are tear jerkers. The only thing derogatory I have to say about this new effort is the constant attempt either by the Augeri himself or by the group as a whole to imitate the singing style of Steve Perry, even down to his trademark woo-ooh-woo. I believe this was a conscious effort to convert Steve Perry fans over to the new line-up. Augeri brings with him a gritty voice that lends itself greatly to the rockers, but gone is the vocal range and smooth delivery of Perry. Final verdict, this is a great album but it shouldn't be compared to prior Journey efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love","review":"Love the cd...great music, lyrics and sound....JOurney was back again...loved Steve Perri..but, Steve Augeri does one hell of a job....I LOVE HIS VOICE... ....PLEASE ONE OF THE STEVE'S GO BACK TO JOURNEY...PLEASE....OKAY, I'M BEGGING...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the classics.........","review":"This could of been good but their new singer Steve Augeri does not have the vocal power to sing these songs and he is a very weak version of the great Steve Perry nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought Neal was gonna ROCK more without Perry ! ?","review":"This is not a knock against Augeri,who puts on a great concert with journey.But Neal has said over and over that the problems with he and Perry was that Neal wanted to rock while Steve wanted ballads.Well,Neal had his chance.....and blew it.Nothing off ARRIVAL comes close to TRIAL BY FIRE's CASTLES BURNING as far a \\"rocking\\" goes.There are way too many average ballads on this album,although ALL THE WAY is a good one.It's not fair to compare any singer with Perry but I was almost sure that with Augeri in and Neal free to play how he wanted that this album was going to be great.It's good compared to todays rock bands(creed,matchbox 20 etc.)but disappointing for a journey album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Very Sad","review":"As stated in my earlier review.. This band was great in the early to mid 70's w/o Steve Perry and w/ him. But after Frontiers they have done nothing worth noting. If there are those who would disagree and there are those. Just check out how fast this album sank after it's release and how fast they have put yet another Greatest Hits cd out. Steve Augeri is a very talented vocalist. But this band no longer has it. And I had said that they are playing to much smaller crowds then ever before. They may sell out some places here and there, but a vast majortiy of the venues are half full which has caused them to put up a curtain to make it seem like the crowd is bigger than it was. Hence the Syracuse carrier dome which they had sold out before, but barely got it half full after 2 thousand seats were given away... I will always love this band. But for the sake of the great memories, just go your seperate ways...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"The only reason why I gave this album 1 star is because there is no opportunity to give it 'Zero' stars.Journey is a novelty act.

Who care's? I feel bad because Steve Augeri will not get the recognition he deserves. He just \\"that guy they replaced Perry with\\". Forget Perry and listen to the album. Augeri's vocals soar in this one. It's a pure classic Journey album. All the songs are brilliant. The rockers rock and the ballads will be considered timeless. If you like Journey, and I DO mean Journey, pick up the album. I think you'll discover there's alot more than just Steve Perry.

But if they wanted a trually great soulful voice with great range, they should have gone after HUGO. Who is 10 times the vocalist Steve Perry ever dreamed of being. Let's face it, the last great release was ESCAPE, from top to bottom that was one of the greatest albums ever. This is almost as bad as Raised on Radio... They should just break up for good and go about on solo careers again. Which by the way, Neal Schoon had some great solo releases. Stop putting out this garbage and salvage what is left of any credibility and hang JOURNEY up for good... They were once great, now they stink... The album sales are not that good, and they are not filling the arenas any more. Actually they are playing to half full small theatres...

Although I miss Perry's crooning, the new lead singer is fantastic and a good replacement (if there has to be one).

And I'm one of those who believe that without Steve Perry, Journey would have never seen the success they now have. But, this new CD is awesome. I'm always listening to the radio for new music that sounds appealing. Sad to say that in the last few years, I rarely hear anything that contains real musicianship. But putting Schon, Cain, and Valory back together will always bring forth exceptional music. And the new lead singer Augeri is impressive. He has the soul, range, dialect, and diction of Perry. But, what would Journey be without that kind of lead singer? I love the \\"nostalgic\\" solo on Signs of Life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brand NEW classic Journey!!","review":"If you have a soft spot in your heart for good ol' classic rock served 'straight up'-and Journey is on the top of a LOT of those lists- then DO NOT hesitate one second before getting this disc!!

As long as Journey keeps writing great, melodic rock, I will remain a fan. The other members obviously wanted his range to be able to perform the old classics live. You don't hire a tenor vocalist to be able to sing soprano tunes, or vice-versa. Come on, Journey has moved on musically and I think they will always be one of the most musically talented groups. Oh yeah, I doubt that Steve A. stays in a seperate hotel or rides in a seperate limo like his predecessor did while on tour. Yeah, Steve Perry had a terrific voice, but he also had the ego to match it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey At Their Best","review":"Let's get some facts straight about Journey, Steve Perry has been gone from the band for over three years now. Perry also was the reason why the band was not together from 1987 to 1995 or so. All of you who think that Journey is no good without Perry are not real Journey fans! Journey does not revolve around Perry or anybody else.I have been listening to older Journey albums. Those of you who say that Arrival would be better with Perry singing the lead vocals are mistaken. Arrival would sound pretty much the same with either singers on lead vocals.Lets put are support behind the band and buy this tremendous album. This album does not demonstrate how great Augeri truly is. You have to see Journey in concert to experience the true talent of Steve Augeri and the rest of the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve who?","review":"Wow! Being a Journey fan since junior high (I'm mid-30's now) I was quite skeptical about a new singer for Journey. However, I attended a concert on the Arrival tour, and loved some of the new songs they played. So, I bought the CD, and what do you know - it's fabulous! It's my second-favorite Journey album next to Infinity. And actually, it reminds me of Infinity in a number of ways. Mainly, it's progressive, with new sounds not typically heard on pop/rock albums. Jonathan Cain is spotlighted quite a bit, and Steve Augeri sounds great. I don't think he sounds as much like Perry as others do, but I just love the emotional quality of his voice. My favorite tracks are All the Things, Higher Place, Kiss Me Softly, and Livin' to Do. The only thing I'm stumped about is, why are these songs not on the radio? If you miss this CD, you've really missed out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Deperate For Journey?","review":"Journey is not Journey without Steve Perry, even if the band technically got together before he joined. Listening to the songs on this album, it is obvious that the new Steve is just trying to imitate Steve Perry. He can get by, but he lacks the range, tone and depth of Steve Perry. He also does not physically have the same presence as Steve Perry. Like it or not, even though the other members are great, Steve Perry is Journey to the majority of fans who were in their teen and twenties during the 80's. I think it is fine that Schon wanted to continue in music, but he should have at least picked a new name for the band. Without capitalizing on the Journey name, I really wonder where this band would be without Steve Perry. This is an album for people so desperate to have Journey back (and I can relate) that they will accept anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poop on Plastic.","review":"Wow, my name's Steve Au Jus--or whatever--and I can scream just like the prima donna I replaced. Not only that, but I sang the same song 15 times in a row. Ya hear? One song 15 times. I tried usin' this cd to help my pony count, but he got confused 'cuzzin' he didn't know when one cut ended and the next began. In fact, he had a nervous breakdown on me cuz last time I tried it with Credence Clearwater Revival, and it was the same result. My poor little pony's been through enough. I think I'll keep him away from the Peter Cetera and Boston stuff, otherwise he might commit suicide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journey?","review":"While some would argue that Journey existed before Steve Perry showed up, the truth is that Journey was a talented group of musicians without the voice or song writing ability needed to be successful. Then came Steve Perry, and the rest is history.... They have returned to their former selves (pre-Perry), only this time they try to sing and write. It was a dissaster. To support this argument I give you their tours. They are still singing all of the old Perry stuff, because they know that fans do not like the new stuff. The truth is, this album is a stinker. The positive reviews the new Journey is getting is not reflected in their record sales, and this leads most to believe that the positive reviews are less than genuine. Journey fans would have been much better served with more studio albums that include Perry and not this NEW BAND that is pretending to be Journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked and completely stoked!","review":"I was very nervous about this album, and I honestly wasn't sure what to expect with change, but wow! This is a phenominal album; I don't think I've been this excited about an album ever! Kudos to Schon and the rest of Journey for bringing Journey back and not letting it be gone forever, and to bring it back in such wonderful form! I didn't think I'd find an album this fanstastic with a new lineup! This IS Journey, no doubt about it, and they're in top form!There is so much attitude on this album, pound for pound this album could be Journey's best, or at least close to it! Heck, why not, I'd be willing to call this Journey's best album , I love it that much!This album almost sounds like a greatest hits album compiled of songs I've never heard before! Every song has me caught from start to finish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saddened...","review":"Well, I have to agree with all the Steve Perry fans. Journey just isn't the same without the classic frontman. Then the argument comes saying that Mr.Whatsit is just as good as Steve Perry. Why, he even SOUNDS like Steve Perry. Oh goodie. They sound totally different to me. If Steve Perry wasn't important to the band, why find a singer so similar in style? I feel that if the rest of the band members wanted a new feel , they should have found a new style alltogether. Too bad, I was really excited when I found out a new album was coming out. Hopefully, the other band members will come to their senses and bring the SOUL of Journey back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Thanks to the review that pointed me at the Japan release.

NO WAY","review":"The only thing I can say to all you Steve A. lovers out there, is that you must never really have gotten into the FEEL of Journey's music. This stuff has zero feeling to it. It's cookie-cutter polished garbage for the most part. Don't get me wrong, some songs are ok, and Steve A. can hit some notes, but that's where it ends. This CD doesn't move me the way classic Journey did. The only movement is running to the CD rack to pick something else out to listen to.And one last thing - if Neal and Jon wanted so much to move on from old Steve Perry, why is it that everything they do is so blatently Steve Perryish? (albeit done very weakly).Save your money, and if you don't already own it, buy Captured instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Songwriting...Lukewarm Delivery","review":"I purchased this album after hearing the band's Greatest Hits album. My interest had been sparked and I was curious to see what type of music the band was making these days. I was pleased to see that they hadn't strayed from their perfect blend of guitars and keys. The songs were okay...just okay. It was basically a collection of filler without one prominent hit. I almost got the feeling that Journey, like so many other veteran bands out there trying to find their place in this ugly rock scene we have today, were trying to hard to write a hit. The new singer was okay but not outstanding. He kindof sounded like a mix of John Waite and Steve Perry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Steve Perry?","review":"I've recently been on the official Journey website and heard parts of some of theese songs.

Without him there is no Journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey has Arrived in the 21st century!","review":"I've been listening to most of this songs since late last summer, thanks to a company hated by the RIAA(you know the one I'm talking about). I have now paid for Arrival twice as I have the Japanese and American versions. It is well worth the money as Steve Augeri, and everyone else, truly shine on this album. Songs that stand out for me are Higher Place, Signs of Life, To Be Alive Again, Live and Breathe and With Your Love. It is a shame that with todays music climate that this album will probably not do as well as predecessors Escape or Frotniers."},{"rating":"1","title":"....meh","review":"What is there to say? If Neal and the boys decided to change the name of the band, like Steve Perry suggested, perhaps I would have liked this cd more. However great a singer Augeri is, he is a poor substitute to Steve Perry, he simply cannot capture the magic that Perry's voice brought to Journey. I compared Steve Augeri's singing to Steve Perry's the whole cd, and why not? Steve Perry, like it or not, was the heart of the band, he's the one that the general people know, not Neal Schon, Johnathan Cain, and whoever else is in the band. If you buy this cd expecting to hear the Journey you've grown up with, you will be in for a rude awakening, it's not them anymore. I aggree with what Journey's old manager, Herbie said, \\"If anyone tried to make Journey disappear, nobody would be there to stop them.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad...but not great","review":"The new Steve doesn't do the ballads as well as the old Steve. Yes A couple of the songs do rock, but overall it is the weakest Journey album they have ever released. I might add that I am not counting the original 3 which where great albums, but not comparable to the journey most people know. Believe what you want, but it is also the poorest selling Journey album ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time For The Journey To End!","review":"This CD was a attempt on a band that has seen its heyday to make a few bucks off of its legacy. Steve Perry may not be with the band in person, but the sound didn't change. All they did was get a sound alike/look alike to replace him. The songwriting is average at best, the music is second rate. Go buy Jouney's Greatest Hits to hear how great this band can sound, but don't waste your money on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cow Dung For Brains","review":"All of you who think this album is good or great should admit to having cow dung from brains. Seriously! I took all of you \\"cow dung for brains\\" advice and bought this CD because you said it was great and I can honestly and truthfully tell you that I would rather hear Fran Drescher sing the American National Anthem then to listen the this CD ever again. All of you who believe that this album is good or great should go to the kitchen and fill a small glass of water and mix it with potassium cyanide and drink the entire glass so you don't ever give bad advice to decent human beings who know the difference between real music and fake music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is a waste of time, effort and money....

I don't hear a single banjo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perry's songwriting is what's really missing","review":"This is honestly the worst journey album ever.All of these 5 star reviews are ludicrous.I can get over the fact Perry isnt still the singer,but it's his songwriting that is sorely missed here.Steve Ausherry..I mean..Auperry...no.Augeri just isnt that distinctive enough from other average rock bands.Schon and Cain still have that trademark journey sound but the songs are so weak it doesnt help matters much.The song world gone wild is the only highlight of this poor album."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I COULD NOT WAIT FOR THE RELEASE OF THIS CD. I RECEIVED IT TODAY AND AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. THE CD DOES NOT MEASURE UP TO THE MUSIC THAT WE HAVE GROWN TO EXPECT FROM JOURNEY. STEVE PERRY WAS THE SOUND OF JOURNEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"JOURNEY NO MORE!!!!!","review":"There is only one song that I would say was worth listening to. Steve Augeri has a strong voice but he lacks the soulfulness that Steve Perry had and the listener just knew that he had been down that road that he sang about!! That beautiful voice came from a place way down deep and it can never be replaced by Steve Augeri attempting to sound like \\"THE REAL VOICE OF JOURNEY\\", Steve Perry!!! After 20 years, and after watching the VH1 Behind The Music featuring Journey, I am convinced that Steve Perry at 52 years old, still remains the only true voice of Journey. The fact of the matter is that, indeed ,Journey needs Perry but Perry has proven time and time again that he can stand alone!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Journey is Over","review":"ARRIVAL This new release from the new Journey line-up suffers greatly from mediocre songwriting and from the lack of a strong lead vocalist.The new singer, Steve Augeri, tries his best to fill Perry's shoes but falls short. Augeri's vocals are a thin imitation of Steve Perry's, with only half the range Perry had. The songwriting is uninspiring. Aside from some enjoyable guitar licks from Neil, the songs are pretty unmemorable and do not have the emotional punch and melodic interest that past Journey music had.On Arrival, you really start to miss Perry's great songwriting abilities that were present on every other Journey album from 1978 up until 1996.This is NOT the Journey sound that we all know and love so much.On Journey's reunion 1996 album, Trial By Fire, Steve Perry proved that he still has The Voice...and then some!!! Its a real shame that he is no longer with Journey.I was hoping I'd enjoy this new album. But this new 'Journey' sounds, at best, like a Journey cover band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appreciate it for what it IS, not what it COULD be......","review":"First of all, I have to agree with the reviewer who commented on Augeri's vocal range. He CANNOT sustain a Perry-like note, and his rendition of Perry-era songs are unemotional, to say the least.....But I digress.....Appreciate this effort(and Lineup) for what it IS, and not what it COULD or SHOULD be! These 15 songs are great for what they are. Neal's guitar playing is better than it has been in YEARS, and Jon's songwriting is at it's best(just imagine Steve Perry singing these songs)...My favorites are: Higher Place, Signs of Life, I got a Reason, To Be Alive Again, and We Will Meet again....Although I'm a sucka for a sappy Cain/Perry ballad, Steve A.. just doesn't pull it off....I'll stick with the Power ballads and rockers from this CD.....Overall it's worth the money...FOR WHAT IT IS....Oh and as an aside..I've been burning to say this for 2 years....Kevin Chalfant, or Hugo Valentin(e) would have been a better choice than Augeri...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly sad album","review":"I can accept change when it comes to bands and their front men with the best of 'em. Journey's change...........I cannot get past this.Why in the world would one go messing around with a formula like Journey had with Perry? It goes back to the old saying \\"If it isn't broken, don't fix it.\\"The songs are uninspiring at best save one exception. I did like \\"We Will Meet Again\\" simply because its words remind me of someone who I hope to...you guessed it, meet again.The new \\"Steve\\" hints at Perry's styling but he cannot pull it off. If change is what Journey really wanted, then they should have removed themselves completely from any Perry-esque influence. I know, I know, easier said than done.Everyone was expecting to hear Perry, and when they got a doppelganger who only shows hints of the true Perry it just isn't going to work...and it doesn't work.Overall a sorry effort by a once AWESOME band.Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape revisited","review":"This is truly a return to classic Journey. Arrival takes me back to Escape. I will always miss Steve Perry, however it makes it easier to move on with this album. Steve Agueri is an almost match and will fill Perry's shoes quite nice. Tracks like Higher Place, Signs of Life, I got a reason and All the Way are immediate Journey Classics. Schon's guitar work is masterful and it is nice to hear Cain using the Piano in rockers ala Don't stop believing. Candidate for rock album of the year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No truffle taste, a little truffle aroma.","review":"Maybe this company has very poor quality control where some batches are wonderful and others are just olive oil with a whiff of truffle but our 2 bottles had no truffle flavor at all.

Alison Thompson shows you that one motivated person can make a huge impact on thousands of people's lives, and personally got me involved in Haiti. This movie chronicles her time in Sri Lanka with the help of a few friends, rebuilt a town, saved countless lives and developed the first Tsunami early warning system in Sri Lanka.

That's about it, the steam evacuates right where you would lift to open the iron, and it hurts. The batter if it does overflow, spills right into the temp control dial, so it's lots of fun to try to clean. And the batter sticks to the top and bottom heating elements so you get to scrape the batter out from between the grids after your waffle is ripped in half. I recommend using a wooden spoon to scrape out the batter because it is scalding hot and will melt a plastic spatula, meanwhile a metal spatula will scratch the \\"stick free\\" surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made But Makes Decent Waffles","review":"This waffle maker does make pretty good waffles but I can not get over how cheap it is for supposed \\"Cuisinart quality\\".

I thought it was a lot safer to use than it actually is. It has no safety features at all and you cannot come in contact with the outside of it when it is on or even after it has been turned off. The outside of the unit gets so intensely hot that if you accidentally touch it anywhere on its outer surface, you get a nasty blistery burn. You cannot ever allow children in the kitchen when attempting to cook waffles with this skin sizzler. Also, the instructions tell you to spread out the batter, which I did. Even when using a small amount of batter, it came gushing out the sides! Then what stayed in stuck to the grid and had to be scraped out. I used Pam and it still stuck. I experimented with all different amounts of batter on all different settings and got the same horrendous results each time. This is the worst small appliance I have ever purchased and I am surprised it has not been recalled. Stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bah humbug!","review":"I bought this wafflemaker under the impression that it would easily make fluffy delicious waffles and that a nonstick spray was unnecessary. In fact, this product is terrible. The batter totally sticks to both upper and lower surfaces inside. When you open the lid, the waffle splits in half, the entire halves of the waffle are stuck to upper and lower lids, and scraping them out is a nightmare. Also, the lid that's \\"impossible\\" to burn yourself on ? Burned myself! I would not have rated this as high as I did but there's no way to give 0 stars. Stay away from this product. It's a classic rip off, not a classic waffle maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not vey well made.","review":"The dial for for how well done you want your waffel broke off the first time I cleaned it. Very cheap piece of plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Stick Sticks Like Super-Glue","review":"I tried to make it work and even called Cuisinart for assistance. No joy. I tried three different batter mixes and tried PAM spray and everything they told me to try.100% of the time the waffle stuck to both the top and bottom plates and had to be scrapped off from each while they continued to burn. I tried Belgian and regular mixes but they both stuck.The non-stick surfaces of this thing sticks to waffles like super-glue. After dozens of attempts at different temps, batters, mix combinations, spraying with cooking spray..... I finally gave up and returned the thing to where I bought it. I've never had anything stick to a non-stick surface like this thing. You really have to scrape to get the stuff off. Nice try but Cuisinart needs to work on their non-stick so that it doesn't stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waffle, waffle! Who gets the waffle.","review":"The initial maker I received had a nonfunctioning \\"ready\\" (green light) indicator. The maker was propmptly replaced and functions well.The maker produces and excellent waffle. The only drawback is that it only produces a single waffle at a time. For me, a single person, this doesn't cause any problem. For a family, however, a larger waffle maker would be advisable.Storage is easy due to the size and configuration. The maker stands upright. To clean the maker, a simple wipe down on the grid and a periodic cleaning on the exterior is easily accomplished. Overall, well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"I wasn't that happy with this waffle maker from the start, but when it broke after a couple of uses I was pretty disappointed. No luck getting Cuisinart to honor their guarantee, either. I'd skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart round waffle maker","review":"I have only used this waffle maker once. And I have noticed some problems. The Cuisinart round waffle maker seems to be a bit cheap, the hinge connection seems like it will break easily, and it cooks a little fast. The cooking is also un-even, some parts on the waffles are burnt and some parts are not even cooked! I know it is very hard to try to find a classic round waffle maker besides this one. Overall, this seems to suffice enough for my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I could give it no star","review":"Do not buy this waffle maker! I just tossed in the trash, the waffles will not comes off, even after I oiled it.

I have a cusinart toaster that it pur garbage but they make a really nice walfle iron. It has an indicator light that goes green when the waffle iron is ready for batter and then when it is cooked, it makes a soft crackling sound and you take them out and the waffles are perfect every time.I usually spray the waffle iron the first time of each use; once per day or less if not using it daily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Item","review":"The Control temperature with this item does not work, when set to medium, it burns the waffles darker than advertised.Basically have to use it manually & watch the cooking process-cannot recommend this product.

Name doesn't mean anything!","review":"This is the first review I've ever written on Amazon, if that tells you anything. This product is terrible! Bought for a camping trip, used about twice a year for 2 years. The doneness selector broke off!! There is not an adjustable back hinge, so if the waffle gets too big, the front opens and the steam pours out. Even if it isn't too big, the steam pours out the front, warming the handle to open the iron...not a good design! Also, if you overfill, the batter pours out the front into the slot wheree the (now broken) doneness slector is. The Cuisinart name isn't what it used to be. Don't buy it!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk but decent waffles","review":"The moment I removed this from the package I considered returning it. Probably should have. It is so cheaply made that it's hard to believe. The hinge is so loose I examined it to see if it was defective but I think that's just how it is. Also, the sliding switch has a lot of play. I'll now have to think twice about Cuisinart products. The only positive is that it actually makes ok waffles. They are the kind I like, brown and crispy. We'll see how long it lasts; for $40 it's kind of disposable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart WMR-CA Waffle Maker","review":"This waffle maker looks good and works fair at making waffles, but has many problems. The temperature and timing numbers wear off in just a couple of months. The plastic parts broke and separated also in a couple months and had to be super glued back on. The only redeeming qualities are it makes fair waffles if you remember where to put the temperature dial. I am dissapointed that a high class company like Cuisinart makes such a poor quality product. I can not recommend this waffle maker"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes good waffles, but doesn't last","review":"I have been through two of these. The first one lasted 2 or 3 years. The second one didn't even make it a year. In both cases they just stopped working (no heat or lights). It's too bad, because they are cheap and make good waffles, but I learned my lesson and will buy something different this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money on a better one","review":"I bought this waffle maker because of brand name and price.It was a big disappointment.PROS: It cooks waffles at the right temperature for the setting and they come out looking good. It does not take up counter space and has a great appearance.CONS: Waffles stick and are hard to removed without tearing up. I've tried cooking spray and cooking oil but nothing helps. The biggest problem is the smell. The burned plastic smell lingers for hours after it cools. Makes me wonder if it is in the food. The griddles cannot be removed for cleaning and are a pain to try to wash. It's on the back shelf and I am ordering a better 3-in-1 selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this Waffle Maker!","review":"I received this waffle maker the other day and was so excited I used it the same day. I read all of the reviews before ordering, and even with some \\"not so good reviews\\", I still decided to order it and I am not sorry I did. Other than no on/off button it is great, and really, that is not a problem to me. It makes yummy waffles, and fast, too! So far I have no complaints! :-) I almost forgot to say that I received it real quick and in excellent condition... thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this. Waffles are perfect","review":"I made waffles the same day the product arrived.

Waffles came out great. I recommend using the 3-4 setting for perfect waffles. I only wish it came with a spatula or something to remove from waffle iron once done cooking. Easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good on paper, but small in real life","review":"I was excited about this waffle maker because I really like the thinner waffles (not belgian style). I'm also a big fan of the square waffles so I was eager to try it out. However, I was really surprised by how small it was! The waffles are tiny and would take much too long to make for hungry cyclists, so I'm returning it. I've learned my lesson and will buy waffle makers in person from now on to see what size it actually is before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fast waffles","review":"After looking at all the local stores we couldn't find a wafflemaker that wasn't for Belgian waffles. Finally, I checked Amazon. There it was and I ordered it, it was shipped very quickly. Just tested it today (xmas - it was a gift to my husband) and it worked perfectly. The waffles are done quickly -- much better than the old one that finally broke. Yum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"The waffle iron works pretty good. You have to break it in by using it a couple of times,but after that it makes a decent waffle. One thing though is you have to cook using a temperature of between two and three."},{"rating":"1","title":"the silent waffel maker","review":"It's a good waffel maker but it needs a buzzer of some type to let you know when the waffel is done. Also the selector for how you want it cooked is a loose lever needs to be tightened up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Waffler","review":"Just tried the Cuisinart waffle maker and was extremely pleased with the way the waffles turned out. Actually, surprised would be a better description. Over the last 40 years I bet I've owned at least 10 different ones that never did come up to my expectations. Like a making decent waffle. My view for a decent waffle is just what it says. 1) Not burned 2) Soft inside ( as in done ) and slightly crispy on the outside 3)Easy to remove from the cooking grids (both top and bottom )4) Easy to clean and store. When it first arrived, I took it out of the box thinking, \\"Oh no, this one is too small\\". Don't be fooled with the looks. It is just right. I mixed up and made three waffles within 30 minutes and each one turned out great. Even my wife was impressed and that,s saying a mouthful. Great product at a reasonable price![ASIN:B00006JKZN Cuisinart WMR-CA Round Classic Waffle Maker"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winner!","review":"This iron produces crisp and flawless waffles every time. My only complaint is that sometimes it can take 45-60 seconds for the light to reset itself when you pour more batter on the iron. This, however, does not affect the outcome of the waffle and once you get used to it, is really not an issue at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Waffle Maker !!!","review":"In short, this is one great waffle maker. For the price it can't be beat. I own the $350 Kitchen Aid Pro-line waffle maker and this one beats it hands down. It heats up in minutes and is ready to make the next waffle WITHOUT a recovery period. If you are looking to make a Waffle House-type waffle this one is for you (round and about 1/2\\" thick). You won't be dissapointed with this one. I am online to purchase a second one to make two waffles at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like waffles","review":"At first this worked great, the red light/green light thing is a good thing, and being able to actually select how cooked you want your waffle is definatly better than having to time waffles yourself (especially when your cooking for picky people ;))Unfortunatly after 5 or 6 uses the waffles started sticking and pulling apart regardless of how much (or little) they were cooked. It got worse until the waffle stuck completly and were basicly ineatible. I tried greasing the iron, the waffles still pull apart but they're eatible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great waffles, but the slide heat controller melted","review":"I just hate it...This thing makes great waffles. They are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. It took me back to dad making waffles on Sunday mornings.But, after the fifth or sixth time I used it, the plastic heat controller slide (that little gray thing on the front) just melted off the unit. I thought I might be able to use the metal piece that the plastic was stuck to, but it fell inside the unit. I considered keeping it, but it was still within a couple of days of the Amazon 30 day return, so back it went.I am now searching for another waffle maker. It's a bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"No frills regular waffle maker that WORKS","review":"I wanted just a plain ole waffle maker-not a Belgian waffle maker- JUST a waffle maker. This works great for me. No bells or whistles with this unit- red light means it's baking, green light means it's done. Simple. It makes (1) round waffle. If you need to feed a crowd at once, this probably is NOT what you want. I went by the manufacturer's recommendation of using the #3 setting and I also made the whole wheat waffle recipe that came with the maker. They turned out great. Made that recipe 3x's already. I make them and then freeze them for later. One note about the whole wheat waffle recipe-instead of using ground nuts- I used wheat germ. YUM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Yes, it does make a waffle fairly quickly. But not so pretty one. I invested more $$ thinking because it is cuisinart, it'd be better. My friend has a dirt cheap waffle maker from wallmart but it makes a better waffle. Also, it said it'll be smokey when only used for the first time, but the smoke still comes out after over 5 times of use. Not so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Waffles every time!","review":"I bought this model based on the good reviews and was not disappointed. I highly recommend using non-stick spray for the first waffle of the batch. After that, you don't need to respray. I bought this for my 8-year-old budding chef and she loves it (I would not recommend to just ANY 8-year-old, mine is well-trained in the kitchen). Great value for the money. Easy clean up.

The only way to prevent this, is to set the unit on its #1 heat setting, and letting the waffle cook until steam stops coming out the sides...Then it is crunchy and almost burnt. Using PAM did not help, it has the worst non-stick surface I have ever seen...gets WAY to hot on its recommended setting, and tells you the waffle is finished at the correct time, but tears in in half when opened.I wont go into the fact that the waffles are paper thin, and the top flops around like its broken (although I do not see anything broken on the hinge.Will be returning this one, and keep on searching for something that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing product from Cuisinart","review":"Received this as a gift for Christmas. Waffles stuck horribly on the first use. On the second try a week or so later, the heat-control tab broke off. Then the piece that moves back and forth between the numbers slid into the waffle maker.

Will be picking out a different waffle maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did a good job - for a while","review":"We have had this waffle iron for a little over a year. It did an excellent job at first; waffles are crispy and evenly baked in just 90 seconds! However, even though we cared for it as directed, the waffles started to stick after about 8 months of use. We found that we had to spray a little oil on the iron after the first waffle, or the second one would tend to stick a little. It gradually got worse until we were oiling the plates before each waffle, and still had to coax them a little to remove them. Heaven help us if we forgot! We would have thoroughly stuck waffle on both the upper and lower plate, which was quite a challenge to clean off.We enjoy waffles on a regular basis, making 2 waffles about 3 times a month. We got 14 months of use out of this waffle iron. Just got a replacement under warranty; after paying shipping each way, it is costing me $19 to replace. When this one starts to stick, I'll look for another brand that (I hope) will last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, performs poor","review":"The first time I used this, it made pretty good waffles. Although very thin, they had a great taste. I used a setting of three and turned it down to two after the first two waffles were a little too crispy for me. The second time I started at two, the waffles were overdone so I made the remaining at setting one. The third (and final) time I started at setting one, the waffles were still overdone. Each time I used the same batter(with oil) and same amount, also tried with Pam and without. Im going to return this to the store at which I paid $35."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"We wanted a traditional style waffle (not the Belgian type) and this waffle iron makes the traditional ones.

I have to use Pam for Baking on the inside for each waffle; I had a couple ruined waffles until I started using the spray. Also As the waffle cooks, the front of the lid will open up. This means that the front of the waffle wont be cooked as much as the rest of the waffle. The top of the waffle maker does get hot so make sure you touch ONLY the black plastic parts till it cools down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken..... 3 x Used","review":"Apparently (having purchased this 2/2/12) the only recourse on this is to \\"review\\"....either that or return for reduced refund and pay the shipping to boot.

I have been using the same recipe (beaten egg whites folded into batter) for waffles for 33 years--the last 5 with a similar Cuisinart waffle iron which failed two weeks ago. I immediately replaced the failed waffle iron with what I thought was a similar product. No matter what I try, the waffles stick. After seven attempts interspersed with cleaning, reheating, sometimes trying to grease the grids (which you are not supposed to do) sometimes not and various temperature settings, I give up. This product simply stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it worked half of the time","review":"I was thrilled with the idea of being able to make waffles at home, and I believe the excitement and novelty of it is what kept me satisfied with this waffle maker for the first few months despite the consistant fact that half of every batch of waffles would remain stuck to the plates and have to be pried, poked and scraped out with a fork or butter knife. However, as time went on my patience grew thinner and the percentage of botched waffles grew higher.

It took me probably half an hour to clean the grills after the very first attempted waffle out of the box - so much for \\"non-stick\\"! To make matters worse, Cuisinart won't stand behind their products - they wanted me to spend more of my time and my money to ship this garbage back and also pay them $10 more to ship me a new one - not worth it for a $40 waffle maker - which is I'm sure what they had in mind.

I use a very thick batter, this is a serious design flaw.3. The heating element shows thorough on the waffle i.e. there's a cook ring within the waffle - looks really stupid.This thing is not the waffle iron to buy and it's the second terrible Cuisinart waffle iron I've tried.

Nothing was mentioned about spraying the waffle iron grill as it should be non stick. The waffle maker also does not have a large surface area so get enough waffle for more than one serving.You cannot remove the waffle grill surface for cleaning. Not good. My old GE waffle iron has removable grills for easy cleaning when necessary.I have an old GE waffle maker that is still making great waffles.

I trusted the positive reviews posted here and bought one. WHAT A MISTAKE! It doesn't come near to getting hot enough. Even on the darkest setting (5), the waffles come out limp as a noodle, and with the insides of the waffles tasting like warmed, but not cooked, batter! If that is your idea of a good waffle, you will love this machine. Now I get to re-package it and mail it back.

I loved the iron for making the waffles, perfectly timed. It created golden brown waffles every time. What I didn't like about it is the slider on the front to adjust the length of cooking. If you overpour the batter, it leaks out the front into the slider trough. The bottom of the iron sealed. It appeared I could have unscrewed the screws and cleaned it out but what a pain in the neck. It aggrevated me when the kids overfilled the iron and the batter oozed into the gizzards of the waffle iron.The iron does make great waffles and the collection of batter in the bottom didn't interfere with future batches; I just thought it was unsanitary in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Easy","review":"This waffle maker is my first and I'm loving it so far. I had a friend who used this waffle maker previously and she highly recommended it so I went out and got one too. Its really easy to use. All you have to do is pour in the batter after it's warmed up and the waffles are done within minutes. My first waffle came out a bit undercooked, but after I figured out the right batter, the rest of the waffles came out beautifully. One thing you have to be careful of is to close the lid as soon as you finish pouring in the batter, if you wait too long to do so the bottom might come out a bit crispier than the top.Now I usually make a container full of batter and just leave that in the fridge for whenever we want waffles. My little brother who's eleven, can use this waffle maker by himself and make his own breakfast.The only negative is that it can be hard to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design","review":"I purchased the item and was very pleased with its performance until the black plastic at the top back of the waffle iron fell off (the tabs broke). I contacted customer service and after much discussion they replaced it with a new one after I had to prove how this was a safety issue. Once again, the same exact thing happened about 1 1/2 years later. The internal wiring is exposed again. In addition, since the metal parts also get very hot when in use it is difficult to move it now because there is nowhere to grab onto it with 2 hands. Makes great waffles but falls apart with normal handling-too bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine","review":"I was hungry for a waffle and so I had to have this. Its not overly sturdy but then again its not a commercial product (however I am not having the best of luck with other Cuisinart products lately so am holding my breath on this one). Initially the non-stick surface was anything but however after a few waffles it seems to be work just fine. For the price its perfect but my suspicions related to recent Cuisinart quality has me thinking it will end up being replaced sooner than I'd like. For the sort term, enjoy waffles on a lazy weekend morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design Vents Steam Towards Handle","review":"I'm returning this waffle iron. First, I was surprised that the slider button was plastic. Seems very cheap. If i use a bit of pan spray I can make waffles that do not stick, so that's ok. The highest setting 5, was not enough to make a golden brown and crispy waffle, so I give it about 1 minute extra each time.But, the worst part is the design.The steam is funneled to the front of the waffle iron - where the handle for the top lid is. I end up using a hot pad or mitt each time just to open the lid. There is NO WAY I could let my 13 year old - who loves to cook - use this waffle iron due to the poor design.The waffles are fine.And, if you are fine with using a mitt each time, go for it.But, I'll be searching for a model that vents the steam away from the user.And, I'll probably look for a more sturdy model - perhaps cast iron instead of plastic on the inside.This one is fine for the money, if you are ok with the design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes great waffles, inferior product attributes","review":"I was delighted to find the waffle maker I had been looking for. . .one that was NOT a Belgian-waffle type. I have used this appliance perhaps 6 times now, loved it until today when I brushed against the temperature adjustment knob and it fell off! In the future I will have to somehow adjust the termperature with. . . what? Perhaps a toothpick? Its very shoddily made for such a great name as Cuisinart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Waffle Maker ... Recommended","review":"4 Stars instead of 5 because no audible alarm but you get what you pay for!!I bought this new off Ebay for < $25.I used it for the first time and everyone enjoyed the waffles it made.I plugged it in to start to preheat.I set the slider to 3.I made my waffle batter.By the time I had the waffle batter made, the Waffle Maker was ready.Setting 3 will let you make a golden Brown Waffle in about 1 minute.Then I used setting 4. I dont think the temperature changed.The waffle it made on setting 4 got darker but I think the only thing that changed was the amount of time it \\"baked\\".I used 1/2c to 2/3 c batter per Waffle.Each person only ate 1 Waffle.I froze the extra waffles to use in the Toaster.I had to break the waffle into 4 pieces because my Toaster can not handle a 7\\" waffle.I may have to buy a new Toaster!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warranty worthless","review":"Made good waffles, but when the adjustment knob fell off for no apparent reason and no way to repair it myself, I called Cuisinart and they said they would sent me another one for $[...] and I would have to send the other one back and pay shipping. Might as well buy another maker from another manufacturer who stands behind their product and, probably, lasts a lot longer. So I cannot recommend this iron since I am sure there are others out there which would be more reliable and do just as good a job."},{"rating":"2","title":"slightly disappointed","review":"I was slightly disappointed with this waffle maker, yet also slightly in love. I had to turn up the heat to the 5 setting and leave the waffle on much longer than the indicator light suggested to get the golden brown crispy waffle I wanted. It also did not cook evenly, the difference wasn't huge or bad, but it might be because the top doesn't seem weighed down like it says. But all in all I am happy with this waffle maker, I did give it four stars didn't I? It just takes patience. I am happy that I no longer have to make belgian waffles, which is the reason I bought this. I'm torn on if I should have spent the 10 extra dollars on a similar one but if you aren't horribly picky this is the one for you, it does work, and can make delicious crispy waffles, just remember you get what you pay for. I will say my picky 3 year old asked for seconds, and that never happens. HE LOVED THEM! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Waffles","review":"I really enjoy my new Cuisinart round waffle iron - it makes yummy nice waffles, a little crispy on the outside and OOH! good on the inside.

The waffles baked quickly and were perfectly browned. After two weeks the slide control broke off. Amazon.com was great to send a replacement, especially since Cuisinart charges almost $11.00 for handling a warranty issue. Again, we really like the waffles. But the baking control is definitely cheaply made and does not look as though it will hold up. We will see. The control issue is the only reason for not giving the product \\"high 5!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned It - TWICE!","review":"Based on positive reviews, I bought this waffle maker. The first thing I noticed was how cheap the adjustable setting slider was. Cheap and plastic. It's so loose, I couldn't even tell which setting it was on. Cooking was inconsistent as a result of this design flaw. After a few weeks, the slider broke.I exchanged it for another of the same model. This new one had the same design flaw. In addition, the new one kept burning waffles. I returned it, too.I will look for a different waffle maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooks great but has disintegrated","review":"Have used this for 4 years about once a week.

I tried three times to make waffles in it and each time the batter stuck so that I had to unplug the iron and let it cool to release the waffle. Needless to say they were unedible, burned to a crisp. I packed it up and am returning it ASAP.Its not worth rating!!! Too bad you don't have half a star, even that's too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job!","review":"Adequate little waffle maker.

First, the switch to make it lighter or darker is very unstable. You never know what you are going to get. Second, how do you handwash the thing without getting water in the electronics? Third, the waffle ALWAYS sticks to it so I have to scrape it off, often times breaking the waffle which ends up in throwing it out and starting over. I can use spray...but if I forget to use spray, forget about it. I've had this for a few years and it's just completely fallen apart. It's not durable and just not a good product. I don't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"Not so good. The batter stuck to the grids and had to pry the stuff off, I waited for the green light too.

Easy to clean, waffles came out easily without sticking. Browning control setting seemed to be accurate. But then the browning control slide broke. Very cheap plastic part broke inside the slot, so there is no way to fix this. Very sad to say that this was only after 10-12 uses. I would stay away from any Cuisinart unit that uses this slide control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Browning handle is made to fail","review":"We used this about six times before the browning button fell off. I popped open the back cover to see if I could fix it but this little knob was attached to a plastic part that just fell apart when I touched it. The plastic was just too thin and brittle. It was made to fail. I won't buy another Cuisinart, they used to stand for high quality but they get all their stuff from China now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control for Cuisinart","review":"I cannot comment on how well this waffle maker might work because I never plugged it in. The temperature control slider was very loose. It might be a poor quality component or it might be that it is not properly fastened inside the unit. If it is a poor quality component it probably won't last long. If it isn't properly fastened there is an electric shock danger. Either way, I sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money or time on this product","review":"I order this waffle maker last week and received it the orther day and used it for the first time tonight and it started to heat up like it was and then it quit working.

The bad news is that it makes terrible waffles. It cooks horribly unevenly. Most of the time the waffle tears in half when the lid is opened. The overall construction of the waffle iron is flimsy and the \\"dial\\" is very cheapy done. After two weeks of use, I am going back to making pancakes. I am going to give this waffle iron to a thrift shop, and I am actually feeling a little bad for the future owner of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST. WAFFLE. MAKER. EVER.","review":"This is, hands down, the most frustrating product I've ever owned in my life. When it first arrived, I was a little put off by the looseness of the hinge in the back because it wobbles every time you move the lid. I actually almost returned it, but after seeing another reviewer said the same thing, I figured they were probably all like that. The first couple uses, were fine. I haven't used it much at all in the last month and a half that I've owned it. But, after the initial couple uses, every single waffle I've made has stuck. To the point where all my waffles split in half and I have to dig them out. And yes, I do put oil in my waffle batter. The description says it is NON STICK, I shouldn't have to put cooking oil. I am furious with this product, which is now ruined and I have to throw it away now because it is beyond the point of being cleaned and uses. Essentially, I there $40 down the drain and my kids, who love waffles, are going to be devastated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk","review":"I've used mine twice. I have yet to get an edible waffle from it. Every waffle tears to shreds when I try to remove it. Instead of non-stick, they ought to call it maximum stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad news for waffle lovers","review":"Based on my experiences and the other reviews, it seems one must be lucky to get a waffle maker that works. The Cuisinart WMR-CA Round Classic Waffle Maker I received was a disaster from the very first waffle.On our first try, the waffle split neatly in half when we tried to open the waffle maker and stuck to the griddles. We carefully peeled it off, cleaned the griddles, seasoned them with cooking oil, and tried again. Waffle #2 was burnt to a crisp and raw inside. Waffle #3 was a return of waffle #1. We used a faithful old Black & Decker for almost 20 years before it wore out with never a failure, so we're hardly waffle novices. I believe that some people may have gotten waffle makers that worked, but ours wasn't among them.I'd say if you have plenty of time and don't mind packaging up returns and taking them to the post office, go ahead and order one. You might get lucky. Otherwise, keep looking. This waffle maker isn't worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried it...","review":"I bought this waffle iron a couple of weeks ago and I'm not very happy with it for the following reasons. It browns waffles very unevenly. It doesn't have a large enough reservoir for overflow so if you accidentally overfill the iron at all the batter ends up on the waffle maker and on the counter. The waffles tend to stick to the top part of the iron even though the iron is new and supposedly nonstick. I'm already looking for a new waffle iron and wish I had kept the receipt for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are round waffles a problem?","review":"I didn't think it mattered what shape the waffles were until now. I like square. We end up cooking more waffles than we can eat so the rest can be frozen...and reheated...but not in a standard toaster! They don't fit because they're round. We don't find sticking an issue but we use Pam first. It'll do for now, but we'll replace it with a square one next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the price","review":"I bought this waffle maker to just have a standard, decent model around the place that would make standard, decent waffles. It didn't have to be awesome, so I didn't want to spend eighty dollars. And it's not awesome, but it's good and I'm happy with it.You do have to choose your recipe carefully. I tried my first batch with Alton Brown's classic buttermilk waffles, which had a delicious taste, but I just could not get them crispy in this unit. They went from floppy to burnt. Then, this morning, I tried the Waffles of Insane Greatness recipe, which was terrific -- crisp on the outside, tender inside. So choose your recipe carefully -- it's got to have plenty of oil, and corn starch helps, too, to get it crispy on the non-stick surface. I always spray the plates, too.Another trick I use is to put a heavy wooden cooking board on top of the iron a few seconds after I close it, in order to weight it down a bit. I think that helps with crispness, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waffle Maker","review":"We like our Classic Waffle Maker. We were especially wanting to get one that had small holes instead of the Belgian type of waffle and this does that. It makes good waffles and we are able to adjust the crispness to our taste. Some reviews said the waffles would stick, however, we use regular pancake mix and just add about a teaspoon of oil to the mix and it works well. The only drawback to this device is the selector for crispness is not tight. It can be difficult to determine exactly where it is set because it moves freely for about 1/4 of an inch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works pretty well for a while, but didn't last very long","review":"This waffle maker worked pretty well for about 18 months, during which we used it about once or twice a month. The waffle pockets are not very deep (about a quarter of an inch), and the thermostat setting has a lot of play, which makes it fairly inaccurate, but for the waffle recipe we use (Alton Brown's awesome Luft-Waffle recipe), we just left it at the lowest setting and the waffles were done perfectly after about 1.5 minutes. However, the non-stick surface started pealing in a few small spots and eventually the thermostat broke, overheating the waffle iron to the point where the non-stick just came of in flakes, at which point we threw it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS WAFFLE MAKER!!!!","review":"I just received my waffle maker and I have just got finished having Banana Chocolate chip waffles for lunch! My family loves waffles and I hate buying them in the frozen section at the store.

My 1st batch of waffles stuck and almost burned, but I sprayed a little Pam on the top and bottom before putting my waffle mix on and waited a few seconds before closing the lid and the 2nd batch came out PERFECT!

I keep it at my Parents' home for when I visit. Setting 4, without fail, will produce the perfect crispy waffles. I use non stick cooking spray on it, though some people are against that.I've experimented with different waffle recipes and to make them extra fluffy and healthier, I use whipped egg whites, a little baking powder and a little lemon juice with basic waffle recipes. They come out fantastic in this waffle iron.The only thing I would change is the fact that it's not the Belgian style waffles with deeper squares. I recently purchased one that is Belgian style and flips, and am yet to try it out.If you're not bothered by the size of the square indents, definitely go for this one! It's also sold at Bed, Bath & Beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this waffle iron just before Christmas with the intent of having a brunch with 4 other couples.

We used the iron on a \\"2\\" setting, though it goes to \\"5\\", \\"2\\" was perfect for our Paleo waffles and they were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.Only problem was the awful smell with the initial use.

I too gave Cuisinart the benifit after reading the reviews and purchased this. The hinges are very loose. It sticks very badly. If you spray Pam on the iron for each waffle the Pam works ok. The temp control is very loose and you have to wait about a minute after the light changes to take them out. Even then they will not be all brown and they are full of holes. I have to wonder if in the past this model wasn't Chinese junk but now it is not a good buy in my opinion. I would much prefer a little higher price for something of a higher quality.

This product does work. Watch how much batter you put into it, though, as it will expand and leak over the side and force the top and bottom apart (as there's no form of latch on this thing.) There's also no on and off switch that I can find... I literally have to plug it in and unplug it to use. The hinge separating the top and bottom wiggles clumsily as well, and the no-stick surface required quite a long time for me to scrape and wash afterwards, as it stuck on the very first use.It works, and is inexpensive... so I guess this is just an example of getting what you pay for... in this case, not a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many design flaws","review":"My main problem with this waffle maker is that if you have a batter overflow (which is a common problem since it seems to be very easy to put either too much or too little in this waffle maker) then it overflows into the crevice with the dial and then is impossible to clean.

This machine makes good waffles, but it overflows very easily. If you fill it correctly with batter using the recipes provided (as well as others I have tried), it does not fill in the dimples of the waffle on the top after cooking. If you add enough extra batter to fill in the incomplete upper dimples, then it overflows. I am accustomed to waffle batter overflow, but what makes this one so frustrating is the spewed out batter invariably runs into the temperature control slide!

Eventually it just falls off. Our first one died within the warranty period. The second one lasted until just beyond the warranty period. It is a stupid design flaw on an otherwise wonderful product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I don't make waffles very often, so I wasn't looking at buying something super-expensive for only occasional use. The price seemed like a good value, and the reviews were mostly positive. However, this waffle iron had enough design issues that I returned it after the first use.Pros: efficient space-saving design, easy to storeCons: rear hinge does not expand up, so when the waffle expands during cooking it opens the front of the waffle maker, venting the steam directly onto the handle, and making the waffles cook unevenly. At first I thought I was putting too much batter on the iron, but after several creative batter-pouring and spreading attempts I continued to have the same problem. Uneven cooking, steam burns on my hand when I tried to open the maker, and shoddy construction that allows the top plate to wiggle significantly from side to side when moving the unit were enough to convince me it was not worth the money or the headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"May call for a little adjustment, but it's good","review":"This waffle iron cooks an excellent light thin waffle. I've enjoyed having it, and I recommend it.There is one possible misunderstanding that caused me a bit of trouble at first, so I'll warn you. If you have been using a waffle iron where the best indicator that the waffle is done is that it stops steaming, you may end up with the waffles made in this one being a bit overdone and a bit hard. Because the waffles are not at all thick, the cooking is very quick; and the steam may still be there when the waffle should be removed. The best method I have found is to wait for the ready light (green) to go on and then remove the waffle fairly promptly; it will be cooked and crisp and tender.For that reason, I wish that the lights were elevated a bit so I, sitting at the table, could look at the waffle iron, sitting on the countertop, and see the color of the light; but that's just me--if I'm sitting I like to stay that way as much as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as the reviews...","review":"I bought this because of the great reviews and especially because several people said the waffles were crispy, well, they are....for about 30 seconds and then they get soft....unless you put them in the toaster....which isn't very convenient if you're wanting to eat them.

Once again, a stock character in a stock tale---this one made even worse by even *more* tedious pointless rambling than there was in the first book (which at least had the crutch of an actual plot to help alleviate the tedium).However, this story's biggest flaw lies in its failure to exploit the most interesting characters---the Hawkbrothers. Once again, we've got a good chance to see their daily life, and it's simply glossed over. A possible enriching facet which *could* have been used to make the Hawkbrothers more well-rounded and interesting---their mild xenophobia toward outsiders---was mentioned, then simply ignored.This is the last Lackey series I'll be reading.

I'd recommend this book for people like myself who are in love with Valdemar and can't stand the thought of missing a single tidbit, but non-Misty fans would probably hate it.

The few mathematical expressions that appear in the book invariably contain misprints. The frequency of occurrence of the word \\"homosexual\\" and the relentless implication that Turing's life revolved around sex is insulting to Turing's genius.

However, when I opened the book I was sorely disappointed. Chapter one starts out with a story written in Hebrew. If I knew Hebrew, I wouldn't need this book. But the author assumes you know 150 Hebrew words including: father, eats, mother, says, I, you, please, school, son, morning, chalk, garden, window, etc. It's common practice in language books to skip over words that are obvious cognates, but since Hebrew has no relationship with English, the only cognates are those words that have become a part of our language due to religion such as seraph and hallelujah. This is the only level one language book I've ever seen that makes such large assumptions about the readers knowledge of a language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need Primer before Level 1","review":"Hebrew is far from English.

Purchase \\"The First Hebrew Primer\\" (donot forget the answer book) (level zero) first, THEN move on to this book (level 1).Reasons for not perfect: This book assumes a classroom situation (with a knowledgeable teacher). Multiple glossaries make word definitions hard to locate and many words arenot defined. The \\"Etymological Dictionary of the Hebrew Language\\" supplies answers even when internet dictionaries fail. This book needs a better glossary, appendixes and an answer sheet, but I have seen nothing better to continue AFTER \\"The First Hebrew Primer\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and real","review":"This book was a great read - funny and real.

I felt like this wasn't appropriate for my 7-year-olds and especially not with a \\"oh well, things happen\\" kind of attitude. There was no real 'feeling' in this book and I think the story needs it to work.I used Trojan Horse by Emily Little this year. It's a brief overview without getting too in-depth or too gruesome.

Amazon.com's recommendation center has never steered me so wrong before, but I guess there's always a first time. When I finally slogged my way through it, I donated it to a homeless shelter.

There was a small ding on the back metal housing but that was easy to fix. The temp controller seems a bit finnicky but it can definitely get the beer cold enough. I even froze a glass of water that I had in there to check the temp. The drip tray is just plain stupid but all the hardware (regulator, tap, tower) seem solid and well made. There are certain things that let you know this kegerator is not top of the line but for the price it performs well and is worth having draft beer at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Fit & Finish, High Price","review":"For what boils down to a mini-fridge the kegerator is priced way too high.

Finally got a refund and bought one locally after negotiating an internet price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sanyo Beer Cooler","review":"The first unit I received was damaged in shipping. It took about a week or so for the vendor to arrange picking up the damaged unit. Once the damaged cooler arrived at warehouse, another unit was sent. This one arrived intact and works well. About the only shortcoming is that the instructions are a little short on details. For example, the beer faucet has several parts/pieces that need assembly, but there are no detailed instructions on how to do this. I did what was intuitively obvious, which appeared to work. Other that that, I'm enjoying the cold contents this item dispenses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good, but is leaking after a couple of months","review":"Pretty good - easy to use (included instructions are lacking, however) was working fine for a couple of months, but now it seems to run all of the time, and I am getting water all over the bottom of the inside. I checked for leaks but couldn't find any. The seals seem to be fine as well. It also seems to get very hot in the back.

And this book takes the prize. Apart from providing a delicious overview of world history, this brilliant work contains fascinating trivia on every page. If you've ever wanted to know the answers to the following questions, this book will do it with elegance and grace. Why are the days of the week named the way they are (Sunday, Monday, etc.)? What is the story behind the Gordian Knot? How does the Chinese script work? How was the marathon race invented?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Without \\"cult\\" there is no culture","review":"Since other reviewers have hit most of the high points of this book -- its comprehensiveness, its accessible style, its suitability for reading aloud, etc. -- I'll focus on one little-discussed aspect: its respect for religion. Gombrich has no interest in proselytizing his readers; you will find no arguments on behalf of any particular religion in this book. Yet he appreciates that without \\"cult\\" there is no culture, and that religion has been the driving force of all civilizations. The world's major religious figures, e.g., Christ, Buddha, and Mohammed, are discussed in detail and presented fairly. We've been reading aloud a few chapters a week for about a month, and my children, especially the sixth-, fourth- and first-graders, have profited enormously from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice overview","review":"It is hard to condence history, but Gombrich does a great job at the overview.

The radio story was actually about a similar style book titled \\"A Little Book of Language\\" I didn't care much about that title, but this one piqued my interest, so I bought it! I read a chapter or two (only a few pages)each night and as a person who didn't care much for or pay attention to history during my school years, I now understand what I missed!! This book gets the main ideas/topics across without overwhelming you with minute details. I love it! Definitely a good book/gift for an older child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Putting History into Perspective","review":"We all learn little chapters of history at school, quite often not chronologically and certainly with little understanding of the timeline of our planet. This book, old fashioned though it may be, lays out the history of the world in simple, colorful and exciting prose, relevant to children and adults alike. Little snippets of history that I learnt in school now have a new perspective and relevance. Mr Gombrich writes very evocatively and with great respect for human strengths and weaknesses."},{"rating":"2","title":"[review of the audiobook version] an enlightening book; very well read","review":"This is currently my favorite audiobook (and I have dozens!). It is an excellent wee book from the author of the more famous and much longer \\"The Story of Art\\" - now in its 16th edition! If The Story of Art was written for college students, this one was originally written for school children - although it is more insightful than many adult history books I have read. It is enchanting, educational and extremely entertaining! (can you tell I like adjectives beginning with \\"e\\"?!)It is also read superbly (by Ralph Cosham) at a pace that people of all ages can easily follow.I therefore thoroughly recommended this book for adults and children alike.If you want more detail, go for JM Roberts' masterpiece (History of The World) a much longer (54 hour) audiobook that is also an absolute classic - but this \\"Little History\\" is the best place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for young people to \\"find\\" on your bookshelf","review":"An excellent, sweeping, review of world history written in a fashion that young people can understand and appreciate.Most, if not all, kids will learn about world history in school piece by piece and when they do they will probably get bogged down in details like \\"How much corn did the Incas grow?\\", \\"What is the average rainfall in Egypt?\\" type \\"testable\\" minutiae that turns people off from history because they think that to know history they have to know which country grew the most apples in the 18th century.But this book presents history in an interesting manner that shows the impact of individual people, and sweeps you from one time and place to the next one while referring back to what you already read so you can fit it all together in your mind.I bought my copy so my three kids can \\"find\\" it on my bookshelf sometime down the road and think they've discovered a secret treasure their boring old man doesn't know about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for a 12 yr old nephew","review":"My nephew is a history buff and likes to read.

It is wonderful for teenagers, adults, and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"best summary of history","review":"Just finished reading \\"A Little History Of The World\\" by E.H. Gombrich. The most readable history book ever. Reads like a journey. It didn't feel like I was reading a history book. It felt like a really interesting novel and the characters were the countries. The author was lucky as he came from a German Jewish family and through his job got out of Germany just in time. This Art Historian wrote the book in London in 1936 for children (older children). Then he edited the book in 1985. I'm pretty sure it wasn't translated until 2005. I couldn't put it down. The author made great attempts to not be biased, include everyone and give you just enough info to know whats going on with out boring you to death with too many dates and details. Its like a really well written summary. This needs to be a school text book. His message at the end is really wonderful about making the most of the time we have here, that \\"it's all worth it\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laura Reviews: A Little History of the World","review":"Gombrich takes the reader on a pilgrimage from 'before there were any people' up to the end of World War II.But he does it masterfully, in a style written for young readers - and yay! - we adult readers like it. Simple sentences, easy explanations and wit. Chapter titles like \\"An Unlucky King and Lucky King,\\" and \\"Heroes and their Weapons,\\" wrap it all up in digestable morsels with factual information.What's even better is that it covers more than American and British history, which is most of what we were taught in the U.S. China, Turkey, Africa are all included equally.And yes, while Gombrich illustrates that history *does* repeat itself, he doesn't write the same bland comatose-invoking text over and over. It's fresh in each chapter.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"its a history of europe","review":"Misleading title. Its just a history of Europe. That why it fails. Great civilizations / countries like China, Japan, India , North America, South America and even Russia are ignored or dismissed in a few lines. Looks like the author was actually living in the middle ages. He seems to have little idea that there was a big world beyond the boundaries of the European continent. A few chapters on the rest of the world would have helped. Keeping this aspect aside, the book is OK. Easy to read. Easier to forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very light and simple read, written in another time and age - updated 12-2010","review":"The concept sounded great, but I really can't recommend this book. It's very euro-centric, too simple and light for adults, and unless you read it aloud to your kids, so they can ask questions and get explainations that are missing, not readable for a young adult. It was clearly written in another time and age and it shows. And stopping as it does at 1945 or so, it's missing a little history to say the least.Updated 12-2010So I saw that so many people found this book to be 5 stars, and only 5 of 9 people felt this review was helpful, I reread the book. I am just as convinced then ever - it is out of date, missing entire cultures(and not minor ones), not interesting enough for a child and too simple for an adult. Perhaps I've read too much history to find the value in this book. I would even say that even one of the Dummy books would be a better read then this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This author did insert opinions.","review":"I read the other reviews and decided to try this book. From the reviews, I thought this would not be written from any particular worldview. It is. This author did provide facts and he did insert his opinions. I bought this book to read out loud to my children. I only read the first half of the book to myself and stopped. I kept trying to find a reason to share this book with my children. The information provided was better provided in the VP History Cards. Here is one quote of advice that the author offered, \\"One day - but there's no hurry - you may come to read the Bible\\". (pg. 25) One book review from the book says it well, \\"Gombrich opens with the most magical definition of history I have ever read...

For a shape sorter, the added feature of the animal sounds is what keeps him coming back to it. Some problems with it are: the door on the hatch where you retrieve the shapes comes off, it is probably taken off as a way to get the pieces out because they are hard to get out of the ship, especially the round, yellow, lion piece. Also, my son has had his hand stuck in the round hole where the shape is supposed to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a sinker....","review":"My daughter recieved this toy as a christmas present and I thought she would love it.

The photographs are also from his own personal collection and are, therefore, unlikely to have been published elsewhere. The Maps, however, could so easily be improved.In Part One of this book, Herbert Werner takes the reader through the glorious years of success after success for both Germany and her U Boat offensive. In Part Two, however, we reach that turning point in the war which he aptly describes as \\"Above us Hell.\\" Finally, Part 3 is equally effectively described as \\"Disaster to Defeat.\\"An interesting and well written account of the U Boat war of WW2 - not only because the author actually took part, but also because he was fortunate enough to survive that war and relive his experiences so that we might read and learn.NM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barska Lucid 8x21 Compact Binocular","review":"I was very disappointed with this purchase.

I read the same complaints from others, bad strings and tuning knobs (not sure what they are called, but the part that the strings wrap around that you tighten to tune the strings) so I expected it, but what do you want for the price.

They come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and price tags. This violin I bought when I first started out. It is the perfect violin to see how dedicated you are to the instrument, since it has a very cheap price tag. I recommend to all begginers this violin, but only for their first few months or year depending on their progress. The violin does have a major fault in that the action. Meaning the strings are to far off the fingerboard so it's hard to play in the higher positions. So I recommend sanding down the bridge until the strings are all 1/8 of an inch off the fingerboard at the end of the fingerboard. Other than that flaw the violin is perfect for young kids since it is a very durable violin and not to mention cheap, and always remember the violin doesn't make the music as much as the violinist makes the violin make music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I purchased this beginner's violin for myself as I'm desirous of learning to play \\"from scratch\\"!

But I doubt this is a fault of the product. I have purchased new strings and hope to beginning playing again soon! The resin that came with this package was not good quality though. You should buy a different kind as this seemed like a sample that didn't help the new bow strings at all.

However, unwilling to leave this book without having given it every chance to redeem itself (or rather, the author, not the book) I read until the very end.

It explains the physics of the devices, but that part of the chapter is not interesting enough to read. The example problems are plug and chug problems, which provide you with almost all of the necessary numbers and the reader only has to follow the given equations. This would make the student think that all problems can be done using the exact equations given except for the fact that multiple equations are given for similar situations with no explanation of the differences. Finally, the end of chapter problems are much harder than the example problems and cannot be done by simply following the equations."},{"rating":"1","title":"I totally agree with the others","review":"Yes, this is a horrible book, I do not even know why the professors choose to use this book, the author is horrible at explaining anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"The internet is the way to go for college text books.

The book has also never been revised, from my understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"More difficult than it should be","review":"This book is far more confusing than it needs to be. It was clearly written for experts in circuit design and not for students. Frequently, the book will skip several steps under the assumption that you understand the reasoning and steps in between. However, if it's your first time learning about transistors, you end up more confused when the chapter is finished.

As long as it's out of the sun and has good air circulation, it evaporates and keeps the insulin much cooler than the surrounding air. Even if it's very hot outside, placed in a draft (near the shady window of a moving car, etc.) this little cooler will work efficiently.**BUT** Who decided to order the new white satin Frio labels? They are made of a material (probably polyester) that catches in the velcro and sticks, ripping tiny fibers out and preventing a quick opening or closing of the pouch.

The children reading or being read to must make the connections between the few words and the actions / emotions they see on the page.

It is not about having the big ideas of each book fed to you through text.Try it out yourself sometime...you'd probably be less likely to make the review you did and maybe be able to answer the questions you posed in the process.Shannon's books are just fine...and rhyming isn't a prerequisite for a children's book =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the message here?","review":"After receiving this book as a gift from my mother, whom oddly enough while growing up would only read us Peter Rabbit, Goodnight Moon, etc. I just couldn't understand what message this book was trying to send.

I hope the next album is going to be much much better, and Liam will star to record a real HARD ELECTRO music, not DISCO 80's with a terrible female vocal. We need THE PRODIGY, man.

This track is pretty amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe","review":"This is the Prodigy? How far they have fallen! This album is truly one of the worst that I have ever heard. It is a compilation of random discordant sounds with absolutely no cohesiveness or inspired artistry that I have come to expect. I had visions of them in the studio just cranking out this garbage in record time so they could fulfil contractual obligations and get back to lounging by the pool. This is NOT the Prodigy. Check out what they can really do when they are still hungry. Music For The Jilted Generation (Their best) and The Fat Of The Land are far superior in every aspect.

I even liked Baby's Got A Temper(even if only a little). I guess I was expecting more Bombastic Bad-Assness and thats not what I got. These songs sounded like they could be on the soundtrack to Fast and The Furious. They were boring run-of-the-mill hip hop inspired dance tracks...with lame female vocals....they should play this cd in a Skate Rink. I'm sorry but all of what made Prodigy original is gone.

Id've thought it to be garbage if I listened to it on a boombox. Driving down the street crankin this is seriously better than hearing \\"rubber band man\\" playing ANYWHERE, IMO. The music world needs more music like this before it's completely gone down the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their worst by far","review":"For any fans thinking of buying this album, a strong word of caution: It is not Fat of the Land Part 2, and it doesn't really take the band to the next level, as the previous two albums had done. There's no progression here, if anything there is backsliding a little bit back into Jilted Generation's territory - except that the band's been there and done that already. This is an album where the band are treading water, with bland beats, female vocals that don't really fit into the Prodigy ethos, and completely forgettable tracks. Only Spitfire really has the Prodigy mark of quality on it. The rest is so indistinguishable from any middling electronica group out there.Also, Maxim and Keith might not originally have been vocalists, but the band evolved and garnered more success with them on vocals. They are sorely missed here, and leaving them off was a mistake. At best, this probably should have been released as a Liam side project than carrying the Prodigy name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing rock/electronic/hip hop/funk....Prodigy rocks","review":"I'll be honest, i didnt like this ablum when first came out and now, years later, with the Prodigy dropping a new album at end of 2012..I went back to AONO. It rocks, don't know what my problem was before, minus the lack of Keith Flint and Maxim, which made Invaders Must die, awesome..but this album is Liam Howlett's baby and he stretches out to everything from hard rock to hip hop and funk while fusing Prodigy's electronica into all of it.

However, this album came nowhere near living up to the previous Prodigy albums for a couple of reasons: the songs are somewhat repetetive and has several songs with VERY obnoxious, grating samples/loops.

When you think they've outdone themselves with experience, They come out with fat of the land which was a different style but still an excellent album within thier time. Thier albums have always been high quality. I figured that they had two or three really good albums left in them. Yet it takes them years and a bad single \\"babys got a temper\\" to put forth all this time and effort to come up with this junk. I can't believe they had to use a sample from a michael jackson album to make what they though was a creative track. This album is worthy of a basement startup using crappy equipment and no experience. They should have stopped when they had a chance and kept everyone wondering what beautiful music these legends could have created if they hadn't stopped at fat of the land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again, if 4.5 was an option...","review":"Ok so I really do enjoy this album. I really do. It's a complete step in the right direction after the frantic and somewhat uninspired \\"Fat of the Land\\".This album is fast-paced, crunchy, and does everything right to keep me interested and satisfied.My favorite track right now is Hotride, the female's vocals being wonderfully deviant and not beautiful at all, but fitting right in with the crunchiness of the track. Other tracks of mention include the single, \\"Girls\\", and \\"Memphis Belles\\".The problem with the disc that I had overall is that it tends to flow into itself, and if you are using it as background music it becomes monotonous. You have to listen to it, really listen, to enjoy it all the way through.Definitely give this disc a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I heard plenty of bad comments about this release and honestly they were for the most part irrelevant when i finally had the chance to listen to it.Now let me say that the first single \\"girls\\" is the weakest track on the whole album and it's weird how it was chosen as the first single to kick off the album. So please don't base your judgements just on that one song.You won't find any firestarters (well, with the exception of spitfire perhaps), no smack my bitch ups, and no breathes. there are no strong singles off this one but there are strong consistent songs that hold up the album if you let it.Just breathe with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE word: L -A-M-E","review":"We waited all those years after Fat of the Land for THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Yuck"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I'm a new Prodigy fan (Fat of the Land is my only other album) but anyone can get hooked with this album.

The release of \\"Fat of the Land\\" one week before my birthday was the greatest. All the clubs were remixing all the tracks, and the disc never came out of my player. Seven years later, I am married, have a new baby and live in the 'burbs. I have to say I would have been really sad if this CD had been anywhere near as good as Fat of the Land, because it would have made me feel old... now I just feel glad knowing that the Prodigy were at their prime when I was in my prime partying years. I own and still listen to all my Prodigy CD's, but I think this one will collect dust. I gave it two stars instead of one just because it's the Prodigy. \\"Girls\\" is the only halfway decent track, and it doesn't even sound like them. \\"Baby's Got a Temper\\" was better than half the tracks on the album.

My copy also came with a bone shaped cookie cutter! very good though short and card pages so robust enough for kids etc... my dog loves the peanut biscuits"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book","review":"I really enjoy making the recipes in this book and my dog really enjoys eating them (as do the dogs in his obedience class). I have only two issues with the book. First, I don't think that the batch sizes were changed from the original book to accomodate the smaller bone cookie cutter size, because I always end up with many more treats than it says I should have (not that my dog is complaining). Also, there are no recipes for dogs who have corn and wheat allergies as all call for either corn or wheat flour although I'm sure with a little work you could substitute oat or rice flour. All in all a fun and creative book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doggylicious","review":"So far my 'lil guy loves the peamut butter biscuits and so do his friends, Diesel and Samantha. I would highly recommend this book for a natural treat you make for your pet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Easy to Make","review":"I just finished making the Smaller Collar Diet Bones and my golden retriever *loves* them! I have a few other doggy treat cookbooks, but this one is by far the easiest. Simple and short ingredient lists (with common ingredients). It'd be very easy to substitute different ingredients if you wanted to get creative too. Dough came together in my mixer in no time. It does take awhile to cut out all the biscuits (if I'm pressed for time, I can see myself just cutting the dough into short strips and baking that way). Most of all, I really like knowing there are no \\"iffy\\" ingredients in what I'm feeding to my dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"My dogs give it dew claws up!","review":"I've never seen my retrievers behave so well as when I'm holding one of these homemade biscuits up to them. I've given them as gifts to friends' dogs as well. Although I've seen other biscuit recipes, these are EASY to make, with ingredients most people already have in their cupboards. However, I have found that I have to bake the biscuits longer than recommended, otherwise they stay a little moist and will get moldy. The folks at my vet's office have begged for the recipes to the diet doggy bones and the peanut butter biscuits. Now, I never make my husband cookies without making a batch for my dogs as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bone-Apetit!","review":"This book provides a fun and easy way to bake love and nutrition into your dog's diet.

It arrived in great condition at a tremendous price, and in an unbelievable timeframe. Thank you for the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius!","review":"Sixpence became popular with songs like \\"Kiss Me\\" and \\"There She Goes\\", but before all that was a very different band. \\"This Beautiful Mess\\" is an album free of pop music. Leigh Nash sings with a sort of passion and emotion that seems very genuine, and the music in turn has a great deal of energy. Each song has its own unique style, and a suprisingly strong rock overtone throughout the album gives way to great guitar solos and outros one would never expect form the pop icons. Whether you're looking for a CD with a strong religious message, or just great music you can really get into, this is an outstanding album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A necessary addition to your Bluegrass collection","review":"This album is so appropriate for today's Bluegrass audience, while remaining trueto traditional Bluegrass. \\"Little Girl\\" and \\"Without You\\"(writen by lead singer Ray Craft) show maturity beyond his years both lyrically and with regard to the depth of his sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Art, But Good","review":"Fans of other Kaishaku series, such as Kannazuki no Miko and Steel Angel Kurumi are going to want to see this series. This is a mashup of other Kaishaku worlds, stuck into a blender and pourned back out in similar molds. Many characters and types from previous series are rehashed, but in a way that does not lessen the enjoyment.The same fetishes as always are involved - maids, catgirls, Yuri, etc.It's a must-see for Kaishaku fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very, Very Bizarre Film","review":"Without stating the obvious, this film is so unbelievably bad it isnt even funny. The acting is confused,the plot makes hardly any sense and has one of the most absurd endings in film history. The Makers of this film however deserve some credit for persuading such talented actors as Hugh Grant and Malcolm McDowell to appear in this appalling drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the Worst Movie I Have EVER Seen.","review":"I sat downt to watch this movie with some hope because I generally like Hugh Grant movies, but this movie is absolute garbage. The first half is simple to undestand, but it is boring. The second half is the most incoherent 45 minutes in cinema history. I still do not fully understand this movie. Please anyone reading this do NOT waste time watching this movie. I would rather stare at a blank screen for the same amount of time than watch this mess again."},{"rating":"1","title":"it truly is the worst","review":"I have to agree with everyone above, except I'll say unequivocally that it is the absolute worst ever, and I thought I could sit through anything if Hugh Grant was in it. It's true, this video has no redeeming value whatsoever, unless it's that some of the costumes in Venice are cool looking. Positively not worth spending 2 seconds or 2 cents on. There's a lot of horrid, tasteless and pointless violence, without even the satisfaction of understanding why or seeing the villains get their come-uppance at the end. I suppose someone had a fuzzy notion of appearance vs. reality symbolism, but it fails utterly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring movie ever made! Minus 100 stars !","review":"Hugh Grant would probably, and should, cringe at seeing this junk available for sale. I rented this movie, before Grant's L.A. escapade. I watched about 30 minutes and was so tortured by how horrible and boring it was, I rewound it and returned it, asking for an exchange. The owner of the video store watched it and threw it out. Grant isn't even cute in this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We never did finish viewing this movie","review":"I have to agree with the views expressed by everyone here. We invited friends over to watch it and, after waiting what seemed an endless time for everything to start making sense, not one out of six of us wanted to finish it. Like others here, we couldn't understand why someone like Hugh Grant should have accepted a role in a movie with such a muddled plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I watched the whole thing but then again I am autistic this stuff made me laugh myself silly!","review":"The whole movie makes no sense at all. Talk about violence for violence sake. There is not one single solitary frame of this mess that would be worth paying a penny to see unless you just want to torture yourself. This movie is nothing personified and taken to heights few other directors will ever reach or want to. Poor Hugh Grant what kind of day must he been having when he said ok to staring in this dreck! Night Train to Venice avoid this ride at all costs. Take the Last Train to Clarksville Instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"really, really awful","review":"Unlike the other reviewers, i think there is a good reason to watch this film, and that is just to be able to say that you watched Hugh Grant's worst movie ever, which i am sure he (grant) must be absurdly embarrassed about. i suppose the film is supposed to be something about how dreams might just be reality (the closing quotation), and i guess in a weird way, it is kind of like a dream, in that nothing makes sense. characters cross paths, but there is no clear conflict, no clear climax, just lots of different characters thrown into scenes that make absolutely no dramatic sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not a complete product, as shown in picture.","review":"They must change the picture and product description. It is misleading, as it is not complete product to mount the projector as shown with mounted projector.

Throw this right in there with Jethro Tull, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Blue Oyster Cult for 70's retreads of the year. How many more ways can companies package this stuff? My advice is to find the original \\"Stained Class\\" cd release on eBay or zShops for a third of this price. The sound on this remastered verison doesn't show a great improvement over the original. And after one listen you'll just skip over the bonus tracks every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST METAL ALBUM EVER MADE!","review":"This is album was so influential around the time of its release that that launched the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal. All members of Judas Priest deliver incredible performances for this awesome album. Every song is excellent classic metal. My personal favorite. You simply cannot call yourself a metal fan if you don't have Judas Priest's \\"Stained Class.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Stand by for an exciting CD!","review":"The obvious highlight of this CD is 'Better by you better than me' which may or may not contain the reversed \\"do it!\\" lyric. Not withstanding that, the rest of the CD is just as powerful. The quintet of Exciter, White Heat..., Better By You..., Stained Class, and Invader will have you running into walls and smashing things in no time! BTW, the reversed \\"do it!\\" is very hard to locate, but my money has it at around two minutes and thirty seconds into \\"Better by you better than me\\". Any thoughts?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better early albums.","review":"This album is a powerful force in the NWOBHM. It followed Sin After Sin and is much better than that one. \\"Exciter\\" is a concert favorite and \\"Beyond The Realms Of Death\\" is one of their more melodic moments. But, melodic for this band still kicks. Not the first JP album to buy, but it is one to add to the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stained Class","review":"Stained Class being Judas Priest's 4th studio album and their 1978 release is the first album with Les Binks playing the drums. The booklet contains well-written liner-notes by the band and all the lyrics including three photographs of the band from the time of the recording of the album. We also get two extra tracks one which was during the early years of the band and one recorded during one of their many world tours. The sound is very raw and the lyrics are well-written. Allmusic gives the album 4.5/5 and this is right but since 5 is a little to high and I can not give half points it gets 4/5. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Stained Class is a classic. It is also notorious of allegedly inspiring two Nevada kids to commit suicide with the subliminal message \\"do it\\" on Better By You, Better Than Me. Exciter is a classic and the most memorable song on here. White Heat, Red Hot has a memorable chorus. Better By You, Better Than Me is a slower song with interesting vocal work. The title track, Stained Class, a true gem. Invader is a decent rocker. Saints In Hell is pretty cool. Sabage is about the Native Americans losingb their land. Beyond the Realms of Death is a ballad about suicide. Heroe's End has probably the best riffs on the entire album. Stained Class os a classic that shouldn't be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 70s Metal","review":"Stained Class was released when the disco craze was at its peak. Kiss, Rod Stewart and others released albums at this time, too. Remember \\"I was made for loving you baby...\\" and \\"If ya think I'm sexy and ya want my body come on let me know...\\" and similar monuments to musical idiocy? Well, you're not going to find any hint of that from Judas Priest. This is a fine guitar-based album from the early years of genuine heavy metal. You can certainly tell it is pre-1980s but even for that era Priest's sound was unique. You certainly will not confuse it with Led Zeppelin or Aerosmith."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best 70's Priest Album","review":"I've always had a soft spot for Stained Class, an album you didn't really tell your friends you liked so much, no one else seemed to be into it.This album is Priest's finest moment in the 70's, until their sound took a new direction with \\"Hell Bent For Leather.\\"There is not a bad song on this one, and even more unknown songs like \\"Savage,\\" \\"Hero's End\\" and \\"Invader\\" have stood the test of time, and are some of Priest's finest. Even the title track is an iPod addition for me, despite not necessarily being a \\"metal head.\\" It's a transitional album for Priest, and possibly one of the most underrated metal or hard rock albums of all-time.And of course if you really like 70's Sabbath during the Ozzy years, you would likely dig 70's Priest."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beginning of a Dynasty","review":"Stained Class is one of the greatest albums ever made by Priest and the one that made them famous for Better by You, Better then Me.

On of the few groups I was actually \\"into\\" before they hit the big time. This is one of their best albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demos?","review":"First off I am a huge Judas Priest fan. I consider Screaming and Painkiller some of the best albums ever...of any genre but compared to those albums this one sounds like a demo. It's obvious the \\"Priest\\" sound was being solidified and still in the works which is why I say it seems like your listening to demos rather than a finished album.Either Halford learned to control his instument better or the engineer and producer didn't know how to capture him because as blasphemous as it sounds his high notes get annoying on Stained Class. When Halford goes high on Devil's Child on Screaming the effect is mind-boggleing but on Stained Class it can sound like cats fighting.Sorry to say but this album is only for hardcore fans or to complete a collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"made in USA or Made in Japan","review":"just recieve this audio cd,do not buy this.you will not get the Japan made audio cd,sorry.not for 8.29.Warning/////////////////"},{"rating":"1","title":"OVerrated","review":"I can assure you that this album is overrated. SIN AFTER SIN and HELL BENT FOR LEATHER (KILLING MACHINE) are clearly better than STAINED CLASS. They have more focus, more punch, a consistent line of work.The riffs in STAINED CLASS are weak and uninspired (exception: EXCITER and BEYOND THE REALMS OF DEATH). The album is not bad, but the others albums are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Mr. Tipton, don't do it, please!!!","review":"Dear Mr. Glenn TIpton (the actual leader of Judas): please, do not include any bonus tracks ina an already legendary record, if you don't have quality material to add!!

It includes new drummer Les Binks, who is superb. Stained Class contains excellent songs, great musicianship and thought-provoking lyrics. Thank goodness the lyrics are finally available, now I know what is being sung. I do wish that CBS would have included more bonus tracks(At least 4 would have been nice)when they took on this remastering overhaul. Sound quality has been improved over the original with the guitars having better presence. Drums are cleaner as well. The bonus tracks are fine but the first one 'Fire Burns Below', is a bit strange for a Priest song, definitely an outake. Vocals are excellent as usual reminding me a lot of 'Sad Wings Of Destiny' in their delivery. A must-have for the Priest fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a forgotten and under-appreciated classic","review":"I've owned a vinyl copy of this since I was in junior high school, in the early 80's, and it was always one of my quiet favorites, something I never really admitted liking so much to anyone really. Not many people I know appreciate early Judas Priest, just the way it is.Stained Class is a step into a bit of a 70's progressive rock direction, with complex songs that change tempo and vary a lot on odd beats, and aren't very radio friendly. The Downing/Tipton guitar work is phenomenal, and this record for the first time really shows off their talents.Every song on here is good, it's a complete album. The songs that stuck in my head the most as a teenager were \\"Beyond The Realms Of The Dead,\\" \\"Heroes End,\\" \\"Savage\\" and \\"Better By You, Better Than Me.\\"It's great to get into this music again, and is some of the more timeless metal out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"metal classic","review":"stained class is a great record. every song is great and theirs no bad songs to be heard. It starts with the metal classic \\"Exciter\\" and never lets up. another classic is Better By you better than me\\". The title track has classic vocals from halford and the second side of the album is classic with \\"Saints in hell\\" and \\"savage\\" along with one of my favorites \\"beyond The Relms Of Death\\". Stained Class along with \\"sad wings of Destiny are my favorites by priest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best","review":"One of the best rock-metal albums ever.It's as simple as that.Halford's vocals are absolutely stunning ,i consider this album as a vocal lesson for all singers!His voice ranges from high operatic to slow blues and angry metal screams.The sound of this album is way ahead of it's time paving the way for later metal bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stained Classic Metal Remastered","review":"Great album, great remaster. Signal to noise ratio and dynamic headroom capabilities of the PCM medium are finally realised here. Exciter, Invader and Better By You are hard rock classics. The current generation won't get it but who cares. As with all remasters of this sort, buy it before it gets gone. Incredible sound compared to the original cd release. And if you like this one get HELL BENT and British Steel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stained Class- A CLASSY c.d.! (Pun intended).","review":"Man, '70s metal just doesn't get any better than this! You have excellent drumming (Exciter); awesome riffs (White Heat, Saints in Hell, and Heroes End); brilliant lead playing (all songs); and even an embellished cover (Better by you).

You can't go wrong if you buy this c.d.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Throw it in the fridge first!","review":"Nice quality and good looking wine chiller.

The majority of Sinatraphiles have seen the movies that featured these songs, and what movies they were! Each song brings back memories of those movies. My particular favorite in this compilation is Frank's version of It's All Right With Me(from the sexy film Can Can), in my opinion it is the best interpretation of the song in recorded music.

They rival such junk authors as Goodkind and Jordan....actually as impossible as it sounds, they are worse than both authors.The story is not fantastical...it's stupid. Police called LEPreCONs HOW WITTY.Oh and while we're at it let's have a protagonist who has the depth of a slice of cardboard.I found myself looking at plot mistakes and implausibities more than reading the story....it made for a very hilarious read.Fantasy is great....farce is a waste of time.This book tops the waste pile...Computer wielding elves....INGENIUS...."},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a break","review":"This has got to be one of the WORST books I have ever read in my life. The charactors were shallow and half-developed, the plot was ANNOYING and half-developed, and the whole thing was just tediously irritating. It gave me a headache, in fact. The idea of the plot may have been interesting, had it been handled better. Altogether Artemis Fowl was about as deep as a damp paper towel.

A little too old for something like this, you might think, but it reads like a very good, smart action movie.

I read these books whenevever Ineed to escape for a little while.And as to all the comparasons to Harry Potter, it is a completely different type of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not the greatest","review":"I found this book in a store and fascinated by its glittering cover I opened it. It's mainly about a young criminal mastermind named Artemis Fowl, who tries to gain gold by kidnapping a fairy, who turns out to be Holly Short, a female captain.During the read, I laughed several times - plenty of jokes in there to keep people happy. There's a bit of fighting, not to mention developed technology. The words are easy and simple. I'd say it's a great book, but not the greatest. The book doesn't go very deep; but it's certainly entertaining. However, I recommend this book only to 4~6 graders or older people who feel younger. To others, I believe, it would be interesting but not exactly satisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was WONDERFUL.","review":"Artemis Fowl was a great book. I loved how he was a criminal mastermind. His comebacks when people talked to him were always great. He always knew what was happening even before other people told him!

My favorite character was actually Artemis Fowl because he was devilishly tricky and clever. It all started off in a city in an alley way of a city and later followed at Artemis Manor and underground. The majority of the book acquired at the Fowl Manor though. I also liked the part when the LepRecon officers (who live underground because they hate the sun and it drains all their powers) drop a bio bomb on the house which kills all living things. They do this in order to get back one of their officers that Artemis is holding hostage.

Artemis has no redeeming qualities, and he is, as one reviewer put it, \\"a nasty little boy.\\" Definitely not someone I want my daughter looking up to.

As a mother I don't want to read to my grade schoolers or middle schoolers for that matter anything about shooting up. Which is exactly what the drunken fairy was doing. I stopped reading it to them but read through it the rest of the way myself and found that in the end I hated it more than in the beginning. We threw it away....

Butler is the lacky who does what Artemis tells him to, always has at least one weapon, and can kill a man without caring. Cuss he is like a major cime lord. Caption Holy is like a trouble maker, never flows the rules, and is always under Commander Roots skin. Commander Root is the commander of the Lcm, as a very sort temper, and thinks he isn't as old as he looks.This story would be ok for some reads. The only thing I don't like is the frist five chapters put you to sleep, the plot is easy to figure out, and the only really good chapter is chapter 9 or 10.

For a second let's just forget about them both, because this book is not comparable with any other fantasy books. The language is easy (meant for age 9-12) and Eoin Colfer, the author, did a great job in ending the story.It is about a young masterminded criminal named Artemis Fowl. He goes on an adventure with his Butler from stealing the Book of the Fairies in the Underworld (a fantasy world exist underground). However, an officer fairy goes by the name of Captain Holly Short, and she becomes a problem to Artemis Fowl. After his capture of the captain, it brings a disaster to the Fowl Mansion.

I read on, thinking that it would get better, but I'm sorry to report I stopped halfway through the third \\"novel\\" and can't bring myself to finish reading the series. However, on the upside, I believe the book was written for younger readers that may still need the stereotypical characters to help them understand the non-existant dynamics of this book.So as not to be completely harsh, I enjoyed the premise of the book moreso than the writing itself and found the ideas it presented interesting if not overly absorbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gold for goal","review":"Artemis fowl.

Artemis Fowl is complex, it's unpredictable, it's imaginative, it has some gruesome descriptions, and it is really, really good.Colfer's focal point is the wanna-be evil boy genius. He's all genius, but he can't quite bring himself to be truly evil, and the conflict in character is fascinating to read. Colfer latches on to a real problem that so many youth identify with, sadly--the absentee parents for reasons that even they can't always help. Although Colfer acknowledges this issue, he doesn't preach, he just lets it be, and allows Artemis to make his own mess and dig his way out.Colfer's imaginative LEP unit and Foaly are great fun to read. I can't wait to get into the second novel, and I would not hesitate to recommend this series to any upper elementary/middle school aged reader, either in years or at heart. :D Order the series without reserve and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids, really fun for you.","review":"\\"Artemis Fowl\\" by Eoin Colfer is a great book to read to your kids while having a great time yourself.This is a story of a young boy who is beyond a mischievous young imp sbut not quite a diabolical genius.

I picked up the first book several weeks later and wasn't able to put it down. In my opinion, Fowl blows Harry Potter out of the water, and Colfer does a great job writing a book for adults as well as children. I read the book in about three days which is a feat for me. With two sons under the age of six, I have little time to sit down and enjoy a good book, but I quickly decided reading Fowl was worth my free time. I started the second book as soon as I finished the first and it is great too. Colfer does a great job of melding modern technology with magic and his Fowl character is a great blend of Sherlock Holmes and the Godfather all rolled up in a kid. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read good fiction or to any parent who is looking for something fun to read to their kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faries with a difference","review":"Most people would pick up this book and think no! Not another fairy story. In fact it took a lot of persuading before I was convinced it was good enough to buy! To start with the first chapter seemed a bit farsical but as I became immersed in the story to me it became more and more real. It's about twelve year old Artemis Fowl, a criminal mastermind with a thirst for blood. He he bargins with a fairy into letting him look at her magick book and he learns everything there is to know about being a fairy. With his knowledge he plans to blackmail a fortune out of the fairy kingdom but not if commander Holly Short has anything to do with it.This book has everything you need.

I was really disappointed. The only remotely likeable character was Holly Short, and even she wasn't that engaging. Artemis was an obnoxious, mean, shallow protagonist who wasn't redeemed at all by the ending of the story. I appreciate moral complexities in literary characters; Artemis was one-dimensional. The story was also boring - it was basically a rescue story with a few uncreative bells and whistles. The author didn't manage to make me believe in this alternate reality, unlike other writers of this genre like C.S. Lewis, Susan Cooper or, of course, J.K. Rowling. While waiting for the 5th Harry Potter book, try Phillip Pullman's Golden Compass Trilogy instead of Artemis Fowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comments on book","review":"The book starts rather nicely but soon loses its taste.

I agree, but I'll compare it to a brilliant mix of James Bond and Star Trek with the classic fantasy creatures.Artemis is a 12 year old criminal mastermind and he's developed the master plan to steal gold from the underworld fairies. Only, it's not going to be easy because the fairies are nearly invisible to the human population (Mud People) and they have tech that Captain Kirk would LOVE to get his hands on and have packaged into nifty little gadgets that only James Bond could appreciate.I really enjoyed this book as I think all 5th grade and up children would. The combat, and the effects of it, are a little bit graphic for younger children.After you finish reading the book, there is a cryptogram to decipher as an added bonus for kids who like to solve puzzles. It's not a tough code to break, but still alot of fun.I look forward to more installments of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book i have read- eniz","review":"I didn't think Eoin Colfer did a very good job with this book because it spent way too much time describing the scenery so much as the actual plot or characters. I have read much more interesting books than this. This book did have a great story, but the author didn't really use much rising action. He didn't really keep me waiting or anything. Eoin colfer could have done a much better job. I read this for readers workshop in class and I really hated having to open the book and start reading from where I left off.

It is a children's novel, but it is just as enjoyable for an adult to read (much like Harry Potter). Rather than being the typical sort of fairy tale, this one twists the whole convention. There are fairies, sprites, dwarves, and goblins, but not quite as we know them. The time period is the present day and we see the interaction between the species of fairy and human. There are guns, magic, and a whole lot of adventure in this book.What sets Artemis Fowl is the title character. He is the protagonist (mostly), but he is also the villain. Artemis is a 12 year old master criminal trying to rob the fairies of their gold. How this all comes about is a joy to read, and is highly creative.

At the same time, I thought some of the content was fairly questionable. Artemis is the most twisted twelve-year old imaginable. It's not just that he's a genius, or just that his life has been brilliantly harsh and cold. At twelve, twelve! this kid is cold as could be. There are a few cracks at various points, but he's generally cruel, calculating, and unrepentant. There's very little warmth between any characters in the book.The volume of deceit, manipulation, and arrogance in the book made it a surprisingly uncomfortable read. I kept reading it hopes that it would have a more redeeming end, and was sorely disappointed. In short, it's not a book I would feel at all comfortable recommending for children.

I really knew almost nothing about these books other than it's about a young criminal mastermind, basically he's an all-around genius.

Artemis' plot to kidnap a fairy for the ransom gold unfolds and seems inplausible in our real world but just another day at the office for the boy. And one seemingly flaw in Artemis' plan keeps you guessing, resulting in astonished glee at his genius.The story sucks you in and is ejoyable to the core.

The characters of Artemis Fowl and Holly Short are completely unsympathetic, bringing the entire narrative to repeated thudding stops, with all other characters seeming to have been culled from The Authors Big Book Of Stock Characters. The descriptions of the LEProcon and everything about them are detailed to the point of pedantical.The plot is interesting, however, and has a certain fascination that kept me reading. But I found the conclusion to be unsatisfying and quite anticlimatic. I had hoped for a lot more, and so started reading the second book in the series, The Arctic Incident. I didn't waste my time finishing it, and recommend you don't waste yours starting the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete crud .","review":"This is truly one of the worst books ever.Honestly ,how are you supposed to like the main character if he's a criminal mastermind ?How are you supposed to find it funny if the humor is complete gore ?Truly ,I don't understand how anyone can like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed :(","review":"I was very disappointed in the book, Artemis Fowl Bk.I. From the very beginning I felt there was something missing in its development and created \\"facts\\". I felt the author was trying to use \\"in\\" or modern day gross out material aimed at 9 yr. old boys. Although I felt it didn't work, I continued to read. Still thought I was being too critical of the copy-cat characters from TV crime shows until I spoke with a school librarian. She highly reviewed Harry Potter and many other of the classic series that 6-8 graders read but felt that Artemis Fowl did not meet the expectation of quality.I felt I was mislead by the reviews of this book. Rarely does that happen so blatantly. In my opinion, there is very little creativity to blossom from reading this book. And in this very busy time, even children should find relaxing reading which also stimulates their imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first Artemis Fowl book","review":"The plot was more focused on the fairy characters rather than on the personality and behaviour of Artemis Fowl. It starts with the intrigiung idea that Artemis was going to rescue his father but most of the book was spent solving a revolt in the fairy world that Artemis had little to do with. Only at the very end does the rescue mission for the father happen, the name of the book should be changed to the Fairy World Revolt featuring Artemis Fowl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever, clever Artemis Fowl","review":"Artemis is clever, very clever. He wants fairy gold. And he has a plan to get it.The fairies are rather smart, too. They want to keep their gold.

It had great offhand humor and is real middle-grade must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"artemis fowl","review":"Artemis fowl was a fairly good book. there was action , adventure, and all that good stuff, but it was a little predictable. Artemis fowl wants the fairy gold, they get into a battle, and then, what's next? The fairies get the gold back and Artemis stays alive with Butler. But the whole plot was great and I could even imagine the setting in my head. Overall, the whole story was good! Read \\"Artemis Fowl!!\\" :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is spectacular. It has lots of suspense and excitement. I was surprised by the ending of the book because it seemed like what Artemis did with the gold, didn't follow the plot. Artemis Fowl has lots of interesting characters such as: Butler, a super muscled bodyguard of Artemis, a 12 year old genius, criminal and millionaire. The only one to stop them is Captain Holly Short, a member of LEP, the fairy police. In this book Artemis has come up with an evil plan that associates with the fairies, elves and sprites.

So, to all you Harry Potter fans, it isn't quite the same caliber in my opinion. However, it was suprisingly enjoyable and was very easy to read. The story wasn't what I had anticipated at all, but was very entertained by Colfer's story and characters. If you enjoy magic and fantasy creatures, give this book a shot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read so many positive reviews, I thought I had found an interesting book for the kids. I'm just glad that I read it first. (My children will not be reading this, not yet, anyway).I had very little sympathy for the character: a spoiled, selfish, arrogant, rich, criminal twelve year old. His inherited fortune has been built over generations of criminal activity. His father is either dead, or missing, and so Artemis, as head criminal of household, takes over.This child prodigy/computer genius then goes on to drug, threaten, con and in other ways deceive the \\"fairies\\" of the underground world in order to steal their gold.All the old favourites are here: dwarfs, goblins, elves, sprites and trolls. Except for Holly, one of the fairies, you don't care what happens to the underground world - its description is not really very appealing.Unfortunately, there is not much else to redeem this book and its really not the sort of children's book I want my ten and unders reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising Premise but Untimately a Waste of Paper","review":"Perhaps the target audience of this novel is elementary school-aged readers, but I must say this book was beyond mundane and would have a hard time keeping most sharp minds engaged. Too modern and then too organic. Too many creatures and characters without any depth of development or personality. I cannot even think of a character I liked, let alone any I would care to read about again. I hope no one is comparing this amateurish drivel to certain well written books about a boy wizard, because there is no comparison. Maybe this series will improve as it continues, but I doubt it. Two stars given for the imaginative aspects, only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artemis Fowl Fan","review":"Back about two years I read some of this book and was very intriged. I have been a big Warriors by Erin Hunter fan so most of my money went to aquireing those books but recently I have completly caught up on the series and with no more books to buy and some extra money I ordered Artemis Fowl off of Amazon.

If your into the fairy/witchcraft thing this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"granted I'm not 12, but","review":"I still enjoy books aimed at that age group - like Harry Potter. I did not expect this book to be an HP clone, however, I hoped that I would encounter the same standard of writing. Sadly, I did not. I don't mind reading about the adventures of an evil genius and his sidekicks, rather than a character who is inherently good, but I would hope those characters would possess depth, humor and insight. However, so many reviewers feel differently, so perhaps there's something here that I'm missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"After all of the great reviews, I was very excited about reading Artemis Fowl. However, it proved very disapointing. I might have enjoyed this a little more when I was for. It is a very young book and I do not reccomend it.

This is the first book of the series of great books you will like if you like fantasy, fairies, and other mystical creatures in an adventure together. This book came out of nowhere and kept me guessing over and over on what was going to happen to the fairies.This book is very exciting specially when Artemis&#65533;s butler takes out a whole bunch of mythical creatures in one blow.

After reading it myself in preperation for our unit I was delighted that I would have to study this book closely. This is a fantasy style book that is easy to follow, with vivid descriptions of the settings and characters.The plot is fast paced and as a result, I found it hard to put the book down - I read it it one sitting!This book is a lot of fun and certainly gives the imagination a workout. I recommend this book to people of all ages for a fun and exciting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artemis Fowl (1-4)","review":"The author is such a genius in weaving the story. It is not Harry Potter, it is better. More compact, more personal, and more challenging. I tried to predict every turn of the story and failed almost all the time.It is harder than Harry Potter to understand the plots and the vocabulary level is much higher. Somehow, I think it is not really for kids in elementary schools, they just cannot get it that much.Amazingly good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, Reviewed by a great reader :)","review":"I am an 11 year old girl who read this a year ago. This is one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read a lot of books (trust me on this one). Mix 1 part humor, 2 parts fairy tale, and 10 parts adventure, and you get Artemis Fowl.

Thank You (smiles sweetly)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Harry Potter","review":"Once I started I couldn't put down the book. I think I've found a worthy rival for Harry Harrison's Jim diGriz!

The book was as stupid as the back cover made it sound.I will say that it was somewhat original, but the plot lacked any depth. The characters were extremely flat and boring.I ususally enjoy fantasy, but Artemis Fowl barely kept my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teaching kids to be selfish","review":"Wake up parents and start reading what your kids do. This book glorifies cheating and deceiving. Artemis is suppose to be a rich boy genius who wants to be like his father who was a criminal mastermind. What a warm fuzzy thing for our kids to be aspiring for! Is this world of the me-generation, Artemis is following suit. I really enjoy fantasy stories and hoped this would be one I could recommend, not a chance. I started out thinking it would be a cool detective book, and there are sections of good writing, but it all goes bad when you learn his ambition and passion is to cheat a group of people out of their money and he does not care who he destroys along the way. I also found the attempt to make the fairey world a real world was awkward. Eoin Colfer, you had some good concepts and attempts at teaching kids history and folklore and technology, but you screwed it up with making a hero out of a selfish criminal. I suggest a re-write."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing.......","review":"this book was very dissapointing. i do not recommend this fantasy series to any one who likes an exciting and intrigueing read. if you're looking for something for something extraordinary to read try the Stravaganza series by Mary Hoffman!Now those books........................."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artemis Fowl","review":"I read some of the reviews and bought the book. Even though I had my doubts, people raved over it so I tried it. What a waste of money! I am an avid reader and rarely throw away a book but I think I will actually burn this one! Artemis Fowl is really a foul book. Who needs a book about a genius criminal 12 year old brat? It is a \\"dark\\" book. I for one do not waste my time putting such rubbish in my mind. This is not literature. A teacher used it in the classroom?! So much for our schools! How could anyone have compared this with Harry Potter?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Potentially good","review":"The villain of the story, Artemis Fowl, is twelve years old and a good portion of the story is told from his point of view. This interesting point of view could have shed a whole new light on an overused idea; however, the parts of the story that are told from his point of view are not omniscient. We know some of what he's thinking, but not really enough to understand his motives or his plans. This leads to suspense, but it leaves me wanting more. So what we're left with is the usual story with an unusually young villain, and not much more. There is a lot of action, fighting, gore and some bodily functions that might appeal to young boys, but I found them unnecessary. The fantasy part of the story involving fairies, goblins, and trolls is really nothing new. The fairies seem unbelievable, arrogant, and a little stupid. I found it hard to care about them. The plot was interesting enough to hold my attention until I got to the end, but not much longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artemis Fowl","review":"Artemis Fowl is a genius, millionaire, criminal mastermind and a twelve-year-old boy. He owns millions of dollars worth of gold that he inherited from his father. He uses his criminal mastermind to trick a fairy into giving him gold and ends up with the whole fairy army at his door. He uses his genius to escape. One of the reasons I like Artemis Fowl, the book, is because it is original, the main character is the bad guy. I would recommend Artemis Fowl to anyone that likes adventurous, fantasy books."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are no sympathetic characters","review":"I thought this would be a good series to read, since it dealt with a young boy and the world of magic (and we were all hot in the grip of Harry Potter #5 when I bought it). However, this book is very disappointing. None of the characters stands out as likeable (either in a \\"gee, I really like this person\\" or a \\"gee, what a great villain\\") way, and the fact that Artemis seems to be out to infiltrate/irritate/rob/otherwise harm the magical world doesn't make for a good plot in my opinion. He seems like a Draco Malfoy without restraints (if you will pardon me referencing the Potter books again).The story was also a little bit coy, with terms like \\"Lower Elements Police RECON\\" becoming the term \\"LEPrecon\\" and such.I finished the book out of a dogged sense of persistence, but since there was nothing in it to interest me, I won't be carrying on with the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artemis Fowl","review":"The book I read was Atremis Fowl, written by Eilon Colfer. It is about a 12-year-old boy who tries to steal gold from fairies. The story was just ok. It was kind of boring. My favorite character was Mr. Butler, Artemis's bodyguard. The story took place in England. I would recommend this book to a friend because the ending is exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely good book and very original depiction of magic","review":"Almost everyone has read a book involving magic and faeries, but there have been none that have taken Eoin Colfer's approach. I picked this book up after a friend said it was fantastic. I was a little skeptical and thought it may be just another remake of fairy stories. This book is not that at all. In fact, this book is incredibly original and introduces a non steriotypical fairy race. Anyone in search of a good book should look no further than Artemis Fowl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a book","review":"When you start this book is an excellent book, but when it stars with fairy tales, you have two options, you leave the book or you read it with other mind, with a childish mind, if you do the second point as I did you will enjoy reading this book, that's for sure, the book will not give anything but a good time while you read, but is not what anybody want while reading a book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"INGENIOUS","review":"EION COLFER REALLY HIT IT BIG TIME WITH THE ARTEMIS FOWL SERIES!

One day he and his butler go to a forest and find a drunken fairy. Then they take this fairy book from it and translate it to English and then they figure out there is some sort of fairy Gold.This books theme is that you should never give up, never stop trying, and always keep your head up. For example, this fairy says Artemis can't do a certain task, but he still believes he can do it.I like this book because it always makes me wonder what's going to happen in the next chapter. I think it would make you have the same feeling. So maybe you should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing devotional and liturgical aid (and CHEAP)","review":"I won't recite here who Cranmer was -- for that see one of the reviews above or MacCulloch's excellent biography.This is a truly practical book -- as a devotional aid for any Christian, as a help for pastors and other designing their churches' liturgies, and as an aid for family worship.The two most amazing things I notice here:1. That Eerdmans is able to sell such a nicely packaged hardback for such an INEXPENSIVE price.2. That so many folks wrote reviews of this book, and so many have voted on the usefulness of these reviews, and yet this book is only ranked 195,000th as of my writing!

Anyone who has enjoyed the spiritual comfort of the Anglican Collects, will be moved by this wonderful source for appreciating the message of hope they convey. Frs. Barbee and Zahl tell the reader from what sources Cranmer drew the inspiration for his Collets. They also provide an understanding of their internal structure and how beautifully they are crafted as well. More movingly, they illuminate the message and spiritual insight relected in Cranmer's tightly compacted Collects with \\"meditations\\" that are along side each of them.

The way it is set up in the book, you cannot tell what season of the church year you are in, which makes the book practically very difficult to use. I returned it for a refund, and am considering buying the print edition, which looks a lot nicer.

The shoe is good for work or casual wear. The size runs a little bigger than most other shoes. I wear a 13 wide and most shoes will still feel a little snug.

Hmm, should that be a primary concern for a black shoe? But apparently there's just nothing else in these shoes to brag about. They look much cruder than in the pictures. The interior (insoles and some trim) are lined with a vinyl plastic, not leather. That immediately makes them very hot and uncomfortable to wear. Unlike some other reviewers, I found the sizing to be fairly true. But there was uncomfortable pressure on the instep, and poor shock absorption in the sole. Since the interior is not leather, the shoes are unlikely to break in either.Amazon provides great service both in delivery and handling of returns; but I wish I could return these shoes all the way back to China, from where they came."},{"rating":"1","title":"As of today, I have not received this item (order).

These really exceed that standard. The Dockers Shelter shoes are perfect for business casual. I wear them daily with khakis, a shirt and tie. With a little effort they keep a shine well. They are comfortable and move well with my feet as I am typically going from kneeling on the floor to check things on computers in the office and walking down seemingly endless hallways and up and down stairs all day. The soles perform as billed, if I pass through a wet hallway or an oily shop floor they really do not slip. I probably would not wear them with a suit, but for daily wear they are just great!

The soles on these have worn so quickly that I will probably only get about another 2 or 3 months out of them.I will NOT be buying Dockers again when I have to replace these, or ever again, for that matter. My shoes before this pair lasted me two years. This is unacceptable, Dockers! Customers expect much better quality for the higher price associate with your brand name."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOLES WEAR OUT QUICKLY, AVOID","review":"The Dockers Men's Shelter Plain Toe Oxford is a comfortable and attractive shoe, but the soles wear very quickly. After only 3 weeks of occasional (3x a week) use INDOORS and (usually) on CARPET, the soles were visibly worn.Hoping to receive a refund from the seller, Shoebuy.com, proved pointless. When the shoes were returned to me, a form was included indicating that the \\"soles are excessively worn\\" which is nonsense. If the soles fade so quickly in a mere three weeks, they will be completely eroded in 6 months.In the Great Recession, giving money to a business or government means having parted with it forever regardless of the circumstances.

While this book does not fall into the category of classic literature, it does succeed in its intended purpose: to create a fun story, replete with interesting characters (caracatures though they are) and an interesting plot. It reads like an old black and white film, where actors/actresses drop great one-liners. The author's tongue-and-cheek efforts do not go to waste. This book is a great one to discuss with friends.

But, most importantly, it gives you specific examples of things you can do to help create life-long memories that will positively impact your children.

They actually interviewed non-Scholl persons for this book and engaged in serious investigative journalism. The result: Their book is not a rehash of the usual Scholl legend of the White Rose. For that, I am grateful.But it falls short. They take documents out of context, using letters written at one point in the lives of these children to prove philosophy when they are older. None of the facts (as far as I can tell) is actually wrong. It's just that they manipulated facts by omitting context to come up with the story they wanted to tell.If they had stuck closer to the interviews they were granted and pieced it all together with better attention to chronology, their book could have been as earthshattering as the original story. Instead, it disappears into the usual White Rose quagmire, adding to the confusion surrounding the tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of info","review":"This book is packed with info which will be of great interest to guitar gear-heads. You would have to search throught decades of old guitar magazines to compile the facts found here. A lot of the popular guitar players from the last 40 years are represented here, with the obvious exceptions of Stevie Ray Vaughan, (Beats me as to why any book would leave him out???) and Jimmy Page. It also wastes a lot of pages on several contemporary one hit wonders who will be nobody in a year. For example, Tom Delonge of Blink-182 is included, but Slash, who is actually a talented guitar player, is left out. The CD that accompanies the book was a bit of a dissapointment. With all the info in the book about vintage amps giutars and pickups, the CD was recorded with a computer's digital amp simulator and sound very innaccurate and fake. Still, for the price, it's a lot of good info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so much choice","review":"Apart from this book you can try the books by Egenes (Introduction to Sanskrit, Part 1andIntroduction to Sanskrit, Part 2), they are much more \\"gentler\\". You could also first study \\"A Practical Sanskrit Introductory\\" by Charles Wikner, you can find it on line. Wikners' text guides you through the Devanagari writing system and the complex sandhi rules (and also prepares you for the Monier Williams dictionary). Coulsons' book is like a reversed \\"cold turkey\\" when it comes to Devanagari and sandhi, the first two chapters will discourage you unless you are really motivated.The text contains quite a few typos in the devanagari parts, notably in the keys to the exercises.

Thanks goodness I hadn't bought it without looking inside.After about 5 minutes of reading Chapter One I had the feeling I was reading somewhere in the middle of the book. None of what the author was saying made me think I was learning (or about to learn Sanskrit). There were just too many overly difficult sentences to follow. Really.The layout (if you could call it that) was nearly 90% text based, meaning its not broken up much at all with graphs, charts, progressive chaptering, or sidebars.

(WARNING: the sparks are pretty, but THIS COULD FRY YOUR MICROWAVE. I recommend keeping a thrift-store spare around for microwaving non-food items. Also entertaining are incandescent light bulbs, steel wool, and Irish Spring deodorant soap.)I made an amusing set of wind chimes out of the rejects (as an added bonus, sunlight flashing off the disks keeps birds off my patio), but I'll definitely not be buying Verbatim digital media in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"Well researched and presented.

He doesn't care for the choppy \\"learning to read\\" Thomas books that basically boils the plot down to 3 word sentences and at 7 he's perfectly capable of reading this book. If anything, these \\"read to me\\" books as one reviewer calls it are great for learning to read, because the kids already know the story and have memorized parts of the script from the video so when they get to a word that might have stopped them before, they just remember the video and remember the word. Although my son is 7 now, he's enjoyed this book for a while and it's still a bedtime go-to favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alter Bridge Rocks!","review":"This ranks right up there as one of the best concerts I've seen on DVD. They don't have the stage show of say an \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" but they put on one hell of a show. The emotion the band shows is amazing and a strong reason why the fans give show much back. The acoustic version of Watch over you is incredible. My only complaint is the fact that there is no guitar solo by Tremonti. Maybe it's because when I grew up and went to concerts in the 80's we always got the drum solo, bass solo, and guitar solo and they are all missing on this DVD. But if you are an Alter Bridge fan, this is a must have. If you are just learning about Alter Bridge, this is an excellent starting point for you. You won't be disappointed. (Unless you are looking for the missing solos as mentioned above.)Get it now and get prepared for Alter Bridge III this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent concert video","review":"One of the best concert videos I've ever watched!

When I originally saw the setlist, I was very excited because I absolutely love all of those songs. Problem is, in order to fit 18 songs into 1:15, AB sped up every song by like 50 beats per minute, so every song is like a minute or so shorter. That kinda bothered me, cuz it was really hard to enjoy the songs at such a fast pace. They should have cut out 3 or 4 songs and kept everything at normal pace. Everything else is great though, sound quality, video quality, and the boys were at their best, just everything was too fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Alter Bridge Fans!!!!","review":"This is what all Alter Bridge fans have been waiting for...From the opening power of \\"Come To Life\\" through \\"Find The Real\\" and \\"Broken Wings\\" the concert DVD hits all the high notes...no bootlegs here, this is a beautifully shot show from Amsterdam...Myles Kennedy is a true talent and Tremonti sounds as good as we've heard him in a while...Standout songs are Kennedy's solo spots on a poignant acoustic version of \\"Watch Over You\\" and a smoking version of \\"Traveling Riverside Blues\\" complete with slide guitar...Go out and buy this!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alter Bridge Live from Amsterdam","review":"The product is very good! the image and sound are ok!The concert of Alter Bridge was amazing!

What this author fails to see is that the scheme, completely justified, by FDR to provoke Japan into war was hatched at a meeting in August 1941 at Placentia Bay in Newfoundland. Churchill told FDR then that unless the US got into the war by the end of the year the UK would be finished and compelled to surrender to Hitler. FDR was duly alarmed and set right after that to create a plan to provoke Japan into attacking the US. Only such an attack could flip US opinion for anti-war to pro-war. FDR did this amazingly well, so well that most Americans even today don't know the real story. They need to wise up. FDR was right in doing what he did; only by lying and scheming could he get the US into the war. And that was essential to defeat Hitler. Stinnett has done all the research needed to prove this. The author of this book is quite wrong and confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Divas here! Just noise...","review":"This CD is a complete disappointment.

If your nearby food store does not have it (Whole Foods- been waiting for 3-4 months), then just get it online. Amazon has some really great prices.

I don't care for the stevia at all, there is a taste that really turns me off and I believe it is the stevia but ... they use so many ingredients in their teas that it is hard to pinpoint the actual villian. We use stevia at home but it seems that stevia in processed products takes on a weirder flavour - to me anyways.

My fiance, however loves it. I will say however, that the mint scent is very relaxing. It may be the way I am brewing the tea: I tried brewing for 1-2 minutes, 5-6 minutes and 9-10 minutes. The box recommends a brew time of 9-10 minutes, but I've found that too short a brewing time tastes like poorly flavored watered, but too long a brewing time really kicks up the notch on that citrus after taste. My fiance says that she doesn't think it taste like citrus, but rather more of a sweet honey flavor.Update: I now brew about 4 minutes but in a much bigger cup and now I enjoy the tea (although I still think other tea's taste better) So I'm changing from 3 stars to 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure it works if you can stomach it...","review":"I'm sorry to give this a poor review, but tea has to taste good in order for me to drink it.

We ordered the rack at the last minute to take our bikes on a 2-3 hour trip to Coachella so there was no time for a trial run. We used the rack for the first time on my VW Golf and although I was nervous the whole way out the bikes stayed secure and tight going 80+ mph on a very windy highway in the desert for 2 hours. We did tighten it up about 20 minutes into the trip but after that we were good to go the whole way there and back! Great purchase and we use it all the time now!

The last one I used to haul my store bought bikes with wasn't secure at all. It just had the 2 posts and you just hang the bikes and tie them up with the straps.This Allen rack works best because it has straps to secure the bikes onto the rack itself and of course the hooks on the car trunk works like any other bike rack would. It fits 2 hybrid bikes male and female versions of the same model without having to get an external bar. The rack is well made and whoever designed it did not scrimp on the materials.My friend, who is also particular about stuff bought on line and my husband were impressed and like the bike rack also because of its easy handling and installation.Before settling on a product, make sure you research very well on compatibility and returns.You will be very pleased with this product as we were... :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave out on second use","review":"This bike rack gave out the second time I used it. The first time it was used it was easy to put together and felt solid. The second time I used it one of the buckles (plastic) gave out. The teeth of the buckle stopped holding the strap (one of the top two) and the bike swung free while I was driving down the highway. I had to quickly pull over before the whole bike fell off the back of the car.Side note: My car is on the fit list for the bike rack. I followed the instructions for securing it to the car carefully and my bike is within the weight limits. The plastic buckle simply gave out. A work around would be to just tie a knot since I can't trust the buckle but, after nearly causing an accident on the highway after just the second use, I don't trust it anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rack--recommended","review":"One of my considerations when shopping for a rack was the low quality of many consumer products. Failure of this kind of product could be disastrous.Turns out that this rack is very well built. All critical parts are made of real METAL.If there is anything to complain about, it is the reliance on elastic portions of lower straps to hold bottom of rack firmly against car and a couple of the less critical buckles and fittings are plastic.Overall, the rack is very roadworthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it cheaper in walmart","review":"It is cheaper at walmart.

The bottom clips can hook under the car like in the picture, or on the bottom of the trunk lid. My only concerns are that the metal clips seem to be chipping away the paint (nothing a little pipe insulator can't fix) and the straps are extremely long (to fit SUVs) so I have to tie several knots/bows to keep them from flapping.

The bike stayed on and remained secure after I parked and checked to see how the bike rack held up. The top straps, that go into your trunk, stayed tight and didn't loosen, unlike the bottom straps that had started to loosen up a bit. It was nothing too severe though; despite this, I believe the bike rack would have remained on my car. Also, the bike rack did not scratch the paint on my car (white, 2000 Honda Accord) at all, but that is because I followed the instructions and really cleaned the trunk of my car and the rubber pads of the bike rack before I hooked it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"so many to choose from","review":"I was looking for a trunk bike rack and when I found the Allen 102S bike rack I knew this was what I wanted...the 2 strap tie down, the fact that the mount could be at the bottom of the trunk not under the bumper, the trunk would open with the bikes on, and the color (women and their colors) matched my car what more did I need...This rack is very strong and I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"part broke but company fixed it right away","review":"I am very unhappy with the product. It broke the first time I used it. I put it on the car, loaded the bike and then traveled 25 miles. The bike was secure, but that was not the problem. When I got home and started taking the rack off the release on the top strap clamp broke. The only way that I could get it off was to undo all the other straps and then slide the strap off after the others were loose. I am going to contact the company and hopefully they will send me a replacement part. The company promptly sent me a replacement part for the broken clasp. Great service and hopefully this one will not break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casual Cyclist w/Genesis Coupe","review":"I have a 2010 3.8 Genesis Coupe (no spoiler). This rack fits the car perfectly. I recommend putting a sock on the pedal which faces your car b/c it will come in contact w/the bumper when you are trying to put the bike on the rack (once the bike is on the rack, the pedal does not touch the car). I also wrapped small microfiber towels around each one of the hooks to prevent my car's trunk from getting scratched. Prior to putting the bike rack on the car, I cleaned the exterior part of my trunk w/soap and water. I also made sure the pads on the rack were clean. After doing all this, I'm happy to report that the bike and car made it to and from the park w/out a scratch. I highly recommend this rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has lot's going for it.","review":"I have a Chrysler Pacifica and this was one of the few racks that was advertised to fit that car. (Car has a plastic extended trim on top of the rear door). The rack has a lot going for it... well built, generally light, and folds to a small package for easy storage. The only downside thus far is a nagging concern that the plastic trim may yet be a victim. So far it has done well, with about 100 miles total of paved roads travelled. The other niggling thing for me was the lack of a place to lock the bike to the rack supports. Installation is fast and easy, with only a few seconds required to re-adjust the straps when moving to another vehicle. I would recommend the Allen premium 2 to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and easy","review":"Allen 102S Premium 2-Bike Trunk Mount RackBack racks in general can be pretty pricey. This is a pretty reasonable price for this product. This rack was extremely easy to put on my car (2009 Honda Civic) and felt very secure with my bike on. I did have to buy an adapter for my woman's road bike. Another notable comment: I used the extra slack from the straps used to strap it to the car to secure the pedals. I drove 900 miles at up to 80 mph without any problems or concerns. The rack fits easily in my trunk. I though the bike rack stood up very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allen 102S Bike Rack","review":"Delivered on time as promised and in perfect condition. Extremely easy to install on my 99 Accord.

Then today, after driving on the interstate for 700 miles this week, we got back into town, went over a speed bump at about 25 mph, and both plastic buckles holding my bike onto the rack broke and it flew off. My rear wheel is bent beyond repair, and I had just had it in for a major tune-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allen 102S 2-Bike Rack","review":"This bike rack is a very good value. The 4 straps are adequate enough to keep 2 bikes in place without the worry of the bikes shifting or moving around. I've had them for a short period of time, but it looks solid enough to last a number of years. It fits many different vehicle models, but check their website to make sure it fits yours. It manages to actually look pretty cool too. It's definitely a great alternative to more expensinve brand models, but does the same thing without breaking the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great","review":"It worked great with a round trip of over 120 miles. The only thing that I would like to see different are some type of padding on the hooks and something to hold the bike tires, but other than those two things I think that it worked great with two bikes; it's sets up quick and easily, and it's easy to put away too - didn't have to read the instructions really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sits a little low on 98 Buick Regal.","review":"It put this on my P.O.S.

And as a bonus, I can access the trunk now.Very simple to assemble; once straps are initially set, it's literally a matter of seconds to remove or reattach.UPDATE (11/2012) -- One of the straps broke, and customer service at Allen sent a new rack immediately (for free) after a simple phone call. Can't beat 5 years of harsh sun, frequent use, and nearly constant attachment.

The rack sits on my trunk and straps to the top and the bottom of the trunk no problem, cinch down the straps and it doesn't move at all. I did have problems with the straps at first. The directions are not very clear (at least I couldn't figure them out) about how the straps attach to the rack. I had the straps going the wrong way and they kept slipping with my bike on it.

Or something.","review":"I liked this movie rather well when I was younger, but after watching it again recently, I found it almost intolerable. I don't know why I ever thought Tom Cruise as a pompous, nihilistic vampire was worth watching, because he's not. He's just TOO Tom Cruise to stand, and all the makeup and poncy clothing in the world can't change his mannerisms and facial expressions.This movie takes itself much too seriously, and all the manufactured angst and darkness reminds one of the public access Floridian goths on SNL.Honestly, Brad Pitt's acting was pretty okay, but any redemption to be found in his performance (as far as the film goes, overall) is eclipsed by the wretchedness of the rest of the production.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, save teenagers who perhaps are still impressed by this kind of thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"Okay, first let me say that I have not yet read the book by Anne Rice. I had heard that this movie was good. \\"Good\\" is not a strong enough word. While other movies about vampires tend to be more on the phony side, this movie, in my opinion, was very realistic and believable. I do agree that Interview with the Vampire is less of a horror film than it is a work of art, but that certainly isn't a bad thing. Overall, this is an awesome movie and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and artistic, with a dash of humor.","review":"This is probably the best vampire movie I have ever seen, because even though there is some comic relief here and there, this movie takes itself very seriously. Since it deals with a fantasy subject, it is nice to see a script that is so well written that it has the power to make you believe for the 2 hours you will spend with it. Another thing this movie has going for it is the art direction, the sets, and the music, they are all wonderful and add the the dark mood of the movie. Tom Cruise does a nice acting job. It is obvious that Brad Pitt has improved since his performance in this (such as Fight Club). I gave it 4 stars, because not everyone will enjoy the endless blood flow and darkness that comes with a vampire movie.Overall, very stylistic and fun. Reccomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray is BAD!","review":"This review is for the quality of the Blu-ray only, and it is worthless.

The bits of dark humor injected in by Cruise made it rather enjoyable at times. Brad Pitt did a good job as the vampire with a bit of his human-ness causing him to lament (whine about) his fate throughout. His acting is stellar in the final sequences.Kirsten Dunst's character, 10-year old Claudia, as an unreachable love/soul mate for Louis (Pitt) was the essential ingredient that makes it all work. She did a great job. Its worth watching - and pretty cheap besides. Forget about ancient Dracula and juvenile Twilight - Check this one out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hire a vampire","review":"The story, based on the book by Anne Rice, is timeless as it shows the vampire not only as bloodsucking fiend but a creature that still possesses humanity.

You just watched cruise and pitt walk around and drink the blood of every living creature. And then pitt would feel so bad about it which is supose to make us feel bad for him. Well I tell you one thing it didn't work. The only reason I feel bad for cruise and pitt is because they were stupid enough to agree to be in this movie. It wasn't their acting that was bad it was the story. Their acting was o.k. Pitt was good he had the right kind of creepyness to him in the beginning but that is it.

The Vampire, Louis [Brad Pitt] tells the story of his life as a vampire, his companion and nemesis LeStat [Tom Cruise], and their daughter Claudia [Kirsten Dunst], spanning over two centuries in just two hours in a surprisingly coherent way that captures much of the spirit of the original books. An excellent film and an excellent introduction to the new breed of vampire, who is no longer seen as evil incarnate but a breed similar but different from humans, with their own moral code, who love and hate, who have only a few of the weaknesses of the old school vampires like Count Dracula.

Pitt pouts, Cruise drones on and on about nothing, and the film is unendingly slow, especially in the scenes between Cruise and Pitt.

Apart from anything else, the film violates the most important canon of horror literature: the \\"face\\" of the horror must never be portrayed or described, but only hinted at; its content comes from the imagination of the reader/viewer.

Gonna glide down, over Mulholland, gonna freefall, out in the nothing, gonna leave this world for a while...\\"- T. Petty, the song Freefallin' from 1987.Interview With A Vampire is lavish and viscerally entertaining - with a strong Cruise - but also self-indulgent and dragging at times, with a misplaced Pitt (too much pin-up boy despite immense acting qualities). The set design is a triumph - bringing Blade Runner (1982) to mind in vastness.The ending is ambivalant - it finally ends, the movie has dragged for a while at this point - yet watching Cruise demonically laughing and pumped up - showing an edge we would only later see him display in the gem Magnolia (2000) - to the raunching tunes of Guns N' Roses' original and splendid cover of the old Stones song Sympathy For The Devil - feels like the opening to a great vampire/horror flick.

Time isn't always the culprit for lower quality films. This is why say One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest looks so rich and clean and this one doesn't. A lot of things play a factor, between the biggest which is type of film stock, camera, lenses, lighting. This movie was shot this way. What you are seeing is what was shot. It isn't because Warner is out to \\"get you\\". Trust me, they want to make consumers happy. They want good reviews so people will buy more of their products. It's not like Interview is a small title that they can just throw on an HD disc either. It's a shame the average consumer has this mentality, and if you are a high end movie collector, you should really start taking these things into consideration before posting a review.

The actors brought the viewer straight into the plot, and it held me all the way through.

If you have seen it before this disc is worth having and if not I would highly recomend it. But videophiles beware...this movie brings out one of the only flaws associated with mpeg encoding on DVD's. When the the picture is dark it has a tendancy to look very \\"digital\\" on DVDs. Needless to say this is a vampire movie and many of the picturs are dark. Many people wont notice this, but if are picky and look for stuff like that, it tends to get a bit annoying. Otherwise it is great, both the Dolby and the DTS soundtracks are great. Hope you all enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average vampire movie.","review":"A very fine film. I'm lucky in that I watched the movie before reading the book. Watching the movie prompted me to read Rice's novel, but she has a way of dragging things on. The movie tells the story while leaving out the boring parts.What I most enjoy about this film is that it deals with the morallity of vampires. Most vampire flicks just show a lot of blood and fangs, and bore me to tears. But Interview with the Vampire takes you to a much more serious level.Also, I must add how much I enjoyed the acting. This is the first movie I've seen with Brad Pitt. I used to think that he was just another pretty face without talent. But I was convinced otherwise after watching this film. You really feel for his charater throughout the movie. However, I was most surprised by Kirsten Dunst's performance. She was only around twelve when she did this movie, and she was magnificent.Once again, it's a great movie. Just don't watch it expecting to see a lot of mindless gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the typical movie","review":"How is it that very few books become top movies? Interview With the Vampire is alluring enough as a book, the movie even more seductive. When I first saw the movie I cried for Louis and continue to do so when ever I watched it. No part was left out, but I just wish that the makers could of used the same filming technique that was used in Sleepy Hollow. The pain of a vampire that can feel as humans do that is just sheer talent. An actor that can portray that vampire that is just charisma. Kirsten Dunst showed us an exact copy of Claudia and how we all feel. The vampire tale is not the usual Dracula version. The emtion and hope that was put into this amkes everyone think. Perhaps I think more than others do, but can we not see ourselves be like these creatures in some ways? We all have the selfish side, we are all tormented by something, we are all cold and ucaring in some way. We are truly vampires in certain ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush horror - good enough to sink your teeth into!","review":"This movie is wonderful.

What happened to Freneire.Tom Cruise was a passable Lestat, but Pitt as Louis, I felt was dragging thru the scenes.It felt like he didnt want to play in a movie with gay undertones. He even had the nerve to criticize Rice's Vampire Chronicles. How it left him depressed. If you ask me nothing was more depressing than watching this actor portraying the beautiful Louis. Cruise is just to full of himself to portay Lestat. Banderas was not a convincing Armand. The only real good character here was Dunst as Claudia.

Comparing the DVD vs. the blu-ray with the DVD on a low end multidisc Sony and the Samsung BDP-1200 which was considered about the best Blu-ray, I can't believe how little difference there is. The Blu ray looks like they tried to make it blurry and have no color. I have an older DTS receiver, so the DVD audio is actually better for me on the DVD, which is all the more insulting.

Antonio Banderas was perfectly cast as Armand. The visuals were very effective. However, Anne Rice sold out to agree to Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Christian Slater in lead roles. They were not effective nor appropriate, nor believable as the lead characters they portrayed. They used their clout to bully into getting cast, and true fans of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, feel very betrayed and let down. The novel in the mid 1970's was better than the 1994 movie release, because of the ineffective casting of Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Christian Slater. They were not mature enough nor talented enough to make those lead roles a success."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movie That Introduced The World to the Modern Vampire","review":"Anne Rice created the modern vampire with her novel, and the movie did it justice. Brad Pitt is definitely what makes the movie, he plays the role of the depressed vampire Louis perfectly. This the movie also has the very young Kirsten Dunst playing the role of Claudia, and she is an amazing actress for one her age at the time. The overall film is just perfect, from location to wardrobe, it feels like a trip through time. It's just a shame that the second movie wasn't as good as this movie.

I'll give them that Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are both handsom actors, but Tom didn't portray Lestat as well as he might of. Some parts of the book were excluded from the movie, which was a mistake. The book itself is a great read and it is a lovely addition to your vampiric collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent vampire movie","review":"I don't know why everybody complains about Tom Cruise's performance in this movie. I think he actually carries the movie. His portrayal of LeStat may not be strictly by-the-book (I don't know ; I haven't read it), but is very convincing. Kisten Dunst plays an excellent part. I have to say this is by far the best vampire movie ever made. For once you can actually suspend your disbelief and enjoy the world of these nocturnal creatures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruise, Pitt, and Dunst were all wonderful","review":"I'm in the minority in that I liked the movie more than the book. The book is long winded and bogged down with description and the movie starts that way too. But once Claudia is introduced, the movie spins with action, depth, and spooky bliss. The settings are beautiful, the costumes terrific, the characters superbly portrayed. The soundtrack is hard to beat, but only if you're cultured in your music tastes. The altered ending is - at least to me - refreshing. Axl Rose singing Jagger's Sympathy for the Devil is a fitting ending for the movie that glorified Lestat. And of course Lestat himself was beautifully portrayed by Tom Cruise. This is a must see for any serious vampire fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interview with the vampire","review":"I bought this DVD as a gift for my daughter.

I take it with me on group birdwatching trips so I have something to sit on if we are remaining in place for awhile. Sure spares me from getting backaches from standing too long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"....pull up a chair amigo...\\"","review":"I weigh 220 and have severe back issues and need to sit down when the pain gods strike! No problem if I'm in a furniture store but a major problem if I'm on tour or at a location with no chairs/benches for miles.I sling this little stool over my shoulder & to most people it appears to be a camera tripod.Popping it open when I need to sit is simple and instant. The Slacker is small enough to fit in a suitcase and no strain to carry. My only \\"dis\\" is that the carry strap could be a tad longer. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to sit down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy yes, comfortable - not so much","review":"It occurs to me I must be an Apple fanboy; I bought this \\"chair\\" for the sole purpose of using it when I wait in line for the latest iPhone or iPad. I have grandsons that play soccer and baseball so I thought it'd be good for that as well. In use you'll find it's not very comfortable, but it is better than sitting on the ground or standing for prolonged periods, as long as you're on solid ground.By that I mean it's adequate for the line outside the Apple store on the mall floor, but not very stable on a grass soccer field. That leaves the \\"parade test\\". Would I watch a parade on it? No. I'll use one of my other portable chairs with a back to watch our local parade on the 4th."},{"rating":"2","title":"So excited to put it to use.","review":"I am a sports photographer and I shoot soccer. Sitting on small stools, or kneeling makes shooting the game very uncomfortable. When I opened this up and tested it out, it is so comfortable. I can't wait till the season starts up again. This chair puts me in an natural, relaxed sitting position and folds up to easily be bundled with my monopod for transport.Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Don't waste your time ordering this chair unless you a magician or you are a pole sitter.

I weigh only 110# and I was afraid when I sat on this stool. Not comfortable at all. Looks like it has a back for support in the picture, but it really doesn't. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"E3 Convention was a hit","review":"I bought this item for a 3 day gaming convention, E3 in Los Angeles, that requires a lot of standing and walking. My hope was that I could put it in my small backpack and pull it out only when I need to stand and put it away otherwise. It was small enough to fit in my bag, it was a small carry-on in the plane, and it appears to have survived without any damage or issues to it's integrity. Great product, especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"light weight, good construction","review":"I bought this w/ 2 purposes in mind, one to carry and use to sit on if needed, right size for me, but I'm not sure how comfortable if might be for heavier set persons.My second purpose was to use it underneath a table at a conference as I can't sit for long periods w/ my feet down. Used it for this, which worked quite well. Not obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy Little Seat","review":"I bought 2 of these seats to use with my binoculars and tripod. They are just the right height, and are supper light. It would not be a problem to take 2 along on my wild life viewing trips,should I take along a friend. The 2 chairs together weigh less then my tripod, and my tripod is considered to be light weight. Although they are light they are strong. I am a large man 250 ponds. I have been using one chair for a month and a half with no problems or signs of ware. When you look through binoculars on a tripod you squirm around allot as you change viewing angles. This puts allot of stress on a seat. So far no problems. I have been using one chair exclusively to put all the ware on the one chair. Should it fail, I would have the other while I get another. I have had this chair out on 5 or 6 outings, plus I use it when looking out through my patio door in stead of my computer chair. I am vary pleased with these handy little seats"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy Stool","review":"I'm pushing the upper limit of this stools capacity and it feels rock solid. I'm not at all worried that it will fail.I do have two minor complaints though (but nothing that would stop me from buying again). The velcro strap that holds it together would be much easier to secure if it were at the other end of the stool and didn't have to go around the \\"seat cloth\\" as well as the legs. And the strap is too short and attached with some flimsy and non-stainless steel metal that is already rusting (after one month). I think that sounds worse than it is, but it would be nice if they read this review and fixed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camping Butt Saver","review":"Easily one of the best things to bring on a backpacking trip.

Everything you could expect from 3 pieces of aluminum tied together with a piece of reinforced cordura."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slacker Stool","review":"I am very happy with the Slacker Stool. I'm a big guy and this stool holds my weight and is comfortable. I purchased this stool for a 20 mile backpacking trip, it is lightweight and compact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!!! Well, this was certainly an error in judgment!","review":"The tripod configuration and seat size renders this travel chair painfully uncomfortable for anyone owning male genitalia or weighing more than 120 pounds. On the other hand, since the chair seems to be rather durable, it should be quite acceptable for smaller women and children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lite sturdy anywhere seat.","review":"A friend had one of these related chairs on the beach and I tried it. It was just what I had been looking for so I took out my phone, did a quick Amazon search and ordered it on the spot. Now for the best part. It came on time and was exactly what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this chair!","review":"I used this chair for a month while gold sluicing day in and day out and it was perfect! I gave it away to another gold miner when I left, but now I wish I hadn't, because I miss the little chair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Travelchair Slacker Chair, Red","review":"This little chair is a load off my feet. I have to stand in line (sometimes for a couple of hours) and it helps me from shifting from one leg to the other while waiting. It is very easy to break down when it is time to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"portable lab drawing stool","review":"This chair was purchased for the hospital lab I work in. We go out to draw nursing home residents once a week and we needed something small, light weight and portable to take with us for drawing patients. It works great for this purpose because it helps prevent us from bending over and saves our backs from back pain. What a great chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel Chair","review":"This chair beats all other outdoor chairs. Sure, there are no beer can/bottle holders, but the lightweight of the chair more than makes up for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small seat, cheap construction.....","review":"It didnt last for one round of disc golf on the limestone terrain here in central Texas. This chair is great for the backyard or as a backup/emergency chair only. Small seat, good for a small person or child. Shipped on time and in great condition, just didnt last. Male: 5'10\\", 150lbs, Ended up buying a camptime stool. If your looking for a tournament stool for disc golf, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The feet arent the best","review":"This is a relatively cheap chair that gets the job done, the only problem is the feet on the bottom of the chair dont stay on too well. The first time I sat in it in soft soil, it pushed down and the foot fell off. Then since there is no foot on it, the leg sinks down and you fall off the chair. I fixed it by putting a small screw threw each footing into the pipe its attached to. (maybe the manufacturer should do that). After the modification it works pretty good.FYI. It might be a little uncomfortable if you sit for a long time as the front of the chair wraps around and grips a little too tight for my liking if you know what I mean :/ But I believe that will happen with any 3 legged chair by design.Overall, its cheap and with a minor modification its pretty good for short periods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chair!","review":"I ordered these because I was going with a friend to an Indian PowWow. I was afraid we might have to stand the whole time, and I just couldn't do that because of my back. They are light and easy to carry, and I found them sturdy enough for each of us, but we are both quite light in weight. I'm so pleased with these that I will keep them in my car so they are with me in case I need them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Tripod Chair","review":"I don't have anything bad to say about this chair. It was a good price and it is working great. I use it as a carry along chair when I'm playing long days of disc golf. Works great and hasn't had any problems yet. A solid chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!!","review":"We needed a couple of small chairs to take kayaking with us and these looked like they would work. They not only were exactly what I wanted but more. When folded they are small in diameter and length, making them perfect to put behind the seat of my kayak. They come equipped with a detachable carry handle that I can unfasten and then secure it within my boat so as not to lose it if I flip over (they do not float, I tested that out). They are small but comfortable and sturdy. We used them yesterday when we stopped for lunch on a small rocky beach while on a long paddle, much better than sitting on the ground or on a large rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional not necessarily comfortable","review":"Well, I don't know what I expected but I like this chair. Its extremely light weight and it does hold me up. But..I'm 6'2\\" , 220lbs and my butt certainly isn't thanking me after spending more than 15 minutes in this chair. So...know what your getting and what you want to use it for. It would be great if the seat was about 25% bigger. To watch a whole soccer game sitting in this chair might be asking for too much. I recommend it for short term use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic feet fell off","review":"We bought two of these for the kids at Christmas. The height of this chair is good - it's taller than most similar chairs, and is lightweight and easy to carry with the strap. However, the plastic feet fell off pretty much immediately. We did glue them back on, but the ones we'd bought from REI just seem to be better made. I think I'll probably end up using this when we camp due to the height. The chair is usable, but it was kind of a shocker when it was \\"broken\\" out of the bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great in a pinch.","review":"This will never be my go to folding seat of choice, but it's great in a pinch. I made the decision to buy it for a 3 day backpacking trip in New Hampshire. At under 2 pounds, I felt it would be worth the weight to have a place to sit after a 10 mile trek. It does take up a moderate amount of pack space, but you won't find a more portable and durable seat. It won't win any awards for comfort, but you do get a triangle of elevated space that is preferable to the wet ground, a hard rock, or a rotting log. It takes a little care to sit and rise from it, but it is sturdy and dependable. I will always prefer the back support of a folding camping or beach chair, but when weight and portability become a factor, this little stool serves its purpose. Included several photos to offer a size comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works then breaks","review":"I had this stool for a couple of months and I loved it, it was so handy..until it broke. Now I'm not a heavy person and having the pole tear through the cloth was rather disheartening. I do love the idea of this stool, but the company should make it stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel companion","review":"I just came back from a 2 week trip to the Middle East. My Travel Chair was my constant companion and I couldn't be more pleased. It's light, easy to carry and oh so handy when guides are giving long explanations. Or in Egypt, in the Valley of the Kings, I'd pop it open, sit, and soak in the extraordinary sights I was seeing. Will never travel anymore without it. Just wish there was a longer strip of velcro. It's a little hard to get it to stay closed. That said, I still highly recommend the chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warranty issue / dangerous?","review":"I bought this little chair in March of this year (2012). One of the things I found attractive about it was the weight limit. I'm a big guy: 6'2\\" and every bit of 235 lbs. I don't mess with 225 lb limit items. This one is supposed to be 275. It has gone on a few camping/hunting trips and has done well. Well, at least until 15 minutes ago, when while sitting on it in my garage packing away camping gear, it absolutely collapsed on me. One of the legs sheared through the plastic ring. Landing on concrete on your tailbone is not fun. I will be contacting the manufacturer to find out about warranty. Though I'm not sure I trust the product now, even if they send me a new one.FOLLOW UP: I have to give credit to the folks at Travelchair. They were responsive to my complaint/warranty claim. They replaced the slacker chair and sent me another, larger chair for my trouble. A week and 1/2 on, I'm still quite sore. I hope they look into what caused my chair to fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pagemaster","review":"I received the item in a very timely manner.

I bought this movie for my oldest son when it first came out and he still loves it to this day but over the years the tape has worn out. my youngest son saw it one day and was hooked on watching it over and over that why I got the dvd one. This movie is a good family movie and has good action and adventure for kids. I think it has a good message for kids in reading a book can take you on an adventure too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Childhood Favorite!!!","review":"I've loved this movie ever since I was a kid. It has a great storyline and features live-action and animation. Macaulay Culkin stars as Richard Tyler who is afraid of everything. During a storm, he seeks refuge at a library. He is soon brought into the world of the Pagemaster who gives him 3 tests; Adventure, Horror, and Fantasy. With the help of three books, he must face monsters, pirates, haunted houses, and dragons if he wants to make it to the 'Exit' sign. I highly recommend THE PAGEMASTER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, mediocre execution","review":"I watched this movie a few times when I was a kid, so I had the advantage of nostalgia when I last looked at it now that I'm older. Frankly, it doesn't hold up.This is such a great idea for a film but there's one major problem: the kid is already a bookworm! He babbles on about statistics in the first 20 minutes which means he would have to had READ all of those statistics in a book! Why would you encourage a bookworm to read even more? That's like telling a drug addict to do more drugs! This movie would have worked better if they had the kid be addicted to video games, TV, sports, or anything NOT related to reading.Also, the movie has no structure, the characters are generic, the literary aspects are just glanced over, and it's just a bore. This is such a great idea for a movie, but there's not much effort. Kids deserve stories that have real effort and imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course I would buy","review":"I always loved this movie as a kid growing up and for some reason I was just craving to watch it and I'm glad I did! Now my kids can enjoy the same movies that I did when I was a kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boringmaster","review":"This movie is boring. Nothing happens. It is a good cause to teach kids to read but they messed up BIG TIME. They don't explain who the book characters are at all. The kid is nothing more then a walking cardboard cut-out. The book puns are painful to listin to and just as bad as the ice puns from Mr.Freeze from Batman & Robin. The Books themselfs are infuriating & more cartoony then have to be. Even The Dragon is boring and it barely moves but worst of all,it eats books...BOOKS!!! What kind of dragon eats books? Overall,the only thing this film teaches me is that movies can be just as boring as books. The name of the film itself sounds like a fake award they give at a library. I give this film a 2 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"still good","review":"i also remebering watching this as a kid. to me its all about finding courage and facing your fears. cant wait to watch this with my nephews. i know they will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent quality","review":"This shirt is well made.

It would have taken 3 hours to do the book real justice.One reviewer lamented (possibly in jest) the lack of subtitles. I can only say that the language was much more anglicised than the one I grew up speaking and hearing, so I'd no trouble at all with it. I can't say whether it would cause problems for anyone else.The copy I bought, made by \\"Nostalgia Family Video\\" in Baker City Oregon, is of poor quality. The image is low-contrast and washed-out, and the sound isn't the best. It seems to have been created using low-tech methods. They have a 2007 copyright notice on the box, but it's not clear how they came by it--I'm fairly sure Ealing still own the copyright, since they sell this film as part of a package of 5 (available from Amazon).The quality of this copy is poor enough that I plan to return it for refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"BodyCraft F611 Leg Curl/Ext","review":"Perfect high-quality add-on for the BodyCraft bench.

The author seems to think it's wrong if women want to practice celibacy or try to remain a virgin until marriage. She doesn't think that's something to be proud of. Now my problem with that is if young girls that are planning on trying to wait until marriage read this book might think that's something to be ashamed of, or they want be able to please their spouse if they have not been practicing.

Maybe they just rushed the production and didn't wait for the paint to dry. either case It was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not worth it.","review":"I know this is only $7 but it's honestly not worth the money. The quality was crap, there was a green line on the bottom of the screen from beginning to end and the translation was horrible. Not only that, but it looks like it was a homemade DVD. If I wanted to settle for that, I could have burned it myself for free.

A mother leaves her baby alone when she leaves the house, which is illegal, not cute, not a delightful opening for a children's book. Letting a baby go down a laundry chute, again, not cute. Letting baby swim--SWIM! A baby!--in a fish tank...I won't go on, but if you want a kid's book to show to your adult friends and get a HUGE, dark laugh at, Good Dog Carl will make a great Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanza present.

I now have a Rottweiler that is a therapy dog for children in the hospital as well as elderly people. I buy the book to give to the children either before we visit to let them see a kind gentle BIG dog or when we are visiting at the hospital as a memory of Good Dog Carlie.Since there are few words and beautiful paintings the children usually like to make up their own story from the pictures.Wonderful series of Carl books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for adult & child to read!","review":"This book is a great way to allow both adult and child to have fun \\"reading.\\" I spoke with my nephew about how a child never really crawls out of a crib unless an adult is present. Depsite what some people state, I do NOT find this book as dangerous to the mind of a child if handled properly. Excellent book and highly recommended series of books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent parenting choices","review":"I found this book to be an excellent guide for child rearing. It affirmed by choice as a parent to leave my toddler in the ward of a large canine for hours at a time.

Carl is indeed a good dog and this book will make you a good parent, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter loved it; hubby banned it","review":"I had read the reviews about this book being a bit disturbing, but decided to give it a try anyway. My daughter loved the pictures of Carl, but her father decided to ban it, taking it to work to share with his coworkers. The illustrations are great, and most of the story is cute, but the baby falling two stories in the laundry chute, and falling into the fish tank were not so cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has hardly any words that's the good part.","review":"It makes for a wonderful book when your toddler is going through one of those stages of just wanting to read the same book over and over and over and over and over b/c there isn't much for you to read.I have to admit though that although I find the illustrations charming the whole premise is kind of creepy. I always end the reading with, \\"And then CPS came and took the mother away and placed baby with a loving, responsible family and Carl went on to star in his own TV show.\\" I don't want my daughter being left with the impression that if we get a dog at some point it will be babysitting. I'm all for catharsis in children's books to show irresponsible behavior, etc. I think this one is disturbing b/c the parent is the one that's so horrible. The kid and dog are doing what one would expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you're not a toddler","review":"Love the art & the concept, and, yes, it's very funny. But I would NOT recommend the book for the 1 year old to 3 year old crowd that the board book targets. Or anyone with a sibling that age. I have pretty tame girls, but still my 18 month old, if she so much as saw the picture, would immediately copy it. My three year old, in a silly moment, would try to be the family pet and get the 18 month old to climb on her back from the crib.Toddlers and preschool kids don't know any better, don't necessarily see it as silly, and are excellent imitators. This should not be a board book, I think that is misleading. Great art & concept, cute story too if you are old enough to separate silly from real."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate HATE HATE this book","review":"You read about it every day in the news. Because people just can't seem to learn. Headline: Child gets mauled and killed by family pet. So let's enforce that in a children's book so they can learn stupidity when they are real young. If it didn't happen in real life so much, then it would be a cute story. But why a Rotwieler? Why not a golden retriever? And why can't the mother be getting the mail from the mailbox or doing something a little more sensible. Mother leaving the house to go shopping while leaving a Rotwieler to look after the baby is just a plain dumb story and any responsible adult wouldn't buy or read this book. Stick with the time tested books like Seuss or Eric Carle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"I understand why some people like the cute premise of this book, and the nice illustrations. I thought I would too, as I'm a dog lover and like kids' books that have a sense of humor. But I have to say I don't like this one. Maybe I'd like the other Carl books better.I checked this one out of the library and just read it to my son -- 23 months. I had to whisk past the page with the baby climbing out of the crib, because he is so observant and has been trying to climb out of his crib for awhile now. I think the only reason he hasn't is that he thinks it isn't possible. This book shows him that it is.I felt a little ill viewing the picture of the baby in the fishtank.

It allows you to make up the words as you go, so even an older sibling can \\"read\\" it to the little one. My son never climbed out of his crib, and I wasn't disturbed that the dog watched the baby for a short time -it's just a book! He actually took better care than many babysitters would! :) My son loved the fun pictures, and could relate to the baby \\"oh oh, messy!\\" when he saw him spilling food on the floor, or jumping on the bed. An excellent book if your child loves dogs and mischief! Even without the words, this book taught how to talk. It's still his absolute favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great \\"wordless book\\"","review":"It's not toally wordless.. there are a total of two sentences; one in the beginning and one at the end. The rest of the story is done through beautiful illustrations of interactions between Carl (a Rottweiller) and a baby he's left to care for. For those who find that absurd I point to every story where children are abandoned by mothers (Cat in the Hat, Hansel and Gretel, for that matter every fairy tale ever written). It's fiction! Also it is intended for a pre-reading audience (I recommend 2-3 years) not those who will be judging its probability.As a speech language pathologist I find this book to be AMAZING for eliciting spoken language. You can ask what the baby is doing, where is the baby, how did that happen, or even \\"Can a baby swim in a fish tank???\\" Even my 2 year old son answers no.It's a great imaginative story with beautiful pictures, phooey to those who are shocked."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD DOG CARL, first in a wonderful series","review":"I stumbled on this book when my first grandchildren arrived. The author, Alexandra Day is also the illustrator. The story is told mainly through the pictures, and there's a lot going on. Young children are fascinated by the way Carl takes care of things for the humans. This format is wonderful because the child is encouraged to talk about what is taking place. I recently bought three more for my friends' children. They are already favorites with the children and the grandfathers. This format is on \\"solid\\" pages instead of paper, but the series is available in both. What is really great is when the child creates their own story which they expand on as they grow. All the CARL books are terrific, but a big favorite of mine is CARL'S MASQUERADE PARTY. GOOD DOG CARL is the first in the series...a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Dog Carl is Great","review":"Alexandra Day is a gifted artist and clever and funny story teller.

Just kidding, we love Rottweilers and are glad to see a story that shows their true personality- caring, loving and loyal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I love all the books by Alexandra Day and this one is great.

The cutest in the series. I don't have any issues with her hair like the other reviewer, but the top layer of tulle on her skirt did come off in little coral shaped pieces. That didn't bother me too much, and I tend to be particular. My 3 yo DD loves playing out Dora Saves the Mermaids with this Dora and Mariana and the Sea Carriage. Dora Saves the Mermaids was a HIT at our house. We've given the other Doras in the series as gifts so her friends bring them to play DSTM at our house. Tons of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent documentation of Military Intelligence Paranoia","review":"Col Corso is a name that I had heard before, while I was attached to AF Intelligence in Washington D.C. Many of the items that he mentions ring true to what knowledge I had of certain events and occurances relating to the \\"foreign technologies division.\\" I throughly believe Col Corso's rather simple explanation of inter-service rivalries overshadowing the greatest discovery of all time. You had to be inside to realize how compartmentalization and competition could cause events to unfold as the Colonel explains.He had nothing to gain from this revelation - except the knowledge that he had stopped decieving the American people. Trust me, as a Colonel he did not need the little income that this book probably provided - expecially not at the expense of his reputation and integrity. He was there. He was part of it. His conscience was clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corso's book a dry read with little believeability.","review":"Phillip Corso's \\"The Day After Roswell\\" is, at first blush an exciting look into the world of black ops and reverse engineering. However, once you begin to read Mr. Corso's tale of his management of the Pentagon's reverse engineering of \\"alien technology,\\" you discover a startlingly dull and boring account from a dull man who spends much of his book worshipping his former superior officer. This book is incoherent at its best, and at its worst it is a terrible bait-and-switch pulled on the Roswell Phenomenon enthusiast. This book claims to blow the lid off Roswell. Instead, it puts you to sleep with the sketchy rememberances of a career military man apparently out to make a buck. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Important Book on the American UFO Cover-Up!","review":"Having read the TOP Four books in the UFO/Alien/ Government Coverup Genre; My FAVORITE is 'Alien Rapture' by Brad Steiger (Great fiction-soon to be a movie); and Alien Agenda by the best selling author of 'Crossfire' Jim Marrs (Best reference on UFOlogy); and Unconventional Flying Objects (NASA UFO Investigator for 30 years) by the scientist Dr. Paul Hill, I'd say Corso's book is a MUST READ! Why would a respected, decorated, connected Military Officer swear in a Court of Law that the UFO Conspiracy is real and that the facts and agenda in these books ARE TRUE. Why? If you read this excellent book and the others, you will know that they are indeed true. Two well respected American Astronauts have come forward to proclaim they had seen evidence of the Roswell UFO crash and stated they know the cover-up is real. Was his sudden demise a product of this conspiracy? You be the judge."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will make you re-evaluate...","review":"This book will make you re-evaluate everything you ever thought about ufos, aliens, and the role the government plays in concealing information from the public. This book should be an eye-opener to any reasonably intelligent adult. There is too much evidence here to not make one ponder whether we truly have been visited by aliens. Whether you already believe in aliens or not, this book should be read with an opend mind and let the facts in the book speak for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fact - just a good story","review":"I was looking for some hardened facts, but once again was dissapointed by reading a piece of fiction. Yes, Roswell may be true, and yes reverse enginerring 'might' of occurred, but a lot of what is claimed just does not ring true. Still, it was quite thought provoking.

It would be hard to just make all this up, although the military has gone to great lengths in the past to do just that.Although Corso does not explain why he suddenly wanted to disclose all this information, he does give insider insight into what the army had and what they wanted to do with it. It makes a lot of sense when it comes to the rapid technological advancements we made in the 20 years following the crash.He also shares his mindset, which explains why they considered the ETs hostile and thought time was of the essence to reverse engineer the recovered technology into weapons to fight the aliens.Unfortunately, in the Epilogue, he still feels their intentions are hostile and thinks we can now take on these aliens and beat them with our new weapons. Hmmm... I'm not going there."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I really could'nt wait to read this book. I was sure I would learn something new.nope. for someone in the \\"know\\" he sure is'nt saying anything new. I have read more informative information on the internet and heard more on art bell! this book is nothing but a big tease. I think he must of been planning on writing another book because he alludes to the fact he knows who the aliens are and what their agenda is but never says. this book gives you a tidbit here and there, but, the rest is nothing but space filler about things and events that have nothing to do with the book topic.

I'm sure those truly in the know (no, I am not a mad conspiracy theorist!) are always glad when books such as this one are published as they help to further muddy the water and keep us ignorant of what's really happening in this world.An OK book but not the \\"truth\\", I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too lame even for me.","review":"I have an extremely open mind, but this book is ridiculous!

It strikes home if you grew up in the 60's as it relates to the relationship of the armed forces and other government agencies during that time period. As a technology engineer, I can understand how the discoveries were distributed to the various domestic companies so that it would seem to the everyday consumer that this was invented by a U.S. Fortune 500 company.

This is one book that did not make the grade. It went into the trash. The gall of this author to credit alien science, rather than the ingenuity and hard work of government and industrial scientists and engineers, for certain advancements in electronics and physics, made me very angry.

All the government released documents indicate nothing that would lead one to believe that a UFO crashed at Roswell. There is no evidence in this book that one could examine to see if a UFO crashed at Roswell. THINK! Could the U.S. Government, with civilians who were present at Roswell, hide a UFO? Could the U.S. Government seal the lips of hundreds of people present at Roswell? NO WAY! Corso has nothing.

Corso covers so many different aspects of technology. Most importantly his mention of Canadians Dr Gerald Bull (V3 supergun expert)and Wilbur Smith is in exact correspondence with published information in Canada. In a recent book \\"The UFO Files\\" by Palimaro Campagna, the unclassified papers of Wilbur Smith were discussed. Smith was sent to the US by the Canadian Govt. to discuss the UFO phenomena. Col. Corso accurately describes this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but not complete","review":"An interesting book indeed, but as the old lady used to say, \\"Where's the beef?\\" Indeed Corso's credentials seem squeaky clean, but the question that he never answers is \\"Why are you telling us now?\\" With so many references to intimidation by the Army to the witnesses and to people in the know over the last 50 years why can he divulge the unthinkable now?He touches on so many other interesting topics but never delves into them; The Kennedy Assassination, other crashes, communicating with the aliens, and secret bases. His narration never goes deep enough.Anyway it is the most interesting book about Roswell that I have seen in years, and if what he is saying is true Superman can step out of the way for Col. Corso"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many unanswered questions","review":"\\"The Day After Roswell\\" by Philip Corso is either one of the most significant books of the 20th century or a complete waste of time. Corso, a former high-ranking military officer, claims that he spearheaded the government's supersecret effort to analyze the wreckage of an alien spacecraft and apply the extraterrestrial technology to US industry. Among other items, fiber optics and integrated circuit chips are allegedly the fruits of Corso's efforts. Corso's account is meticulous but leaves many questions unanswered. The author verifies the existence of the infamous, oft-doubted MJ-12 working group and offers the possibility that the \\"aliens\\" found at Roswell were in fact time travelers from Earth's own future, raising some bizarre questions: if the \\"aliens\\" came to 1947 using technology which we in turn injected into contemporary industry, then where--or, more accurately, when--did the technology come from in the first place?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth one star. It is trash, save your money!","review":"Yes, I'd like to believe, and I was fooled into expecting some sort of evidence from this piece of trash. I doubt Corso wrote the book. It is vague, and I believe fraudulent. For someone (Corso) who was supposedly involved in exploiting UFO technology, his involvement amounted to staring at a file cabinet, throwing together some stupid essay of his speculations for his \\"boss,\\" and then turning over artifacts to others and saying: here, do something with it, get it into products of everyday use. Yeah, sure. I started skimming after a couple of chapters, spot checked other chapters, and tossed it into the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"No proof, deceptive","review":"Senator Strom Thurmond wrote the original forward to The Day After Roswell-- only to have it removed. Thurmond was under the impression that Corso's book was autobiographical. The book was supposed to be titled \\"I Walked With Giants: My Career in Military Intelligence\\". Which is certainly not the same as Roswell.This seemed like a ploy by Corso or Birnes to make the story seem authentic. (Disinformation?) Very slick. However, the UFO community mainly dismisses Corso as a fraud... for too many reasons I won't go into.A better account is \\"The Roswell UFO Crash: What They Don't Want You to Know\\" by Kal Korff."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy is delusional at best !","review":"Anyone who is even relatively educated in science and technology, knows the evolution of disciplines that led to all the inventions that Corso claims came from flying saucers.

Don't waste your time with this supposed book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best UFO book yet","review":"This gives detailed descriptions of alien bodies, flying crafts, the crash at Roswell and the invention of the transistor.

It's easy to read, the first-hand experiences and viewpoints conveyed by the aurhor are interesting, and the author was a decorated and relatively high ranking military officer.Some other reviewers have expressed doubt that the development of lasers, supertenacity fibers, and other technologies was influenced by the introduction of alien technology, and that the author's claims in this regard cast doubt on his credibility. That, I think, is an overly cautious conclusion. It's plausible, in my view, that the author did have custody of some crash debris and did make a good-faith effort to introduce it into technology development projects, but that he overestimated his impact. If so, he wouldn't be the first person to have over-rate himself. Then again, maybe his work did have an impact...Anyway, I would recommend this book to everyone, with the possible exception of hardcore skeptics, because they seem to be offended by any mention of UFOs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction...now what!!!","review":"This book seems to be an outline to much more information concerning UFO information. Corso appears to be very credible. However, what is his agenda now? He suggests that we have countered or placed any alien threat into check.

This gentleman was right on top of all that happened in a time period that is conveniently being ignored by those who should be protecting our country. But for the sake of their own greed and power and control issues, at this moment in time much is going downhill for the rest of us who are only looking for truth. The author, Philip Corso,is a former pentagon official (Retired Col.) who, in writing this book, chose honor and truth above all else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm.......","review":"I read the other online reviews and decided to spring for the book. While well written, some things jump right out at me. Corso was a career 'militarian' so his opinions appear to come from one angle. What raised doubts in my mind with regards to this book is that there is indeed so much 'dis'-information out there that you don't know who to trust anymore. I can't visualize the wimpy guy in the picture walking into the office of a CIA officer and mkaing threats. Corso insists that visitors mean us(U.S & the world) harm. Yet, in all his wisdom, fails to realize that harm could very well have been done when we were not in a position to defend ourselves. Any rational mind should come to this conclusion, no matter how long one has been fighting wars. Read Alien Agenda.

Philip J. Corso (Ret.) give us one of the most detailed and informative looks into what happened on the night in 1947, in the New Mexico Dessert. He give details, and names people that were involved in the cover-up. This book tells us where Intergrated circut chips, fiber optics, lasers, and more all came from. It also tells that the government has been lying to us for over 50 years, because they are afraid of how we (the public) would react to the idea that we have been visited by creatures from another world.

The book itself is highly disjointed and doesn't flow in a manner you expect to find in a chronological novel or work of nonfiction.

The stories vary from sensuous and romantic to wild and kinky, but they all have a similar theme: a woman shattering her inhibitions by venturing into her wildest sexual fantasies. I marvel at this author's ecstatic and inventive writing. I couldn't put this book down. Are you in the bargain for a very saucy read? Get Buck Wild and pick up this book! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you read part one then no need to read part two.","review":"The stories repeat!!!!

Who would have thought of a sexual encounter from the prospective of a female bank robber? Or still communicating arousal in the type of apartment - messy, grungy - that a single black man offers for a sudden adventure to a prissy business woman? In every tale Zane injects the language and perspective of black women which is so uniquely their own.

Phoebe, the main character, is drawn vividly and realistically enough to make the reader really care what happens to her. She tries to deal with the death of a beloved uncle, an event that sparks more than just grief in her family, as old secrets make themselves felt in new ways. Dreyer's treatment of bipolar disorder, especially in the way in which it affects those around the person suffering is honest and sensitive. The action moves from the psychological to the physical during Phoebe's excursion into a cave with her Aunt Erica. This sequence is tense, exciting and utterly believable. I will be looking for more of Ellen Dreyer's books because she is an excellent novelist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I bought this book and trust me this book is very helpful, it's the best gramma book I have come a crossed so far.

The book seems to be merely requoting passages from other, more significant works instead of drawing larger conclusions of the time period.

The bridge was too thick and kept popping off every time I tried to tune it and the resin was old and dried out. And finally, one of the pegs was poorly constructed and would not tune. Needless to say, I ended up spending money to buy a new bow, resin, bridge and have the peg fixed so I spend the same amount of money I would have had I bought one from a reputable music store. Buyer Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO.","review":"Parents, you may be thinking, oh at what a low price it's soo good! NO... it's too good to be true. Buy your kids a more worthwhile instrument if you are going to buy them one here at all. Even though the price is low... it can hinder your child's process and make it harder for them to play. Not only that, but buying a better instrument can get better tone AND has a lesser chance of warping, which can lead to VERY high costs. So really, buy a better instrument and don't think just because the price is right that this is a good violin.

The only change is the omission of sweater patterns for men. Sweaters, tanks and cardigans as well as jackets kmean patterns for all seasons.

The chapter on the DDR's health care system was especially bad. Condemning the British National Health Service and the East German system was especially infuriating, since the two systems were comparative apples and oranges.Utterly absent was any mention of the Kampfgruppen or other (numerous) paramilitary organizations. As with many other works, the Stasi figured prominently.Most obnoxious was her use of paragraph-long, tedious,jargon-laden sentences.One sentence was 119 words in length!Sadly, while this book tried to be the DDR's Grunberger (The Twelve Year Reich), it failed.

I took it from the library because I'm a huge fan and was interested in learning more about how he came to where he is now - what I found instead were tedious details (not in a good way) from acquaintances and not much soul to the book. The book also doesn't seem to give credit to the amazingly hilarious Larry David, who is responsible for so much writing on the show. How can someone write an entire book about Seinfeld without once even speaking directly to the person you're writing about? This missing link was definitely a huge gap in the book, leaving only mundane details and a want for something authentic from Seinfeld himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"What a boring read. For a story about a man who made his name largely from the show Seinfeld there were only 82 pages(out of 362)and 8 chapters(out of 41)related to the show. The rest was a boring soap opera about his relationships and lack of commitment in those relationships. All the information was gathered through anecdotes, largely from people Jerry had crossed in some way so they were generally not complimentary. I found the last few chapters particularly tedious telling the stories of the leaked Vanity Fair article and the \\"theft\\" of his future wife. I realise a biography needs to tell about the person outside of what has made them famous but this was over the top in that area and gave me almost no behind the scenes information about the show that most of the world loved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much irelevant gossip and stupid judgments","review":"He seems to have collected a lot of journalistic kind of history.The annoying parts are:He takes a clear moral judgment against anything os seinfeld life he does not like (he hints that somehow Seinfeld should have ocntributed to the synagouge his dad liked.......

The last question is obvious, Seinfeld could be called the greatest entertainer of our generation. What i found ironic about this book was the fact that Seinfeld put so much time and effort into his career, and it appears as if the author of this book did no more than conduct three or four brief interviews, and thype sienfeld into a lexus nexus database. What i found irritating about the biography is how the author mention the quotidian nature of seinfelds love life, and then he writes and entire book about his dull and unremarkable lovelife. I dont understand why he chose seinfeld as a subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Jerry Seinfeld, you'll probably hate this book..","review":"What's up with this Mr. Oppenheimer,anyway. He frequently makes the point that Jerry Seinfeld achieved extraordinary success with a clean act, unlike other comedians of the time. He didn't use profanity in his comedy routines and I think that was a huge part of what made Jerry Seinfeld so great. (Not that he's not great still!)This Mr. Oppenheimer, on the other hand, seems to think that the shock value of throwing in one disgusting word after another is worth the price of degrading his own name as an author.I'm glad I didn't buy this book. The library shouldn't have either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure sensationalist drek","review":"The only reason this book gets one star is because Amazon does not allow a reviewer to select ZERO stars.

Rinse.

The simple fact is that Rand blows it from the start.On the very second page of her second chapter, Rand illustrates her theory of concept-formation in what she describes as its simplest case epistemologically: the formation of a child's concept of 'length'. The question-begging nature of this account is obvious on a single reading; she defines length in terms of itself. According to Rand, in order to form the 'concept', we already have to have it.If that case doesn't work, the rest of her theory can't get off the ground. All this stuff about 'necessity' and so forth is interesting, but it's quite needless as a review of *this* book.Rand was no philosopher, and her epistemology was no epistemology. Look elsewhere for enlightenment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I purchased this book several months ago, hoping that I could begin a new mystery series. I was wrong.

The only reason this release of the series was made was due to the new English voice track. IT. IS. HORRIBLE. The actors clearly aren't putting effort into what they're doing. This isn't surprising since most of the actors chosen have only done hentai work previously. The writing wasn't atrocious as well. Most of the lines are taken directly from the sub track and not made to flow more naturally in English.Moral of the story:GO BUY LOVELESS THE COMPLETE COLLECTION.

Gaylen was a very intelligent boy, and I really liked how Ardis helped him. Or did she? I guess we'll never know!

My fifth grade class enjoyed the many characters Babbitt invented along the way. The book was filled with adventure, humor, and a bit of a lesson about greed. As the protagonist, Vaungaylen searches for one meaning for the word \\"delicious\\" on which everyone can agree, and just when you think the search is hopeless, he finds his answer. An excellent fast read with marvelous characters, The Search for Delicious is sure to be a hit with many young readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicous Indeed","review":"The Search for Delicious is a both humorous and, hmm... mysterious? Perhaps, as the plot (Uh oh, a \\"plot!\\" Fairly weak foreshadowing that was...) is not fully developed until the end of the story. We begin as the Prime Minister DeCree is writing a dictionary. Confused as to the definition of delicious, he accidentally starts a war. Eventually, the people of the city have been stirred up by a mysterious hooded figure. (Now what was that about a plot?) Eventually they all agree on one delicious, thanks to the mysterious hooded, who blocked off the water supply. Whups, now you know what delicious is. There's also a backstory, which will come in handy near the end. A good book for reading, if you're not reading some other good happy fun book that also starts with some meaningless argument. Happy good fun reading, peoples!"},{"rating":"2","title":"unexpected boy adventure story","review":"We have an older edition of this book, with a boy on the cover facing a mermaid. This is a boy-oriented quest adventure story, not a mermaid story.It involves treason and rumors and riots and suspicion and trust and duty and honesty and discouragement and disappointment, with a quiet message in there about how quickly people rush into war, and another quiet message about how people don't own the world.Plenty of foreshadowing, plenty of storylines that get wrapped up in the end.

I really wanted to like this, being such a fan of the first film. The acting in the film is okay, but it suffers so much compared to the Pacino/Penn film. The climax was very bland. The one thing I wish they would have explained better was how Carlito became friends with the Italian mobster and the African American bookie. They were both very successful people in their own circles, and Carlito was just a common care thief. Why would they cut him in as an equal partner in a tens of million dollar drug business? Also, how did all three get in one cell. This takes place in a time when racial tensions are high, and prison officials would not have put a white/African American and Hispanic in the same cell. And while everyone else in the film hates each other for being differant, these three love each other. I would have liked to see the story of how they got that way. I would steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rise to Power is Rise to Nothing","review":"This is one of the worst films of 2005, a prequel that is almost as bad as dumb and dumberer and son of the mask, the acting is terrible especially P.

The best had to be when Puffy's character claims that the Italian Mob won't dare set foot in Harlem. This, of course, is the furthest thing from the truth. Sure, Nicky Barns was a legendary black gangster, but what does he have to do with Carlito's Way? Are you kidding me; who on Earth decided to throw a Nicky Barns character in here?In the original Carlito's Way it is stated that Carlito came up in the 50's. The original also takes place in the seventies. That being the case, why on Earth does Rise to Power also take place in the 70's... especially when it is known that Carlito went away for 5 years to begin with? The bottom line is that this movie was pure garbage but worth watching maybe once for a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"No wonder this release went straight to dvd. The original Carlito's Way is one of my top 3 movies and this is one BIG disappointment. A big majority of the movie I got the feeling like the actors were just standing on screen waiting to say their lines. PDiddy as Hollywood is awful, that is some of the worst acting I have ever seen, especially in the scene where he shoots the guy in the bar. I felt like tossing the dvd out the window by this time and this so called prequel does not connect in anyway to the original. I was waiting for an apperance by Lalin or Pachanga. This movie is a desperate rental if there is nothing better to rent available. My copy is heading off to Ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? Why? oh Why?","review":"I have not seen this film and don't intend to after watching the trailer. How many more prequels of this nature do we have to put up with? The acting and the script look terrible. No wonder it's straight to DVD. Brian De Palma's Carlito's Way was a masterpiece and the performances of Al Pacino and Sean Penn were just mesmorising. The dialogue is absolutely poor in this new film and everything seems so cliched and unoriginal. These pointless films make me cringe and I keep wondering why Hollywood insists on wasting talented actors like Luis Guzm��n and Giancarlo Esposito. They are capable of so much more. These type of films show nothing but Hollywood's lack of imagination. I would say to viewers, watch the first film, it's amazing but stay clear of this. Oh and as for the casting of P.Diddy, I thought he was convincing in Monster's Ball but here well, gimme me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely tragic","review":"Completely unlike the classic original gangster movie starring Al Pacino.

Not even in the same ballpark. First off, aside from Luis Guzman as Nacho Reyes, the acting was pitiful. Jay Hernandez did not play a believable Carlito at all. He was way to soft to play the Carlito that Pacino created, and didn't come across at all like the hardened criminal that he should have. Plus the rest of the C-List actors chosen to play the supporting cast were just as bad. The movie also did very little to tie itself to the original. And finally, they just didn't do a good job of bringing back the time period. The look and feel was off, it needed the look of Dead Presidents to pull it off in my eyes. 2 stars, I'm taking my copy I bought yesterday straight back to sell as used..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carlito has lost his way","review":"...It's almost like an extended SNL skit of \\"Carlito's Way: The Early Years\\"....horrible script, pacing, atmosphere, acting, and anything else you can think of.

Unanswered questions that i was expecting to be revealed in this one. The only part i thought connected very well with the original was Luis Guzman and his \\"this loyalty you have for your friends is going to get you killed one day\\" line.

As with 2006's horror genre entry, HOSTEL (which opened at #1), Mr. Hernandez holds his own against veteran performers and smartly resists turning in a \\"Young Al Pacino\\" portrayal. Instead, he is his own person, fleshing out his role and creating a number of memorable movie moments. While Mr. Hernandez is a strikingly handsome actor, he does not rest on those laurels... not in 'Rise to Power' or any other role he has undertaken.Why this talented young artisan does not headline more films is beyond this movie-goer.

At first, I was really happy with it. I slept a lot better and did not wake up with a pounding headache. However, I started to notice that my gum line was receding. My gums bleed more when brushing and were generally more sensitive. I stopped using it. Then, I asked my dentist how much another professionally made guard would be - $480!!!

I won't be using it again, and I couldn't recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can sleep better now!","review":"All thanks to this sleep guard, I don't wake up in the morning with splitting headaches and jaw pain anymore.

I sleep with this in my mouth for 3 nights and my mouth muscles are properly trained to keep the teeth apart while sleeping. This is my second one that I purchased ( I somehow lost the first one).

The Sleep Right guard is well worth the extra money, much more comfortable, and I plan to stick with it. The guard pretty much fits right out of the box, and is only slightly bulky in the mouth. The only room for improvement would be reducing the bulkiness in the cheeks, which is visible when I wear the guard.The bite pad rests between the molars, and allows my jaw to relax during the night so I have less tension in my neck in the morning. My jaw and neck feel noticably better in the morning than they did with my first night guard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I grind and clench my teeth a great deal.

However, Ms. Lackey manages to resurrect it one again with this awesome book. It continues the motifs of her earlier series, but introduces an entirely new cast of characters, who are all as enthralling as usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new perspective from a good author.","review":"I was very heartend upon reading this book. While all of Lackey's books have been enjoyable to read many of her latters books have lacked a fresheness in there perspective. This new novel was a fresh break from her previous work. The themes are not of global scale and you could feel inimately the plight of the characters. I also was quite delighted by her choice of main character for the novel. Darian, a young mage gifted boy, is not the perfect idealistic youth most often portrayed in books of this type. Instead we are introduce to a young boy who is lazy, neglectful of duty and a bit of a brat. Watching the growth of him through the book only underlines one of the over all premisses of Lackey's books. \\"There is not one true way\\". Not in religion, politics, or the raising of a children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mercedes Lackey has done it again, an extremely good read.","review":"When I first heard that Mercedes Lackey was coming out with a new \\"Valdemar\\" novel, I was excited, then after some long contemplation, and reading some of her recent books, I had doubts. I bought it, read it, loved it. Though at the beginning, I couldn't stand Darian, he was such a brat, no wonder the folk of Errolds grove looked down at him. Then when the barbarians came, and invaded Errolds Grove, and Justyn killed himseif trying to save the town, I started to have a little more compassion for Darian.I won't go into more detail, for there might be readers out there who want to read it, and find out the rest of this wonderful book for themselves.

I was entertained, yes, because I like the book's setting. However, I found myself not really caring what happened to the characters. (Very atypical of a Lackey novel. Including the Gryphon series, which was also co-written with Larry Dixon.) This might not be a bad place to start the Valdemar novels, but I would reccommend starting with \\"Arrows of the Queen.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standards....","review":"Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite authors - her books are, on the whole, wonderful. Not deeply philosophical or anything, but great, creative fantasy. Reading that is relatively light, but still of high quality. Understandable and high-quality and yummy for teenagers and adults alike. In general. Owlflight, however, is really not. It feels like it was aimed strictly at kids age, maybe 8-12. Honestly, that really got to me. It felt almost like it should've been called \\"A children's guide to Valdemar\\". It was better then a lot of \\"young adult\\" fantasy - but not at ALL up to her usual standards. Please, please, if you want to read her books, PLEASE read other ones instead. The Last-Herald Mage trilogy is wonderful, as is the Mage Winds trilogy, Bardic Voices, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool. I thoroughly enjoyed this book","review":"This is NOT a stand alone book. It is the first book in a new Valdemar trilogy, beginning with Owlsight. An excellent novel, if a little bit juvenille. A bit like Arrows of the Queen in writing style, but lacks in no area. Owlsight (the sequel), is more involved, but this book is a necessary prequel. I am anxiously awaiting Owlknight (the final volume), and having read all the Valdemar novels thus far, this series rates up there with the Mage Storms for entertainment value."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want to put it down","review":"One of Misty's best Valdemar stories, possibly because it did not deal with the powerful and highborn. Following Darian from an angry, insecure, child to a confident hawk brother ready to train as a mage, then as a silver was an interesting view into the human psyche.We got to meet all the races we have become used to as the population of Valdemar, but learning the personality of each new character was great. I personally have loved all of the previous stories put out, but there always seemd to be a connection of some sort to Vanyel or Skan, it was refreshing to meet characters who had only heard of the famous Elspeth or Firesong, but weren't related in any way.<P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Though I am a big fan of the series, I'm starting to find Lackey's books extremely disappointing and unsatisfying.

It wasn't just the plot's fault... somehow, Lackey's and Dixon's language has changed.

I swapped bulbs between two of the units and determined that the bulb was bad. For as expensive as these things are I expect them to be more reliable. I've had similar disappointments with other fluorescent lights from Lights of America. Considering that the lights are made in China, why do they have this name? The only way I can see to get a reliable light is to buy several and throw away the bad ones. Not very cost effective. I wish somebody else made these things.As for the claim that they put out the equivalent of 500W, I used these to replace four 400W metal halide lights.

I mean, it was the first controller to popularize analog sticks, in this case called the \\"control stick\\" on the N64. The controller is really comfortable. The way that Nintendo made this actually allows you to play in two ways! You can play it like an NES or SNES controller with six buttons on the right, or you can put your left thumb on the control stick and your right thumb on the six button layout. Now, lets talk about the control stick. It's okay, but it's fragile. It eventually gets loose and wobbles around on one side when you let go of it. The buttons are perfect unless you spill and sugar-substance on the buttons. Like for example, soda or orange juice.

Not remembering much about my mythology, I also enjoyed the background information that Ms. Harbaugh included - and the side plot with Diana the Huntress was also very enjoyable.

I am now amazed at the extent that the author went to mis-quote witnesses in order to prove his thesis. A prime example of mis-quotes can be found when one compares Zirbel's quotes from the Warren Commission with those actually in the Warren Commission's report. Many are taken out of context, or misrepresented in a way that is favorable to Zirbel's theory. I was amused by the mendacity of Zirbel's speculation that Ralph Yarborough was to be the intended limo companion of the first couple. Such an assertation is based purely on speculation, with no factual evidence to back it up. Overall I found the Texas Connection's theories to be an even longer and more arduous shot than the one Oswald may have taken on Nov. 22, 1963."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling and provocative","review":"I found this book one which I couldn't put down - I found it enthralling, extremely convincing.

No such luck. The characters barely approach the one dimensional, while the story - if you can call it that - moves along with all the speed of the erosion of granite being weathered by drizzle.If you find watching an oak tree growing too exciting, then this is probably the book to help calm your nerves.

As with many artists who've been around for awhile, I suppose there are bound to be the two typical camps--those who favor the earlier works and those who prefer the later stuff (or perhaps three camps, since many of us enjoy it all).

The supporting actors are awful (especially the older Christina). The soul reason I give this one star is for Faye Dunaway. Yes she was good, not at her best, but was good. Dunaway was much better ini \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" and \\"Chinatown\\". She can not get this movie out of the whole. Yes, you do find yourself laughing, but that was nnot the intention. The intention was to make you sad and mad, but it did not succeed. it only made us laugh harder. It is such a terrible movie because it is so atupid. The way they depict Joan ,Crawford's personal life is really quite terrible. Hollywood agrees with me. The Golden Raspberry Awards (Worst movie awards) gave \\"Mommie Dearest\\" the title of worst film of the '80's. Maybe it wasn't the worst film of the 80's but it was one of them. \\"Mommie Dearest\\" deserved every poor review it got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disrespectful to Joan Crawford's Memory!","review":"Thankfully, we didn't pay for this movie. I rented it from Netflix after my Aunt recommended it to me. We were all very disappointed when we watched it at the beach. I have always loved Joan Crawford and thought she was a great actress. As you may know, this movie is based on the biography that her daughter Christina wrote on her. And with all the stories mentioned in the movie, it sounds like she hated her. It is a commandment in the Bible to honor your parents, and this violates that commandment bigtime. I also do not like the way that she talked in the movie.

Actors get paid a great deal, but this film proves that they have to take responsibily for the mistakes of everyone else involved. She may have put too much into the movie, but everyone else seemed to put far too little into it, especially the supporting actors and the studio. It's no surprise she wanted wooden coat hangers, they would fit in with the rest of the cast. She seemed to spend the latter 3 decades of her life as Joan Crawford in the same 2/3 places, no wonder she went boss-eyed. Surely she cannot have been aware how bad this film would have turned out. I think the biggest issue this film raises is cruelty to actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan got the raw deal","review":"From what I've seen in this movie, Christina Crawford has to be the most mealy-mouthed, whiny, and self-centered person in the world. Joan had to have had the patience of a saint not to have killed her. Everything was always about Christina, as if Joan was there to serve her and have no life of her own. Christina should have been raised without all the amenities if she wanted to know what real life was all about. All Christina had to do was keep her mouth shut and do what she was told, but no, Christina had to be impertinent, ungrateful and belligerant. Gee, where is SHE today? Back to being the nobody she was born as, before she was rescued by Joan. Where are the scathing books from the other children Joan adopted, or is Christina the only ignoramus in the bunch?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mommy Dearest","review":"Arrived on time and in the exact condition as stated in their description.

It has some of the worst acting in cinema history (Steve Forrest in particular - just brutal). It has the great actress Faye Dunaway in the most overblown acting role in cinema history. It makes a disturbing subject like child abuse seem comical. And I love all 129 minutes of it. The lines (\\"No Wire Hangers!\\", \\"Don't f*** with me fellas!\\", \\"Clean up this mess!\\") are classics.

(The laserdisc and tape were just awful.)And this improved image makes the film better. The sets look less cheesy, and Dunaway's miriad facial expressions are there for the wonderment.Sure there are all the great quotes, but when all is said and done, the film is a bit more complex than it seems. There are times when you think, Joan is just a raging alcoholic who liked to buy babies and change their names, but there are other times when you think, this kid deserves it . . . almost. More could have been done to make this release better. How about Faye commentary? The Hurrell photographs she did for Life magazine? The photo galllery is mostly comprised of film frames. Too bad. But you gotta have the disc anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes Mommie Dearest...","review":"This is a great movie! I remember seeing it when I was very little.

Dunaway is awful. Crawford was a woman who was very tough but also had great humility and heart. Dunaway plays the role very coldly...she never warms up and shows hr humanity, implying Crawford was some kind of psycho zombie. So untrue. Anyone who accepts this as the \\"real\\" Joan Crawford should read a few books about her by people who knew her. A good one is The Last Years by Carl Johnes or Joan Crawford by Bob Thomas. Those books offer a less-biased point of view. Joan Crawford was a troubled woman, there is no doubt. And she had her flaws. Most of her problems (and the alcoholism) resulted from a very unhappy life. Joan Crawford was a dreamer looking for love and affection among those who could offer her none. I think it's safe to say no one ever loved her. All she had was her career and fans which she had to fight to keep. Ask yourself, before you judge Joan, who would you be if nobody loved you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Movie","review":"This movie was horrible and to top it off the seller harrassed me about my review.

Christina Crawford's autobiograhical bestseller about her Hollywood upbringing at the hands of her alcoholic, moviestar 'Mommie' Joan Crawford, was powerful, enfuriating, and heartbreaking. The movie, unfortunately, is just a mish-mash of overblown acting and there is little continuity between the scenes. I nearly walked out on this movie when I first saw it, and it's not much better on the small screen! The period sets, costumes, and Faye Dunaway's makeup are right, but the tone of the film is way off! Both the Christinas were horribly cast, and I had no sympathy for either one. Diana Scarwid's acting is downright embarrassing (since when did Christina have a Southern accent?)!

This is the most amazing performance I have ever seen, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES! Mommie Dearest","review":"This campy movie is by now a classic. In my opinion, it does not depict the private life of Joan Crawford as much as it depicts the perceptions of a little girl growing up in a miserable Hollywood environment. I don't doubt for a second poor Christina's life was a living hell but I don't blame Joan for all of it. I know quite a few people, including myself, who could easily write a \\"Mommie Dearest\\" book with as many or more horror sequences as depicted in this movie.Faye Dunaway seems to channel Joan's spirit in a riveting performance. I remember reading that some very strange occurences were happening on the set while this was being filmed; wouldn't be a bit surprised if Joan came back to haunt the place. Who could blame her?No matter what you think of Hollywood brats or Joan Crawford, this movie is worth watching for the incredible performances and bizarre story. Many lessons to be learned here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Camp Trash","review":"Too funny in parts, too campy in others, this movie will go down in the annals of Hollywood history with the same regard as \\"Valley of the Dolls,\\" and other campy movies that generate a following.

This is the funniest piece of crap that Hollywood ever produced; that was meant to be serious. It comes off as a comedy; as it should.

I'm mad at the dirt.\\" \\"Why must EVERYTHING be a contest?\\", \\"Why can't you treat me with the same respect that I deserve; that I'd get from any stranger on the street?\\" and many, many, others.

Dunaway's performance is flawless. She was born to emulate Crawford.Diana Scarwid is perhaps just as unlikable as Dunaway.Although I'm certain that if ANY of us were written about in the negative, 2 hours of all our bad moves and poor choices, even if true, would appear as awful as this.Great acting and a great movie. Only one good thing came from Christina the Brat's psuedo-biographical novel: Joan is smiling from above. Thanks Dunaway and Getchell for a grand film and a showstopping good time! Whew!

Not many people have ever heard of Borderline Personality Disorder, but Joan Crawford had it, and that's why she acted the way she did. The movie seems over-the-top because that's what BPD is all about -- being overly emotional and over-the-top. To anyone who hasn't experienced it personally, I'm sure the movie does seem ludicrous and overdone; however, the sad thing is that it actually happened, and continues to happen to millions of unfortunate children.I oughta know, my mother is Borderline. How ironic that she used to hate this movie -- she pulled a Joan Crawford whenever I jokingly called her \\"Mommie Dearest\\"! *sigh* Yeah, it's really not funny at all if you've lived it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CAMP CLASSIC WITH NO FEATURES??? BOOOOOH!!!","review":"Leave it to Paramount video to take a camp classic like \\"Mommie Dearest\\" and turn this event into a bummer! If you can believe it: they have given it absolutely NO ADDED FEATURES. That's right: no insights from Faye Dunaway, no background chit chat from little Tina, not a word from Diana Scarwid. That's right, nothing!

I don't know what happened in the Crawford home and if abuse resided there then I am so sorry for everyone involved... but what I do know is that it seems like Christina is only worried about money. In the interview she was telling of how horrible her mother was because each year she would get fewer presents at Christmas time. Give me a break! Her mean old mom would even make her give her birthday gifts to children who didn't have the nice things she had. It is amazing what money will do to people. I would rather be poor as can be raising my children with just enough to get by, than raising a couple of spoiled brats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CHRISTINA! CLEAN UP THIS MESS!!!","review":"You can not walk away from this movie without remembering at least one catch phrase. It's a staple viewing for all...men since Faye Dunaway is just FABULOUS as the one and only Joan Crawford. And it's simply the greatest comedy of all time believe it or not. I laugh uncontrollably when Christina's school mate catches her with an alleged boyfriend, only to tell Christina \\"I am going to TELL, oh dear God I am going TO TELL!!\\" This film is classic and it's about time Paramount pays it's respects by releasing \\"Mommie Dearest\\" on DVD!

Incidentally, they are located VERY close to me and I even offered to bring the product to them so they could see it. They wanted nothing to do with me doing that.

So, while it is tempting to buy another birdbath on the hope that the manufacturer has finally gotten his product to work reliably, I wouldn't dare. Too bad.

However, and this is a big however- the mounting bracket is \\"flawed\\" at best, and at its worst is useless. It needs a thoughtful design upgrade in order to make it more stable. I attached it perfectly (as the directions indicate), and it does work, but it is very floppy, and sways back and forth spilling water whenever a slight breeze or bird is nearby. Who designed this bracket? 1 star for bracket.note- with a little effort, I was able to add a piece of plywood and some wood shims (just under 1\\" thickness) to the underneath area to add support to the birdbath. Am disappointed I had to do this, but it made the birdbath much more stable, as needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great heated birdbath","review":"This heated birdbath does the trick.

I recommend it as it does the job. The non heated one is great too.

The rim is perfect for perching for birds of all sizes and the squirrels are loving it too. We think this is a great birdbath, priced right and easy to assemble.

I have been turning it off at night via indoor switch installed by picture window and it takes a little while for the ice to melt in the morning.Bracket that came with it works suprisingly well.

It was an arena for artists to perform their music LIVE, not MTV style. This was the 1970s and when bands performed live, this is what it sounded like. This is meant to be intimate, stripped down reality. They didn't have computer synths and what not...every other show at the time and later (like American Bandstand) simply had the artists syncing to the recording. If that is what you prefer, stick with AM BS, MTV and the like. However, if REAL live music is your bag, and what you appreciate is the stripped down rawness of that, then Midnight Special is the way to go.

Many show restored artifacts from China's long history. Vases, stoneware, flasks, paintings, handscrolls and much more. From the paintings, you can see where the traditional misty style of Chinese landscape paintings arose. There are even genres, like bamboo painting. Just like the Europeans developed portraits of horses and landed gentry.Naturally, there is also extensive coverage of porcelain plates and containers. Beautifully decorated. The items that the Europeans would call \\"china\\"; so close was the identification of the objects with China itself.But more than just objects, the narrative also gives insight into the various Chinese dynasties from which these arose. And also the provinces, like Jiangsu and Anhui, that were artistic centers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of the best textbooks on the subject","review":"The fourth edition of Michael Sullivan's lucid survey of the arts of China is still one of the best textbooks on the subject to be found in the English language. Within its chronological arrangement of chapters it covers major historical, religious, and cultural events from each period/dynasty in Chinese history before examining developments in the visual arts. Major masters and works of art are given careful attention, as are important stylistic changes from period to period. This book has been used by many institutions of higher learning as assigned reading for undergraduate courses on Chinese art, and rightly so. Although some of the photographs could be better, reproducing every object in color would necessitate a rise in price, and most college students have enough to deal with, financially, as it is.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant if you have the Singer Property Casebook","review":"If you use the Singer Casebook for property, you're not going to get much more out of this hornbook.

I read it many years ago, and it continues to reverberate in my theological practice. Apocalypse means \\"unveiling.\\" As Keller says, this was the verb of the groom unveiling his bride. The next thing we know, that same groom is tearing open the earth for weatlth and pleasure. Thus economic development is revealed in the dark light of pillage. I have never read such an eloquent plea for the earth and her creatures, the earth itself as the Body of Christ. The book reads like a dream, revelatory, deconstructing the strictures of linear thinking to show its underlying chaos and self-interest. As a result of reading this, I began to do theology as dreamwork, an idea that Keller herself takes up in more recent writings, notably God and Power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtually inaccessible","review":"I'm certain that, buried somewhere deep in her convoluted prose, Keller has important and profound understandings to share about the nature of apocalypse. Unfortunately, this text is written in the language of a person so immersed in academia that she has forgotten how to communicate clearly and concisely to those outside of the world of research journals and symposiums. Keller's approach is to say in a paragraph what could be said in a sentence and to write with such a vocabulary that most readers will need to keep a dictionary close at hand just to decipher what she is trying to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much","review":"looks like a nice cart--however look at the freight--too much. $35 product--$50 plus for shipping.

The climax was ridiculous and I just felt cheated by the time the story was over. I'm glad I bought it used for under $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there anything lower than an zero rating...","review":"This book was horrible. I mean, really, really horrible.

But I'll keep the faith...a little while longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Know What's Up With Zane Anymore","review":"I believe that Zane has fell off. I don't know what she is writitng anymore. Its like she got her props and she doesn't want to stick to writing quality books anymore. The storylines are like whatever.Being that this story was set around Christmas, I wasn't too crazy about that and her little presents at the end of the book was like a waste of pages. I really don't know why people still like her because what she is distributing is just of waste of ink, paper and time. I still read her books to see if she is going to bring back her formula. I only purchased one of her book and I never purchased another since."},{"rating":"1","title":"so far my least favorite zane novel","review":"i read zane's book just for the fun of it and of course the juicy sex scenes she is famous for writing. this book was a complete let down. it had a few interesting twists although they were somewhat predictable. the sex scenes were pathetic. i read it fairly quickly, but only because i was hoping it was going to get better and not because it was such a page turner. zane's book are hit or miss for me. she has done a good job with most of her books by including a good story along with the trashiness we all secretly love, but this book had no good storyline and no good trash to girltalk to your friends about. this has probably been my least zane novel by a landslide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overheard in the bathroom stall","review":"The positive hype about Zane books is way off the mark. I imagined this book would be filled with juicy sex scenes that would tantalize and inspire but what I actually read where childish and insipid sex scenes that would excite no one who has actually had sex.

Being a reader myself I was curious to find out why the sudden demand for the book.I still don't get it beause I thought the book was awful.The storylines were very weak and the language was quite vulgar. I'm no prude and don't have any great objection to some degree of profanity in books but this was just too much.The sex scenes were non descriptive and vulgar.I thought the book gave a very negative view of african americans and I still don't understand why people would want to read stories like this.I think that erotic stories for black people can be written in a more tasteful manner,and still leave you in no doubt that it is a story for a predominantly black readership.I think Zane can do a better job than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note to self: Don't Ever Do that Again!","review":"I read this book because I'd heard so many good things about Zane. I won't repeat all of the other reviewers word for word, but my goodness, the characters had NO depth, no spirit, no nothing (Oh, except for consistently stimulated genitals and a lack of self-respect)! Now, I know that it's nearly impossible to tell a story that hasn't been told before, but I was predicting this story before its ending and even when things started happening, I was yawning. It was WAY too predictable, boring, diluted(...). I'll never pick it--or any other Zane novel for that matter--up again.

No serious content, no heartfelt scenes, just some good old reading material.We meet four main players in the Wolfe Industry.

You have to check it out"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could do better","review":"There's nothing wrong with a little trash but not when it's this badly written. Zane has no ear for dialogue, her characters are one dimensional, and have no motivation for their actions, every woman has big breasts and an ample sexy backside, every man has a big youknowwhat and EVERYBODY is fine! She needs to take a page from Terry McMillan who writes funny, sexy books but actually knows how to develop distinctive characters a reader can relate to. I understand what Zane is trying to do, but truly I could do better - and that ain't saying a lot. Please if you must read this book - buy a used copy. Don't waste $27."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I usually enjoy Zane's novels, but Skyscraper felt very rushed. The characters were undeveloped and boring.

Because it was written by Zane I just knew every other page was going to have a rounchy sex scence lol but to my surprise it didn't. I mean there were some parts but for the most this is probably one of the few Zane books that are not too explicit.I like the way the book was broken up into characters but they all relate to one another. My favorite character was Diana. She was one of the most realistic characters throughout the book in my opinion.The only thing I did not care for was the ending and how alot of it was fabricated. I think they could have been a little more realistic when it came to Zetta, Chico, and Tomalis. Other than that, I really enjoyed it and I'd read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful yes, but...","review":"This light is great. Small enough & very bright.

It has very good battery lift with rechargeable energizer batteries. The light itself is very strong and provides great illumination on the road surface.My only complaint with the device is that the way the lamp connects to the main battery compartment is poorly designed. I found this out when the light accidentally dropped out of my side coat pocket. A drop of 4 feet cracked the plastic side latches. While, a drop of this height might have rendered any lamp useless, due to the construction of the Cateye there is really no easy way to fix the lamp so it will work again. How do I recycle one of these?I am going to ship it back to the manufacturer to see if I can get a replacement or recycle it. In the future I will look for something more rugged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cateye quality is not what it used to be....","review":"My old cateye Halogen headlight (HL-500) was legendary in its toughness, 10 years with routine drops and spills. I can't say the same for the new OptiCube LED models. I've had both the HL-EL500 and the newer HL-EL530 LED lights stop working after falling only once from handlebar heights(just about 3.5 ft). Nothing visibly broken or cracked, no loose parts, just a $45-$55 paper weight. The problem is limited to the reflector/bulb housing unit, for which Cateye does not sell replacements, so once it breaks you have to replace the whole thing. No complaints about the brightness when it worked, but a bike-light needs to be tough and should withstand small drops at least as well as your average cell-phone. MagLite can make nearly indestructable and waterproof flashlights that sell for under $35, why can't CatEye? It's about time we stopped getting ripped off by bike light manufacturers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"This light is decent if you want to be seen at night.

For just a few bucks more, the difference is unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good light. Sleek design.","review":"I first bought this headlight as a gift. I then tried it and like it so much I decided to buy it for myself. The light is very bright so much so it can light up the dark path (not only for others to see you).

Highly recommend this Cateye headlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cateye headlight","review":"I'm disappointed with this product because of: 1. It throws a round beam 2.

So this year, I'm replacing my old Cateye MicroHallogen 500s, with two 530s, better run time, and a brighter light. So in the end, I'll have the single shot plus mounted in the middle, then two of the 530s, one on each side. I should have plenty of light, even if the single shot plus, runs out of juice.As for the light being rugged, it is made out of plastic, so dont drop it. As for the switch getting sticky, well the whole light is water proff to 30 feet, so just wash it clean. Lets have some common sense here people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it breaks.

Eric and Leslie both had gone down destructive romantic paths before meeting each other and developing a loyal friendship, which turned into a chaste romance. (They did not even kiss until they had said their vows.) I loved the part where Eric proposes to Leslie--it is so romantic and pure. If you're looking for a real love story, buy \\"When Dreams Come True\\"--And read it 'til your face turns blue! (yes, I know, I'm not good at rhymes.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Star In The Night","review":"When someone is hurting, a story is better than a lecture. Eric and Leslie invite you into a very vunerable part of their lives and share their mistakes, their tears, and their pain, as well as the priceless things God did with their confused and wounded hearts. Their story is challenging, comforting, and encouraging. And it really happened!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only the Best","review":"I found every spare moment to finish this book and yet I also wished it would never end.One thing I took away was how God can be honored even in relationships.

I don't need someone telling me the ten steps to a successful relationship that won't work anyway; I just want to hear about how God brought two people together and concocted a beautiful story. I love reading true love stories anyway, and Eric and Leslie have a beautiful and entertaining writing style that literally means you can't put this book down. It's a light read, but it stays with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful love story","review":"This is such a great story. The best I've read in a long time. Eric and Leslie Ludy tell their love story in this book. They write about their experiences in high school, what they were like, how they became christians and how they met each other.Each chapter is different, one chapter will be written by Eric and the next one by Leslie, and so on. Its great you know who's writing which chapter and it tells you details about their life. It talks about how God got involved in their lives and how he helped them and changed them, its such a beautiful story, I loved it.Instead of reading another Christian romance novel, read this book. Its so encouraging and wonderful, why settle for second best, when you can have God's best?! I must say that this book has certainly changed the way that I look at love and romance, that if you trully want the best, just trust God with your love life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back great memories!","review":"What a treat it was to stumble upon this book in a now-defunct catalog (Common Reader) and then ordering it from Amazon. I stayed at the Hotel Taft many times in the late 1970's while in high school. Our choral/acting group would take a bus trip to NYC every spring from South Georgia. And we stayed at the Taft every time. So reading this book was a trip down Memory Lane for me. Reading what went on behind the scenes opened my eyes to what it really took to run a full-service hotel like the Taft. My main memories are the mezzanine and the dry cleaning door on the back side of the room door. I'd never seen one before. And actually haven't seen one since. Read this book to be transported back in time to the earlier years of the theatre district!

Perhaps one of those memoir-writing students.The sentence structure is of the \\"See Dick run.\\" complexity and depth. An appalling lack of descriptives, and absolutely no lyricism, nor romance in the writing - nor is it a hard-core expose - which then would at least have a sense that the author cared about writing the story. This is the book I would have written about my travels...which is why I have not written it, as it would be as lacking in its ability to convey a richness of experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"personal/universal","review":"\\"Armchair Cogitations\\" continues in the apparently semi-autobiographical vein of \\"Pathways\\", Herbert Kaufman's previous book. The section \\"Air Force Vignettes\\", especially, provides a glimpse into a world that, in some ways, no longer exists. However, just when you think that a piece is going to be primarily nostalgic in nature, an event or conversation between characters shifts the emphasis. Often we understand then that the relationships between humans broadly follow along certain well-worn paths; what may appear as our own original, highly personal drama is part of an existence common to all of us. Perhaps the reader's age will, in part, determine the extent to which he or she may empathize with some of the book's characters and situations, but there is much that all will recognize."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book. was my super hero!!","review":"i was worrying because i was going to get a maltese but i didn't know how to train it. i got this book and when i got my maltese i tried the way it says in the book and it worked!! i really reccomend this book to maltese owners that don't know how to train and groom their maltese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for beginners","review":"I own several Maltese books.

By organizing the excerpts around key issues, Professor Wright illustrates that liturgical debate on topics like - Prayer from a Book vs. spontaneous prayer - more or less fixed liturgy vs. a preaching style of service are not new issues. The particular excerpts he has chosen illustrate how much the current debates could be informed and deepened by a sincere appreciation of the discussions of the past.

This one did. So maybe I got lucky, or maybe the other reviewers were unlucky. But so far, this has been the best cordless controller I've owned and I've tried others.

The characters of Myron, Win, Esperanza, and the rest are all great. This book was a typical Myron Bolitar book in that it is complex yet easy to read, and there are no dull parts because it is so funny. I highly recommend all books in this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an efficient and perfectly enjoyable murder mystery...","review":"Harlan Coben certainly likes to churn out his Myron Bolitar mysteries. Thankfully 'Drop Shot' is among the more sane and enjoyable entries. In it we have our sport agent cum private investigator trying to sort out seemingly interrelated murders connected to his star tennis player, all taking place during the US Open. There is sex, violence and lots of flippant dialogue. Yes, there are plot twists in the end. But compared to other works of Harlan Coben I found the ending to 'Drop Shot' to at least be rational, although hardly believable.Bottom line: a fast-paced, funny thriller. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Myron is fabulous all over again","review":"Coben knows how to weave a story that keeps you up all night finishing his books.

Indeed, the clock looks good from a certain distance and is EXACTLY as the pic - and here is why: it seems to be a paper dial, which means that everything is printed, including the \\"distressed\\" elements.So yes, it is a nice product for the price, looks great on the wall (the illusion of metal is excellent), and it seems to be accurate too.

Read the reviews and decided on this Chaney. We love it! It looks like it is made of metal on the wall, and the parcment look on the face is well done. So far, it is keeping accurate time and we have gotten several comments on how great it looks. We feel the price is incredible for the quality! So far, a happy customer!**UPDATE** 1/21/13Uh oh.... clock loses a minute or two every 5-6 days. I have now had to take off wall reset fast about 2 minutes several times now.

It will only read a disc about once every 30 tries now and has started eating dvds. Not only does the laser fail to read the discs now, but the belt is also broken and the dvd fell off the tray and was damaged. And the other annoying part is that the VCR still works fine, so it seems a waste to scrap it altogether. You're better off having a separate dvd player, and certainly not a \\"daewoo\\" one. It may seem like a bargain, but believe me, it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"The other reviews are right, this thing is a lemon. Right out of the box the audio did not sync with the picture, both on VHS and DVD. It would fall behind, then run ahead, then behind, etc. VHS picture had incredibly dull and fuzzy picture (guess 6 heads AREN'T better than 4), and I noticed the DVD playback was stuttering a bit too. Probably the worst electronics purchase I've ever made...so it's going back. Daewoo makes great standalone players but avoid this heap of scrap metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken right out of the box","review":"Brand new unit, but the VCR player would not rewind. Too bad too, because the VCR plays fine, as does the DVD player...nice picture and sound, and it plays DVD+Rs, VCDs, etc. as advertised on Amazon. The unit looks nice enough too, though a little large. It has a solid feeling construction...made of metal and not plastic like many of the new low-end models. Regardless of what works, without the VCR being able to rewind, it's certainly not proving its reliablity. I guess I am glad it showed itself right away.

I won't buy Daewoo brand products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality VCR module","review":"The unit I purchased played DVD's with great quality. The recording and playback of VHS tapes, however, was about the worst of any VCR I have used in 23 years of video taping. The recordings (even at SP) have a great deal of noise and even streaking. This unit makes tapes recorded on other machines unwatchable. Just to make sure it was not bad tapes, I played the tapes back on several other machines (none of which are the recorders used to record the tapes), and they looked great. The Daewoo makes them look like they were recorded with bad reception or something.I am sending this machine back right away. A similar-quality DVD player is half the price of this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victorinox Paring Knives","review":"Needing a new paring knife, I went as per my custom to Amazon. The name \\"Victorinox\\" immediately caught my eye, since I have carried their original \\"Swiss Army Knife\\" for many years, and given these fine folding knives as gifts to several of my friends. The set of three paring knives was very little more costly than the single knife I desired, so I chose that option. Upon arrival, I found that these knives are indeed the usual fine \\"Victorinox\\" product, sharp enough to shave as delivered, and likely to stay that way through much use. Extremely satisfactory!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the curved beak knife","review":"I used to have a wood handle curved beak knife but it disappeared a few weeks ago so I bought this set. It was cheaper in the marketplace even with shipping than getting another wooden handle one. I missed my knife but now I have another and use it all the time. This curved beak knife is great for getting stems out of berries, tomatoes and paring slices of turnip. I also have a paring knife I will use a lot but I am not sure about the serrated one yet. I have used it but prefer non serrated blades myself. This set was definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"These knives are worth raving about","review":"I got a pack of these knives a year ago, put them through their paces, and have been very pleased! They're still sharp, even though they are the only knives I really ever use for chopping or cutting anything, and I put them through the dishwasher each time I use them and there's not a single hint of rust anywhere on them. The handles are attached well, no food debris gets stuck between the blade and the handle and the handle doesn't come loose. I just bought a second pack so I can have more knives, and this company has so impressed me I am looking for other size knives from the same manufacturer to complete my collection.

But serious knives need some heft to help them cut and these knives have none.

It is a lot easier to adjust the mirrors when you have two people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whistling Mirror","review":"These mirrors are pretty good. I have towed from Michigan to Florida, and to Texas. They can be difficult to set up correctly, but once they are they stay in position pretty well. They can whistle at certain speeds, however I find that if I align them close to the installed mirrors and slightly closer to the nose of the car they do not whistle. I've used them on a 2006 Honda Odyssey and on a 2012 Odyssey; the vehicle mirrors are shaped differently on these two models but they worked well on both. I've never used any other mirror and so have nothing to compare it against although the dealer who sold them to me told me they were the best option and I believe this is the case. I would like to see someone come up with a version that is remotely adjustable without getting in and out of my car - maybe a few servos, batteries a remote control would be nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very noisy and hard to install. Not usable for me.","review":"The cushion pads would not stick to the unit on mine. It took two people to mount due to the pads. Once we got on the road it lasted on my car all of 10 miles before I had enough and removed it. The wind whistles through it and makes a dual-tone sound that reminds me of a train whistle. Seriously, it's loud! The mirror also vibrates a lot making it hard to see. It's the glass itself that's vibrating, not the whole unit, so it doesn't matter how securely you get it mounted. Also scratched the mirror housing on my car!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Universal Towing Mirror","review":"Towing Truck: 2010 Nissan Frontier.First off, the price. Amazon's price was half what some on-line sellers are asking-- a great bargain!As to the product, I am very pleased with the quality of construction, design, and the ease of fitment to the existing truck mirrors. With patience and experimenting, the fit is excellent, with very little vibration at 60 mph. Two suggestions to potential buyers: First, once you have dialed in the fit, mark each respective mirror as to which side it attaches. I marked mine D (driver) and P (passenger). Second, buy a secondary strap for each (I found small dog collars made of nylon at Wally World). Slip these around the built-in straps on the mirrors before attaching, slightly tighten, and then tighten down the attachment straps to the truck mirror. This does two things: it lessens the wind noise; and, it adds an additional bit of security to prevent mirrors from slipping or falling off. Fiddle with it a bit and you will see how much it helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice about buying this mirror.","review":"I've install these on both a 09 Tacoma and a 04 F-150. Didn't have too much trouble adjusting them on the Tacoma. I did have a little trouble mounting them at the correct angle so that they were actually useful. After that they worked ok. Put them on the Ford and it mounted a little easier. But on my last trip I was having troubles adjusting it to the right angle. While trying to adjust it, it was like there was a dead spot in it. The view too high. Try to lower it a bit then it would go too low. It acted like it was sticking and then it would almost \\"click\\" to the next spot which was way too low. After trying time and time again to adjust it the mirror finally just fell out and cracked into pieces. It snapped back into place but it's now a mirrored spiderweb.

So, the Universal Towing mirror was the best viable alternative, I thought. IT works OK, but the way the mirror mounts places it on the back-side of the installed side mirrors, making the CIPA mirrors hard to see well. They get obstructed from Tahoe's own mirrors. Also, the mirrors fall easily -- luckily it happened when I was parked, and the mirror didn't break.

It has a delicious fruity taste and I am able to drink it without added sugar or sweetener.I read that to enjoy the full health benefits of Kombucha the tea should not be heated and the bag should be left simmering in cold water. I have done that and I enjoy it. Although I really like my tea hot too so once in a while I will just make a traditional tea with this bag and hot water. Green tea is supposed to have a huge number of beneficial properties and this one tastes great.

Well, two week after I purchased the product; I opened the box, and the first thing I see is Kombucha DECAF! No wonder it was cheaper than the other prices. The original kombucha has 30 mg of caffeine, and this one has 5 mg. Okay, so it's decaf so what? I brewed one. I did not like it. It does not taste like the original kombucha. Plus I cannot return this product; therefore, this product gets one star. I am so upset and I will buy from another site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had known more about Kombucha","review":"After reading that some people have issues with Kombucha tea, I Googled it and read some more. I recommend that others do the same before drinking it. I am sure that Yogi Tea produces their Kombucha in a careful environment, but it can cause health problems. It also does not appear to be appropriate for people with Candida despite some claims. It contains alcohol, sugars, fungi, yeast and molds, and a study showed that it did not improve symptoms of people with Candida. I've been drinking it almost daily and have been having unexplained stomach aches lately and will try eliminating this tea to see if it helps, now that I know more. Again, read up on Kombucha and make your own informed decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy","review":"Green tea kombucha from yogi teas is yummy and tasty.

The whole idea of Kindle is that the author's costs are practically eliminated, and that this savings is shared with the purchaser. $27.04 is just plain greedy.

Double Standard, Mr. White? Or maybe the editor called in sick that day?There's also a dissing comment about feminists which had me rolling my eyes.

Still, read it if you must. The writing gets better with \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", but I think it would had been a lot better if Glut had gone into detail a little more. Still, even if it is missing something, it's still good. \\"Return of the Jedi\\" surprised me. Many critics say it is the worst movie in the \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, as it can be constructed as weak and childish in some respects. Yet it makes for the best book of the three! Since it is best, of course, to read all three books in sequence, a compressed edition should be very convenient. I would recommend this book to most \\"Star Wars\\" fans I know.

I regret that such a spectacular vision and story goes unfairly represented in print. All Star Wars fans know that this broad, complex and vibrant universe Lucas created and was able to translate into a visual medium (sometimes better than others, i.e., \\"A New Hope:\\" compared to \\"Return of the Jedi\\"), deserves a literary treatment by talents at least of the caliber of Timothy Zhan (who wrote the \\"officially sanctioned\\" literary sequels to Episodes IV through VI)or better.

This book features all three star wars, A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return Of The Jedi. If you must know this book is just as good as the movie but it's even more fun to find out what the characters are thinking during lightsaber fights, empier encounters, and all scenes with Darth Vader and The Emporer.

These 3 stories are the best science fiction pieces I have ever read. They are witty, charming, and humurous. The creativity in these stories is astounding! The characters are great! George Lucas combines romance with action, and danger, for the Star Wars triliogy. Anyone who likes science fiction, I highly recommend these books. The movies are just as great, so see them too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You know they're good, but not how good until you read them.","review":"The first thing that will strike you when you begin reading \\"A New Hope,\\" will be the level of skill with which George Lucas writes. He truly is an artist in the highest sense of the word. \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" is nothing more than a simple literary translation of the script. But both \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Return of the Jedi\\" are very well written, both having some truly stunning poetic breakthroughs in the prose. The biggest beef is that Obi-Wan is referred to as finding and training young Anakin and that Yoda trained Obi-Wan. Of course, now in 2002, we know about Qui-Gon Jinn and all that. I hope Omnibus has the sense to correct these obvious errors in ultimate plot.

I am sure that if you enjoy Star Wars, you will LOVE this book. The only complaint I can offer is that this book is a little much at one time. If you can watch all three movies in row, I'm sure you'll have no trouble reading the whole book at once. I myself was only able to finish the second story before I took a long break.

It is the best I could find. It stayed perfectly in place on multiple trips up north on Michigan's notoriously bumpy roads. I like that the lower straps hook on to the bumper of the car instead of on to the bottom of the trunk. This rack is sturdy, well made, and is exactly what I was looking for. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because it did rub against the spoiler of my car(2002 Olsdmobile Alero), and the rack scuffed the paint on my bike in the one small place it made contact with it. But, this is an easy fix, I just tied a piece of cloth where the bike or rack made contact with anything. No problems after that. I am VERY happy with my purchase, and believe got the best trunk rack available."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a hatchback don't even waste your money and time -it dinged my car!","review":"I bought this rack based on some of the good reviews I read.

However, as soon as I installed this rack in my car and drove very few miles, I noticed that the bikes were coming off. I tightened-up the belts twice and re-read the instructions flier just to make sure. Then after 2-3 miles...I hit a pothole, the rack got lose and the bikes almost fell off to the pavement --I had to pull over.Results: my trunk was dinged badly, and one of the bike wheels got damaged. Yet I had to dismount the bikes and start all over again so I could make it home. I changed the position of the rack -thinking that was going to help but this piece of steel never worked. It's one of the worst items I have ever bought.If you have a hatchback or a minivan, SUV don't waste your time and money and then more money in repairs for your car!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price","review":"I purchased this to be able to bring the family bikes camping with us.

If she had not been pushed over the edge by the taunting of others and her childlike need for approval, life would have ultimately proven her to be the success.Kellie Martin's performance is so on-target that at times it is agonizing (and embarrassing) to watch.

So I started to read it. After 40 pages I concluded that this was the single worst book I had ever read. Other reviewers have invoked the author's pomposity, self-absorption and smugness that comes through in the text. As an erstwhile professor of Jewish studies, I found much more troubling the awful tasteless scholarship - a little bit of this - a little bit of that. Can I say I found the book revolting? The way W. tells the story of how the Kaddish came to be instituted in the 12th century made me want to stop saying the prayer and run out of the synagogue. Early on W. says he prefers not to call the Jewish house of worship a synagogue. Rather he wants to call it a shul. Huh? It was downhill from there, believe me. I prefer not to call this a book. I'd rather just call it a DOA. I'm saying Kaddish for this flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"My overall description of this book is \\"irritating.\\" It is self indulgent, pompous and tiresome. The author experiences the death of his father, as billions have before him. He ruminates about it, as billions have before him. However, an unconstrained ego leads him to believe that his ruminations are somehow worthy of publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is a controlled and passionatly intellectual resar","review":"Kaddish is a controlled and passionately intellectual research in the origins of the mourner's Kaddish. The author uses the death of his father, and therefor the necessity of saying Kaddish, 3 times a day, for a year to inquire into Jewish practice, history, theology and philosophy. This book is neither a memoir nor a textbook for scholars. It is instead a tribute to the Jewish wisdom of the mourning process. Having heard the author speak, I understand why he did not want autobiographic material, why he chose boundaries around his privacy. He wanted intellectual pursuit, not voyeurism. Don't try to read it all at once. Pick it up at random and savor it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it at sunrise instead of a morning/mourning prayer.","review":"I read it at sunrise instead of a morning prayer. For a semi-schooled but unorthodox, secular Jew, reading Kaddish is like \\"davening\\" (praying) immersed in a sea of Jewish learning over a morning cup of strong coffee. Between the caffine and Wieseltier's high charged brilliance, I start the day exercised and sometimes in a lather."},{"rating":"2","title":"book review","review":"I read this book after my mother passed away last year at the advice of a friend.

A dud.","review":"I read the above reviews and they convinced me to get this book. What a mistake! Maybe being \\"Literary editor\\" of the New Republic means people are scared to write the truth about your book -- all those writers afraid of getting paid back in bad reviews -- but I am not afraid to tell the truth. This is a self-indulgent, long-winded waste of time. The man's father died; I am sorry for him. But does the death of a family member excuse any kind of self-indulgent, psuedo-philosophical nonsense? I think, what you have here, is a man who is going down under his own sense of learning, of a belief in his own smarts and superiority. I would suggest someone throw the man a rope but he is already too far from shore. Of course, I cannot tell you about the last few hundred pages for, I must be honest, I could not finish this book.

Cioran, Milan Kundera. Alas, we're left with a flabby collection of pedestrian thoughts, self-congratulatory anecdotes, ostentatious displays of esoteric erudition and -- worst of all -- failed epigrams. Imagine the 'Dairy' section of the 'New Republic,' where Weisletter is an editor, at its most insufferable. Philip Roth ('Patrimony'), Leonard Michaels ('Sylvia,' 'I Would Have Saved Them If I Could') and Cynthia Ozick (anything) have all handled similar themes to much greater effect. An interested reader might want to start there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overheated, over-intellectual, over-indulgent","review":"Wieseltier is clearly a very smart man and he mourned his father's death. But this book is a mish-mash of self-indulgent windy scholarship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and challenging","review":"Having contemplated issues similar to the author's (but without the academic credentials to match), I was deeply touched by this work. The book not only presents a broad survey of the rich literature on Jewish mourning ; the author taps into both a personal tragedy and into his vast erudition in order to make painfully relevant observations about God, religious belief, historical realities and personal obligations. And he devotes 500+ pages to achieve the feat. The style is whimsical as the pages jump from legal responsa to personal anecdotes to customs literature to pithy proverbs and then back. The author respects and deeply loves his traditions, even as he cannot get himself to believe in many fundametal Jewish doctrines. This reader, though, didn't mind the challenge to religious faith. It is good to ask why one believes. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music Maniac","review":"Should have been a one hit wonder or at the max two.

The statistics that the author highlights show that the most fervent Christians behave either slightly worse or no better than the population at large in many measures of morality, such as divorce, domestic violence, racism, and sexual promiscuity. We heathens have often suspected this, so it's nice to have data that backs us up, provided by an evangelical Christian no less.Unfortunately, the rest of the book is downhill; in it, the author mostly quotes scriptures to exhort Christians to behave better. Why does the author think that he can succeed where 2,000 years of preaching has failed? In the end, what he's selling doesn't address the root of the problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are christians living like the rest of the world?","review":"Because we are human!!

As Mr. Sider did in his \\"Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger\\", the average American Christian is taken to task for his/her lack of distinction from the rest of society. Mr. Sider provides a vast ammount of data to prove that the true tragedy of our time is the inability of Christians to act and think differently from unbelievers. The scope of this tragedy is reinforced by Mr. Sider's use of scripture to underline just where today's Christians have fallen short and how far we must go to change things. The book's shortcommings are only that some of the material is clearly reused from other books by Mr. Sider, and it is somewhat short incomparison to the depth of the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"with a little help of his friends","review":"A nice and honest product, collecting Ringo's favorites tunes.

If you lay them right the first time you can walk all over them forever\\" This joke (one of many) shows the public what kind of women these authors really are...and should show any other reader why these women have had such bad relationships. The true majestic people of Canton are sickened that one of their fellow citizens in this proud city could say such dirty things.

Therefore you are left with sorting through the data to find out what the issue is. Hence, my sore point of the whole troubleshooting process. Otherwise, this unit performs very, very well and I am very pleased with the performance. The CP9180 has been discontinued by Actron and replaced by the CP9185.

I was raised with all of these stories showing God's wisdom, mercy and love of the chosen people. God may have acted in a punitive way throughout biblical history, however, creating a fear in children the way this book does, is repulsive and does not teach a valuable lesson for today's standards. Children today are creative & intelligent and to tell them stories about how God is like their \\"pappa\\" needing to punish children who \\"do not obey\\" is insulting. Most definitely NOT a modern Jewish version of the important stories all youngsters should know.

However, it discusses basic concepts such as the probability of meeting, which leads to probability of sale. There is no discussion on the specifics of getting around gatekeepers (other than calling at odd times) or aggressive techniques such as using (\\"I'm going to be in the area\\").

Once you're comfortable with the basic characters, the book throws you into the Dakuon, Handakuon and Yoon. The book concludes with a crash-course in word-writing and sentence-writing (complete with basic punctuation!)I would say this book is a must have for anyone trying to tackle the Japanese language."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Limited' information, even for a small book like this","review":"I always start reading 'tutorial' books by examining the table of contents. This looked promising. But An hour and a half or so later I finished the last page feeling disappointed. Expanders and Gates are mentioned only briefly, while the rest of the book deals with compressors and limiters. What can you tell? Most of the material is repeated 4 times or more. I think this whole book could easiliy be rewritten in 40 pages. As for the CD examples: some are helpfull, but they are most of the time not very convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great utility bag for my camera","review":"I find this bag is perfect for my Minolta Maxxum, has plenty of space and cusion to hold my camera, film and all accessories.In fact, I use it as my carry on as I can fit a magazine, book and snacks in it too.I tossed out the previous bag I was using and really like this one.

Now the battery charges fine, was not happy to spend $24.00 more for a charger. The first time I used it on my monitor, it lasted less than an hour.

Plugged it in and everything worked fine. Tonight I hooked everything up and the left CD did not read the disc. I tried a few others, then it read one. The right player read all CD's. Then I noticed that the right player would make CD noises through my amp to the speakers. Every time I advanced the track, it would make noise. When I got the Left player to read and play, it did not make noise when advancing tracks. NOT A GROUND LOOP.I would stay away. In my business you don't get second chances.

I'm currently having the same problem but on the right side this time with my Cd Mix2. So, u know I'm not going to buy or try the Cd Mix3 because this time both cd sides probably will start freezin up and starting over.

Tom McCamus turns in a flawless performance as Henry Adler, the non-entity actor who wins a part in a cop show. At first, he draws strength from his macho cop character, but then - well, I won't say any more. See it for yourself - at least twice. This one is bizarre, but it's worth the trouble.

McCamus does a decent job in the lead role, but that's about it. The story is about an actor who plays a cop. He becomes so obsesses in his part that he starts acting out his role in the streets. The scenarios that he was put in were dull and the plot was undeveloped. Overall there was nothing new and nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the Ugly Stick Name","review":"The Ugly Stick name let me down on this one. The basic rod is ok. The problem is that the reel mount just uses the friction of the handle to hold the rear reel mount in place. The rod is missing the Ugly Stick twist lock.

Every time I saw it it was for Windows and PC. So I was pretty excited when I found it in a tiny MAC shop. The first night after I bought it, I made a single sim named Monica who moved into a one room bachelor pad. Monica now lives in a mansion with her husband and three kids. The surprising thing is that I did it all without a cheat code. The Sims truly is a game of strategy. I have pushed relationships to the extreme (marriage) and others to the lowest (Coronation Street style fights). I have made kids get A's and go to military school. I have made people who go to work in limousines.And I am still no Sim pro. In other words, one does NOT need cheat codes to get their Sims to the top. This game is definitely worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best simulated game ever!","review":"The Sims is one of my favorite games that I've ever played. You control their every movement, and the fate of their lives. I also like this game, because it allows you to be more flexible that you are in the previous \\"sim\\" games.

I played it instantly because me and my friend always play it at her house. Well, I didn't have to install it because we brought my friend's game over here and installed it here too. That way, when I got the game I wouldn't have to. Overall, the game was pretty good. I mean, it gets boring after at least an hour of gameplay and in the morning if your sims have jobs they only have a minute to take a shower, have a quick breakfast change for work and get out the door by nine. Also, WARNING! Zombies DO come out of the ground. They are all green so yu know what to look out for. Luckily they dont eat your sims brains but they do try. I found that out while my sim jessica was mourning at the graveyard next to their house."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sims","review":"Wow I was expecting to love this. Unfortunatly that didn't last long. The problem is that there isn't enough time in the Sim's dayto do everything they need too. To keep my Sims going to work and paying the bills they got behind on socializing and got sodepressed that they wouldn't answer the door when a visitor came over.The real problem is that if left alone they would never do anything that they needed to (like work), so you can't leave the gamegoing overnight unattended - like other Maxis games."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sims","review":"Another great Sim game is the Sims.

Not a bump could faze me, not even a mound. I went on the rocks, gravel and sand, they all crumbled before my Mongoose MTB bikes suspension.

I've been very happy with the build quality of the bike. The ride is very smooth. My only complaint is that the seat pole is so long I can't move it down as far as I want because it will hit the rear shock. I could cut it, but I don't think I should have to.Assembly was easy and the brakes just need minor adjustment. I also had to adjust the gear changers because they weren't shifting too well.

I'll start by saying the game itself is interesting and fun -- if you can actually get enough people together to play. You have to have at least 5 people. Also, you hardly get anything for the amount of money you spend -- you get a tiny box, and the only contents are a stack of cards and one fold-out page of instructions.The cards only serve to let players know what role they play (villager, cult member, seer, etc.) You could easily just write the roles on pieces of paper. The rules are incredibly simple (they fit on a single small piece of paper), so that gameplay is very limited.Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It feels more like the kind of game you can find directions for free online. Again, this isn't really a board game, and it isn't really card game, as the cards don't really serve any purpose once you are assigned your role. If you pay $20 for this, you're going to be disappointed when you open the box..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited use opportunities, not collectible artwork-wise, super-simple rules","review":"I probably shouldn't review this, since I've never played it, but I did buy it, and Amazon keeps begging me to \`be the first.' As a Lovecraft fan, I ordered this on reflex without much research. Only after it arrived did I notice the fine print that it requires a room full of people to play - there are no two-person or \`solitaire' rule sets - it's not that kind of game. In fact, the cards are hardly necessary at all - after reading the rules you realize that you can practically play this game by just ripping some strips of paper and handing them around. The fun, it appears, comes from it being a social activity and the cards are very simple props. Sadly, I can't remember the last time I had a dozen Lovecraft fans all in one room at one time, looking to play a party game, so this will probably just sit on the shelf forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Collectable","review":"It has been so long ago I don't even remember when I first heard Rachel Sweet, but it made an impression, so when I ran across Fool Around-The Best Of, I grabbed it and have not looked back.

Where a spice has been used for a specific health issue for thousands of years with good effect, how is it neccesary to make animals sick by poisoning them or giving them cancer to scientifically 'prove' what is already known? There is nothing healthy, holistic or in anyway humane in such cruel acts.As a Herbalist, I seek to help and give ease to people and animals and cannot support such a practice in the name of herbal 'research'.

It has an Italian barber who wants to get his Greek nephew into a Broadway production (I guess the scriptwriter regarded all European ethnic groups as interchangeable). Add to this his involvement with a couple of real dodos who spend on personal items all the money he gave them for betting on a horse in a steeplechase. They meet a handsome Broadway producer and his wealthy financier as well as a cute dancer and singer who is trying to rescue that horse when the financier discards him for injuring a tendon. Every song is lackluster with the exception of Judy Garland's \\"Dear Mr. Gable\\".In fact, the horse and Ms. Garland are the only reasons to endure this musical. Even Robert Taylor's scenes fail to capture much interest. Watching \\"Broadway Melody of 1938\\" only reminds me of why I like \\"The Goldwyn Follies\\" from that time period so much more.

Brian Hyland can SING Lonely Teardrops and you KNOW he wants her to come home.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much remastered","review":"The music and the album are great.

I have never had a problem using it and doubt I ever will. I tried salon tints which use the same Roux products and they were expensive, $100. for brows and eyelashes. They burnt my eyes and that does not have to happen if you use small pieces of cotton twisted around the toothpicks. I tried 5 beauty supply houses in Ca. and none had the product. This was so easy to buy and cost the same as I paid at beauty supply houses. This is a no brainer!

I could do it myself and save some $$ at the salon. Boy was I wrong!!! The dye tinted everything but my lashes-it left terrible stains on the skin around my eyes and the \\"remover\\" they send does not work at all. Plus it did not leave any color on my lashes at all.

The reason being is I had to repeat the process 4x over to get my lashes black. Also I could not get much color at all to take on my bottom lashes. In the end this only lasted a few weeks. I purchased in store and ended up returning the product. Not worth my time in my opinion, also not worth the chemical fumes being near my eye. My eyes did not water or sting however you definitely know that there are bad chemicals near your eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"So pleased with products performance!","review":"I have blond eyebrows but dark hair. I wish I had discovered this years ago. Its so much more natural looking than eye brow pencil.Its a simple process of applying solution #1 for 3 minutes, solution #2 for 1 minute, then rinse. Instead of using the prescribed petroleum jelly to cover things I dont want dyed, I'm just careful. I lightly brush the #2 (color) on and rarely smudge, tho if I need to clean up any little mark, the remover works great. Really you can nearly scratch off the color if you catch it immediately.A good way to get both sides of the brows is to brush them up with an eyebrow brush to get the backside, then you really dont worry about smudges. If you want them darker, go back and repeat the process the instructions say, and you can do it right away.I'd say you can get more than the prescribed 30 usages from it. No need to make an appointment and you can do it as often as you like.Sweet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"My eyebrows are naturally very light, thin, and unnoticeable.

We have a relatively high level of chlorination in our water and my fiancee is convinced that the cats don't like it (even though they happily drink from any toilet in the house).The issue we ran into is that after around a week the carbon starts to clump together. This massively reduces the flow through the filter and causes the water to back up behind it. This then causes the fountain to become very noisy.I don't know if this is a recurring problem with all users but the lifespan on these things is supposed to be a month so we're not doing so well. I have another 5 to use so we'll get through them then probably switch to using filtered water. (or toilet water if my fiancee isn't looking)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!!!","review":"These filters really only will work to help filter out lint and other light debris that might fall into the water bowl. The enormous size of the charcoal bits is ridiculous for true water filtration because each piece is so huge. There are only so many 'sites' on the bits to adsorb water impurities. Not only that, but there are hardly any pieces in it to begin with. Charcoal filters work best when the pieces are tiny and packed together and the overall surface area is significantly increased. If you look at any Brita or PUR pitcher filter and see the tiny activated charcoal pieces, you can clearly tell the difference. DON'T BUY THEM--Wast of your hard earned money for a gimic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably not that effective.","review":"Ok so I have not been using the unit that these go with for too long, just got it today. But just based on my feeling of the product, I highly doubt that they are very effective in actually filtering anything other than lint or other large debris. Its a loose felt material on the outside. The inside of it feels to be some stiff plastic or thin metal of some sort to hold the shape, with some pieces of carbon or charcoal in there. There are not a lot of actual carbon or charcoal chunks like you would see in a brita filter, and they do not do anything but sit at the bottom of the \\"filter\\" so I honestly dont see how they could do anything. We have a brita filter on our sink, so when I fill the unit, I use that and will use the rest of the 4 filters I got for the unit, but do not believe I will be purchasing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found Live Worms in Charcoal !!!","review":"I bought these filters and found live black worms about 1/4 inch long! The worms appeared in about a week and were clinging to the filter. I bought multiple packs, as I have more than 1 fountain and all the filters got the worms. The worms appeared in about a week. The filters are replaced regularly and even more frequently in warm weather. My cats are indoor cats and fed the best of the best food, so I know for sure the worms were in the charcoal. If you use these filters place them in boiled water for a few minutes, rinse them with hydrogen peroxide and rinse with fresh water again, also complain directly to the company! 1-877-PETMATE (1-877-738-6283) customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless product does not fit! whatever happened to the sturdy filters they used to make before!","review":"This is the most useless product ever! Total waste of money! A) It is flimsy B) It doesn't even fit in the Petmate fountain (model 24860). I have asked for a full-refund! If I can't get the old-filter it is going to make my water fountain useless. Or I will have to start making my own! But this is a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like they used to be","review":"These are junk! I used this type of water fountain 6 years ago. I have recently come back to it, and am disappointed at how flimsy the filters now are. They used to have a hard plastic frame inside the filter,and you could actually hear the charcoal when it was activated in water. Now, I'm hard pressed to believe that there is any charcoal in there at all! I don't really need to filter water, as I have a well, but cats being what they are, love to play and \\"rinse\\" their feet in the water. Lots of big chunks get into the water, as well as fur. This filter will control the debris, but for someone who is filtering less desirable water, these filters may not stand up to the test. Too bad the price isn't lower for these cheap things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stock up","review":"If you have the Fresh Flow fountain unit, it's not a bad idea to keep a few extra of these around. I only use the fountain when we're going out of town-- I tried to use it daily, my my stone freak of a cat splashes all the water out onto the floor, contaminating what's left (and in a mold-prone area like Michigan, the filter then gunks up very quickly). Cat #2 gets the short end of the stick on this one.

It's been 3 weeks and I have not really seen any changes to the filter. The water flows passively through the system, but there is no force pushing the water through the filter per se. So I'm not completely sure it is filtering, rather than just taking the path of least resistance around the filter. but cats are still drinking the water (albeit a bit less than initially) and still prefer it to fresh water in a bowl even after 3 weeks.ADDITIONAL INFO:The water filter itself broke after about 6 months of use. So unfortunately I have a bunch of filters and nowhere to use them. I've taken off another star for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"what's to say? these filter the water for my cats. i haven't tasted the water, so i can't say how well they do the job! i do find it a bit annoying to have to keep buying filters for my cats (i just wanted them to have running water--but i drink tap and think they'd be fine with it too!!). but, that's not the fault of these filters but of me for buying such a machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice idea.","review":"I definitely like the idea of my cats drinking clean water.

While it may offend some as stereotyping, it is done very tastefully and I recommend to young people of today as an exanple of the best that hollywood had to off when this movie was made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't play it!!!","review":"I tried to play it in 2 laptops, 3 dvd players and 1 brand new blu-ray player and all did the same thing. I returned it to Amazon for a replacement and the replacement did the same. I am returning the replacement for a refund!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cabin In The Sky","review":"This is a great classic. I remember watching this movie with my mother and father when I was a child. Ethel Waters - singing \\"Little Joe\\", Rochester dancing - my father use to dance the same way - it really brings back memories. Every black family should have this in their collection. Thank you Amazon for stocking this and other great classics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At Long Last","review":"I've been waiting for this title for years on DVD. This is one of my favourite musicals. No Doubt Warners will pull out the stops for this release. If you're never seen this movie buy it now, i guarantee you'll love it.This is Vincentte Minelli's finest hour. Thank you Warners"},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't need color to feel the greatness of this movie","review":"I believe all kids, teens, adults, and everyone in between should see this movie at least once in their lifetime. This movie made you laugh, cry, and rejoice in what's right and wrong. This is one of my favorite movies next to \\"Stormy Wheather\\" You will defintely not be bored with this one! CLASSIC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cabin in the Sky","review":"I love this movie. It's one of my favorites. Ethel Waters and Lena Horne are sensational. Eddie Anderson is appealing and the other cast members, songs, musical numbers, dancing are just great! A real gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Golden Oldie","review":"A great film with humor, seriousness, sadness and joy all in the package. Listen to the music and watch the dancing in the bar scenes...Fred Astaire, I think you've got some serious competition! Too bad Hollywood didn't use more black dancers in the great musicals of that era. Maybe they were afraid? For some reason this movie is no longer available on vhs and was never available on dvd. Someone needs to get it in gear and put this movie back out so people can see what they've been missing. A good dvd version with tons of extras would suit me just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good disc","review":"I have never had a problem with dvd order through amazon. unfortunatly, I hadn't viewed the dvd until recently, and it will not play in any of my players and it's not my players. And I no longer have the receipt for the dvd. I'm at a lost on just what I can do to get a good dvd of this movie without it costing me additional funds. Disappointed in dallas."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISC WILL NOT PLAY","review":"BUYER BEWARE! I purchased the \\"Cabin in the Sky\\" DVD in June. Due to my busy schedule I only just recently tried to view it. It would not play in my brand new high end player nor would it play in my old DVD player or my computer. Zip, zero, nada.I read the reviews (which I should have done before my purchase) and found I am far from alone in this problem. Unfortunately, it's past its return date so I'm stuck with it and can't get a refund --- but at least I can warn others (that would be YOU, fellow Amazon buyer).IF YOU MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS DISC test it immediately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't play","review":"Dvd wouldn't play on ps3 nor computer. Skipped and froze on laptop. Returned for full refund. Should have listened to other reviews about quality but hoped the issues were resolved. Does anyone know where to find quality disc ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"CABIN IN THE SKY","review":"THIS IS AN OLD BLACK AMERICAN CLASSIC MUSICAL ABOUT HEAVEN AND HELL. I ENJOYED THE ACTING AND SETTING OF THIS MUSICAL. ETHEL WATERS IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND LENA HORNE WAS VERY GOOD IN THE ROLE SHE PLAYED. I WAS BORN IN 1953 SO I CAN SOUGHT OF RELATE TO SOME OF THE CHEATING AND SOCIALIZING IN THIS FILM. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE FROM START TO FINISH. MY BROTHER LIKE THIS MOVIE AS WELL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, terrible DVD","review":"Echoing comments that I should have read before I bought this DVD, the movie is great, but the DVD is really poor quality. I had to get a replacement because the first copy wouldn't play; the replacement skips, freezes, the sound goes in and out--and that was the first 10 minutes. If you buy it, beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cabin in the sky","review":"Cabin in the sky is a terrific movie. I really love it, however the quality sucks. The movie keeps getting stuck and it skips alot..I am totally disappointed in Amazon.com for sending me such poor merchandise. I will think twice before ordering from Amazon.com again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"product problem","review":"I love the product but it will only play on my computer. I don't understand why it did not play on dvd player. The movie is excellent I purchase it for my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sure it is a great movie but....","review":"The disc I received was not readable by every dvd bluray player in my house as well as the computers. I will return the dvd and try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"I opened the dvd, put in in the dvd player, and it would not load. I cleaned it, and tried again. I tried it in another dvd player: no dice. I'm guessing something went wrong in manufacturing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible musical talent","review":"Minions of God and the Devil (Kenneth Spencer and Rex Ingram) compete for the soul of an inveterate gambler (Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson) whose long-suffering wife (Ethel Waters) struggles to maintain her faith in the basic goodness of her husband. Fantastic musical talent is on display in this all-black production, but so are the unfortunate black stereotypes of the day, which caused me to shave one star from an otherwise completely entertaining film. The production values and Vincente Minelli's direction are top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cabin In The Sky","review":"So, what do you do when the cable goes out on a stormy night? Pop in the DVD of one of those old movies that has been sitting on your shelf for months, collecting dust and just waiting to be watched. A wonderfully done tale of a man's struggle to get on and stay on the straight and narrow while being tempted into the ways of the wicked and evil. Ethel Waters and Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson are perfectly suited as Petunia and Little Joe, Rex Ingram is great (as always) in the role of Lucifer, Jr. Lena Horne is stunningly beautiful but underused in her role as the temptress Georgia Brown.An all Black cast, interesting dialogue, great performances - a really good film for its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Lena Horne!","review":"All black cast in roles that are befitting for them.Lena shined as Georgia Brown,the lady who leads Rodchester astray. She was the Rita Hayworth of the 1940s!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an historic American Classic finally ported to DVD!","review":"I am so excited about the release of this absolutely AWESOME African American treasure. The cast in this film is legendary, the plot engaging, and the music is intoxicating.I have been saving a VHS copy of this film to transfer to DVD. It's the ONLY VHS movie I've held onto. Every one of my friends that has seen it has wondered why they never heard of it.Ethel Waters' character shows incredible commitment to turning her husband into the man God made him to be. It's one of the first serious Black films to be recorded during its era. This is a departure from the stereotypic minstrel movies of its time.Whether you're Black or Martian-American, this is a GREAT American classic film. Buy this one - it's a wonderful piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRILLIANT FILM Worst Commentary EVER!","review":"Why oh why did Warner ruin such a wonderful, amazing, joyous film by bringing in a commentary by the most nasty, negative, militant, killjoy African American scholar who with every word he uttered, turned the most innocent beautiful little scene from this lovely film into a \\"statement of the white oppression of the black man\\". While the makers of the film spoke of nothing but how it broke boundaries, this guy had to find something negative and disrespectful in EVER nuance. It was the most pathetic excuse for a \\"statement\\" since Warner had Whoopie Goldberg give a justifying commentary on 60 year old Warner and MGM cartoons. Disgraceful and insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"unmemorable","review":"I had to go back for my receipt to see if I had purchased this film. That sums it up for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Seller Sucks!!","review":"I ordered this DVD along with some other items on the same day from different sellers. I never received this item and I contacted the company to let them know. They in turn responded saying that it had been shipped and delivered. I told them that maybe it had been delivered to the wrong address because I never got it. All of the other products I ordered on the same day had been shipped and received in a timely fashion. I have not heard anything from the seller since. I am glad that I did not pay much for this DVD. I will never order from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"look closer.","review":"Why does Petunia talk in AAVE but sing like Judy Garland in perfectly articulated SAE? Why is Petunia scolded when she temporarily breaks from this ridiculous singing to let her voice go into a yell? What does that say about the raw passion of the African American woman's voice? Why does Little Joe have to \\"whitewash\\" his soul? What's with the caricature-like ridiculous smile during the tap-dancing scene? I was too stunned by the blatantly racist and stereotypical script of this film to enjoy it. This is not entertainment--this is a sorry piece of American history."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],N={key:0},W={key:1};function B(a,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(o(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(x,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-dadf43e9"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/37.md","filePath":"people/37.md"}'),M={name:"people/37.md"},P=Object.assign(M,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
