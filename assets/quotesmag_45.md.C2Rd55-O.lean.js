Finally in November, after just 2 1/2 months, her little bottom busted open and her insides came spilling out leaving little beads everywhere. I went ahead and got her a new one because she loves it so much but if this one falls apart, I don't know. If you have a Sesame street fan, I'd buy the Abby Cadabby doll instead.

After stopping, the problem was that the corresponding latch has unlocked. I replaced the supporting arm in the right position, pushed the latch back in place and secured it with a heavy rubber band (blessed He that invented rubber bands). That did the job, but I returned the product to Saris, who provided a new model, the Guardian being discontinued. This new model, the Bike Porter 2, is very poorly designed, cheaply made and unstable, so I returned it also.I think I'll check the other brands.

However, the hero(?), Hack Holland, never seems believable to me. To the extent he is, I utterly dislike him - he's a two-dimensional character who is an alcoholic and a womanizer. That I can take, but what I don't understand is why such a nogood would have the slightest interest in Mexican laborers, other that to get drunk a lot and often have sex with a beautiful Spanish woman.It's as if an untalented writer wrote most of a book and, then, paid James Lee Burke to write the descriptive parts. I'll admit that, according to my Kindle download, I've read only 85% of the book.

Yet, I also felt very hopeful that there are things adults can do to positively effect the lives of adolescents. The book is so informative, yet not pessimistic.

Apparently, this would place me in the minority.Although I think Hersch does some sensationalizing, the warnings are clear: In a society that seems to reward selfish indulgence and the pursuit of material goods, many parents are leaving child-rearing on the back burner.And when these children grow up and are imparted with the responsibility to run our corporations and government, we are all going to be a heap of trouble.Great book.

The author's intent was noble but the end result reads like a first draft,(a very long first draft)a sort of stream of consciousness, in an effort, I would assume, to be authentic and true to the youths' words. I had to keep rereading to figure out who was who. I found the writing very amateur and the profound realizations almost embarassing. These few kids are not an accurate crosssection of our youth society (as other reviewers have pointed out.) At least two of the kids has been physically abused and another has an acute psychiatric condition. I think it is irresponsible to call this journalism, and to present it as such. I probably would have been better reading as a novel.

By her own admission, she is working on another book of similar content and my only caution is not to hire her as a speaker. She has no professional background in this area except to realize what will sell books.

I've played Bananas10 times as much as Skynyrd's latest.It's safe to say this is not Skynyrd's finest hour, but it might be Deep Purple\`s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for Skynyrd","review":"This is by far the poorest Lynyrd Skynyrd cd ever made. Tired cliched lyrics.80's retread riffs and synth fills.A total waste of guitarists.Lynyrd Skynrd has some loyal fans and they deserve better than this.The juvenile lyrics...come on Johnny, your better than that man.And the kid rock track is an insult to the original.I am sorry to say I bought it. Gimme back my bullets...nah! GIMME BACK MY MONEY! If you want real southern rock get Hittin The Note, by the Allman Brothers Band."},{"rating":"1","title":"give it up guys","review":"Boy this CD was obnoxious, Red, White and Blue clearly has 'Skynyrd' sucking up to mindless 'patriotic' rednecks, though Clear Channel's storm troopers played the heck of it. Van Zant simply doesn't measure up to his brother, a very weak and off-key singer. Folks, the soul of that group is gone, rest their souls, and been replaced by opportunistic 4nd string family members whose writing is very poor. Call them what you want, but these clowns shouldn't be allowed to use the Skynryd name, the proud name of a once great southern rock band."},{"rating":"2","title":"SKYNYRD'S BAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCKKK","review":"Johnny Van Zant and the rest of the Crew in Lynyrd Skynyrd are back with their first studio album in 4 years entitled \\"Vicious Cycle.\\" (Last one being \\"Edge of Forever\\" in 1999), and by far one of Skynyrd's best as a whole. Skynyrd shows their full talent on songs such as \\"Crawl,\\" \\"Heaven or Hell,\\" \\"Life's Lessons,\\" and \\"Lucky Man.\\" The tribute to the late bassist of the group, Leon Wilkeson - \\"Mad Hatter\\" is brilliant. This album spans the generations. Hard Rock songs such as \\"That's How I Like It,\\" \\"All Funked Up,\\" \\"Jake,\\" and the \\"Gimme Back My Bullets\\" version are sweet. This album is better than all but \\"The Last Rebel\\" from the new Skynyrd (1987-Current).VERY WORTH GETTING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"After 12 years of seeing Lynyrd Skynyrd reformed and writing new music, it's good to see a stable lineup that just plain gets better and better the longer they're together. This is the best LS album since 1977, beginning to end a surprisingly contemporary and yet traditional sound. Some of the songs would be at home on modern rock radio; others on a country station; and others fit no mold at all. It's nice to to see them support this album on tour in a way no other has been - 2 songs before it came out, three this year. Now if Gary Rossington doesn't manage to kill himself when they go back out the end of August, we'll be in great shape for a long time to come. The update on Gimme Back My Bullets was a nice surprise.. some don't like the Kid Rock take on it, but hell I've been singing it that way in the car for 10 years - I dare say anyone not liking this album is either still stuck in the 1970's, is one of those anti-new-band morons, or otherwise just isn't a true fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lynyrd Skynyrd Still Rocks!!!","review":"If you like Lynyrd Skynyd you love this cd!!

I've been using the older Tae Bo videos for several years now, but this \\"newer\\" workout is a complete waste of my time. It takes 10 minutes before anything meaningful happens, and, like other reviewers stated, there's not enough flow to keep my heart rate up. It's just a ridiculously easy work out. The worst part though is how clearly made up on the spot the routine is. Billy is half way through making up a new exercise when the thunder plays, and he doesn't even hear it at first. He's getting cues that it is time to do cool down, and he's not even ready for it. It's like someone called him unexpectedly and asked him to show up at the studio to jam out a quick 40 minute tape and then go home.

Wells is one of the greatest Americans of all time, and most of us have never heard of her. What she did to better the lives of African-Americans and, especially, to stop lynching, is moving, stirring, and heartbreaking.

Turned the field of science fiction on its ear, awards were flung at the contributors like so much confetti, new voices were heard, some of the best work in any literary genre was produced, etc, etc. The third has never appeared, apparently weighted down by both the audience's and the editor's expectations for something bigger, braver, bolder. Almost thirty years have passed, most of the visions collected for this book are likely to have lost their edge of danger, and still no TLDV. Mr Priest collects enough evidence both of Ellison's mercurial personality and inconsistency regarding this volume to paint a pretty damning portrait. While the story of the nonissuance of TLDV is interesting, I'd rather see the works it is supposed to have contained. Wouldn't that be nice? Hey, Harlan, let 'em go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful Little Book.","review":"Really, I still think that after reading this essay it's a great loss that The Last Dangerous Visions never saw the light of day.

For me, it was validating to read of life through Dr.Michael Stones'eyes, and think,I've seen and thought that myself. I work with Willie and others like him on a daily basis, and I have a new appreciation of these residents, and why I continue to find them so fascinating. I can see myself going to visit Willie to be educated, and I have done this as well as had similar conversations with correctional types.

This is a lightning paced multiple Academy Award winner that is really a timeless movie of both man and politics.Crawford gives the performance of his life portraying Willie Stark, whom everyone assumes is the long ago buried Huey Long, former governor of Louisiana. Enraged by backroom politics that cost him his first election, Stark appeals directly to the people,and never loses another election. In the process, he becomes what future president Truman labeled a law unto himself,someone who has put himself above the law,not an executor of it. The entire cast has sins, albeit McCambridge seems above the fray, calling things as she sees them (and winning an Oscar). If the ending is surprising, remember that politicians like Stark evoke strong, even beastial, feelings from the public. But it's a game that shows no signs of relenting, 59 years after the film's production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willie Stark is more gutsy than Bush or Clinton","review":"Although this film is about corruption and politics, Willie Stark hasmore 'guts' than anybody running today in the year, 2008.And Sadie Burke(Mercedes McCambridge) could blow Hillary Clinton backto Arkansas along with her wimpbag husband, Bill.All said and done, this film is fantastic, better than the novel--too trashy, salty language(who needs it!)Great cast, screenplay and director. John Ireland SHOULD have gottenthe OSCAR for best supporting actor--he could wipe the floor with Sadie and 'Ann'(Joanne Dru)both together. And a young John Derek was very good as the football player brother, Tom.An excellent film.

At the center of it all is B-movie veteran Broderick Crawford, who would never again give the kind of all-or-nothing, powerhouse performance he did here, to the tune of an Oscar.

SHE likes volume three, of course, but to the parents out there brave enough to read such stuff to their kids, get the first two first, because then you can laugh with your kids, too. Great titles, though. They had the same effect on me as the book title \\"A Man Cut in Slices\\" had on Henry Miller in Tropic of Cancer.

How else does one describe a book where the writer frequently marvels at his comparative wealth to those around him, seems to get upset when the locals are not overwhelmed by his being white and being amongst them, etc? The text reads like an Arabian Nightmare with the odd interlude where something dramatic happens - such as the author taking part in the torture and slaughter of a black cat so that he can get a charm he hopes/believes/doubts (yes, all at the same time) will make him invisible - it never goes anywhere and paints the locals as clueless children.

Still, it left much to be desired in the way of real advancement or meaningful discussion about the existence of God and belief. The panel of \\"experts\\" are far from expert in their comments, which are more random and opinionated, rather than meaningful or insightful. As a student of philosophy of religion, there is no more frustrating thing than to see an opportunity for fruitful discussion get wasted by people who don't have a clue about what they're discussing. Perhaps a panel of honest thinkers, instead of talking heads, would make for a more interesting program in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"smarter than the average fare","review":"Bill Hicks, who died at the age of 32, was easily one of the most aware individuals of his generation. Seeing right through the self-constructed veneers of hype involved in politics, religion, social issues, and most interestingly drugs, Bill pushed the boundaries of the maxim that \\"it's funny because it's true\\". Likely to offend everyone at some point, the degree to which you appreciate him is probably the degree to which you are honest with yourself about the world. This is him at his most raw, and yet his intelligence shines through. I consider him as much a priest as a comedian. As with so many shooting stars, we can only wonder what material we are deprived of due to his early demise. If you like this one, also try \\"Arizona Bay\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth be told!","review":"Bill Hicks talked straight and with much humor and honesty.

Bill and his squeegied third eye's insights are not friendly to the mainstream media, to say the least.Bottom Line: If Seinfeld clones just don't do anything for you, get this album.

This is not for children or those with tender sensibilities. Bill's take on Limbaugh, for example, is a dark musing on the latter's probable sexual problems, featuring speculation as likely true as it is disgusting.

This is the album Hicks did when he knew he was dying (he died of cancer on 2/26/94), and it sounds like he decided to hold NOTHING back because of that. The bits about Jay Leno, Rush Limbaugh and David Koresch are COMPLETELY over the top. I've never heard an album that pushed the envelope as far as Rant In E-Minor.

Although he had become popular in the UK, he was a little too \\"out there\\" for our networks and media bigwigs to know what to do with. Here me now and believe me later: Bill Hicks was the greatest comic mind of our generation. A true comedian's comedian. He saw the stupidity of our society, the ignorance of our ways, and wove a tapestry of anger, cyniscism and hilarity that was simply too funny and too true to be put in a neat little marketable package. You doubt me??? buy this CD, and then buy Arizona Bay. Bill Hicks would be a household name today if cancer hadn't taken him out. What a loss.

I mounted a Dewalt 12\\" sliding compound saw on it. It's very easy to set up, stores upright when it's closed (though it's a little wobbly), but very importantly, when it's in the open position, the wheels are down. So, by just lifting the other end a little, you can move it around if you need to without taking it back down. My only complaint would be that if I have to cut framing members, or deck boards, the support isn't enough to hold up the wings, and they sag. If you adjust them up, and then slide the stock over for another cut, they spring back up and you have to adjust them again. Maybe this stand was built only for light mouldings like baseboard, casings or crown. It works great for those. I still highly recommend this stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overall Stand!","review":"I like this stand better than others I've used just due to the fact of the ladder design which catches the wood when you cut it. The stand is a bit heavy compared with others but the big pneumatic wheels help quite a bit with that. Also the ability to move it around on the job site by yourself is quite handy. I just use it with the saw sitting on it, I do keep some small Bessey clamps on it to clamp the tool down if you prefer. Works great with my planer as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"See before you buy","review":"I didn't and ordered directly from amazon.com ...

The Jewish people once they follow Kaplan's prescription and make of their religious life a ' tradition' only, lose a dimension of meaning not easily gained elsewhere.. Is it surprising then that what we have today in the Jewish world is so so much assimilation on the one hand, and a growth in a more narrow kind of Haredi Judaism?Kaplan was a prolific, and in certain ways heroic figure.But his ideas and his whole view - of - the -world did not bring about true Jewish renewal.

Yet what is missing is strength in character and acting by the cast, and an exciting storyline to support them. I was really disappointed that the \\"spark didn't jump\\" - the movie leaves the impression that the script was written by a civil servant, that the director was an accountant, and that the actors were postmen (not that I hold any grudge against these honorable professions - just as a matter of speech).So: good to gain some insights in the attack (also the Japanese viewpoint) - but poor in excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"not 'chick lit' -- that's for sure","review":"A great book that sneaks up on you over time. The relatively slow beginning is a wonderful evocation of the rural south and of the healing power of music and nature. However, violence is not that easy to tame. As someone who grew up after the Vietnam War (born 1969), I've often wondered why so many veterans ended up training in some form of martial arts. This book goes a long way towards explaining that need. The violence from the war bleeds through the lives of the vets in this novel as both a liberating and a destructive force; they can't shake it and they aren't sure if they really want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful piece of work","review":"Someone gave me this book 14 years ago, and I just got around to reading it because there was nothing else on my bookshelf that I hadn't read. I'm glad I picked it up! The book deals with music and violence and family, and the prose itself is musical at times.

More bewildering is the music. Performers like Joe Frank have used incidental music extremely well as a backdrop to their monologues, while those like Babs Gonzales, the Beat poets and Frank Zappa have brought music into their storytelling. ARIZONA BAY's sonic wallpaper and scene shift music could have been worse than the sincere, smooth-jazz strummings. But once it's on this music stays on. Not only does it run uninterrupted for too long, it persists (loudly) over the next comedy routine. If it's intended to counterpoint Hicks's acid wit, its effect is to drown the humor out.

Comedians are harmless guys who tell jokes and roguishly poke fun at our oh-so-silly human foibles. Ah me! This was not Hicks. Hicks was a very serious and fiercely intelligent social critic and moralist who just happened to be extremely damn funny at the same time. He told the hardest of hard truths and was totally uncompromising. All his CDs are brilliant, but I have to dock this one a notch for the frequent musical interludes,which I find obtrusive and distracting. They do the same thing on Rant In E Minor, where it gets really ridiculous, music rising between practically every sentence out of Hicks's mouth, sometimes obscuring his voice for a while. If they wanted to release some of Bill's music, they should have added it on at the end in the form of bonus tracks or devoted a separate CD to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another true talent dead before his time","review":"Why do we have to lose the most talented comedians to untimely death.

Were it not for the dodgy killah-robot, it could be a really nice piece of cyberpunk cinema. With a few more character monologues and a storyline that covered something a bit more existential, this could have been a great movie. Thankfully we have the soundtrack to evoke some of the better images and a nice - unobtrusive - mixing of samples from the film. Out of nearly 25 tracks there is only one dodgy one, which spookily enough is the 'ATTACK OF THE KILLAH-ROBOT'. Its not called that, but you know the type, lots of crashing discordant keyboard chords while a deranged midget hammers scrap metal in the background! The rest of the album is pure poetry though. If you like your 'light' in hues of sodium yellow, and your air to taste of industrial effluent, then HARDWARE by Simon Boswell is the soundtrack for you.

In fact, there is no way for the editors to know what version I have. Indeed, it is the very same version currently available from Amazon (521 pages, 1989). This seems like a mistake that ought to be corrected, or it is a dishonest way to disclaim my criticism. I would challenge others to refute my claims.

Thornton even dares to draw moral lessons for our own times from the thoughts and actions of the Greeks. The viciousness and malice of the Kirkus review presented above shows just how badly we academics need authors with Thornton's combination of courage and erudition.

The paper tray holds about 4 sheets at a time (okay, maybe I'm exaggerating....20 sheets). And the worst? The paper jams every third time you print, wasting time, paper, and ink. And now, for some reason, it won't load a sheet properly, so everything I print comes out lop-sided (and the sheet is bent on one side).

For draft quality stuff, who cares, but note: YOU CANNOT PRINT A HIGH QUALITY DOCUMENT! Even on the best settings, there is sporadic bleeding. Not all inkjets are like this: the Canon and HP inkjets I had before did not do this, except at the end of one or two years. And sure, they had other problems.

I have not used other printers so, I cannot compare.

At $13 each color and $24 for black, that's $60 every 3 months. Print frequently, and those little cartridges won't last a month.

After reading the other reviews and finding out this is not an isolated case (but rather common) I'm not only fustrated with my printer but angry at Epson and certainly not buying from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nozzle Clogging Piece of Frustrating Hardware!!!","review":"I have owned 3 Epson C86 printers. They worked great for about a month and did produce outstanding color results. The problem is that the print heads get clogged very easily. The heads are incredibly small in order to spray very fine droplets of pigment, but when those same tiny heads get clogged, you get ugly lines through your masterpiece. Epson's cure: run a head cleaning ritual where you waste large amounts of ink, as the process (usually in vain) attempts to clean the heads.After returning the printer for lousy performance, I bought the Canon Pixma 4200 and have had no problems. The Canon has never been plagued with clogged print heads, and it produces superb color printouts.Don't waste your money on the Epson printer. It will drive you nuts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Let Down","review":"I like many others have had more than one of these printers. The first one was replaced by Epson for the usual head clog-won't print one of the colors issue. The first one also did not print straight, texted was shewed on the paper, didn't pull the paper through straight. I was hoping the second one would be better, so far no head clogs, no missing colors but prints just as crooked as the first. Nothing is stuck in the path, both have done this right out of the box.

Initially it worked fine.I did the nozzle check recently, it barely printed a trace. After installing all new cartridges (Epson and expensive) and at least 10, maybe 15 cleanings, it just prints a trace of cyan and a trace of magenta, no black and no yellow.

Forums have told me that Epson isn't interested in fixing the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful printer!","review":"I print out maybe 10 pages a month and in the year or so that I've owned this printer, I've already changed the printer cartridge twice. Since cartridges are expensive it's not worth my while to continue using this printer. It also has this awful habit of printing out every other line when the ink cartridge is running low.

Oddly, though, after turning it off for a couple of days, I turned it on and an apparent miracle had occurred. It started working again. Well that bought me several more months, but a few days ago, it went down for the count. The software told its usual lie about nearly empty ink cartridges. Hoping for another \\"miracle\\", I bought a fresh round of ink, and that turned it into a boat anchor: nothing but blank pages, except for the occasional wisp of cyan. Bottom line, this was a really good printer while it lasted, got good reviews back in December '04 when I bought it. I've noticed most of the bad reviews are from 2006. Lesson learned. Don't buy another Epson. My previous printer was a Canon BJC 4550 that lasted over 6 years, and still worked fairly well when I gave it away.

Tech support advised to clean the heads--no help. I think I've tried that procedure about 100 times so far, to no avail. After spending about 200 bucks in ink packages, the only color that prints is blue. Nothing else. Do not waste the money on this.

I was more interested in the self-proclaimed \\"most horrifying movie\\" and how it was supposed to be so scary. However, the movie is not scary but yes it is horrifying due to its story. It tries to develop the plot where one can pay an incredible amount of cash to fulfill their hack and slash animal side at the expense (and pain) of tourists. Yes we all know that humans can be utterly merciless but there are more dramatic ways of reflecting this on the screen. Unless you cringe at the sight of blood or faint at envisioning someone slicing a piece of achilles tendon, then maybe this movie will frighten you.

I thoroughly enjoyed the plot but I feel the end ruined the movie. The plot keeps you interested to get to the end. There's plenty of female nudity and blood for all the guys out there. I prefer a movie with some kind of depth to it, not pointless slaughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Doesn't Cut It","review":"I love horror movies and books and this movie did not cut it. I felt like the movie was a joke. It was not scary to me and it seemed ridiculous. The premise is a club where you pay to hunt, torture and kill people. It is just slice and dice \`em with the bare bones of a plot with some sex and violence thrown in. It should appeal to teenage boys, but I am not sure who else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sold out theater i was in gave a standing ovation when the credits rolled.","review":"I dont care what the haters say, This is good film making.I purposefully avoided all media related to hostel till I was able to catch it in theaters(on opening day.) It made it an absolutely amazing experience. The sold out theater i was in gave a standing ovation when the credits rolled.Avoiding this movie is like avoiding sex, sure you can do it, but you're a worse person for doing so.Again, like its sequel, the video and audio quality on the blu disc is amazing. And the directors ending is very much different than the original ending. Disc contains both versions of the movie (Unrated cut, and Directors cut.) If you're a fan of the film, pick this disc up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur-ish","review":"Just a warning - bad acting, terrible pacing, dreadful script. This is a train wreck of a movie. The incompetence shown by the entire cast, crew, and producers is the only truly horrifying thing here. And there really should be consequences to contributing such a pile of dung to existence. By the time you understand why everything is happening, there is little chance you care. Yes, there are some gory parts, but it is scary? NO! Something has to be believable to be scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"waaaay overrated","review":"The way I see it: If you're going to make movie like this, either go all the way with it or don't bother. While there are a couple of scenes that are no doubt twisted and brutal, the overall tone of the movie seems pretty confused. The basic premise has lots of potential to thoroughly disturb, if pulled off well. Alas, this movie struck me as a cop-out. It has no business trying to be campy or crowd-pleasing. The tone of this movie is all over the place and rarely dark enough to evoke any real dread (excepting the torture scenes of course). There's no build. No suspense. No characters to care about. Bad dialogue. It's the WB on bad acid."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie could have been condensed to one hour and still be long and drawn out","review":"hostle is the kind of movie that make you think,about how many stippers that it would take to make this slow and drawn out movie worth watching. the entire movie could have been condensed into an episode of tales from the crypt and still it would have drawn on id recommend the devils rejects or i spit on your grave if you want a good horror\\\\explotation movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Scarey","review":"Ok I'm a very big Horror movie fan,Saw, Saw 2, Texas chainsaw ect....This wasn't scarey, it was slightly gross... in places.

I mean yes you get to know the characters and feel for them but how bad can you feel for guys going to hook up with girls to just have sex? HAHAOverall it was worth watching. I wouldn't buy it though. Wait for cable.It did also have a twist at the end... it should have been talked about a few minutes more.And the end there is a justified action. Which was a nice ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully bad - though it could have been really good","review":"THIS MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERSThis movie was three parts:1. Some young American guys and their zany friend being stereotypical horrible and rude tourists just trying to hook up - 40 minutes.2. The time spent in this cool, torture 'hostel' - 10 minutes.3. A getaway/chase scene - 30 minutes.Not only was the only cool part only 10 minutes, but they barely touched on why these people do this. The only hint that they gave towards one character is because he is a closeted [...]. It was just ridiculous.

I didn't even finish it. Not only is it just porn, it's disgusting after that. I can't imagine how this is entertaining.This movie just reminds me of why I don't get into horror and gore flicks. I can take a scary movie, but this is just gross. I'm all for men getting what they deserve for being the randy pigs they can be, but this is just too much.

WELL YOU HAVE TO SEE.THE SAME WOMAN JUMPS IN FRONT OF A TRAIN BECAUSE HER FACED WAS MESSED UP. WHAT IS THAT?MOVIE DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT THE END!!!WHAT IS WITH THE KIDS?

So, I picked up a copy of Hostel on DVD. The first half of the movie, in my opinion, was boring as hell. The first half consisted of talking, sex, talking, sex, talking...did I mention sex? If I wanted to see so much sex I'd watch a porno flick. I like horror movies that start right away, and have gore throughout. This movie seriously lacked the action through the first hour of the movie. On a more positive note, the last 35 minutes of the movie caught my attention. So, my advice: Skip to chapter 18 on the DVD and watch the last half. There are chopped off body parts, an eye popped out, and blood everywhere. If you're like me and love gore, you'll probably find the first hour of this movie a big bore, but will be entertained by the last half hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangers on a Train MEETS The Texas Chainsaw Massacre","review":"Now, I knew not what to expect when I purchased this film, but being a fan of horror, I decided to give it a go. At first I was disappointed to find that it was written by the creator of \\"Cabin Fever\\"--a film that I wish I could erase from my movie-going memory. But \\"Hostel\\" tries to break all the rules and it delivers in that regard. I would only recommend it to DIE hard fans of the genre, especially if you have a penchant for gore. This movie has wall to wall blood and guts. It even evokes some Hitchcockian elements with Americans loosed in a Slovakian country where the characters surrounding them are not on the level. At times, the film is so gratuitous with both sex and violence, that you almost roll your eyes at how unbelievable it is. Yet, the reasons for why the gore occurs is a probable (and profitable) theme that could happen in reality. That's what makes the movie all the more terrifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the critics need to RELAX!!!!!!!!!","review":"If all the \\"movie critics\\" out there could just relax and watch a movie without picking apart every single detail, they might come away from this movie asking - Oh my God!

After seeing it I told myself I wouldn't see another Eli Roth movie. Then Hostil comes out and QT is affiliated with it, and it gets all this hype. So I went against my better judgement and rented it. Thank god I didn't waste 10 bucks at the theater. This movie is better than C.F. but it still pretty much sucks. I thought there was only one shocking scene, and that's the scene with the \\"eye\\". The rest of the movie is just stupid. Like it was made for teenagers and it probably was. I mean half the movie is for us to get to know these college students. 45 min. into the movie I couldn't wait for these kids to die! Was that his intent or were we supposed to feel sorry for them? I thought it was a very good idea! Too bad it was Roths'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my stomach sick!","review":"I rented this movie and when I watched it... it made my stomach sick!

A 2nd time director, he benefited from increased budgeting. The plot is described elsewhere, but basically people are kidnapped in East Europe, and tortured for entertainment. Sexy vixens lured them with sex, and they are then kidnapped. The 'vixens' are the most interesting perhaps, as most of the tourists are too bland to register.A must miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately a guy movie!","review":"Girls, if you want to see a bunch of annoying ugly guys with bad hair styles keep talking about how they want to have sex with girls, then this is the perfect movie for all of you. I have never seen so many nude girls in one movie before in my life. This movie should have been rated x! I heard that director QT was responsible for this movie. Wow, he must be one talentless director! This movie has all the trash that someone with no taste in movies would love. It has a homosexual scene, and lots and lots totally nude ugly girls prancing around like bunch of dumb girls. I wonder what their parents would think about how their proud girls have grown to be come."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there was a 0 star...","review":"This movie had absolutely no plot and is the only movie that has ever left me feeling suckered at the end. I went to see it with three friends and we were all visibly angry at the end. We agreed that it was most regretful that we spent our time and money on this bloody, grotesque, carelessly put together film. I welcome sex and gore in movies, but when that's ALL there is and the plot is sacrificed mercilessly, the viewer is left lost and at the end, most angry.WARNING: let this be one you never see or pay money for. Trust me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this a horror film?!!!","review":"After reading a few 5 star reviews before submitting this, as I honestly didn't think there would be any, I just had to give my 2 cents. Just to let you know, the first 40 or so minutes of this film is straight porn. When watching a horror film, I expect to see more... well horror. The idea of the film is actually interesting and it could have been a good horror film, but with the delay of the plot due to pointless nudity, the film lost my interest fast. Because of waste of half the film there was not enough time to spend on the actual point of the film. I can only imagine that the unrated version is just more nudity. If you want a soft porn mixed with some gruesome death, then go ahead, but if you want a true horror film, definitely look ELSEWHERE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a huge dissappointment","review":"This movie has stereotypical characters, a weak plot, and basically uses the names attached to it to get any kind of attention.

I have no want to see this. i would give it a 0 if i could. Disturbing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This movie is nothing short of brilliant. Eli Roth is amazing and talented. Quentin Terrintino and he are a great match for an amazing horror movie. The story takes place in Amerstam where a group of guys are vacationing. What happens to them is just plain FRIGHTENING. Jay Hernandez is great as the main character who is trying to escape the torture. One of the worst scenes was when Jay Hernandez's character has to cut out an Asian girl's eye. And believe me, it shows everything. This film shows everything and doesn't cut things. I know the film shows so much torture, but you can't help but to watch it with your mouth wide open in shock. This has to be one of the scariest movies to come out in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half porno half gore fest","review":"This movie is good but not the best.

To say that it's not for the faint hearted is putting it mildly I'm not sure who could watch this and actually enjoy it. It oversteps the bounds of a normal horror flick by a country mile and lands in territory normally reserved for people with severe Psychiatric disorders. The film fails to concentrate on any form of a story and loses itself in as many ways to mutilate a person as possible. You will certainly feel like taking a shower after watching this and probably never consider travelling to eastern Europe again. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Sadism, not Horror","review":"Don't assume that this film has any of the hallmark \\"so bloody that its funny,\\" Tarantino action, even though his name is plastered on the front of it in large letters. I love a good horror film but this movie is strickly about sadism, not horror. It begins with three very immature young men seeking sex and finding a lot of women with huge mammaries. It ends with graphic scenes of torture leading to equally graphic scenes of bloody revenge. There is so much blood and suffering in this film that you can almost smell it and no great suspense to the plot other than which part of the body will be drilled or lacerated next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"This is as far from \\"one of the best or perhaps the best thrillers of all time\\" as you can get. Wanna see a really great, suspenseful thriller? Try David Lynch's Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive. This isn't it. It's extremely typical, geared towards gore hungry audiences while not really being extremely gory. The best part of the entire movie were the girls (I'll admit, that alone may be worth the ticket price), but don't expect anything extremely original here. This is basically Saw (which was much better) with a location change and more people involved in making it happen. Long story short, a rental at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"good gosh its a frickin movie quick whinin","review":"jeez you people make me laugh.

A film for the ages. Sadly, this is not one of them. This is a film shot on a shoestring budget with no name actors and whose only purpose is to shock the audiance with \\"See, look how much gore I can put on the screen...and get away with it\\". This is quite simply a movie reflecting the basest of attitudes by some movie producers and directors. The fact that Quentin Tarrentino is somehow treated as a wonderful contributer to cutting edge movies doesn't speak well for those who actually buy tickets to see this drivel. Fortunately, I paid only a small rental fee and was still upset that I even paid that. If you really want to see gore, join the military and ask for duty in Iraq.

This is a shameful display of sheer stupidity and scatological retardation, the only \\"art\\" that Roth apparently can produce.What angers me more is how celebrated this piece of vile trash of a film is by all your mental midgets out there, cheering on the violence with glee, and perhaps in so doing inspire some to follow through it. Perhaps such violence will befall you or a love one. If that day shall come, think back on this film that you so delighted in and see if you cheer then for violence.This film is an affront to all that is worthy of life and a paramastabatory mindless act of deficating in public and then celebrating it with joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUCKED","review":"This movie was by far the worst movie I've EVER seen.

It's a surgical instrument used primarily for clipping sterile towels to one another when you're draping a prepped patient for an operation.Figure half a dozen of 'em in the average abdominal procedure tray sent up from central supply. The circulating nurse can always spill a couple more on the Mayo stand if you drop one on the floor, honest.Yeah, a towel clamp can be used as a tenaculum to grab soft tissue, sure. But that's because the pincer-like design enables you to bite into skin or muscle or fascia with *less* damage than a regular hemostat or Kocher clamp might impose by virtue of crush injury.They're actually a \\"kinder, gentler\\" way to grab the patient's flesh and hold it so that you can put the puzzle back together with a minimum of necrosis or scarring later.Sorry to kill the buzz."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Impressed After Buying","review":"When I first saw Hostel in the theatre, I was a bit taken back that it seemed more like soft core porn than a horror movie.

In addition, I walked out angry as well, my girlfriend seemed to be ammused while I felt it was a waste of my money, time, and my mood. There really wasnt a plot; just sex and gore. So much so that it seemed like it was an appeal to sex/gore fans to make money on low budget. Im not going to go on further.. It was entertaining at a minimum, therefore I gave it 1 star (and not 0)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time...and more","review":"I'm sad that Tarantino would be associated with something like this - I think it is beneath his caliber as a filmmaker. I will be hard pressed to trust him again, if at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad","review":"I had heard that this movie was 'smart' with all these 'deep political overtones' so I said to myself: great, I've enoyed the recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Saw series, this will probally be like that.But no, no my friends I was wrong. The movie has no discernable plot untill halfway through when you come to realize everyone is on setting these guys up to be tortured and killed. Why? becasue of they are Americans.Seriously, all that happens is the guys get messed up, get laid and get killed with (of course) the one guy surviving and taking revenge on the perps.Come on people, this is not brilliant, its lame, boring and gruesome to make up for a mighty thin plot. Thinner than the laughable pre-teen muggers in the film!Avoid unless you want to see extremely nasty scenes of torture for no appartant reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take all the bad reviews seriously! This was the worst!","review":"As mentioned in so many other reviews, why didn't I rent before buying! Should have taken it as a clue when Blockbuster had only 2 rows of the movie that it wasn't worth the time. Interestingly enough, the nudity, while ample, wasn't even that well done. And in the context of a horror movie, well, we tossed it in the trash (literally) after seeing it the first time. $20 down the tube. I wouldn't subject my worst enemy to this flick as it is probably against the Geneva Convention. I would wait to see this movie until it hits the dollar racks (which shouldn't take more than a week or two)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly","review":"I really enjoyed Cabin Fever, which is partially what made Hostel such a letdown. Hostel is a movie that revels in pure sadism. It's not the first movie to do that sort of thing, but it does so in a way that is gratuitous and rather pointless, as though the writers and producers had lost interest in the plot and were trying to one-up each other to see who could come up with the grossest torture and nastiest injuries. Atmosphere is not a problem in the movie, but the gore-for-the-sake-of-gore element that drives the movie renders it unfulfilling as a viewing experience. The ending is also somewhat silly. Overall, a ghastly movie full of rather grotesque tortures that really don't aim towards any greater contextual purpose except to show off the crew's vivid imaginations. The film is not for those lacking strong constitutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Doesnt get mush better\\"","review":"Well after seeing the movie i just new i had to get the soundtrack.

The amount of weight the TS-501 sawhorses can handle is surely impressive, but the folding style legs leave an uneasy feeling with any substantial weight load. The legs never seem to open well all the way. The legs have a potential to fold with any shift of the weight. An accident like this occurred with me. I had set a significant amount of deck boards on the saw horses for the weekend and when I had returned the legs had buckled to the side, the boards were scattered and the opposite legs had broken through the manufactures stop. Fortunately nothing below was damamged and the boards remained in tact, but my saw horses are useless now."},{"rating":"1","title":"widow makers","review":"The idea for the product seemed good. They are the only tool in my truck that I hate to use. The legs do not stay folded up unless you use two hands( one for carrying, the other for holding the legs in). I have used mine for over one year and the main bolts need to be tightened almost every time. The amount that I have used them on the stairs, like the photo shows, is never. The feet are to small and they sink in any kind of ground other than asphalt or concrete. The small metal angle that holds the legs perpendicular to the top, allows the legs to wabble, they are not sturdy at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative!","review":"I love this book. It's very insightful and gives a well-rounded historical view of Rastafari. I felt a sense of overstanding of what Rasta elders went through. Naturally, I highly recommend it as an excellent resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dread History","review":"For someone like myself, who knows a little about Rasta, and would like to know more this is a great starting point.Douglas Mack really was there, on both missions to Africa, and at Sellasie's visit to Jamaica.The intro is a little long, and covers in brief everything that is covered in more detail in the book itself.In many caes it is more interesting to read between the lines to guess what DM isn't saying. Especially on the second visit to Africa when you get the distinct feeling that the Rasta's weren't that welcome in some countries.Also the relationship with the other delegates on the missions seem strained at times.It's a shame DM doesn't include the history of the wearing of dreadlocks, and some more events after the sixties.All in all a good starting point in Dread history, well written, and well worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"scattered thoughts...","review":"I think a better and more thorough discussion of the rastafarian movement is The Rastafarians by Sr., Leonard E.

I found the characters sad, the setting sad, the story line sad, and the plot extremely slow moving. The book seemed to be all about sadness and struggle, and, yes, after a certain point I skipped through to the end. Writing a \\"serious historical novel\\" does not mean everything in it has to be so serious. Thank goodness this was free on Kindle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a mystery","review":"I am a fan of the Golden Age mysteries and regularly read Edmund Crispin, Patricia Wentworth, Agatha Christie, Georgette Heyer, Dorothy Sayers, Gladys Mitchell and Rex Stout. I came upon this book thinking it was a mystery, but it is not. If you enjoyed \\"The Case Against Elinor Norton\\" you'll like this book. I found it failing in the same way- just too dated for me to read about a helpless female and how shes being destroyed by perceived or real relationships outside of marriage with men. For those who prefer a traditional cozy mystery, \\"The Yellow Room\\" is a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midwest's Best Kept Secret","review":"This album is a oft overlooked rare treasure that belongs in ANYONE'S cd collection.

Robert Lockwood Jr. knew Robert Johnson and it shows. He covers no less than seven Johnson compositions including a previously unknown song \\"Mr. Downchild\\".

This Cuban salsero is in form and this cd complements the previous two. In this one he repeats the formula that has lead him to success, which is blending contemporary salsa with a touch of Cuban son. No surprises here this is typical Miles Pena salsa- not too fast but upbeat enough to enjoy. This cd is great for listening and surely would appeal to the most diverse salsa tastes. A recommended cd if you are a Miles Pena aficionado."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think its about India and China mostly","review":"I didn't find this book particularly helpful in terms of investing. I think most people know that India and China have become more capatilistic, in a purely relative sense, and that they will be needing to build roads, indoor plumbing, etc. Coxe seems to be a genius in his other writings and has a weekly conference available on line.

Still, I don't recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful core theme- Doesn't need a full book though","review":"Interesting book. Basic premise is that the folks that spread the word about mass market products are not movie stars or early adopters, but folks who are socially and politically active in their communities. Think den mothers, PTA members, folks in the Lions Club, the local city council etc. The notion connects to the concepts outlined in \\"Tipping Point\\" about Connectors, Mavens and Salespeople, although the framing is different and in this case Influentials appear to be part Connector, part Maven and part Salespeople.In any case, it's a valuable insight which is probably relevant across cultures and countries. You don't need to read the whole book but it's worth reading a few chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but pricey","review":"My wife and I both use and it we like it, but it's pricey.

I have naturally wiry hair and the organic shampoo actually accentuated the frizz! Ummm... Can you tell I'm bitter about buying expensive organic stuff that didn't work??I only gave it 4 stars because it does contain Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which is bad for your hair and can cause cancer (blah blah blah).

From the up tempo Die, Die, Die (which was the first song I heard them play live) to the heart felt Weight of Lies.

The packaging looks fantastic and the records are even pressed on heavyweight vinyl. Unfortunately, that all changed after I dropped the needle on the first track.All throughout the album there is excess sibilance, an overemphasis of the 'S' sound, which utterly destroys both Scot and Seth's vocal performances. It is so bad even the piano is mucked up! Ramseur Records really botched this pressing and it is ridiculous nobody caught this before it hit the market for $30 a piece. Seriously, if you're going to issue a quality release, make sure it sounds acceptable first.

I use it in my small cabinet shop to crosscut prefinished panels and doors. Bought it for the 30\\" crosscut ability. Saw is very accurate and is adjusted to have zero play in column and turret index stops. Industrial machine with power to spare. All parts are accurately machined and ground.It is the third Radial arm saw I have owned, from Craftsman 10\\", to Delta 2hp 12\\". Found both prior to be underpowered and lacked large crosscut ability. I do not rip on this saw. One positive thing with this saw verses my past saws is that electromagnet brake works very well, stopping large blade in 5-10 seconds - much faster than others.One negative is that long turret is in the way of your shoulder so it forces you to stand on one side or other of machine while in use. Also if on left side hard to hit power button. Won't be without this saw in my shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silver Screen Shower Scene!","review":"Don't be fooled by my 4 star rating here; the first and last tracks are worth the price of the CD alone, though everything in between...Just sounds like cheap electroclash.By that virtue, I must say my fav tracks (the aforementioned first and last) hardly sound like the rest of the album - which doesn't ever seem to want to shine... the songs are just kinda there.Nevertheless, if only for track 1 and 8, I do greatly enjoy this remix album.If you haven't heard the original album whence this CD came (Kitenz and Thee Glitz by Felix Da Housecat), I recomend that as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the opera aria at the climax of film Anthony Adverse.","review":"This is a real disapointment as I was anxious to purchase the CD afterwatching the film on TV.

I love books in which ordinary, everyday kids get thrown into fantasy worlds or sci-fi worlds or whatever, and this was book made it onto my Top Five Best list. : )I think the best thing were all of the amazing characters. I'm the kind of person who tends to enjoy character-driven novels slightly more than plot-driven ones, so I always keep a close eye on characters. Everything about the characters in \\"The Door Within\\" were great--the names, the personalities...everything. It fit perfectly with the genre of the novel.I found recurring themes of loyalty and courage throughout the book, which I appreciated.

I'm an adult who reads a lot, both for myself and to my children, so initially I thought that my age skewed my opionion here, but when my kids agreed I felt justified in giving this book a low rating.Anyway I was shocked to dislike the book as much as I did. 51 reviews and it still held a five star rating on Amazon. How could the book possibly be bad? The writing was overly simplistic (even for a childs book), the charaters where dull and far to emotional, and the Christian allegory was way overblown. Don't get me wrong here, I have nothing against Christianity, I'm one myself, but it's placement in this book took away from any orginality that the author potentially had and made the book come across as an obnoxious Sunday school lesson taught by a teacher whom nobody can really stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great!","review":"This book was a great book. Anyone who likes fantasy would like The Door Within.

Young Aidan Thomas, the main character, is about to enter high school when he discovers three mysterious scrolls in his basement. They beckon him to another world of knights, dragons, and war, and he finds himself wrapped up in a dangerous mission: to save the kingdom of Mithegard from the evil clutches of Paragory.The book is filled with action, mystery, and peril, and I found it impossible to put down. Christians will love the clear allegory and good Biblical messages, and any reader will enjoy the nail-biting, page-turning suspense that keeps you up late at night; waiting to find out what happens next. This was the first fantasy book I ever read, and after reading The Door Within I became a huge fan of the genre.

She is using a lot of words to say nothing. Just like Terry McMillian's How Stella Got Her Groove Back, this book is allowing us to get into Tamara's inner thoughts. Some of her thoughts need not be heard. They are somewhat useless to me. I checked this book out from the library a little over 3 weeks ago and I'm only half way through it. It's just plain boring to me. It is going to take me another 3 weeks to finish it. I was reading other reviews about her other books. I am going to try and give this sister the benefit of the doubt and try to read her other books. If you really want to read good mystery written by an African American women then you should read books written by Eleanor Taylor-Bland, now she's an excellent mystery writer.

I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read!","review":"This is the second Tamara Hayle mystery that Ive read and I can't wait for the third. However, I must admit that this one was a bit more difficult to follow than her first novel.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed the book and cannot wait to see what becomes of Tamara's relationship with Basil!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique prose will keep you turning the pages","review":"Tamara Hayle is an ex-cop PI on vacation in Jamaica when she meets three people who invite her out for drinks.

This is obviously music suffused with the spirit of the big, American city. The production on this CD is also absolutely amazing.But - and it's a big but - infuriatingly, the best piece from the film is not on the CD. I'm referring to the incredible music from the title sequence. It's reprised to some extent on Track 14 but it's no substitute.

I was fortunate enough to see Bill perform numerous times and knew him personally and I still sad that this comic genius left us so soon. A genius work by the best comedy talent of the past 20 years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Hicks: Another Dead Hero","review":"I really can't quite describe how funny Bill Hicks is. He is not a comedian in the Jerry Seinfeld/Tim Allen vein. He has IDEAS. Most comics talk about their parents and husbands or wives. Bill Hicks talked about his ideas, his perspective. He was crude and obscene to be sure, but he was also smart and perceptive. This CD is a good place to start if you have never heard of Hicks. Smoking, The War in Drugs, Modern Bummer, and Burning Issues are arguably the pick of the litter. I Love My Job gets a bit rough, but that was the point. It's a shame that Denis Leary appropriated some of Hicks' best bits and got famous. This CD is worth getting, the only drawback is once you get it you are going to want to buy Arizona Bay, Relentless, and Rant in E-Minor. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerous Mind","review":"This is Bill Hicks's first comedy album. While it outshines most other comedy albums, it is dwarved by Bill's later work. In this, he seems to be going for the easy laughs, while later on he revelled in making audiences think and squirm. Still, it's amazingly insightful and fearless, especially his thoughts on the flag-burning issue. And you can take his material on vacuuous rock stars like Debbie Gibson and Rick Astley and apply it almost any musical act on the Top 40 charts today. The beginning of the legacy of a legend. Definitely not for people who think Adam Sandler is funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writer","review":"I am shocked to find that so many people gushed over this book. The narrative was boring, cloying and drippy. There were some interesting new things as far as hauntings go, like the cat's strange behavior and the water incident. I really have no sympathy for a family that is too stupid to look into the history of the house sooner. I mean, it was ten years of torture before they even decided to get any kind of help at all. The main problem with the writing was how repetitive it was. I did not need to hear the details of the same \\"suffocating dream\\" all 75 times it happened. And the dialogue was far too detailed to be real recollections. No good and not scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grave's End should End","review":"Easy reading, but this book would have been much more believeable if the author wasn't so repetitious. She talked about the same things over and over again. I would have believed this story if the author wouldn't have stayed in the situation for so long and making excuses for staying in the house.I also found it hard to believe that she allowed herself and her family to endure such an unnerving lifestyle. Then again, if she couldn't stand up to her daughters (they insisted on living in that house) and her tenants (allowing them to stay for 1 1/2 years in her home while she remained in a cramped apartment) I could understand the personality. The book suggested that the author was a very weak personality and allowed herself to be used by her husband, daughters, tenants, and finally the entities that were in her home."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"So-so were the only words I could come up with for this book. While the content of the actual haunting was intriguing, the book was both written and edited poorly. I can't count how many times she repeated she felt ashamed about the haunting. While that may have been true, it didn't need repeated in just about every chapter. The main thing that bothered me though, was that fact that she wrote about being so scared, terrified even. However, upon getting help, 10 years into her situation, she was reluctant to have her privacy invaded and was non-believing in what she was being told by the investigators. Plus, her family was upset that the house was cleansed. That was just weird to me, after years of disturbances, you wouldn't want the spirits to pass on? Ones that have been in agony for almost 200 hundred years of being earth-bound? Seemed kind of wishy-washy to me. I've read a lot better by new writers.Grave's End"},{"rating":"1","title":"a definite letdown...","review":"i kept taking into consideration that this book was the author's 1st....and if the rest of them are like this one-i hope it's the last...some of the story was fine to read-what she saw, and experienced...but through out the whole book..she kept saying the same thing over and over,,sometimes-not even with different words...i found this book very boring...-easy to put down...and difficult to pick back up again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Certain to fascinate beyond new age readers","review":"Elaine Mercado's Grave's End is certain to fascinate beyond new age readers: it provides a true ghost story of the author's personal encounter with a Brooklyn haunted house.

Fascinating reading on paranormal experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like this book","review":"From the beginning, I believed that this was a true story. My problem is with the author, Elaine and how she handled this entire issue of living in a haunted house. She denied, she put her daughters in danger, she remained a skeptic til the end.Usually I can get into the story and allow it to be what it is. However, I found myself thinking to Elaine. What is your problem. Get some help. 10 years later, she finally acknowledges there is something wrong and seeks paranormal assistance.It's the kind of story that I found myself saying over and over again, \\"I would not put that child in that room.\\" \\"I would have done this so differently.\\" \\"I would have given up my skepticism a long time ago and done something.\\"so ending this book was difficult because I voewed to finish it, and doing so made me resist picking up my Kindle.

Left thinking that either: 1) It was pure fiction or, 2) If it were a true story, no one can be that ignorantly defiant. After all of these episodes - years and years worth - you don't move because of potential financial implications. And this is with children involved?Same stories over and over.

It's not particularly scary, and the author seems to spend as much time talking about her bad marriage (basically saying the same thing over and over) and her worries about her daughter sleeping downstairs. Badly in need of an editor, because the author has no sense of pacing whatsoever. Read fifty pages and you've read the whole thing, because the same stuff gets rehashed over and over.

This is truly a must read! I was amazed at how frightened I was during the duration of reading this book.

Not only does it give you the view of what it is like to go through such a haunting, it is filled with little tid bits of information! I have learned a lot of things that I didn't know before reading this book. This is one of those educational books, that you read without realizing you are learning! You feel as though you are reading just a scary (I mean Scary) ghost story. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chills!","review":"This is an excellent book.

Were we reading the same book? Better question...were these same reviewers even literate? I was absolutely enthralled; not to mention chilled by Elaine Mercado's story. Though I am enormously captivated by the various divisions of the paranormal, I've rarely come across a book that struck me as 100% authentic. More like campy, over-the-top and Hollywood scripted. One reviewer mentioned that it was 'boring', compared to some of the other books out there on the subject. Hmmm...could that be because there's a difference between fact and fantasy fiction? Having had several experiences with negative and/or inexplicable energies in my lifetime, I believe in the authenticity of this family's story beyond a shadow of a doubt. My only advice? Don't read it at 3 a.m. You'll have difficulty sleeping even with the lights on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literature's End!","review":"If you are looking to be scared -- this book does provide some creepy moments, but the repetitive, seemingly endless mantra of \\"let's ignore the obvious in every way\\" theme only serves to annoy the reader into not wanting to know or care what happens in the end. Granted, the author states in the beginning that she is a nurse, not a writer, but where was her editor? The truth of Ms. Mercado's ongoing haunting is frightening, but the book itself should be buried."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you heard the interview on Coast to Coast AM . . .","review":"don't bother reading this book.

I was very surprised by how well-written it is and by the fact that it reads like a fiction novel. My prior attempts at \\"true hauntings\\" just didn't hit the mark and were often dry. If you're looking for a good ghost story or tale of a haunted house that will keep you up at night, with the light on, this is it. Highly recommended for those seeking case studies and reference material on the paranormal, and even more so for those looking for a good scare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Tale of A True Haunting","review":"Elaine Mercado did an excellent job telling her story. At no point did the paranormal occurances she described seem over-the-top. I've read many books on \\"true hauntings\\", some of which have struck me as ridiculous. Not the case with Elaine's book. I found it very believable. I can't say that the story frightened me or \\"creeped me out\\". It didn't. However, it was a very interesting read and I became thoroughly absorbed in her tale. More than anything, Ms. Mercado's story focuses on the stress a family may suffer while living with a haunting -- the embarassment and shame that often comes along with letting the outside world know. I found Ms. Mercado all the more credible because she didn't seem to buy into everything she was told by the medium who offered her assistance. All in all, this was an excellent book. I'd definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best book on the subject","review":"I have an interest in haunted houses, so I read as many \\"true\\" accounts as I can get my hands on. I constantly check amazon for recent publications on the subject. Most of what I read is trash; either it strikes me as completely made-up, or the poor writing detracts from the story, or both. **Elaine Mercado's book is the BEST I've read on the subject of hauntings. Elaine Mercado is a very intelligent, scientific (she is a a nurse), grounded person. At first took the hauntings with a grain of salt, as any of us would. But as the haunting intensified, she had to accept it for what it was, i.e., a supernatural occurence. **This book is beautifully written. The narrator is so grounded in reality that it makes these other-worldly occurences seem all the more creepy. I highly recommend this book. It is definitely the best of its genre. I have read it many times. I wish I could read it again for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I am very interested in the paranormal based on numerous experiances that I have had in my life, i have been searching for a book that would really scare me...

I say SKIP IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep Paralysis?","review":"I'm confused as to why the author puts so much emphasis on the sleep paralysis episodes. It's a perfectly normal condition, and she claims to be aware of this fact, but she still goes on to attribute it to paranormal acitivty. She implies that the episodes got worse due to the haunting, including a smothering sensation, a sense of an evil presence, and a sense of overwhelming terror, but these are still CLASSIC symptoms of sleep parlaysis. From Scientific American: \\"The reason sleep paralysis may explain tales of ghosts and aliens is the strong sense of a presence, usually harmful, that victims commonly feel during an attack.\\"Also, people tend to experience sleep paralysis episodes more frequently due to stress, so all it demonstrates is that the author was stressed out during this time, not that it was actually caused by ghosts (as she would like her readers to believe)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author loves to be the victim/martyr","review":"This was a terribly repetitive book, as others have stated.Oh, I was so, so, so, so, so scared, but I guess I will wait for someone to rescue me.Oh, my relationship with my husband was so, so, so, so, so bad.Oh, I like my job so, so, so, so, so much.Basically, she sits around waiting over a decade for someone else (finally, her brother stepped up) to find some sort of resolution. Meanwhile, she takes the bedroom where no one has been held down and suffocated in their sleep, while her daughter continues to \\"deal\\" with it. I began to dislike the author as a person, not only as an author.Giving this book a so-so rating would be so, so generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for an amateur writer","review":"After reading this book, I realize you can't trust Amazon.com reviewers all of the time! The author isn't a writer and saysso. But she should have had a professional editor. The book has some creepy moments, but they are isolated. There is no sustained suspense. Unless you are familiar with Brooklyn, you don't even know that she lives in the Gravesend neighborhood until you are two-thirds of the way into the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant","review":"I feel as though this almost 200 page book could have easily been half the size if the author didn't repeat herself a million times. We get that your marriage was bad, that you were cold in your old apartment, etc. Instead of the \\"filler\\" material just tell the story.Admittedly, I have only finished about 25% of the story. I keep reading it hoping something will happen but so far it just keeps repeating itself. I don't know if I will finish this one.At least it was a free book so I didn't lose out on anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grave's End: A True Ghost Story","review":"This was a very well written and informative book about an actual experience with ghosts. I thoroughly enjoyed how the book was organized and presented. My only question would be why didn't the author seek qualified assistance to deal with her ghosts sooner? I don't think I could have lived in this situation that long without seeking help. Especially since the entire family was affected. This is a book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary and Rational..","review":"Scary. Rational, and completely believable.... From someone who has also experienced things that can't be so easily explained. I can understand the authors reluctance to believe what is happening, and the reluctance to talk about it, and take some steps to dealing with it..... I had the good fortune to walk away from what was happening, but I will never forget it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book to share","review":"Grave's End: A True Ghost Story was a riveting tale. It speaks of true to life experiences with something that is not what is thought of as common occurrence and have no idea as to the cause of the happenings. It shows how easy it would be to wonder about one's mental health. A great read for all who like ghost stories and also a training reference if you are into paranormal pursuits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh....its okay","review":"There are definitively some creepy things going on in the house, but the story is not written very suspensefully. A good quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, but what took so long?","review":"I would recommend this book, but the question I kept asking myself is what took so long for this woman to ask for help? After the first few incident's I would have been out the door with my kid's no matter what my husband thought.I found it somewhat unbelievable that it would take over five years of terror to get paranormal investigator's into the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written for a 'true life' ghost story","review":"Compared to most written ghost story this tells the entire story, by this I mean it doesn't just tell the 'ghost' story. Very believable, I read it late one night until daylight then finished it the next day after a very long work day. In fact I just finished it not more than 30 min ago. It does, in a way, explain why people act the way they do in poorly made horror movies. Script writers I think read true stories like this and try to put all of it into an hour and a half, leaving the audience to ponder 'why didn't they just leave?'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grave\`s End","review":"This was a fun read. It was well written,and has some real spooky moments in it. A lot of these type stories are very hard to believe, but this one wasn't. I also saw this story some months ago on the syfy channels Paranormal Witness. The book is much better then the shows version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok","review":"Pretty good for a freebie. I don't know if I would read it again or share. Interesting just slow at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read !!","review":"It is very rare when a person can honestly say after reading a book, \\"Not one page was boring.\\" I felt the author was truthful and the book was very well written. This one is worth keeping for your library. I easily give it 5 stars !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believable","review":"Very good read. I am convinced this family went through a haunting. Two things that made me question at first were 1. I had a hard time understanding how she could stay in this house for so long (which she explains in the book) 2. She is such a good writer it makes me wonder if that is why it is so believable. In the end I was convinced this is a based on a true account. Either way this is a good read, especially if you are convinced its real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it on one night.","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. The haunting this family delt with was amazing. I was realy disterbed by the old lady nightmare the writter experienced. I would discribe it but I don't was to ruin the book. A great book for dark and lonly nights."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read it in one sitting","review":"Grave's End is much better than your average \\"true\\" haunted house story. The supernatural experiences of Elaine Mercado, her family and friends are both frightening and fascinating. If you enjoy a well written ghost story, this one will keep you reading well into the wee hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Ghost Story Should Make Your Heart Skip a Beat, Not Put You to Sleep","review":"OK I have to say this is the dullest and most confusing ghost story I have ever read. Not only does it create no sense of fear in the reader but the author doesn't convey a sense that she is truly afraid. There is no sense of menace and more a sense that this is a change in her boring life. The writing is flat out terrible. There is no real story being told here other than the author's life living in what she believes is a haunted house. I can't help but notice the more involved she becomes in paranormal research the more she believes her house is haunted. Cause and effect I believe.Don't waste your time here it is a dull book with no real story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like I expected!","review":"I have to say that I was very unimpressed with this book. First of all, what kind of mother allows some unseen force to terrorize her children for 12 years before she attempts to do anything about it? I felt nothing but sadness for all the horror and problems that this family went through. How terrible it must have been. However, I felt nothing but anger with every page that I turned in this book. I waited and waited for her to do something about it. Well she did......12 years later. I'm sorry but that is completely ridiculous!!!! And even afterwards, she doubted the origin of the happenings. When will people realize that ghost exist? We all need to believe what we see with our own eyes and not what our faith tells us!!! SEEING IS BELIEVING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Readers should be outraged by price!!","review":"I can't believe the publisher wants $10 for this book. I read this book last year and it was SO bad it wasn't even funny!! I called it a cross between ghost story meets a severely dysfunctional family and I don't know which was scarier, the ghosts or the family.This book is a classic example of a discussion we have had in multiple groups I belong to in regards to excellent books garnering less than $5 and garbage like this getting $10. Do like I did, save yourself the $10 or grab a couple of good books with it and get this one from the library.Here is my Goodreads review:I am not sure what is goofier in this book. The story of this woman's dysfunctional marriage or the story of the haunting. It is like 2 books in one. I was going to purchase this book...thank God for my library. It saved me $10!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly written and repetitious","review":"This book is so terrible I don't know where to begin... there is so much to comment on. First, the woman who wrote the book repeats the same things over and over again - I struggled to keep interested but since I paid for the book I made myself keep reading. Second, she comes across as unbelievably stupid - I can't believe she stayed in a house that was terrorizing her and her daughters for 10+ years. If what she claims was happening truly was happening, letting it go on that long borders on child abuse. Third, why was her family \\"upset\\" that she finally after 10+ years had the house \\"cleaned\\"? Makes no sense, and makes me wonder if maybe she is suffering from a mental illness and was having hallucinations all along... Please save your money - I am astounded so many people gave this book a decent review, it doesn't deserve one."},{"rating":"1","title":"faulty handle pins","review":"Assembly was easy but the spring-loaded anchoring pins that pop into the holes in the sleeves of the handle support were faulty. This is a dangerous flaw as the security of the handle in maneuvering the saw is essential. I have to attempt to file the inside \\"chads\\"(!) of the holes to allow the pins to more fully penetrate the hole and be secure. Otherwise seems fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not review battery since I never got the correct one. Twice!!!","review":"Very upset!!Wrong Battery sent Twice. I was sent a Dell Battery nstead of a Toshiba Battery twice.Finally decided to get a battery on ebay."},{"rating":"2","title":"You think they are all the same....","review":"But they aren't. This was my required reading. I doubled up and purchased two others just in case. I found that I liked this one the best and just wasted my money on the other two. This book is very well organized and since all of the content to review for the NREMT is the same, that's what it is all about.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning tool","review":"This was the textbook for my EMT-B class, and I found it was very informative + easy to read. My instructor complained that the chapters were a bit out of order, as to understand something completely in, say, chapter five, you'd have to have read chapter ten or fifteen first, for example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Workbook","review":"I used this workbook in conjuction with the Emergency Care Book, to prepare for the state registry EMT-B test, and the NREMT-B test. This is a MUST have if you are using the Emergency Care Book. Questions are nearly identical in wording and phrasing to the NREMT-B exam, and the inclusion of practice homework problems add even more preparation oppertunities. DO NOT BUY THE EMERGENCY CARE BOOK, WITHOUT THIS WORKBOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PortaMax Jr, turns portable tabel saw into contractor's saw","review":"Adding the PortaMax Jr to your 8-1/4\\" or 10\\" Bench-top table saw gives you an accurate saw with a precise rip fence, equal to many higher priced Table Saws. Allow ripping a full 4X8 sheet of plywood lengthwise. This accesory is easy to install and Rousseau provides prompt replies to any questions that arise during installation.Table fits Delta, Makita and most other portable contractor's saws and allows you to make precise cuts using the strong, secure fence. I have used this accessory with my Delta 8-1/4\\" saw for cabinet making, and general woodworking.The table is strong and is easily adjusted to remain level with the saw table. I am very satisfied and now I have a versatile table saw tha is nearly as accurate as rigs costing more than the saw and PortaMax combined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doubles the value and usefulness of your portable saw!","review":"I bought this table extension and fence for my Makita 10\\" portable table saw. The Makita came with a terrible fence that was almost always off-center and inaccurate. Even worse, the table was so small, you could only make cuts up to 12\\" wide. This table extension makes the saw able to rip full size sheet goods (the long way) and the fence makes the Makita a decently accurate saw to work with. So far I've used this combination for making speaker cabinets and homebrew arcade controls cabinets and it has exceeded my expectations. Rousseau has built a very high quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes the saw even more worthwhile","review":"I have a 9 year old version of the stand to go with my Makita saw - and both are going strong after endless projects, including large, hardwood furniture pieces. The stand is what makes this setup worthwhile: more accurate, safer to use and capable of cutting full size ply sheets. The only downside is that it is a bit clumsy to fold up. Every manufacturer should offer a base extension like this. Buy one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for my little girl!","review":"I ordered this toy for my 9 month old girl based on previous positive reviews and I was pleasantly surprised at how much we both enjoyed it. In just a few days, she learned how to use the mallet to beat on the drum.Construction of the drum is very solid. It is well made and I like the story behind Plan Toys.I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a child over 9 months, even though the age suggestion is 19 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"my one-year old likes it","review":"I got this as a gift for my one year old. She really likes it. She's not quite the target age range, but she still enjoys beating on it.I was nervous because one reviewer mentioned it breaking soon buying it, but it seems quite durable to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd prefer better sounds","review":"My son loves anything to do with drums, but he really isn't into this toy. I think he'd like it better if it came with two drumsticks instead of only one. Also, I find it interesting that the drum is cut to make three different tones, but the choice of tones is off-putting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music without plastic or batteries","review":"I bought this toy as a Christmas gift for my kids with the intention of introducing them to music outside of the electronic, battery-operated guitars and drums in brightly colored plastic tones. The sound is great. The look is great. It's a toy I don't mind having laying around. Of course the drum stick was lost soon after purchase. But anything, including hands, make some noise on this and serves the purpose of learning rhythm or making music."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!!","review":"I use this drum with developmentally delayed children between the ages of 2-5. They love it and it's durable. Great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be fantastic, if modified","review":"When you look at the design, you will see the center is more \\"cut out\\" than the rest. While this is necessary to allow for different sounds, this center piece of wood needs to be thicker. My 2 yr old Grandson broke that piece after playing with it for about an hour or so. {It was broken by being hit with the drumstick} The toy had to be thrown out. there was no repairing it as the break was sharp and dangerous.While it does help the child create many different sound & again, all that is needed is to make that one piece of wood thicker. It is a good toy for musical education otherwise. But the \\"Otherwise\\" is a biggie! I'll be writing to the manufacturer about this as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Drum - and 'Green' Too!","review":"I was looking for rhythm instruments for my nephews - ages 2 and 4.This drum was exactly what I was looking for. The sound is not too hard on Mom and Dad's ears, which is always a part of toy decision criteria. I loved that the company that makes it is 'Green' - there are many environmental bonuses of buying toys from this company. The most critical to me as an Aunt was that the materials that this item were made from were eco-friendly and non-toxic to the kiddos (as they tend to put everything in their mouth etc). For more information on this company's practices, go to their website: [...]It was a well received gift and the kids play with it often!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made and fun for kids","review":"A \\"tongue drum\\" with 3 tones.

The drum is lovely, wooden with nice paint and a well made stick. She is still a little young for it (Plan Toys says 18 mos is ideal for this toy), but she loves making beats already. The sound is pleasant, so even a child's erratic beating is not annoying. I am so glad she has this and imagine we will enjoy playing with it for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful sound","review":"I wanted some natural toys without chemicals for my childcare infants and toddlers. This not only satisfies our music and rhythm urges, but has a great tone also. Actually 3 different tones depending on which section you tap. I'll likely keep the mallet up until it's time for us to use it together since I know they'll put it in their mouths still. With the natural materials used, there was a small crack in the side where the wood bends. Doesn't affect the drum at this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little drum","review":"got this toy for my nephew. his counselors at school mentioned he is not doing well with following sound patterns (which will ultimately help him with understanding syllabols). i got him one drum, and his older brother another. i had his brother play a sound on the drum (like 4 taps in a row) and have the little guy repeat that. it worked for him with up to 3 taps and then he gets confused. so he needs work, but i think the drums are a fun way to get him there. the sound they make are not annoyingly loud either. so they can both play with them and not bother me to much, which is a plus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Lacking in Value!","review":"Although my youngest son wanted this action figure really bad;The price never approaches the value for what received.The figure is extremely small; and probably cost, at most, $[...] dollars elsewhere in actual stores other than Amazon.The base price was $[...] approximately. $[...] something with shipping via Amazon.I thought that the figure would be much larger or more robust than it actually was.This will be the last time that I purchase an item such as this via Internet or Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"As an artist trying to maintain my versitility, I found this book to be extremely helpful!

I see now that he really can sing, BUT why won't he showcase that??!!! Songs like \\"How Could U\\" & \\"Nikes Fresh Out The Box\\" keep you listening but by the end of the Cd you're left highly dissapointed. The lyrics in songs like \\"Like Me Real Hard\\" are ridiculous! If some dude said that to me I'd probably smack him. What is \\"I'm not sayin that you should rush and give me your heart. I'm just asking that you like me real hard..just like me real hard\\" Take a writing class Mario, pleazzz! In the entrance of the song I catch myself saying this seems like a nice song but when he starts sayin like me real hard I just say \\"SKIP\\" Directions is the same way. The lyrics are mediocre & Stupid! I hope in his 3rd Album he finds himself and comes w/ more songs like how could u!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have expected more","review":"Frankly, I generally don't buy much music anymore for various reasons. However, when I saw Mario's album in the store, I gave it a quick listening-through and simply purchased it spur of the moment because I really liked \\"Let me love you\\" and because the other songs didn't seem to sound abysmally bad. Unfortunately, after listening to the album for several times, I had to discover that other than \\"let me love you,\\" there really weren't any other songs on the album that I liked. I find myself skipping song after song until I end up at track 2 yet again. Of course, music taste is truly subjective but I still would think that there should be at least one other song on an album that is worth listening to. This album falls very short of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mario's Turning Point","review":"The reason I brought \\"Turning Point\\" was on the strength of the first single. Which is \\"Let Me Love You\\". But, I must say this song did not need a remix. This song has longevity and is able to stand on it's own.

It's a varitey of great songs by a wonderful voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Ninja Can SANG","review":"Despite the random and unneccessary profanity on this project, the overall feel was hot. The production is smashing. Vocally, Mario is killin' it. The CD jumps off with \\"18\\". Mario puts it out there on this track. Cats, including the ones on this site AND abroad, keep saying that dude is imitating Usher. I have to admit that he has that same vibe to his voice, but guy has the potential of surpassing what Usher's brought to the table. Bump imitation. As it was said in the opening track, he's 18 now. He's got 7 years to catch up. If Mario is rocking it like this NOW, there's no telling where he'll end up in 7. Mario is mos' DEF giving Mr. Raymond a run for ALL his money. Mad props on skill.PS: I wanna hear this cat do a gospel joint."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"aight\\" album","review":"I thought the album was \\"aight\\" because it could have been better but I gave it four stars because Mario's cool layed back voice made me like it even if the beat wasn't that tight.Here's the top two I liked1.Let me love you- It was so smooth and he song the mess out of that song.2.Boom- That beat was raw man!So the album was aight but I definately recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"average&Basically Usher lite,but better vocals","review":"Mario has made a change Image wise&also is pushing a few more slow cuts,but on a whole a formula at duplicating what Usher has done seems to be on the drawing boards throughout this set.

Mario did put some effort into his other songs but they were disappointing.I hope the he does better on his next cd. This also taught me a lesson to always listen to a cd before I buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My niece said it was horrible","review":"I bought this CD for my 12 year old niece thinking that she would enjoy it, and she said that it sucked big time. She said that the only good tracks were song #5 and his single that have out now. Now I haven't heard this album myself because I really don't think Mario can sing personally.

I am a huge Mario fan but I really think he took a step backwards on this album. I liked the first album 100 times better. He barely uses his beautiful voice on this one. He doesn't try to show his range or hit any notes. I think he tried too hard to be hip hop or something cuz there is like 2 ballads. I don't know what it is.

The author hates didactism, yet she does not explain things enough and give enough definitions. She spends the majority of the book quoting children's books as fluff to create a big book. Organized poorly. I only read it because it was required for my class I was taking. The book did nothing but give me a headache and put me to sleep. I cannot see how it has made it to print, let alone being the eighth edition. Very boring book that does nothing to encourage the reader to love children's literature. The author does not even have a full glossary or index. Many terms and definitions are in the chapters, but no in the glossary or index. The book is not worth the money spent for it. Waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to have it for my class","review":"This is not a book that I would buy to read just because I wanted to.

But these events chronicled on two DVD's are much more than the typical releases...or matches.The talent may appear in character, but they toss the soap opera-styled scripts aside for these special events, while reminding fans at home of the sacrifices from the men and women in the military. The matches are from the 2003 and 2004 tours, along with bonus material that includes tour highlights from the WWE program, Confidential.The performers include Undertaker, Hardcore Holly, Kurt Angle, Eddie Guerrero, John Cena and Big Show, along with several of the WWE Divas.

In subsequent years, I went on to take degrees related to the subject matter, to write a PhD on the Bab and his movement, and to write many books and articles on the topic. Others have done some academic work on the subject as well. Sears was a TV presenter who knew next to nothing about Babism, took everything from a well-known Baha'i history of limited value, and wrote an entertaining tale that is aimed at converting readers to Baha'ism.

Nuevamente, los detalles de los articulos a la venta, dejan muchisimo que desear y a menudo se apartan notablemente de toda semejanza con la realidad. Inconciencia de los vendedores o simple haraganeria?

He is straightforward, spare, uses very few metaphors. He is an absolute master of measure, using the sound of the words and the pauses in between to create beautiful, haunting verse. It is difficult to be cerebral while reading his work, the poetry never explains or describe but is made to be experienced as a bodily phenomenon. It engages a quieter, deeper more subtle appreciation challenging for a modern readership used to instant gratifications."},{"rating":"1","title":"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH","review":"Like i said.....AHHHHHHHHHHH.

That wasn't up to much, and neither is this 'official' release. This medley/megamix focuses on the Spice Girls' main hits, but recorded in 'club' style which is the first negative point of many. This new style makes the once familiar songs almost unrecognisable, and you're left wondering if these really are Spice Girls' songs. The mixing is okay, I guess, but nothing special to praise. You'll enjoy this CD single if you collect weird, alternative mixes of well-known songs. But don't buy it thinking it's a bona-fide Spice Girls release.Jon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read aloud but audio is terrible","review":"This book was a great read. true to the traditional tale but the audio actually reads words that are not there and punctuation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trip-Trap Perfection","review":"I love the story of the billy goats Gruff; a memory from my childhood when my father read to me every evening after supper while my mother cleaned up the kitchen.

I thought the novel was going to focus on that geographical area. But once the protagonists find one another and fall in love in the first chapter or two, the remaining hundreds of pages are about their angst. Scotland is not mentioned again. Not that it has to be, but why get the reader's expectations up with the initial setting. The characters also seemed stilted to me, with no gradual change that one likes to see as a book progresses. The mother, for instance, remained critical and aloof, the father invisible. Sorry, I can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"I also found this planer for a very good price, and 24 inch capicty is useful, and a great time saver because it allows you to plane 2 or more boards at once.

But these time are gone, even though the music is left. It would be even worse to continue along the Kula lines for a new band of Crispian Mills, since \\"The Jeevas\\" is a totally new sound, a totally different philosophy. It's more old type of rock'n'roll, something if you took out the tablas from \\"Mystical Machine Gun\\".

In an irreverent, and sometimes humorous style, he describes the institutional Church's departure from the real message of the New Testament. He also charges that contemporary Christians have distorted their religious beliefs for the sake of convenience and pursuit of the \\"good life\\". Feeling blessed, the prosperous, nominal Christian ignores the plight of the very kind of people Jesus befriended and championed.Rensaw's book is an enlightening interpretation of Jesus' purpose on earth. He invites the reader to take another look at Jesus of the gospels, and to re-examine their own religious beliefs and practices.This book is destined to prick the conscience of many claiming to be followers of Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Cockburn's Best","review":"Charity of Night presents one of the most coherent pieces in Cockburn's long, respected career. The CD continues in the vein of his more recent, eclectic musical efforts, but the tracks work together to create a collage that finds its focal point in the title track. Musically, there are few weak links here; lyrically, this CD is Cockburn's most poetically satisfying in years. There is an appealing, hard-edged intensity to many of the songs (especially \\"Strange Waters\\" and \\"Get Up, Jonah\\") that is often tempered by works that sooth troubled waters (\\"Pacing the Cage\\" and \\"Charity of Night\\"). The CD serves as an appropriate introduction to Cockburn and, to his long-time devotees, as a satisfying complication of his work. If you feel that modern life too often lacks substance, then Cockburn's art may be an antidote: the well-crafted, masterfully played music of an authentic self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Album by Bruce!","review":"We recently saw Bruce Cockburn in concert and he sang \\"Strange Waters\\" from this album which I had never heard. \\"Live on My Mind\\" is also gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Charity of Light","review":"I write this as antidote to my review of \\"Anytime, Anyplace...\\", which is full of much noisy racket. But this album is a beauty, the charity rather of light.This is where you may find one the nuggets of gold, hopefully, of the work of core Bruce Cockburn. Except for his narrations, and some overproduction, there are some of the finest and most elegant songs written in folk-rock-pop-world music today. Though the album is from the late nineties, I hope we hear more such musical and lyrical gems from this quixotic artist. Listen also to his early acoustic albums and his masterpiece \\"Speechless\\" guitar music album, to find the sensitive artist behind the politico hype image of later times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best band of the nineties!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Everclear came along and spoke to a generation, they were not the first and hopefully wont be the last, but their music means a lot to me and this cd is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is a great CD that contains all of their hits.

With regular use knives with blunt ends like cleavers bend and break the rods making it impossible to get the knives back. And very sharp knives DO cut right thru the rods leaving shortened rods that bend and turn the middle of the rods into a birds nest. The block looks like a cool invention but it doesn't work yet. I wasted $40 bucks on the stainless steel model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great at first, not so great after a while","review":"I bought this at a brick and mortar. It worked great for a while and, as others have said, it's nice because you can fit all shapes and sizes of knives. After a bit, however, the \\"rods\\" start to compact and it makes inserting anything next to impossible. This leaves the blade exposed which is dangerous when you're trying to grab other knives. I've removed everything and cleaned it, but there is no way to straighten the rods.Other issues, stainless is low-grade, but it's what you get for $50. Rubber feet on the bottom keep popping out if you move the block around. Knives sit at a fairly high angle, so if you plan on putting it under any standard-height cabinets, you will be moving it in and out a lot, reinserting the rubber feet often.I think I'm being pretty generous with two stars for this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete waste of money","review":"don't waste your money on this book - it's filled with drivel and fluff. thankfully it was given to me as a gift so it wasn't my money down the toilet. if you're looking for books on your spiritual journey, try slyvia browne's lessons for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your #1 Marketing Strategy","review":"Almost everyone in business will acknowledge that the best way to gain new business is through referrals.

And that new idea for this book is -- don't ever argue with your customer! Use their objections to how you are failing them as an opportunity to do better by them.

While it may not rank as a classic of American literature it is a good read. The characters are engaging and believable, from the grumbling and tenacious Parker Noble, the frequently frustrated Stan and the seemingly \\"dittzie\\" Buffy Coyle, who in the end is nobodies fool. The character work together well to weave a genuine American detective novel complete with a suprise ending, numerous \\"red herrings\\", and a generous dose of legal information from the author/attorney. After finishing the book I was left wanting to read more of these characters. I do hope Manno writes a few sequels. This is an eclectic three-some that begs for more cases, but maybe with the addition of yet another character; Parkers intreped pooch \\"Buckwheat Bob\\", the wonder dog (Bassethound). My only criticism to the author would be...\\"don't leave us hanging. Give us some more!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Parker the prosecutor","review":"Mike Manno has a way of putting it to you.

Check out Damon & Naomi's modern-day wankfests for evidence (and bring me back some Romilar as a souvenir ... zzzz ... ). Aside from serving some sentimental purpose for the G500 folks now moping through middle age, ain't much this CD, documenting the band's final European performance, has to offer. Like most live recordings, the bass is mixed too high, the guitars too low in some sort of a jagged murk, the vocals from some cave north of Omsk. And those voices - yeesh, and this is when Wareham's forlorn whininess actually sounded most at home. On \\"When Will You Come Home,\\" though, it sounds as if he's been hanging out in the kitchen with the Swedish Chef and a puppeteer has a hand up his rear.

I really think Bob could use a little Prozac though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll Over and Die","review":"There's 1 good song on this CD: Roll Over and Die. The remainder lacks the intensity I expect from Mould. I admit to being spoiled, having watched the post-Workbook tour in Santa Cruz in 1990/91.

Plus, the cover art is pretty nifty. But it's by no means an essential part of Mould's oeuvre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"For me, Bob Mould is right up there with Lennon, Westerberg, and Dylan as fas as songwriters go. But he missed the mark on this one. Musically it's uninspired, despite a few flashes of brilliance (\\"The Next Time That You Leave,\\" \\"I Hate Alternative Rock\\"), but lyrically it's fairly clever still. This sounds like an album he could have written and recorded in a week.Production-wise, it's a step backward from his earlier efforts. He's not good at producing himself. More often than not, the drums get lost, the guitar's too far out front and the vocal is self-consciously buried in the mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimo soundtrack de Bernard Herrmann","review":"Bernard Herrmann fue un de los más grandes compositores del s.

He enjoyed the challenge of being able to best his own time AND he more enjoyed whopping up on the rest of use. The kid is super fast. The timing device is easy to use and is placed in front of you at the base of the mat. It makes it easy to start/stop the timer.

Norman Pausen tries to use Yogananda's name to give his own teaching some clout. Why he would even refer to himself as a direct disciple of Yogananda and yet change Kriya with his own innovations is beyond me. Loyalty and having a Guru like Yogananda are an essential part of the Kriya Yoga path. Norman Paulsen has said in his advertisements that this his own technique is the \\"complete kriya yoga\\".

These two weapons I feel, helped usher in the era of modern war fare along with the Gatling gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Needed support","review":"I purchased this item from Amazon back in Oct.2004. Used it on a project that required 2 full sheets of 4x8 3/4inch birch plywood that had to be ripped and cross cut to many different sizes. I have to say that the Rousseau 8400 came in very handy. The support itself has 2 tightening tee handles to allow inner tube to slide up or down for desired heigth. The support legs can also fold upwards by removing a wing nut and a bolt on each leg. This allows me to stow away the 8400 in a corner when not in use. I am very satisfied with this Roussea free standing support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is He Serious?","review":"I know he won a Grammy for this album, but man, you should have heard him when he wasn't playing elevator music. This album is pure truck-stop lounge-lizard snoozarama. Dave may be an exceptional song writer, but the boy CAN'T SING! Although if you think about it, neither can Bob Dylan, but the cirtics love him no matter what lands on the vinyl. Don't get me wrong, Dave Alvin's music has inspired many great musicians whom everyone's heard of. Unfortunately, I believe ALvin's name recognition has now surpassed his actual talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"time stands still","review":"Some other reviewers' comments had made me hesitate, but I'm glad I took the plunge and have been playing this pretty constantly. We fans of Dave Alvin love his songwriting and, personally, I have no problem with his voice. That the songs here are timeworn (but not trail weary) is of no consequence. He inhabits the material with ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Alvin puts his private touch on Public Domain","review":"Fans of Dave Alvin will not be disappointed, and those who don't know his work should rush to pick this up. American Music king Dave Alvin, formerly of The Blasters (with his brother Phil singing lead), X, and The Knitters, digs into the back of his record bin for this collection of some of his favorite songs that obviously shape his songwriting. It's easy to imagine young Dave, gleefully hearing these tunes for the first time, just as I found myself gleefully listening to his versions. Dave Alvin proves himself a great interpreter with this collection, adding one more title to his Singer/Songwriter/Historian moniker.P.S. If you haven't yet caught him live, get to the club next time he is in your town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dave!","review":"I have dug Dave Alvin for years from his work with the Blasters to his solo and production work on Katy Moffat and others .But truthfully this one misses the boat!Sorry Dave your stories are told better by you when you penn them than by you singing classics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Alvin's trip through Americana","review":"This is Dave Alvin's album of cover songs - but instead of doing the usual suspects, he did us all a favor and did songs that are true American folk songs and have entered the public domain - hence the title.On the first song, \\"Shenandoah,\\" Dave shows that his singing ability has really grown since his first album.There's a nice range of material here - and some really good songs I had never heard before. I like Dave's songwriting so much that my main gripe is that there are no songs of his own on here - but that wasn't the purpose of the album, so it isn't really a fair complaint.Dave is a great performer, and the tour he did supporting this album was really good. He's a good singer, a great songwriter, a hot guitarist, and comes across great onstage, dynamic yet humble."},{"rating":"2","title":"wm425, workmate","review":"This project center is a real helpmate. It took awhile to put together, but was worth it. Its versatility is a nice surprise. It can be raised to different work-heghts, AND folded flat to hang on a wall, and all the adjustments that can be made to hold projects of all sizes is amazing. It will hold my new miter saw AND my sewing machine. It couldn't get better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Workmate 425 - DO NOT BUY!","review":"Shame on B&D for selling a piece of junk mechanical bench. AND shame on me for not looking at all of the reviews to understand the difference from the original workmate. I own an original and expected good quality. Why would a company change from a WINNER to such a POOR LOSER? Cheap metal, rough cut in places, thin cheap wood compared to the originals, an adjustment system that is based on a PLASTIC belt (wow!) and handles that adjust as one. I have read that if you crank the handle that would tighten on the smaller end of an angled piece of wood, the wider side slips off of the plastic crank and when the board is almost tightened you use both handles to tighten securely. Doesn't sound good to me. I would have rather spend a little more for the old original workmate than this piece of junk. I will be buying a \\"jawhorse\\" and sell this new workmate on craigslist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A handy, versatile, tool","review":"The Black & Decker WM425 Workmate is a handy, versatile, portable tool within its limitations. At the Amazon price it's a no brainer. It is not a precision clamping device for fine woodworking nor a heavy duty work bench. It is, however, very useful and unique for some tasks. My advice to prospective buyers would be to examine one before you buy and visit some of the woodworking/handyman forums on the web for some opinions as to it's suitability for your use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy mail order","review":"This is an OK product with several major caveats. Don't buy mail order. It will arrive damaged. The packaging is nonexistent and the plastic fittings on the underside of the boards will break in shipping. I've done it twice. If you must have it, buy from a retailer and check everything before you take it home.As a product for fixed home use it's OK. For taking to work sites, it's too heavy and awkward to fold, unfold and carry. Also, the plastic fittings that don't make it through shipping may not make it bouncing around in your truck. They are not very sturdy.A better choice is the Craftsman (the more expensive one). It has telescoping legs and is easier to fold and carry. The top boards are melamine, but you can make your own hardwood boards. The best pegs/clamps for these workstands are the ones that come with the Skil workstand sold at Lowe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, could be packaged better","review":"Like the other reviewers here, I found the Workmate I ordered to be a great product. However, when I picked up the box from where it had been left by UPS on my front porch, I could hear the pieces banging around inside. I immediately remembered what another person had mentioned here about their Workmate arriving in bad shape. Sure enough, there were a couple chips out of the boards that form the surface of the workbench. One chip was severe enough to require a part replacement. B&D is sending a replacement part, no questions asked, but now I have to wait another 7-10 business days before I put my Workmate together. Packaging that didn't stand up well to shipping is my one complaint here. You may not have this problem, and either way I'll end up with a good little workbench in the end, I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Workmate vs New","review":"I had an original workmate for almost 25 years. When I moved a few years ago I gave it to my son who had just purchased his first house. Now 5 years later I really miss that old workmate. So I decided to replace it and purchased a new WM425 from Home Depot. It promised to be everything the old one was and more. WRONG!! What a piece of crap compared to the original. It's built out of stamped metal instead of heavier gauge aluminum and is not at all easy to unfold. The worst feature is the vise action which is not as tight or precise as the original. The 2 handles are joined by a cheap light plastic perforated strap so that both sides tighten (sort of) at the same time. This eliminates the possibility of clamping pieces whose sides aren't parallel. So it's going back to HD and my son and I will be having joint custody of the old Workmate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do your own quality control","review":"Fortunately the unit I purchased was not in as bad a shape as units others received. The wooden slats were splintering in places but not warped. The unit is minimalist, not in terms of design but of quality. If it were made properly - heavier metal, vise mechanism more robust, better wooden slats, it could probably command twice the price at Amazon and be worth it. Unfortunately, it is made as a semi-disposable unit probably not the result of being made in China but of what B & D dictated as cost. The instructions for assembly are close to useless - figures misnumbered and not very informative. Made instructions from IKEA look like a Mercedes service manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic handles that break","review":"Had this product for a about 3 years - got it from Lowes for about $55 at the time. It's not very sturdy, and the hand cranks that move the vise are made of plastic - they broke within the first year. I've had to rig it in various ways to keep the vise function working. I would not buy it again due to its cheap parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and Decker Workmate","review":"This is a replacement for one I earlier had lent to my son that somehow has not found its way back home! The Workmate is such a hand convenience in the shop, the home or at the work site. It is solidly built, but yet very portable and in it's collapsed state takes up very little space. I use it as a table for all sorts of functions or as a vice for clamping all sorts of items that I may be working on. It is very stable in any of these modes. This is a most useful accessory for any home owner or wood worker.......I even use it for working on my racing bicycle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Workmate portable","review":"I bought this portable workbench for my son who has just moved into his first home. I have used one of these workbenches for more than 30 years and it has been an exceptional, convenient tool. Sadly, the new model does not come close to the older version. It is relatively flimsy, the vise works ineffectively, and it does not provide as stable a work platform. Cheaper materials; less solid manufacture; useful for its portability, but a pale imitation of a one time flagship product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Experience","review":"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for someone and am glad that I decided to assemble it. They instructions did not match the version of the product in the box and it had lots of missing parts. I RETURNED IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but","review":"As others have commented - I can't believe the problems has still not been addressed - my flimsy package arrived in shreds with the workbench damaged. Amazon promptly replaced it. Assembling the unit is simple, especially if you ignore the somewhat obtuse instructions, but the tool supplied for tightening the bolts is best replaced with a socket wrench as the bolts were nearly impossible to tighten with the supplied tool.Otherwise, the unit seems quite convenient for light duty work and stores easily. Construction is a bit cheesy, but the unit is serviceable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and flimsy, nebulous instructions","review":"I could not believe that this was actually a B&D product. It is cheap and flimsy and the assembly instrucions are nearly impossible to follow. The jaws do not close properly nor do they fit tightly. The plastic assembly wrench is totally useless. What a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"I expected more with this table.... assembly instructions are not too clear and the final result is just ok...."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made and hard to use","review":"I've always heard good things about the workmate so I was very disappointed when I received it.

I have four, great for cutting large pieces of wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the serious DIYer!","review":"Very poorly constructed. Flimsy sheet metal. Catches on the underside of the jaws do not engage securely into the holes in the frame. Adjusting screws were poorly aligned so that the first attachment of the moveable jaw left it crooked and required some disassembly and adjusting on my part. Reasonably sturdy with all 4 legs on a flat floor, but I suspect it will prove wobbly on an uneven surface. Definitely not for the serious DIYer who works with heavier items. Next time I would look for something much sturdier. Made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you're expecting a quality product","review":"I just finished putting this together. Once I was able to parse the sparsely-detailed instructions, it went together fairly quickly, with no 'extra' parts remaining. That's a plus.However, I was very disappointed with the quality of the materials used to construct this product, and the overall design. With the exception of six bolts, the bench is held together with plastic fasteners that will lose integrity in a relatively short time-span, especially under heavy use. Cheap metal, particle board and plastic are poor choices for workbench fabrication. Personally, I wouldn't trust anything weighing anywhere near 500 pounds sitting on this bench. I really don't expect that it will last long.On hindsight, the money would have been better spent on quality lumber and hardware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!","review":"My husband has been wanting one of these for years. We found it on black Friday for an unbelievable price and decided to get it.Typical Black & Decker quality. Product is versatile and allows for several different types of projects. I like the ability to change the table dimensions easily and the option to fold down and hang on the wall.If you ladies are looking to purchase a nice quality product for a special guy in your life - this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & Decker WM425 Workmate Portable Workbench","review":"Assembly was quite easy. However, the plastic belt that controls the vise jaw was damaged upon delivery. I called Black and Decker about this issue on Nov 15, 2012. The representative said the belt for Workmate WM425 is on back order. I told her to order it for me anyway. To date I have not received the belt. The belt does not show on the parts listing nor in the assembly manual. Not having the belt in stock suggests to me that it may be a common problem item experienced by users of this portable workbench."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work Bench","review":"Love it. It was a little confusing to put together but once I assembled it is great. I think it is a good value for the price and the perfect accessory for the home handy \\"woman\\" or \\"man\\". I happen to be a woman and do all the handy work around our house so for those of you like me this is just the right size and that extra set of hands you need when as usual your husband is never around when you need him! Good value and easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad packaging - bad instructions - disappointed","review":"Shipped in the single ply cardboard display box - the same one on the floor at Home Depot. Boards chipped in typically careless UPS handling.Instructions in about 20 languages, none of them helpful in getting the top pieces to align properly. (Gee, and I used to do well on spatial relationship test ;-)Main complaint is the shipping. Suggest buying th product locally if possible so you can take it back if you have the same experience of putting it together and will at least receive it without damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping Destroyed Product","review":"I had to use one star as we were unable to use the product because it was so damaged in shipping - I bought it for a gift for my husband and wanted to surprise him. And believe me it did! It was so destroyed in shipping he refused it and had the UPS driver take it back. Now , the Porter Cable belt sander also came the same day and it was packaged properly and undamaged. I read about this problem in previous reviews but wasn't sure I believed it. I do believe it now. Black & Decker has got to come up with packaging that can make it through the delivery process or discountinue selling to this huge market on the web. Or is it the fault of UPS?? I am still hoping to get a workmate for my husband. The rest of the review to come when we get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"My old Workmate worked easily. This new Workmate being top of the line, WM425, should be at least as good. It is crap. The top is cheap, thin material, not even cut to square. I could replace the top but the vise is flimsy and so poorly designed and manufactured that I have to crank it with both hands. I took it to a B&D Service Center to ask if I can substitute a top from an old Workmate. They young man there had never seen a Workmate and had no idea what it is for. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Models Lack Strength of Old Ones","review":"I have an old Workmate (10 years old) that has been pretty good. It has a couple parks that have worn out, such as the mechanism that holds it in it's compact form when not in use, but over all it have been a great tool.My in-laws gave me a new one last Christmas and it was much more flimsy and was even missing parts out of the box. My wife called Black and Decker and they said it commonly happens and we should reveive the pieces we need within a few weeks. Well, it's June and still no parts. Granted, I should have followed up with them by now. Even with all the parts, the units are much less sturdy now than a few years ago. Back then their usability justified their cost. Now, that is simply not the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for its purposes","review":"It's built fairly decently. It's not like the one I had from 15 years ago which feels sturdier than this one. However, I bought this for my son and it does well for him. It serves his purpose of cutting various pieces of wood, holding objects in place as he works on them, and the adjustability is a great feature because he is able to clamp down various sizes of wood. The folding feature of the table is excellent because it has a small footprint when everything is folded in. I'd recommend it in general. But if you are looking for a true workhorse of a bench, this may not be the best out there for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what a disappointment!","review":"I have one of the original aluminum die-cast Workmates (made in Great Britain in the 70's) that had seen its better day. So I went with this \\"updated\\" model from Black & Decker. What a joke and an extremely poor excuse for \\"progress\\". It's mostly made of cheap stamped metal and plastic parts that make for a very rickety and unstable platform that is a mere wisp of the original Workmate. It came damaged, and I have since had to replace several plastic parts to keep it some form of working order (such as it is). When I finally get some time, I am going to refurbish my old Workmate and junk this POS."},{"rating":"1","title":"WM 425 Review","review":"Diffuicult to put together. Wood work surface difficult to attach to table base with plastic units. Adjusting cranks with thin plastic drive belt was flimsy/cheap. Not very reliable. Wonder how long the crank system will last. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent design","review":"First, I must mention that the Workmate I'm writing about is not new -- it is the Workmate 400 model. My wife won it in a contest nearly 25 years ago; when we got married, she gave it to me.I rate it 5 stars because it is an excellent design. I use it mainly for holding boards when cutting with the circular saw and holding my chopsaw. With the legs splayed out, it is very stable.The top is particle board held to the metal frame with steel bolts. It has stood up well; I've tossed it in the back of vehicles and hauled it around the yard in the Garden Way cart and it's never given me any problems. It just works.If the current model is built as well as this model is, I wouldn't have a second thought about replacing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"B&D Workmate review","review":"I purchased this workmate because I often need an extra pair of hands or a workbench that I can store away. The B&D WM 425 meets all of the requirements and is quite sturdy. I like the one handed feature of being able to close the clamps and the surface area is adequate for most jobs. The only down side is that the table top is a bit flimsi as it is some kind of particle board, and when you clamp items in it it has a tendency to chip. Amazon delivered it quickly as usual and all the parts were there and was pretty easy to assemble from the instructions. Overall, I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"Service and Delivery were great as always w. Prime. The product is not as solid as I thought it would be. The \\"vise\\" capability is a joke as the two screws dont want to work together evenly and smoothly. The workmate has been around for a long time, I remember the one my dad had, seemed very solid and well built. I would have thought that 20 years later the product would be much better than or at least as good as that 20 year old beauty, dad had. Nope...this thing is a flimsy imitation of that old workhorse. As a portable work surface, it does provide a solid tip free worktable and was stable on the patio pavers as well as concrete. It's just not as solid or well built as I had expected. There must be better out there.....will keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" well worth the price \\"","review":"I was alittle hesitant to order this bench as I had owned one 25 years ago and while happy then I thought maybe the quality would not be the same in this current bench. I am pleased to so far Iam no longer hesitant about my decision and would recommend to anyone to order it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great work table and service from Amazon","review":"I can only add an additional thumbs up for this product. Well worth the money. As for all it's uses; just read the huge amount of other reviews.I also want to make sure and say that the table arrived with absolutely NO damage. It is a heavy item though and the Black and Decker carton is not the best for shipping so keep that in mind. I couldn't find this item in any store in my area so was forced to buy on-line.Highly recommend Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not built for long term use","review":"If you buy this keep it safe from the elements. The cheap plastic \\"chain\\" that operates the cranks failed on mine along with the plastic lock for the legs. And the press-board top is cheap as well. Otherwise a nice helpful workbench if you can store it in your house to make it last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"B&D Workmate arrived damaged, has some \\"cheapo\\" features","review":"The product arrived damaged and it wasn't evident 'till the final step in the assembly process. I had to adjust (bend) part of the Workmate to install one of the handles. It would have taken another hour to take it apart and repackage it, then arrange for return or replacement.I wouldn't purchase something like this on the web again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collapsible frame is perfect","review":"I haven't tested the full weight load yet, but at 190 lbs. I didn't feel the workmate having any struggle while standing on it. This collapses to a much smaller frame which is great for those of us who wish we had more space. The clamps work well and haven't yielded yet. I have not used the 90-degree clamp option yet. My one issue is that since the workmate is light, it sometimes kicks up off the ground, so I need to use my foot to hold it down. I don't complain about it's light weight when I have to carry it around though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice unit.","review":"This workbench arrived in great shape for such a large box, easy to put together, sturdy enough base. Two of the table top pieces were warped about 1/8\\", very hard to un-warp these laminated pieces. The lack of surface flatness has not been an issue for me so far, I'm just clamping 2X4's & larger wood with it. Feels like it will hold up to it's rated weight capacity for sure. Not a bad unit for <$100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Helper","review":"Would vote 5 stars, but one star got lost in the plastic...Comes in handy for larger projects, and/or working outside. I wouldn't use it for welding projects, as the laminated-wood-product top, and plastic parts would take too much damage. As a clamp for holding odd-shape items for grinding, it's great! Holds surprisingly solid, considering the flimsy appearance of the parts.Clamping force could be better, but most of that assembly is plastic. When you reach a designed clamp force limit, (maybe 30lb psi - just a guess) it will ratchet off further turning of handles. Considering all torque and pressure points are dependent on plastic to hold all the \\"business\\" parts together, B&D; did a decent job with this unit, and is is a good and useful tool.Overall, I'm happy I got it, it's a third-hand when you need it.I regret not getting one years ago, when metal was the primary component..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a human work mate","review":"I have used Workmates for over 10 years now. It is super and the first thing I get out when starting any project is the Workmate. Over time, I have built my own attachments for securing tools, and/or materials to the surface. It gets used for all painting and papering projects as it folds to the PERFECT height for standing and reaching comfortably to the ceiling. The portability is great in its ability to collapse and remain light weight.It never complains. Never quits. Never lets me down. What more can you expect from a work mate?Only wish B&D; would start some sort of collection of useful ideas, applications, accessories, or problem solutions related to Workmates."},{"rating":"2","title":"First thing you should buy w/out a cord or battery","review":"This is the # 1 most functional thing in my shop without a cord or battery needed. The functions are of professional necessities as well as every day homeowners or as simple as working on the pinewood derby for cub scout parents. Not only is it perfect for the limited space in your home it breaks down and fits comfortably in a small car to bring to the next place you need it. You just can't go wrong for the price. I have had it for 5+ years and still use it everywhere. When I am done I fold it up and hang it on the wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Tailgates on Vacation","review":"I've only had my workmate for 3 days. It's great. Holds lumber for cutting very efficiently and has a unique clamping system. It's so much better than my truck tailgate, can't believe I didn't buy one a long time ago. I looked at the Workmate 225, but for [this price]. more, I bought the heavier duty 425 model. It's the perfect extra hand. Shipping was faster than stated and I was surprised when I received it so fast. The box had a lot of damage to it, but the Workmate did not have a scratch."},{"rating":"1","title":"very flimsy product","review":"I just got mine and this product has nothing to do with product descriptions. It is flimsy has alignment problems and crank is a joke really. And instructions are ridiculous. I will send mine back. Do not bother buying this thing unless you will use it once in a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"top shelf item","review":"My grandfather had the original when it came out 20 + years ago and still uses it this day. I was a little disappointed with the handles to open and close the table and the center board is warped a touch. But I'm taking that up with black and decker. I would recommend this product over the lower models because of size, and the ability to fold up and store in a relatively small space. Also the weight capacity of 500+ pounds is always a plus for \\"do-it yourself'ers\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product for the price","review":"After reading all of he reviews, and mostly the bad ones, I was reluctant to order this product.

However, in my experience, this mask fits a wider range of faces than any other.The mask provides a wonderful field of vision and has a very low volume (important for diving).The only reason that I gave it 4-stars instead of 5 are the various colors these come in. Any color other than black is straight out bad. The reason is that light coming in from the sides (on the clear models that are popular) create glare on the inside of the mask. With the black, all the light that comes in goes directly towards your eyes. With the clear, it will bleed in from all sides and reflect off the inner surface. The other colors aren't as bad as the clear, there is definitely a more noticeable glare from them than the black just because it is more reflective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good traditional stuff","review":"Just what I was looking for, some traditional British songs from the age of sail.

While the best music gets better and better with every new hearing (no small consideration when you have repetition-loving kids), I have found this overlong, overproduced album has instead become more and more irritating. The whole enterprise strikes me as highbrow pretension, from the Shakespearean interludes (nicely played by Ms. Streep but often hard to hear, and with a tenuous thematic connection to the songs) to the pompous spectacle of opera divas singing traditional children's songs. In our house, the classic recordings of Seeger, Guthrie, Leadbelly et. al. are still the favorites; the straightforward, simple, solid recordings of any one of these greats puts the artsy, precious \\"Dance on a Moonbeam\\" to shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT classic Bill Crofut","review":"If you really love folk music, you'll love Bill Crofut; but not this album! I grew up listening to Bill Crofut (my parents' old record is all scratched up from me dancing around in front of the record player to the Chipmunk's Day). I love his voice, I love his poetry, I love the way he plays the banjo. I was so excited to see this album now that I have a child myself. But from the moment I turned it on, I loathed it. It's too operatic (I like Opera, but not when I want to listen to folk music), and it makes the very real and down-to-earth songs sound high-faluten and just plin bad. If your're looking for some great music for your kids (even very young ones), get some Bill Crofut music...but get it with Bill singing, not these non-folk singers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting","review":"I ordered this outfeed table on July 1 when I placed my order for the Rousseau 2775 table saw stand.

There were tons of words spelled incorrectly (confidant for confident, being one that annoyed me several times) or used incorrectly (your when she means you're.) This sort of thing gets annoying after there are several in the beginning of a book. The book is told in the first person by what seems to be the author herself. The main character is a novelist who wears a size 6 and a 36DD bra (which seemed like wishful thinking.) She goes back in time and quickly and easily convinces a local that she is from the future...he decides to marry her and buys her a ton of clothes. The clothes shopping seems to go on forever and in great detail. This was when I gave up. This book has an amateur feel to it, as though it were meant to be published in a fanzine.

However, I may say that the best versions are heard on the first two tracks and track # 6.\\"The Icy Ascent\\" is my favorite track because it represents the pre-Star Wars Williams in a way. The melody begins calmly and then goes in crescendo until reaching a spectacular moment. Just like climbing a mountain. But if we go on talking about classical motifs, \\"The Top Of The World\\" and \\"The Eiger\\" make a fine complement to \\"The Icy Ascent\\".\\"The Eiger Sanction\\" is a fine work by Williams, and the only one written for a Clint Eastwood movie.

If that is a professional term ;)I have finally had it, and will be selling all of my used Milwaukee cordless tools. The actual quality of the cordless tools (18v) is superb. It's just that the batteries die FAR too fast. And at $80+ each...I just will not go on anymore. If the batteries were $25 bucks each, I'd definitely keep the Milwaukee gear. Personally, I think that ALL cordless tools are far too expensive in the long run. But, you just can't live without them.

A service tech at Milwaukee told me how to \\"jump-start\\" the batteries so that they could recharge. Well he was right about the \\"jump-start\\" in that it caused the charger indicator to light up. But after following his advice to the letter, surprise, surprise. Maybe 30 secs of operation.

Enough mindless praise though, this is and likely will be a band unknown to the general populace and that's fitting. They never became the famous but still respected musical giants that they deserve to be. Instead they went further. Listen to Birdsongs of the Mesozoic. Listen to the Volcano Suns. Listen to No Man.

The strength and compact storage when broken down were the big selling points as they are a perfect alternative to the \\"stick-built\\" sawhorses he had been using. A sawhorse takes up a lot of premium shop space and the cheap folding sawhorse options available at the big box home improvement stores simply don't offer the strength required to support the heavy furniture he builds. When not in use they tuck away into a quarter of the space his old free standing wooden horses did. We couldnt be more satisfied with the quality and convenience.

Besides the titanium hammers, these were my favorite gadgets of theirs. These horses, once properly set up, will hold ANYTHING. We stacked forty 2X8X18s on them and started cutting them for rafters. Occasionally, two or more carpenters also climbed on top to nail above and these horses didn't groan. The rafters had steel c-channel sistered on them, and once the wood was up, we stacked almost a ton of steel on the horses and started working on them. They never gave any sign of stress. Any length 2X can be installed as the top, giving the opportunity to make a wider set of horses if need be, but the drawback is that once set up, they don't fold for transport, you have to break them down first. Made strong and simple, great for framers and siding guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best saw horses I've ever used, by far","review":"For years I have made my own saw horses and have tried many, many retail versions, but fortunately while working with another contractor, I discovered these. I now own two sets and these are certainly the simplist and the best saw horses I have ever used.They come assembled and are \\"scissor-action\\" where all you have to do is open one onto one end of a 2x4 and another onto the other end. If you clamp one pair slightly less far apart than the other pair, when not in use, the two horse can be moved next to each other to take the place of only one saw horse. When the connecting 2x4 gets cut up from use, simply replace it with new one and your back in business.They are very, very solid, stable, and although expensive, certainly worth it. I'm writing this review while buying my third pair (and the other remain in excellent condition)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great horses","review":"I bought these because my dad has had a set very similar to these for over 30 years. Same concept, but I don't think they are Trojans. These things set up and tear down very quickly and as I've got the 35\\" legs, they are a perfect height(no more lower back pain from cutting). My only problem with them is the fact that the nuts and bolts that hold them together get loose and you have to tighten them every so often.

They beat any other sawhorses I'd used hands down.You can make them whatever length you want by using any hunk of 2X, which comes in handy on different jobs. I ended up buying a set for each of my crews and now they are just a standard at every jobsite we're on. Everybody thinks they're great.I've gone through those plastic horses in a couple months, built wood ones that took up too much space, and used all kinds of others that wobble or just don't hold up.

If you need a pair of quality horses, definitely get these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sawhorses....simple design, incredible strength","review":"These sawhorses can hold an incredible amount of weight. They create a very stable work surface for cutting, and the width can be changed quickly by replacing your 2x4 with a shorter or longer one depending on your needs. They set up and break down very easily too. However, use caution while setting these up, keeping your hands and fingers away from pinch points.

The reason is because I now know that even if he doesn't feel the same way about me it doesn't mean that I was wrong to tell him. This book really gives you courage to be honest about your feelings and I think teens really need this. The last relationship I was in ended because my boyfriend hated the way everyonetalked about us like we were a television show or something.I think all teens should read this book, girls and guys because it has good ideas about how to handle every situation.

Perhaps their music is so soothing, so warm, so trancelike, that they can move unnoticed, except by those listening for them. How they crafted music of this sort in the 80's remains a mystery; psych guitar melded with a Velvet Underground inspired drone and a knack for melody makes this pop of the mellowest sort. Even though the voice of Warhem is far from that of a crooner, it's perfect for the mood they set. On Fire is a gorgeous and worthy follow-up to its predecessor.

Sadly this book is far from special. Each illustration has a thick black surround which, frankly makes it impossible to concentrate on, and enjoy the image content. The quality of reproduction is average, somewhat lacking the sparkle of other monographs. Still worse are the vast acreages of blank white pages. What is going on here ??, the number of images could have been doubled and more, quite easily. Information on location, and context are frustratingly sparse - I do not know if HCB did keep a log of his locations, but it would be nice to have rather more than, say, \\"Japan\\". This rich and fascinating area of HCB's work deserves a proper presentation, rather than just something that seems to have been 'cobbled together', as this has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but...","review":"Beautiful case!

The recording quality is certainly not the best - this is her recitals, not a digitally mastered CD from the huge recording house.

A Mercenary has charms because it so evokes the news in 2008 and Envy is a wicked little piece likely to have lasting appeal.But I am urging you to buy this book for the sake of one story. It's called Virility. In it, Ozick puts aside her Judeopean, world-weary voice for the clean credulity and wholesome cynicism of a male waspy New Yorker who tells the secret story of one of America's most famous poets and some of the real truths behind the New York literary scene.I read this back in the 70's and its sour little truth changed the way I thought about men and women in the way that no argument could have.The other pieces are good too, but get yourself to Virility as soon as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up and Coming Rock Stars!","review":"Audiovent is a great new band, definately deserving of the attention it is about to receive.

But it took these guys forever to get this album out, and sometimes albums are worth the wait. But after about two years passed \\"DSKIP\\" finally came out, only, much to my disappointment, there were only 4 new songs, 1 old song with brand new lyrics, and 7 songs that remained almost completely unchanged from their independant release in 1999. To me that shows a serious lack of creativity on their part. The four new songs they do have on the album are very good, I just wish that there was more new material to listen to. Hopefully with the next album they'll fix that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!","review":"I'm not the biggest rock fan, but I always can appreciate some good music. Well, along comes Audiovent. I heard this song while playing Madden 2003 on my Playstation 2 and I was like man...

Well, I don't think any of them topped the song, but quite a few of them sure came close. This group sure has quality as a primary focus. With other songs such as \\"I can't breathe\\", \\"Rain\\" and \\"Beautiful addiction\\", this CD is definitely worth picking up.

It is an outpouring of emotion and pain that followed Yoko's tragic miscarriage, but to actually put this on CD and have people buy it, is a joke. The opening track, \\"Cambridge 1969\\" is a 26 minute piece of intolerable pain, which features Yoko's offkey screaming, accompanied by John trying to match the pitch of her screams with feedback from his guitar. If you can last the entire 26 minutes on this one, without going into a fit of rage and breaking something, you are a stronger person than I.

This collection of foolish noise takes you through Yoko's ridiculous \\"singing\\" and poetry, an infant's death, two minutes of absolute silence, and two people playing with a radio.Like Two Virgins, this collection of musick should be avoided at all costs.

With his new avant-garde wife at his side -- and enough money in the bank to last a lifetime -- Lennon set about ruining his bank value so he could return to being a 'private citizen.' All three albums -- Two Virgins, Life With The Lions & Wedding Album -- are potent reminders of a simpler time when artists could experiment wildly (or just be very silly) and still get released and distributed (erm, somewhat). Rykodisc nicely duplicates the original packaging and the remastered sound quality is, for 1967, pretty darn good.Of course you can't actually LISTEN to this stuff...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh yes I tried","review":"I really tried to listen to this record, to discover its hidden message,hidden secret, hidden whatsoever. But I had to give up. It is unbelievably boring, arrogant and useless. I do love atonal music, I do love John Cage, LaMonte Young, Stockhausen, Goeyvaerts. But here there is not the slightest effort to produce music or even sound. Yoko's screaming is totally void and upsets your stomach. THe radio \\"composition\\" is totally aimless. You could do this for fun, but it is endlessly arrogant to put this on a record for sale. Yes, I bought it, because of the legend around it, and I have something of a collector's item now.

It deals with making talismans roughly in the Golden Dawn style, with some unique ideas elucidated here that were only hinted at in the Order's published literature. The sections on using color and shape were valuable in and of themselves. Additionally, the information on determining if your talisman is working is unique and rarely mentioned elsewhere. Be advised, though, that this book's methodologies requires a fair amount of work in terms of ritual practice and developing relationships with spiritual forces before you can actually use its talisman making techniques.

They sound far too empty. These are songs that NEED heavy drums, keyboard, bass, and electric guitar. It's respectable that Coverdale didn't forget about the band who got him on his feet - Deep Purple - by including \\"Soldier of Fortune\\", but this song and all the rest should never have been released in this stripped down way.

Adrian played accoustic guitar peacefully...enjoyable and relaxing music! I still love one old song of Deep Purple number (during Coverdale days in the 70) \\"Soldier of fortune\\". What a lovely song ballad! David Coverdale is a Hard rock singer who has combinated the cool sound between Deep Purple and Zeppelin. I think he did not mean to copy Robert Plant style on his new band Whitesnake, he just only combinated the Deep Purple and Zeppelin sound together. the result is brain melting"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good until it dries","review":"I have a 2001 BMW.

I then masked the adjacent paint and applied 2 good coats of forever black - In all the process took about 2 hours. The car really looked good then, almost like new. My impression was, \\"cool, this stuff is great!\\". Judging by how difficult it was to clean up the spills, it seemed that it was going to stick and be durable. However, because I wanted to make sure the \\"dye\\" had cured, I did not wash the car for about 3 weeks. Then I used one of those automatic car washes that are at gas station/ convenience stores. The side trim still looks good but the rear bumper has lost most of the \\"dye\\" - it just washed off during the first wash! Maybe your results will be better if you have the time to hand wash your car, but do you really have time to always do that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff!","review":"I bought this item to hopefully darken the trim on my '99 Wrangler, which had faded to a pale grey/light blue.

Imagine if Mick Jagger, Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman and other greats moved into YOUR neighborhood! There's also the pyro-next-door, the housekeeper, Mick and Keith's little deli;Mick's parents, somehow done in faux vintage footage, are a scream. There's so much good material here, it's hard to keep up with all the puns and laughs. The British accents are sometimes a challenge - my strategy is to turn the volume way up; it seems to help.

Perhaps they are, because America's children are not only nutritionally challenged, but it seems that they are also deprived of literature that would add more to the substance of their lives than a collection of naughty words and episodes.

Not only do these reluctant readers read this series, but they come back begging to read more. These are the kids who might never have picked up a book willingly. It has been my experience as a children's librarian that the complaints about this book are made mostly by uptight parents who never learned that reading is fun! Lighten up you adults and get over the bodily functions issues that you are obviously still struggling with.

Three of my goldfish are standard gold color. One of them is white, but seems to change its tint depending on the fish food. Sometimes, it's very white, sometimes with some black, sometimes with a golden hue. These flakes make it look more golden.The TetraFin Flakes are large, colorful flakes, not tiny crumbs. I like that, because crumbs don't all get eaten before they dissolve in the water. I imagine the fish get a better meal being able to catch large mouthfuls of flakes.

Oh boy. Did I finish the book, yes, and I read it with a bit more critical eye. In fact, I went back and re-read the first chapter. So, what does this past have to do with his observations of the next 500 years?You'll have to read the book.But, let me say that it was an enjoyable read, and I found his frequent validation of sci-fi writers ideas and theories, mixed in with pure sciece to be a fun way to have written the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"500 years in a matter of hours","review":"The future is demonstrated through pure scientific evidence.

The plot was far fetched, too fragmented, and unlikely. The characters - especially Jane - unsympathetic. The interaction between the characters is psychologically a stretch.But what really bothered me was the repetitive writing style. \\"She stiffened\\", \\"he stiffened\\", \\"Trevor stiffened\\", \\"McDuff stiffened\\", there was a lot of stiffening going on - in lieu of interesting action, obviously.Everyone is angry and constantly saying \\"dammit\\". Jane's gaze flies a lot. Her gaze flies to his face, flies to the action, flies here and there. And she whirls. \\"She whirled on him\\" - frequently. McDuff whirled a few times, too.Between the stiffening, the whirling, the gazes flying and the dammits, the style was insipid to the point of torture. Needless to say, I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Countdown was a big Let Down","review":"Let me start by saying that I generally love this author. But, this one was a huge letdown. I tried to read the story 2 times and ended up giving it to my sister to she if she likes it. I have to say this is probably 2 out of the thousands of books I have read that I just couldn't finish.The book started out with promise but then it almost seemed like the author was trying to push the story and not let it develop. In addition I found that the main female character (Jane) who I have loved in all the other books lacked her normal brilliance and shine in this one. You felt sorry for her and at the same time I was annoyed by her actions, especially with the friend she has protected all these years.I can't say if I liked the ending or if the book gets better because I never got there.I gave the book 2 stars as I did like the initial start (first 20 pages or so) but that was being generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"I am an avid reader of Iris Johansen and always buy her books as soon as they are published.

The author introduces us to a rather unlikeable heroine and draws us into a tepid plot that combines ancient history and suicide nuclear bombers. The heroine, Jane MacGuire, is unsympathetic; instead of being feisty, she just seems contrary. The dialogue in this book is full of small but continuous argument that becomes very, very tiresome.I listened to the book on CD and found myself skipping to the next track again and again. Here's the most telling point - I really didn't miss anything by fast-forwarding. The plot was predictable and the dialogue as well.After all was said and done, nothing 'happened'. Most unforgivable of all, the author's attempt to create a believable love story fell flat as well. It's really a bad book if even the sex scenes aren't exciting.A must-miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Countdown isn't that bad..............","review":"Countdown continues on the story from Blind Alley, with Trevor reuniting with Jane in order to protect her from yet another terrorist. I am glad to see the return of Trevor, and the supporting character MacDuff was very interesting too. You barely see any of Eve or Joe in this novel. The problem with this novel and well as Blind Alley is that Iris is making the plots increasingly overblown and unbelievable. Killing Game at least had believability, unlike the constant terrorists, 2000 year old legends, and trained assassins found in this book. The other problem I had with this book was that Jane's dialogue is very unrealistic. She speaks like a 40 year old instead of a 21 year old college kid..........I am not much older than she is and no 21 year old I know uses phrases or speaks as formally as she does. However, the book was still interesting enough to hold my attention and is worth it to buy it you are an ardent fan of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"Muddled plot, weak character development, repetitive phrasing, boring conversations -- this book is poorly constructed and almost unreadable. It's supposed to be a thriller, but most of the \\"action\\" is Jane hanging out, waiting for something to happen: waiting for Mario to finish translating the scrolls; waiting for Jock to come out of his hypnotically-induced brainwashing; waiting for Trevor to have sex with her. And while she's waiting, there are dozens of interminable discussions that only serve to rehash useless plot lines and fill pages!I always try to finish a book, but I've really struggled through this one. After reading other reviews here, it confirms my reaction, so I'm going to take their advice and stop reading. Whew, I feel better already. Thank you, Amazon readers, for telling it like it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Done with these books","review":"As others reviewers have stated I am finished reading Iris Johansen books. The characters are ridiculous and unbelievable, especially the women. I have read the the first 5 books of the Eve Duncan series and they were pretty good but have continued to decline in quality and are just plain repetitive and boring. I will not be able to finish Countdown, horrible book. The women are just snotty and guarded. Jane's character is the worst of all!! Find Bonnie for gosh sake or move on with the story line. Save your money and buy thrillers from someone who knows how to write them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"This was the first Irish Johansen book I ever read. I noticed this in the store where I work at, and it looked interesting enough, so I thought, why not. I was expecting way more than... this.The story is not very well-constructed and focuses more on the character of Jane and her connection with a Roman woman named Cira. I know this is supposed to be part of a series, but the mark of a good series is that any book within could be read by itself. The story is rather sparse given the description on the back of the book. Unless you're a die-hard Johansen fan, I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"I have to say I am getting very bored with the direction Ms. Johansen is taking the Eve Duncan series. First of all, on the cover it states that this is an Eve Duncan story, which is not. This is a Jane Maguire story just like Blind Alley was. Second, this story was filled with nothing more than the sexual tension between Jane and Mark Trevor. If I wanted that, I would buy something with Fabio on the cover. I think Ms. Johansen needs to get the story back on track with Eve, Joe and Bonnie."},{"rating":"1","title":"please give us the option to rate a book 0 stars!!","review":"After Blind Alley, I swore I'd never read another Johanssen novel, but I thought I'd give her one more chance. Big mistake. What happened to this author? Why has her writing gone downhill so badly? Is it because Jane (a very immature, unlikeable character) is now the focus? Is it because the plots have become goofy and implausible? Does she have a guarantee that she'll be published no matter what she writes? If \\"Countdown\\" and \\"Blind Alley\\" are the best she has left, she's running on empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Countdown by Iris Johansen","review":"Was very excited and practically breathless waiting for another Eve Duncan book...Very disappointed.

I'm only halfway through this book and I'm having to force myself to finish it. The main character, Jane, Is not believable at all. Her life is in danger and she's not scared? Instead, she's bold, smart-mouthed, and cocky... and she's only 21! The plot is stupid and I don't care what happens next. Very disappointed. Not sure if I'll be able to finish it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"No need for a continuation...","review":"This is a continuation set years after Blind Alley, but it lacks the plot and mystery of the first book. Main character Jane is a few years older now and living on her own when she is targeted again. The unfortunate decision to bring back her \\"love interest\\" from the first book was longlasting. Most of the book is spent on arguements between the two,flirting, and sex scenes. I did a lot of skimming. Worst of all was that the matchup of the two lacked any chemistry and bordered on being a disgusting age difference especially considering they had met when Jane was a minor. Stick to the first book, this adds nothing but romance under the guise of mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"I have read most of Iris' novels, and this is tied for the worst! I read Iris for a good suspenseful, thrilling story line, not juvenile \\"romance\\" and a far fetched story about \\"Cira\\" and a quest for gold. Hello??! am I the only one who feels this way?? A quest for gold?? come on now! If I had to read one more Cira flashback, the book would have been tossed across the room. Unfortunately for me, I can't stop something I started, so I wasted my time finishing the book, \\"just in case\\" it got better. It doesn't. But if you want to waste several hours of your life, go ahead and read it.

I felt it was missing some key components; character development,scene establishment, believeable dialogue, believeable plot, suspense, just to name several.I found the dialogue contrived. The characters lacked, well, character. The plot was patronizing.I wish I could be more positive about this one, but I really can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"You guys are tough!!!","review":"I listen to books as I commute - and Iris Johansen is one of my favorites. Although Countdown is not as good as the Eve Duncan series was, it is still alright. Jane MacGuire has grown up and it is pretty obvious that Ms. Johansen intends for Jane to take Eve's place as her new leading character, but Jane certainly has not gotten off to the same start as Eve did. The story line is not any worse than the previous Jane/Mark Trevor encounter was and neither of these last 2 books were as well written as the Eve Duncan series was. But I am an Eve Duncan fan and I am hoping there will be one last tale before Ms. Johansen completely retires Eve Duncan and Joe Quinn. As for those that didn't care for this book - try some of the Eve Duncan series - you will change your mind about this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinishable!","review":"I must read 100 books a year and I finish 99% of them, even if they don't start out very well.

(Unlike some of the others, I have not had trouble with the recipes not working as they should.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Julia brings out the best","review":"Fortunately I had browsed this book before buying it. Otherwise I might have dismissed another \\"Julia\\" related cookbook. How much can one person offer, after all? Nevertheless, she clearly was an inspiration for the bakers who participated in this combined effort. The instructions, explanations, and pictures are not only fun to read, but they work in the kitchen. The book finds a good balance between abbreviated formulas that require a wealth of experience to bring to life, and the overly chatty and often irrelevant stream of consciousness recipe descriptions that tend to pad the pages of lesser cookbooks. Select from any ten pages, and you will find the worth of buying the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't Recommend It...","review":"I would not recommend this ring to anyone in their right minds.

Bruce doing what he does best, performing live. Sound is great as it was recorded in a smaller venue, The Barrymore Theatre, excellent for up close and personal concerts.

Seriously","review":"Unfortunately I did not look at the reviews on this particular model before purchasing. It seems that this toaster has either an 'incredibly great toaster' review or like mine, don't waste your money. This toaster was completely disappointing. The toaster has nine settings and yet you burn your toast at anything over two. One side will be burnt and the other not even toasted. It also seems to devoid the bread of any moisture which for my tastes is unpleasant. Think, brick toast. I truly wish that I had kept my $10 Procter-Silex Walmart special. Spare yourself the hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"In love with this toaster! UPDATE: fell out of love...","review":"UPDATE: The toaster stopped working after about 18 mos. and of course my enthusiasm has gone way down. Luckily, I live in California and can get it replaced for free (read your booklet).Who would think you could fall in love with a toaster? We have! The features are wonderful -- easy to clean, the many choices of settings, ability to cancel with a push of a button, being able to lift the toast higher to get it out easily, and more (see item description). There's also something lovable about its red, plump, simple appearance. It's fun to have it on our counter.

I can't seem to find a toaster that really works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Cuisinart standards","review":"We were extremely disappointed with the toaster.

Otherwise, it is a nice looking unit and browns the bread evenly.However, if it is crispy \\"toast\\" that you are after, this \\"toaster\\" will disappoint you. What the Cuisinart CPT-120R produces is actually \\"hot, browned\\" bread. Not crispy toast. As much as I want to like this thing, I just cannot get used to the texture of the end product.Hopefully, this device will die as quickly as my previous Krups toaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but damaged.","review":"This toaster is very pretty, lovely bright red, and the controls appear to be user-friendly. The only problem was that upon removing it from its inner carton I discovered that the Carriage Control Lever had broken off from its mooring and nothing I could do would fasten it back on. I suppose I could have rigged up a solution, but when buying an appliance I expect it to be customer-ready, so regretfully decided that I couldn't accept it. I was sad to have to send back such a good-looking appliance because otherwise I think I might have loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design & attractive features -- but electronics sure got toasted","review":"This toaster worked great for over a month, yielding evenly browned slices; the defrost feature was particularly useful. But after 2-3 months the 'browning' dial suddenly stopped functioning so that - even at the lowest setting - the bread would keep on toasting till it turned black and smoky, and even then kept going till unplugged. After a few fire alarms, we just unplugged it. Then the 'Bagel' light came on uninvited and could not be turned off - yet without browning one side only. Not worth the hassle going thru warranty -- we're buying different make; are any still made in the USA??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plight of the Eggo Waffle","review":"Everytime I try to cook an Eggo waffle in this toaster it only \\"cooks\\" one side and by cooks I mean burns.

The first cycle made a terrible plastic burning odor. it also burned the toast. I didn't think it was odd, i had it set at the halfway mark and just thought it needed to be turned down. Not that that made any difference. I ejected the next attempt before the cycle completed and got my just overdone toast.My wife let me know a day or two later that even on the lightest setting that it would still burn.We returned it, got a replacement within a week.On the lowest setting, it was still overdone. We gave it a week and it never got better. The Kitchenaid we bought to replace it doesn't have all the buttons and settings, but at least the ones it does have work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Toaster","review":"I received this toaster as a gift, and once we adjusted to how quickly it toasts, we have been happy with it. It is well designed, the slide out crumb tray is convenient and the bright red color is great in our kitchen. The only feature that could be improved would be to have it toast the inside only of the bagel, which is what our last toaster did. Instead - the bagel setting on this one simply means it will toast longer because of the added thickness of a bagel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not made well","review":"This toaster worked great for about a year. Ran a little hot but useable. One day the lever just stopped holding the toast down. We opened it up to see if it was something simple and found that most of the operating mechanisms inside were made of flimsy plastic. We never did find the reason for the lever not working. I wouldn't waste my money on this. It just isn't well made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven toasting, poorly made","review":"From the beginning, this toaster toasted the bread more on one side than the other. You had to rotate the toast halfway through the process. I've had the toaster for about 2 years and today the lever just stopped working and won't hold the toast down. I'm pretty disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart Toaster, Red","review":"The Cuisinart CPT-120R Electronic Cool Touch 2-Slice Toaster, Red arrived on time, which was the only thing it did right.

Three fourths of the movie is typical cutesy Disney fare; the last fourth, featuring the battle between the good detective and the evil Ratigan is somewhat intense, possibly a little too intense for the very young.Mancini's score reflects this. The main title is exciting and engaging. Vincent Price's solo turns on \\"The World's Greatest Criminal Mind\\" and \\"Goodbye So Soon\\" are hilarious and melodic, in a sinister way. As an earlier reviewer stated, the Melissa Manchester addition \\"Let Me Be Good to You\\" is quite provocative for a \\"G-rated\\" family film.The \\"Big Ben Chase\\" is ominous and thrilling as the two rodents are involved in a deadly battle atop London's famous landmark. Mancini's music has never been more \\"on the mark.\\"While not up to his work on the Panther films or \\"Victor/Victoria,\\" this is still a treat for his fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great soundtrack!!","review":"This is a great CD for one of Disney's most underappreciated animated films.

If you were expecting any really interesting information, like the gauges needed to properly set the breathing pressure on a regulator, forget it, all you get is the tired old \\"better left to factory trained representatives\\" rhetoric.

Couple that trait with the way the headset will dip in audio quality when the power gets anywhere near 25% and start dropping calls long before it runs out of charge makes this less than desirable for road warriors or anyone who doesn't regular intervals to charge during the course of a day.In the end, it looks shiny and pretty but it may as well be stuffed with shreds of exotic silk -- expensive and useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Counterfeit","review":"At first, I thought that maybe this model of Motorola was cheap, but then I heard that there are counterfeits out there and so I learned more about that. I found out that the bluetooth i was sold was a COUNTERFEIT! It is really hard to tell though, you have to pay very close attention. It doesn't have the same quality as the original models do.

The product was always slow to synch up with my Motorola K1 Krazr phone, but the problem has gotten worse over time, and now the battery is practically dead. The battery's talk time is down to less than one hour, and the battery runs down within a couple days even when the headset is not even turned on. The headset often takes several minutes to synch up with my phone, even if they are placed within inches of each other, and it tends to disconnect spontaneously after a few minutes of use.The bottom line is \\"watch out\\" for this product from this vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bluetooth","review":"I purchased this due to the laws enforced in chicago where you must use a handsfree while driving, and i'm sorry i picked this one.

It's a pricey little bugger too! So one would assume the quality would be good, but its not. I also work for a retail cellular company and i see this headset returned over and over. Also many of my associates have the complaint about this product.

Pairing was okay and device itself seems fine as far as fit and looks go. Performance matters the most though and in that area it faltered. I couldn't hear anyone else who was talking to me and that was with volume turned all the way up, only if you were in a library could you hear their voice.

Great headset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little gadget to have","review":"I really like this headset - a lot. It is really great to be able to get a call while I am at a job and still be able to keep working. It is also great when I am vacuuming and can't hear the phone ring, but I can hear the little beep in my ear. It is nice while shopping or at a restaurant, if you don't mind people looking at you funny for talking to yourself. It doesn't seem to be able to go very far from the phone, though. But we are in a rural area with fairly poor reception, so don't let that deter you. I would recommend this Bluetooth headset to anyone looking for one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well pleased with Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset","review":"The person I purchased the Bluetooth headset is very pleased with it. He said if the environment is especially noisey, he has to talk quite a bit louder; however, that is probably the case with all like convienences. All in all, he gives it 4 stars because of the having to speak louder at times. Otherwise, he loves it. The sound is great on it! I am surprised to find out how clear the little guy is!

It was also very comfortable.Unfortunately,as soon as my husband asked me to speak up, that I sounded \\"muffled\\" I immediately got concerned, & with good reason. Soon my friends were telling me they thought someting was wrong with THEIR phones, because they couldn't understand me. As soon as I turned off the bluetooth & spoke on the phone, the sound problem cleared up.

It's not what it says it is. I am linked to a Pocket PC and I shouldn't have this kind of problem. There are times when I receive static just between my right ear and my leftside belt holster (My waist)... Not good. If I didn't have a real need to use it at this time, I would return it...

The voice clarity is excellent, better than the mic on my phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality for the price","review":"$40 is what I saved purchasing from Amazon rather than Cingular Wireless, where my phone is from. Excellent deal, considering the attractive style and lightness of the Motorola H700, what a great product. I have noticed one problem making it a 4 star rather than a 5 star product: The ringtone. I have paid for several fancy ringtones and assigned them to all of my friends, but when the headset is in use, all I get is an obnoxious, loud beep! beep! for my ringtone. Wow that is not cool. Other than that, ease of operation and cool design make this the one to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset","review":"I am very happy with the H700 Bluetooth headset.

I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No range and too much static","review":"I bought this headset with high hopes. I have a Jabra JX-10 and love it, but thought that the H700's \\"flip open the boom to answer\\" feature was really cool. It is, except for the fact that you have to keep the phone within two feet of the headset or there is a tremendous amount of static. My Motorola H820 has much better range,(although without the noise cancelling microphone) and my Jabra JX-10 is in a completely different league. This headset works great if you hold the phone close to the headset, but that pretty much defeats the purpose. I would not recommend the H700 to anyone. But if you want to try one, check e-bay. This p.o.s. is going on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cool works terible","review":"I have used almost every headset in the last week and the H700 looks better then any onther headset on the market but sounds the worst.

I constantly had static, even when the phone was 1 or 2 feet away from the headset. I have two friends who had the EXACT same experience. I googled this item and found many other people complaining about that it works with Motorola phones but not with non-motorola phones. I have since purchased a Jabra that works much better. I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight."},{"rating":"1","title":"try something else","review":"I suspect from all the reviews that the real culprit is quality control from the mfg. side. My h700 stopped working within the month. It would receive but not transmit. Suspect flip mike problems. Motorola is providing new one. Unfortuneately this is like being in the lottery. Will I win or not. Will find out if replacement h700 works. The vendor was also poor. I called 10 days after their one month warranty (total Joke) and they said so sorry contact motorola. You are gambling when you purchase this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the Jabra headset","review":"I bought this headset based on the folding boom for on/off control. This feature sets the H700 apart. With other headsets, you have to hold a button down for 6+ sec. This is a hassle if you are constantly on and off the headset as I am. Sound quality on this headset is also superior to the Jabra BT-350, which I had been using previously.After researching and using several bluetooth headsets, this is the best one I have found so far. Retails for $100, I got it for $42 from Amazon! What a deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near as good as the description","review":"I returned this product after two days.

No problems hearing someone or they hearing you. I like the folding (power-saving) option. To get better range, when pairing it with your phone place the H700 atleast 15 feet away.

I believe it is of very good quality for the dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound quality","review":"This is an awesome unit. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the mouth piece closes towards your face, which makes it awkward to open and close while it is on your ear. Too bad they didn't make it so it opened and closed on the outside of the unit. Other than that, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset!","review":"This is a very good headset. I've had no problems with it at all. It even arrived ahead of the scheduled date. It was so easy to set up too. I did it myself without any help from my daughter-in-law, who I usually ask to do this kind of thing for me. It's small and practically weight free. I sometimes forget I even have it on my ear. I am very satisfied with this purchase, and I recommend it to others. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't use it if they paid me!","review":"The BT headset was such a disapoinment. After buying a \\"cheap\\" model that was less than impressive, I decided to go with the name I knew and trusted (past tense) Motorola. After receiving my sexy looking new H700, I was surprised that I could not hear people clearly, nor could anyone hear me- and BT is supposed to work for up to 30 feet (or so) from the source, but if the phone was more than 2 feet, the signal started to degrade worse that it already was. Thank God that Amazon makes returning sub-standard products very easy. I will continue to use Amazon, but Motorola is off my list for BT headsets (and possibly products alltogether)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Cheaply constructed, it falls apart when just opening the microphone. It seems to drain the battery within 24 hours, even when it's turned off. Sound quality, in terms of the speaker, was good, but the microphone picks up a lot of background noise. It does fit on the ear comfortably, but if it connects to the wrong device, then I have to look online to find instructions on how to properly reset the connection. There were no instructions for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work in car, otherwise great","review":"My only complaint is a big one for me: it doesn't work in the car. Once the car gets above 35 mph, the engine noise in my 2004 model year car apparently is too loud and muffles the conversations (even if I try to talk/yell louder). I still use it around the house, and people on the other end don't even know that I am on a bluetooth set. It pairs very easily with my VX 9400. However, the real reason for getting it was for the car, and it is a disappointment that it doesn't work. I've resorted back to a wired earpiece for now while driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good for short Range","review":"This seems to work fine with my Palm Treo 650 when the phone is either on my belt or close by.

He said he has to listen very carefully in order to understand what I'm saying.I do however like the size and the comfort on my ear. However, I feel like I wasted my money.

Previously, I was had a Jabra 250 that worked fine but did not fit well into my ear and the discomfort made it miserable to use.I loved the look and fit of the H700. The audio on my end was loud and clear, but the people I was calling could barely hear me. I tried everything I could think of to clear up the sound (held mic away from face, re-paired with phone several times, etc.) to no avail. I finally had to give up and I am returning the headset.The reviews for all of these headsets seem schizophrenic - half of the people love the headset and have no problems, the other half are like me and cannot get it to work.

First, you have to program the phone to make the headset compatible each time you turn the phone or headset on/off, by going to different options and tools on the phone. Then, each time the phone is out of range from the headset, it has to be set up all over again.It's much more trouble than it's worth. Another thing I didn't like about it is that it can only be used on your right ear and is not interchangeable.

Then it disconneted from the phone and could not re-establish connection. Tried over a dozen times with both the new phone and headset fully charged. No luck. Out of disparation I reset my phone and went through all the button pushing to setup all my options and re-paired the headset. Worked for two calls and then dropped connection again.

I have had no complaints from other people about the way I sound and I can hear everyone just fine. The volume was loud enough that I could hear easily while driving my Jeep (not a very quiet vehicle).I recommended it to my mom (she has a RAZR), and she hasn't had any problems with hers either.

I have used it with the Motorola L7 and now am using it with the K1. Had no problems pairing with either handset. Sound quality is good on my end and have had no complaints to those I talk to. Headset is comfortable but those who wear glasses may have difficulty getting the headset to fit securely due to the design requiring the headset to wrap around your ear. There is only so much space between your ear and the side of your head and although this situation hasn't led to problems with functionality I would suspect most people will find it slightly awkward. On the positive the ability to turn the headset off by flipping the boom mic is very convenient. I can also pick up calls fairly rapidly from having the headset off as start up is quick enough upon flipping open.

I put my v3c down on the table walked across my room and i could hear the person perfect, and they could hear me perfectly. I havn't ever heard static once. Maybe i have the CDMA version some people talk about but i'm not sure. My friend does tell me though that my voice sounds a little muffled but everyone has said that and its no supprise, he says its a little annoying to talk to me lol. The best way he can describe it is that i sound a lot different between using the actual handset vs the h700. So i'm not sure exactly what the means but take it however you want. Thanks and thats my little mini review, Feel free to ask questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is my 2nd Motorola Bluetooth in less than a year","review":"It's not because I love them: It is because they don't last and it's easier to buy a new one than to get Motorola to honor their warranty policy. No one likes to be put on hold, especially three times. I was connected to a tech that described how to pair a bluetooth device, then I was connected to another tech who repeated the description. Wow guys, I already read the how to and had it working for a little while there...all on my own. When I told them that their quick fixes didn't work they connected me to their \\"Alaska Help Center\\" After twenty MORE minutes, I hung up. I bought new one March 19th. It has already gone kaput. They are light and nice when they work...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice- except for the battery life.","review":"Good set. Sounds good, looks good, fits good.

It works well, but has a really loud, ear-piercing \\"ping\\" when it connects.Charging this is a joke. If you leave it on the charger for more than two hours, you risk damaging it. This was explained to me by the support people. I could not find anything on the worthless manual stating this--you would think they would put it in big, bold, red letters. Better yet, they should put a regulator on the headset or charger to prevent it in the first place. The support people said they would not cover it under warranty because I did not buy it from them.If you have one, do not leave it on the charger!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels great - works lousy!","review":"I have a Jabra earpiece that is terrific, in terms of its clarity and ease of use. The problem is that it keeps falling off my ear. So, I went to a store and put on the Motorola 700. Wow! Comfortable and secure. So I ordered it. I got it today. It's terrific... as long as you don't want to use it to make phone calls. The reception was so fuzzy that I couldn't understand the person to whom I was speaking; and that person was my wife - we were both in places from where we had had many other telephone conversations (which had been clear with the Jabra). My advice. Don't buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO GREAT","review":"The Bluetooth 700, is not so great, even with a slight wind it can make it very difficult to carry a conversation. sometimes even after charging it for 3 hours, it can cut off."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems encountered","review":"I have not had difficulty with two problems that other reviewers have encountered. The first reported problem is that the microphone boom lays against one's cheek and muffles the sound. This does not occur for me - and in fact I have tried to do this and it physically won't happen for me (I'm a 6'5\\" male). The second reported problem is with very limited range. My headset works to about 15 ft. with my Treo 700w. I have no problems at all when my phone is in my pocket or in a belt holster.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the sound quality reported by the other party is a little \\"muffled.\\" Otherwise, battery life is very good, noise cancelling ok and I've had no problems linking with the Treo."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much back ground noise!","review":"Your in bound caller hears every warble, woosh and crackle.

With the phone in my right shirt pocket and the H700 on my right ear, folks only tell me I'm breaking up on about 50% of the calls. Move the phone to my left pocket, forget it. On almost every call, I have to cancel the headset and use the phone directly (which works fine).The description says up to 30 feet--I'd by happy with three feet. I have found when lying in bed with the phone resting about four inches from the headset, it works okay. The unit should come with a combo headband/case for your phone so you can wear the phone by your ear, otherwise it's worthless. Disappointed? Wish I could award it negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work","review":"the bluetooth that I purchased was no good. It did not pay to lose more money on shipping to send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"H700: a good headset depending on the price","review":"This is the first Bluetooth headset I ever owned, but I've tried a few out. The sound quality is fairly good, but I did notice for most of my calls I have to bring the volume all the way up. The noise canceling feature of the headset is pretty good for listening, but it doesn't help your caller hear you any better. The mic is fairly sensitive and had some problems while driving. I believe the mic also picks up a lot of wind noise, as I had the a complaint about the noise when I just had the AC in my car on.In general, this headset was a good deal at $50, better than any other $50 headset. Except this one normally retails at about $100. If you can find it for cheaper then I think it's a good deal for the money. If you are going to spend $100, then there are other headsets that will perform better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Currently, absolutely the best.","review":"My biggest hang up (no pun intended) is standby time. M previous bluetooth headsets neededto be recharged every few days whtrh I used it or not. Though this one has a standby time of a week or so, it will hold its charge even long when it's off. That may sound right but it does. You buy one, you'll see exactly what I mean. Also, the multicolor light and audible warnings let you knowwhen it's time to recharge. Recharge time is a couple of hours or so. In my previous life, I always found that the headset was suddenly dead when I needed it in the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal for the money","review":"I felt that this was a pretty good deal for the money. The reception is usually pretty good. My only complaint is that you can't get more than a few feet from your phone without the reception going to static.

Otherwise, it's a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset","review":"This is my first Bluetooth headset and I love it.I have used several from friends and this one works great with my BlackBerry 8300.

I was quite pleased with the old one, until after about 2 years when it just died. That was 2 years of daily service, so not an issue. But this new one has issues holding pairing with a Blackberry 8700G, and has significant voice static unless the Blackberry is on the same side of my body as the headset, and not in the holster. The old one didn't have that problem.On the positive side, the USB mini charger saves me one more power adaptor when traveling, which is a good thing. They should all have that feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"i tried the motorola h700 with 2 motorola phones (v557 & razr v3) and not only would it not stay connected to the phone (which was in my pocket or on the desk) but the sound quality was terrible-- when it didn't drop the call altogether...if i could give it less than 1 star i would."},{"rating":"1","title":"STLL WAITING","review":"BEEN WAITING FOR ALMOST 3 WEEKS AND HAVE NOT RECIVE ANYTHING....WHATS GOING ON .WOULD NOT HAVE GOT THIS IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN IIT WAS GONNA TAKE THIS LONG"},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP","review":"I ordered the Motorola H700 bluetooth on 8/29/11.

I ended up not using it hardly ever because it was such a pain to turn on and off. And it also hung a little looser, which made it very comfortable but I felt like I constantly had to hold it close to my head if I really wanted to make sure I was hearing everything. With this headset it is so simple and quick to turn on and off, I use it ALL THE TIME! And it is still very comfortable so you can wear it for long periods of time, but it fits a little more snug against your ear so you can hear comfortably with out having to hold it. I can't say enough good things about this headset!

The packaging is a generic plastic case with the merchandise shoved in UPSIDE DOWN for display and the earpiece itself in a ziplock bag inside the casing. As I said, the only reason I purchased from this vendor is because I wanted to make sure it had a brand name look - the real packaging from Motorola, etc. because this was to be a gift in a few days for our son. Now I'm faced with having to go somewhere and purchase a nice looking gift and demanding a refund. As I said, save yourself the headache and DO NOT purchase from this vendor, do not be fooled by the \\"Motorola Packaging\\" - there's nothing on it that says Motorola - all it states is Universal Bluetooth Headset - and that it's compatible with Motorola."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - NOT BY MOTOROLA - They cancelled the order!","review":"A day after I ordered and paid on Amazon, I received an email from AccessoryOne stating that they are \\"out of stock on the Retail packaged H700 headsets, but we do have the bulk packaged item in stock.\\"I wrote back saying that it's all right to ship the bulk packaged one to me as long as they can \\"guarantee that this is an original Motorola product from the manufacturer.\\"They never wrote back.

Normally used it in my car for an early morning meeting on my way to work. Driving on the Wash DC Beltway while doing the call was nearly impossible until I used the H700. The volume was quite strong that I had to turn it down sometime. Setup was pretty simple. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time or $","review":"Do not bother. I tried this unit for a few days and my callers said it was really poor quality. I tried a plantronics headset and it worked much better, but I had problems with it transferring calls on it's own.

Go with Samsung!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldn't stay in pairing mode","review":"I returned it. -- I bought it as a gift and tried to help the receiver of my gift to get it to work, but it just would not stay in pairing mode long enough to get it to link with her cell phone. It did seem like a great item though, until the pairing malfunction - very lightweight and high quality materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I had the 850 and thought that it was decent but could be better so I bought the 700. Let me just say that I own the Motorola V330 and from reading the other reviews, it seems that this headset works best with the razr. That being said, it does not work well with the v330. If you move more than 4 feet away from your phone, you get a ton of static. People tell me that I sound muffled when I'm talking to them. My advice is to only get this if you have the razr otherwise forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"I threw it out because of terrible Volume/clarity on both ends.

At arms length, the person on the other end couldn't hear me the crackling was so bad, and I have a Treo 650 (powerful phone, I would think). This device fits me well, but I can see where you may need to have a small face and slim cheeks for it not to block the mic. I like the look and feel of it, too bad it doesn't meet the expectations it creates in advertisement (i.e., \\"range of 10 meters\\" apparently means less than one meter). I'll probably keep it anyway since I paid so much for it; I'll just keep the phone on me. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst BT Headset Ever!!!","review":"I received my H700 headset today and couldn't wait for it to finish charging so I could begin using it. After charging, I easily paired it with my Treo 650 phone and made my first call. To my dismay, my wife could not hear me on her end. All she heard was static and crackling. I had to turn the headset off and call her back without it. I reset my phone and the headset several times and even removed the bluetooth pairing and re-added the headset back to my phone. All to no avail.This crappy headset produced constant static unless the phone was 1-2' from the headset. Bluetooth is supposed to work flawlessly over 15'. I have contacted Amazon to initiate a return and exchange. If the second headset is the same, I am going back to Jabra.For the price, this headset is the worst buy ever. Heck, even for $5, this headset would be a ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Like My Old One","review":"I bought this bluetooth from Dbroth through Amazon. It seemed to work fine, as I have had this model before and loved it. However, I soon realized that it wasn't able to answer incoming calls by pressing the headset button. Nothing by dead silence. I emailed the seller and they assured me that they would replace it if I sent if back. Did it and got an email stating they had received it and a new one would be shipped to me. After a couple of weeks, I contacted the seller. They informed me that they had no more in stock and would refund my payment. That's fine but why are they still advertising them as \\"in stock\\" on Amazon. In any case, the headset was not as sturdy as my previous one, apparently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't answer incoming calls","review":"Wish the product was solid as the packaging - you need a pair of heavy duty scissors to open it.

I do find I need to charge it more than I would like but I have not had any problems with this model. The boom-mike hitting the cheek has not been an issue even though reported several times in reviews.I don't like seeing people with huge Bluetooth devices as it looks as if they have something cancerous protruding from their ear. Not the case with this device. It is small enough so that it is less revealing. I am concerned that it is not 2.0. I believe that does not affect me now but could in the future. I like the compact nature, the color, the quality sound. I read the reviews and pulled the trigger on this one. It was the right decision. All in all, I am VERY PLEASED with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleek and sexy on looks falls way short on performance","review":"I am really beginning to hate Bluetooth headsets. I read the reviews of this headset and thought I finally had found a device that would actually work and not sound like I am talking into a tin can. After using this device for 3 months now I hate it. I am pairing the headset to a Motorola RAZR and the connection rarely works well and there is a stupid bug in the headset that causes the phone to make random calls to the last person I dialed. The only way to solve this problem is to not allow the device to automatically pair to the phone when in range. What a stupid waste of time when I go to use it I have to follow the prompts on the phone to allow the device to connect then I can make a phone call. Don't waste your time (and money) with this headset"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good when and while it works","review":"I bought this product exactly one year ago to use with my Razor V3. For the first six months, it generally worked just fine. I used it often for 3-hour conference calls. At about six months, the battery became odd. Maybe I wore it out. Some days, it functioned just as new. Other days, it'd run only a few minutes. Finally last night after a fresh charge, it would only run for about a minute at the time. I restarted it five times before crushing it under my boot. It now lies in several pieces in a Georgia landfill. I will replace it tomorrow, surely with a different model, perhaps with a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorola H700","review":"This headset is really easy to set up and use. Since my phone does not have voice dialing, I can't use the headset to voice dial. I have to dial the number on my phone and then talk using the headset. The volume is good and people can actually hear me too. This headset was $80 in radio shack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't keep this one long","review":"I purchased this headset to replace an older model I had lost somewhere. The older one was a little bit larger and I thought this smaller model would be more convenient. The sound quality is poor to fair, with a lot of crackling and static type noise. And I often have to ask my callers to repeat themselves, even tho the volume on the headset is up all the way. On top of the poor sound quality, it is very uncomfortable, and I can't wear it long without having to give my ear a break. My other unit (which had a longer mouth piece - more like the HS850) was much more comfortable; in fact, I often forgot I even had it on. I'll replace this unit soon, but I'll be shopping at a phone store, where I can actually try the unit before I buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Tooth","review":"Works excellent, this is my 4th Bluetooth. I had many problems with the others but with this. I recommended this model to other friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the money","review":"Generally very good. Very light weight and very good sound quality. Static only when battery is low. My wife reversed hers to be on the left ear and it works great in the reversed direction. Voice dialing profile capable phones work well with this also.Occasionally goofiness of the headset and the phone un-pairing, but not sure if that's the phone or this headset. However, this hasn't been a big problem.Very good price at Amazon compared to everywhere else.Uses the same charger (mini-USB) that many cameras, Motorola phones and other devices do, so you can use an existing charger, or the included one (i.e. get a spare out of the deal here!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I have a Sprint Treo 700, so this is not a perfect match for my handheld. Of all the bluetooth devices a looked at, this was the best fit in terms of size and comfort. Connectivity is good, and I rarely get static. The set up is simple. You can't use voice dial directly through the head set, but that's minor. I can access the voice dial through the phone, then turn on the head set. Overall, a good unit for the price, small, and comfortable, provided you don't wear it all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the bunch?","review":"It's the first one I've ever used but I read these reviews carefully. The battery doesn't last long, maybe because of the noise cancelling but also because I've got it turned up almost all the way, because its volume more than makes up for the low volume of my Cingular 8125 PC/phone. Volume controls are intuitive -- figured them out w/o reading the manual. Took me 2 tries to sync the Bluetooth but it was my fault and 2nd time worked flawlessly. Hangs on my ear OK -- doesn't feel 100% secure but hasn't fallen off yet. Would be nice if they made a little case for it that doesn't hold the button down and discharge it. Right now I just have it stashed in a little bubble-wrap envelope. TIP: if you use it for voice-activated dialing, record the voice tag using this rather than directly into your phone; seems like it recognizes the voice tags better that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works for me.","review":"I got this so I can talk and drive. It serves its purpose well. I use it with a RAZR and the voice commands are great. Easy to use. The only problem I have run into so far is occasionally I forget it is still on my ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE IT","review":"When I received my Bluetooth, I was very happy with it. The sound quality was very good, and it was nice and sleek, not bulky like the others being sold. However, the material is very cheap.

While talking on this you always sound like you are far away in a tunnel. It is just never as loud as talking on the phone normally; plus listening can be quite difficult, especially in the car. The headset claims to have noise cancellation, but it does not seem to make a difference. If your phone normally gets poor reception, the quality of this headset will amplify those problems both for talking and listening.I've owned 2 of these (returned the first one b/c quality was so bad) and know 2 other people with this headset; we've all had the same experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbled voice","review":"I am disappointed at the sound quality of this headset.

I guess not, because it never was and I never got a real explanation as to why. I have a new model of a Samsung phone, which was listed as compatible with this headset. So why didn't it ever work? If the headset was more than one foot from my phone, the reception got fuzzy. If it was more than 4 feet away, it didn't work at all. What a joke!

Not so quick...it began a series of feeder problems that made the blank pages preferable!These problems weren't only constant, but seemed to come up at the most inconvenient times.

TURN THE PRINTER OFF when you're not using it. Don't leave it on for extended periods of time.2. You MUST print a few pages and/or run a cleaning cycle at least once a month, if not more, to keep the ink from drying up in the waste ink hoses, which is the source of the worst clogs.It's a bit involved to repair yourself, but it can be done.

Less than 1 Star piece of junk","review":"Like a previous reviewer, we purchased this printer from Tiger Direct about 8 months ago and have now replaced the ink cartridges 3 times since the original ones that came with the printer. We print a few pages per month, and very rarely print pictures. It seemed like a good value at the time, but we've now spent $150 in ink and the printer doesn't print in color...online tech support recommends changing the ink cartridges (they're 3/4 full). Instead of spending the money on more ink, we'll be buying a non-Epson printer. After doing some research, it appears that Epson has changed the way their ink cartridges operate. There is a chip in them that makes the ink expire in 4 months to force you to change your cartridges whether you use it up or not and there is no way to save the ink!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great, but not excellent","review":"well i cant complain at all. i pluged it in, it worked flawlessly, i updated the drivers and no problem. the hp site is simple and easy to get around in. scanning, copying and printing all work great.now the one thing that others have complained about, the cleaning of the head. if you use the printer everyday you wont have a problem with it. but if you let it sit for like a week and then use it, you will have to clean the head a few times before it starts to print again flawlessly. so had hp done a better job with that, then it would be perfect, but for 60 bucks i cant complain to much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Printing in 5 Months","review":"This is the second Epson all-in-one printer I purchased in the last year that has just stopped printing.

I don't know anything about Chinese culture or whether or not any of the traditions are even accurate, but when it comes down to it, it's just a book.

I'll stick to reviewing the Audio version, which was new to me. Marcia Gay Harden gives a wonderful read here, very tender and motherly - as if you're right there on her lap. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful and sets the tone for the story. I also really loved the addition of sound effects (the wash of the river, the splash at the bottom of the well, etc.). It's one thing to sit there listening with your kids, watching them imagine the narrative...but the look on their faces when they hear that big splash is priceless! I look forward to future book and CD releases from Macmillan and recommend this to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propogates stereotypes, incorrect Chinese meanings","review":"Yes, tikki tikki tembo, is a catchy phrase, but so are alot of things that are/were not really worthwhile teaching our children. Its 2010, let's teach our kids about other cultures and their stories in an illuminating (and moderately accurate) way. Even if the author had gotten all the Chinese meanings right (they are not even close), you can tell that she is not of Chinese background. Try authors like Karen Chinn, Ernie Chan and HongYing Yang, if you'd like to open your kids eyes to another culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rhythmic Story, but a little inaccurate","review":"I think any child would love to hear the rhythm of saying Tikki Tikki Tembo's entire name. I would say that this aspect of the book makes it the most memorable. Aside from that, I would say, as a college student, I find many inaccuracies regarding the Chinese culture in this book. Firstly, the attire is more akin to the Japanese culture, and the name Tikki Tikki Tembo is rather misleading. I also feel that the indifference that the mother feels toward Chang may lead a child to believe that a second or third born is considered \\"little or nothing\\". I would recommend this book in terms of entertainment, but not for educational value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic Fun!","review":"After recently finding a copy of this childhood treasure in my attic, I was reminded of how much I loved having this story read to me as a child.This book was read to me over 30 years ago. Ironically, I was even able to recite Tikki's entire full name without having to peer inside the book. Talk about lasting impressions!This is a great classic for parents to read to their young children and there is something very warm and appealing about about the story, and the simple illustrations that will captivate your child's heart.It's refreshing to see that this enjoyable book is still available and being read to children."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a mouth full...","review":"Over the years, the kids have loved this one so much that we've had to buy several copies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real treasure I am sharing with my daughter.","review":"This was my favorite book as a child. This book came with a 45 record in the back sleeve. I have fond memories listening to the record and following along with the pictures. When my daughter was born, Tikki Tikki Tembo was the first book I bought her. We now share this fond memory. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite The Way I Remember It","review":"I vaguely remembered this book from childhood, and was delighted when I saw it at our children's library, but decided not to take it out after I reread it. Though the refrain of \\"Rikki Tikki Tembo\\" is very fun, the book really does have a pretty unpleasant premise. I really did not feel the unappreciated and unloved second brother theme was something I wanted my kids to read about, especially as there is no change or any sort of redemption for this son within the tale at all. I think that even my 4 year old would pick up on this. I'm generally not a protective or necessarily PC mom, but this book is going to stay on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but inaccurate","review":"Tikki Tikki Tembo has a beautiful and fun name to say. However, that is where my praise of the book ends. The illustrations are lacking, not to mention inaccurate. A seemingly uncaring mother obviously favoring one son over the other is the main thing that stands out in my mind after having read this book. Perhaps my biggest problem with this text is the sweeping generalization it ends with, \\"from that day to this, the Chinese have always thought it wise to give their children little, short names, instead of great long names.\\" I believe it is important to eduate and expose children to cultures outside of their own. However, we must do so in a way that promotes their curiousity and an accurate understanding. Multicultural literature can be a wonderful tool in the classroom as well as the home, when used properly; Tikki Tikki Tembo will be left out of my toolbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like I remember","review":"I looked for this book after talking with a friend about our favorite books as kids.

I am not sure anyone else had the chance to read it that year, as I checked it out numerous times.I am excited to read it to my own children now, and I hope that they will love the story as much as I did.A definite MUST HAVE for a classic children's library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pros and Cons","review":"There are elements of the book that I both like and dislike. The book's best quality is that it is entertaining. It has a lyrical tone that is catchy to people of all ages, especially young children. If you are looking for a book that is going to excite your youngster and make him/her sing and dance, Tikki Tikki Tembo is a good pick. However, if you want your children to be able to learn something from what they read, this is not the book for you. Tikki Tikki Tembo is controversial from a scholarly standpoint because of its cultural inaccuracies and stereotypes. The illustrations in the book also leave something to be desired. Basically, whether you will like this book or not depends on what you are looking to accomplish by reading it. Personally, this book will not make it to my children's shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable teaching material","review":"With so many books that offer rhyme patterns and beautiful illustrations, I cannot recommend this book simply because it lacks a strong teaching/moral component.The second son is ignored, mistreated and called \\"nothing\\". The first son is glorified and given his proud name. So much time is spent idolizing the first son, but when the first son falls in the well and is rescued by his younger brother, there is (in the story) the slightest blip of change, but never an apology or an outpouring of love for the second son (just relief that the first son is alive).Beyond that, it leads the listener to believe that this name practice existed in Asia. This is not an Asian folk tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinese story with Japanese shoes?","review":"The only negative aspect of this book are the Japanese shoes illustrated on the Chinese children.This is a great story about the boy with the very long name and his brother who gets tired and winded trying to tell his mother that Tikki Tikki Tembo no sarembo chari bari ruchi pip peri pembo has fallen in the well. I grew up with this story and was especially pleased when my 2 1/2 year old daughter loved it as much as Cat in the Hat (I was getting tired of reading that one over and over!) One other draw back-my husband doesn't like saying the long name of Tikki Tikki Tembo and would prefer Cat in the Hat. Eh, personal preference!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful message!","review":"This book sends an awful message about the value of children in the birth order -- the mother goes on and on about her most honored first born, and treats her second born horribly. I read this to my daughter once, and then threw it out. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I cannot believe this book got such high ratings. If I could rate it a \\"0\\" I would.I checked this book out from the library and thankfully looked it over before reading it to my two boys. Why would a childrens story book be about the first born being honored and revered and the second one treated horribly? I just didn't find it appropriate for our family at all. My kids would definitely pick up on this.Sure the older boys name is cute and fun to say, and I can get over the Asian inaccuracies as others mentioned, but a Mothers favoritism in a child's story isn't appropriate at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible story","review":"I took this book out of the library because I had read it is a children's classic. Thank goodness I read it first before I read it to my 3 year old son. The story is just awful focusing on the importance of the firstborn son and discrediting the younger boy. I was appalled that such a revered book included both children having near drowning episodes and CPR! I would not recommend this to anyone as I think the moral of the story is so negative and debilitating to children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect title","review":"The original name of this book is not Tikki Tikki Tembo, it's Rikki Tikki Tembo. I dunno why I got so irked that the name was mispelled but this was one of my most beloved stories to read as a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sends an awful message to children","review":"I do not want to question the intention of the author, but this book clearly sends a very bad message to children, teach them terrible values, and might create serious emotional problems in them.The book talks about parents who value their first born by giving him a more superior name than their later children, which will be given bad names. It's clear that the parents in this story loved takki takki alot more than his other brother, which is considered nothing to those parents. Teaching these values to children will sure give them the wrong idea about themselves and their parents. It is either the older child will be arrogant or a younger child who will lose confidence in self or in his/her parents love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids are smarter than you think","review":"This is a great book. The honored brother gets a grand name and ends up suffering for it. The ignored brother gets a meaningless name , but doesn't suffer and even is heroic. Plus you get to say a funny name over and over.That what kids will enjoy and that's what I remembered 35 years later. As far as historical accuracy or sibling rivalry or even racial stereotypes who cares. If this book causes your child to think in any of those ways you have a lot bigger problems than a politically incorrect book. You would have to throw out all classic childrens books, fairy tales, nursery rhymes, and also most disney movies to avoid any unpleasant reminders of the real world. Kids see through that stuff and get right to the guts of a story, only adults worry over or glorify the bad parts. Bottom line it's a fun book ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I got this book for my 5 year old son for Christmas, he loves it and has a blast trying to repeat the long name of the main character.

An unexpected family treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A post-modern review","review":"The language in this book is easy to understand. The author presents a fairly good grasp and understanding of book magick and post-modernism. The systems he presents are intriguing, but I would've liked to have seen each of the systems more developed in this booklet. Also the Ad&D compedium of spells once again didn't exactly work for me.

I want Seth's other books, but at the price and size they'll have to wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoko Ono, screaming, rock'n'roll, etc.","review":"I cannot begin to describe the brilliance of this album. Suffice to say that HELTER SKELTER is nothing compared to WHY, in terms of sheer energy, pain, and vocal torture. GREENFIELD MORNING, ETC. is dreamy, like a lullaby almost. The bonus tracks are good too, especially THE SOUTH WIND which is probably the best track on the album. I've always thought that Yoko was better at screaming than singing, and it stands to reason that this album, which contains no lyrics, is her best by far. John Lennon, with all his screaming in MOTHER and WELL WELL WELL, didn't do half of what Yoko does in the first ten seconds of WHY as she comes in (not to say that John wasn't completely brilliant as well, it's just not his thing). It's beyond the pinnacle of perfection......I heard a scream from the mountain....The Dalai Lama dying in green flamesLightning struck gold in New York CityAnd Yoko came from the clouds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hippies hate this!","review":"I first listened to this in the early 70's while I worked as a volunteer at an alternative community called Arcosanti. At that time, the place was filled with hippies. So, just to test how open to true alternative music these folks would be, I played it LOUD in the community room. The hippies really did hate it. One of them finally got up and took the needle off the record. This music is the precursor to the No Wave movement 8 years later. If you like this, you should check out current bands like Melt Banana, Deerhoof and early Blonde Redhead."},{"rating":"2","title":"still a good album","review":"Most people will hate this album, after all it features yoko screetching and snorting and soaring over Lennon's hard line guitar and Ringo's solid drumming. mmmmThere are other explorations here with rhythm and voice. Most of the time Ono manages to sound like a synthesiser, and to stretch what people could do with their voices on rock records. Sure not all the album is great - the 16 minute bonus track south wind could have easily been left in her apartment where it was made, and AOS sounds like almost everyother peice of sixties avante guarde. But that still leaves you a lot of passionate noise and rythm.Anyone who likes experimental rock should have this in their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat S*&% all you negative reviewers","review":"What's not to like about Yoko. She's like no other, unique, creative, and not afraid to churn out new material over and over, after all these closed minded reviewers that continously bash her to death.

She's very interesting to listen to....and bless her for keeping John's spirit alive since his tragic Death...I just think she's amazing...i love her music so much because it's so different from anything you hear today or any other time..and to me, someone that can do that is extremely talented.

What sounds does a cat make when caught in machinery? What does a baby crying incessantly sound like when played backwards? What does a coven of witches sound like when being burned at the stake? If you need answers to these questions look no further.John Lennon, Klaus Voorman, Ringo Starr, Ornette Colman and Charlie Haden cannot overcome the vocal noises made by Yoko (there are no lyrics).

If you buy this expecting to hear melodies that sound like \\"penny lane\\" you'll most likely be disappointed. I love this cd and I think it complements Lennon's Ono band cd nicely. It also stands up favorably to McCartney's 1st solo effort, as well as \\"All Things Must Pass\\" by George Harrison. Sometimes music is more than pretty meolodies and beach boy harmonies. Sometimes it must relflect anguish, anger, fear, and outrage. I think this cd accomplishes this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Incredible.

I had to review when i saw someone compare this favorably to Sgt. Peppers and another reviewer say Why not was better than helter skelter. For the record: though this has some great backing tracks, yoko's voice is barely listenable.

Several tracks would be interesting, \\"Why,\\" for starters, if she'd just stop screaming over the mix.This is really more valuable to the collector of Beatle-ish stuff. Released as a sister-LP to Lennon's album of the same name, Yoko's PLASTIC ONO BAND serves only to point out that, while Lennon was stepping away from the Pop center, there was certainly a long way to go before he reached the outer limits."},{"rating":"1","title":"An album of screaming by the woman who broke up The Beatles","review":"For this Lennon traded away The Beatles?

She had no experience writing songs, and yet she had just been forced into the music industry. This and it's followup \\"Fly\\" are more of the avant-garde Ono \\"Pieces\\" than music.

Don't believe it. That is just bull that Yoko's publicity machine has put out to make her seem to be a misunderstood artist who allegedly was way ahead of her time.Let's face it, if she werent' married to John Lennon, no one would have ever permitted her to record this trash, much less try to sell it to an innocent, unsuspecting public.The world lost a great entertainer the night John Lennon was murdered, but John's unfortunate passing does not suddenly make Yoko a talent. This album was garbage when first released, and it is still garbage today.I would give it 0 stars if I could.

There is nothing here even worth reviewing individually. Yoko's albums would NEVER have been released if not for the Lennon connection, and much of Lennon's output would not have been as lame as it is if not for the Ono influence. He gave her exposure, and she brought the level of his music down to a new low.

I live out in the Bookdocks and had simply assumed Amazon would carry the cheaper price. However, after I had ordered the hook, I found the same hook at a local hardware store for about $2 cheaper. So... Check your (family-owned) local hardware store before you buy from Amazon.

It does hold virtually any tool, as advertised, BUT:1. When not in use, the belt hook continually snags on objects. Even if you fold it in, it works its way out and becomes an annoyance.2. The wire hook that holds your $200+ cordless tool bends rather easily when snagged, and can result in a dropped tool.3. The cheap plastic swivel and rivet arrangement that transfers all of the weight of the tool from the wire hook to the spring steel belt clip BREAKS easily.All in all, this clip is NOT recommended. The versatility is nice, but the quality of construction/materials and overall performance just don't make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too crazy about this item","review":"The first problem I had with this item was that it kept sliding down my tool belt and finally the clip bent so that it didn't grip any longer.

Morrissey gave us hope and inspiration. We found solice in the knowledge that we were understood. Unfortunately, his attempts to \\"break new ground\\" with \\"Southpaw Grammar\\" and \\"Maladjusted\\" strayed from the vein of inspiration that spoke to us in an intimate way. It seems that 7 years of separation from the industry has brought back the inspiration of the 80's. \\"You Are the Quarry\\" has that \\"magic\\". Its mixture of curious lyrics and tickling melodies only gets better the more you listen. Morrissey's voice somehow sounds better than ever; his smooth vibrato delicately soothes the soul and balms ones mental wounds. The poetry in lyrics will inspire a whole new generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Sounded Better","review":"He's back, he's middle-aged, and he's as pissy as ever. That's the good news on Morrissey's You Are the Quarry. The music is standard issue alternative - not a bad thing, since Moz is responsible for the blueprint. The lyrics run the gamut from Wildean witticisms to woe-is-me. And it all coheres for one essential reason: Morrissey has never sounded better. He's nearly like one of those 50's balladeers that he's lovingly depicted on other records - a slightly anonymous yet stirring performer, in touch with both the superficial trappings and the emotional depths, aware that fame could disappear at any time, which would make him as lonely as he's always insisted. There's certainly no love lost between him and England (\\"Irish Blood, English Heart\\"). Now he takes on the lesbians (\\"All the Lazy Dykes\\") and a bigger target: America. \\"America Is Not the World\\" he opines. It seems that Morrissey is. And for 12 songs, you might just believe him."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Moz still rocks","review":"Although some songs were a bit of a dissapointment for me (\\"I Like You\\" & Come Back to Camden\\") the rest of the album rolls you over.

I found it to be too over-the-top-self-indulgent, for my taste, and lyrically rambling.

I think Morrissey is a phenomenal talent, but many songs on this CD made me cringe. \\"I'm Not Sorry\\" , however, is the sole exception.

Morrissey is ultimately a good Bowie/Bolan/Ferry immitator. (Of course, he denies this, but after all, he even brought in Ronson to Bowieize his one truly classic album, \\"Your Arsenal\\".) . The problem with this album isn't the usual sophomoric lyrics, it's that it sounds like outtakes from the last three albums. It's not terrible, not quite good, just forgetable and irrelevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in form, a bit mouthy though.","review":"It took a few tries to like this disc but now I love it.

Just leave the USA if you hate it so much Moz.Ok that said, great album and I love Morrissey anyways. \\"I Have Forgiven Jesus\\", \\"I'm Not Sorry\\", and \\"The Last Of The Gang To Die\\" are great songs. I do notice that if you true fans listen to \\"Alma Matters\\" that that's really the same song as \\"Last Of The Gand To Die\\". Same music. Changes are the same and a few riff as well. Still good song though.Morrissey has finally done some good work here since his Right bashing \\"Your Arsenal\\". I do suggest buying this album. And I hope Moz finds his way soon.

The music is not quirky Morrissey, and it starts early with the first track which is a clear attack on America's influence. It doesn't matter whether you agree with his message, it is not Morrissey's style and it clearly shows.The CD was not quirky, but serious. Sadly, without Morrissey's off-the-wall lyrics, his music is dull, even painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst solo effort yet....","review":"Save your money and buy a Smiths record. This is the worst Morrissey CD to date. Morrissey always had good stuff and I figured after such a long holiday from the studio this one would kill but it flat out stinks.

It looks awful, there is virtually no paint left on it, the table board and the out feed table are full of knicks, dings, and oops cuts. In addition to use as a saw, it gets used as a workbench, utility horse, mitre saw stand, and lunch table. Through out all the years of job site use, and sometimes abuse, it is still very acurate and holds it's square as well as the day it was new!

Ninty-five percent of the time our crews request the lighter Rousseau/Makita combinations. Easy set-up and portability usually win the day for everything but the heavest work. We have investigated both the new, wheeled Bosch and DeWalt job saws and while they are excellent tools their lesser capacity and lack of an outfeed table make them not as useful. We are often cutting heavy MDF or plywood sheets and the extra support and stability of the Reusseau combination works better than awkward roller supports or getting another carpenter to \\"catch\\" the outfeed.

This is a fine, well contructed table. I like the way it folds - but even better, how sturdy it is when erected. This table does not shake or wobble as you might expect a folding table to do.I have two areas of criticism:1. I have a 2703 Makita saw and ordered the right table model. This saw 'drops in' but is not perfectly level with the table surface. It is ok for the framing and trim work I have done, but finer, cabinet work could be an issue.2. The rip fence is very sturdy and was one of the reasons I wanted this table. The Makita fence is not great. However, I find I have to 'play' with the fence to get it to lock where I want. The fence tends to 'jump' slightly as you lock it. This is frustrating to deal with.

Had to have one. I sold my Craftsman and my Porter Cable shop size saws and am still using my Makita saw in my Rousseou saw stand I bought in 1992. This is my work horse. I first built my own extension table and later puchased the matching extension for my saw stand. I have built cabinets and many other items with this system.

So I paid about $4 per track of music, that I would listen to on an MP3 player.

A real go to when I want a good Romance novel. This book was especially disappointing. The title has nothing to do with the book since the smuggler is the lady. The heroine, Merrie Trelawny, is annoying and I found her to be pretty stupid. Lord Rutherford seems to be too much of a push over to let her walk all over him. The first half of the book was very tedious. I thought it would pick up in the second half- once they went to London. I'm not even finished with it yet, and I'm finding it very difficult to finish. The London part isn't much better with all of Merrie's stupid reasons for refusing to let Damian give her anything. A truly disappointing read so far and from what I'm reading from the other reviews, it won't get much better. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy it. Jane Feather has a lot better books out there.

Very speedy and the keyboard is absolutely fantastic. The build quality is excellent and the aluminum casing exudes class. Compared to the first 12-inch PowerBook, it runs cooler and is quite a bit snappier. Plus it supports DVI out and USB 2.That said, its battery life and Airport range are not quite as good as an iBook's.

My old Microsoft wired optical mouse was fine on the same surface. I seem to have good connection and battery, but can't continue to fight with this thing. I'm plugging in my wired mouse.

Only the slightest hint of lag, noticeable in games but non-existent anywhere else. Tilt wheel is a useless gimmick, even a disadvantage. The whole wheel feels weird with fluid STEPLESS rotation which makes it TOTALLY NOT suitable for FPS games: it's overly sensitive, so sometimes you TOUCH it by accident and find the next (or previous) weapon in your hands, very frustrating in the middle of a fight, and because if the same reasons, you can't really make use of the middle mouse button in games (or more likely anywhere), the button needs a very firm press to begin with which is discouraging. I would say the whole wheel (scroll, tilt and button) are the mouse's drawback, may be the only. M$ should ditch the gimmick wheel in favor of something more practical and pleasant to use. How about the wheel that was on the original intellimouse with intellieye? IMO that is THE wheet to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mouse I have ever used","review":"This mouse is very responsive, great feel in your hand, excellent battery life and looks great.I have had this mouse at work for 5 months and the battery level is still almost full and I use it 8 hours a day 5 days a week. I used the high end logitech and the shape just didnt feel a quarter as good as this mouse. The sideways scroll is great for use in excel spreadsheets but nothing else really.People this mouse is not for a laptop, the size of the receiver would defeat the purpose of use with a laptop there are better solutions available with smaller wireless mice for laptops.This mouse is great in games, yes the scroll button is hard at first to swtich weapons but when you get used to it, it is smooth and very nice to use.I would definately buy another one of these mice."},{"rating":"2","title":"great mouse","review":"I have had this for 7 months now and have yet to change the battery,and it's performed perfect.I am online most the day every day working or browing the web and the smooth scoll is a nice feature to have.Once had a logitech but it broke down on me after a about 2 months.It is also very comfy to hold.Worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love My Mouse!","review":"It's wonderful not to have to deal with my mouse cord catching on the edge of my desk.

This is my first wireless mouse, so I can't compare it with anything. I have put the transmitter on my computer, which is about 2 feet away and 1.5 feet above where I use the mouse. So far it works well without 'warping'.Update:Some people may feel that using wheel of this mouse may feel very vague; it scrolls fast, but it is a bit too slippery and loose-fitted. Also, you better use the mouse quite close to receiver, otherwise it may be showing jumps. It would have been great if there was battery indicator.

After many miles of use, the scroll wheel has finally started to fail. I can now spin the wheel several times before the screen actually scrolls. The best feature of this mouse is the battery life. A coworker who swears by his Logitech mouse would change his batteries every couple of months, but I usually got at least ten months out of mine. I even took to dating the batteries when I installed them, just to rub it in.This mouse is a bit heavy and does not slide as well as some, but overall I would recommend it.Going to try a rechargable Logitech next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 1 year","review":"I bought this mouse about one year ago, and I used to love it, even if it needs new batteries every 2-3 months, but now it's starting to die, the left click button and the signal are failing, sometimes I can't click anything at all, I've replaced the batteries 3 times and it's still malfunctioning, I had high hopes for this mouse :(, so buy it if you don't expect to keep it for longer than 1 yearPS: do not buy it if you're planning to use it for a laptop, this thing is huge (it fits my average size male hands perfectly), not portable at all, and the signal receiver is also huge, it looks like another mouse, I didn't know where to put it since its so huge and ugly looking.

My mouse just stared working funny, sometimes it doesn't register my left click, sometimes it registers it as a double click, so I'm here to replace it.

His music is a mix of traditional styles from around the world (although with a heavy Scottish slant)melded with varied techno/trance rhythms. It's harder and more interesting than your run-of-the-mill celtic-with-a-beat. He somehow manages to be both mature and playful at the same time.

What can only be described as vomit expressed in the form of music. This album would have been funny if released as a practical joke or as an 'up yours' to a record company after an acrimonious contractual dispute.

From someone who got stuck with this expensive trash, take this advice: don't buy Two Virgins, Life With the Lions, or Wedding album.

I thought it was a MUSICAL album, cover aside. What I found inside was nothing but noise. It is a shame that John and Yoko felt compelled to push this bunch of junk on an unsuspecting public and charge for it at that!

I understand that expirimentation is required for music to progress, but that by no means makes it a good album.Listening to this recording will expose people to bizarre vocal whistles, grunts, and miscellania from both Ono and Lennon. Any background music is seemingly both incidental and random. I apologize to any Yoko fans, but her wailing here does nothing but annoy.

I was thrilled by what I heard. The sounds, the pictures that this creates is amazing. It is 28 or so minutes documenting what would happen if you put John and Yoko in a studio together. Still, this all did leave me wanting more. Then, the bonus track came on. It was sealed. Two Virgins, the CD release, is a five star piece. Anyone who does not like Yoko's music will not like this.

Perhaps some avant garde types can convince themselves that this is some brilliant achievement, but for someone looking for music this is trash.

I think it's kind of sweet that John and Yoko recorded this before they consumated their relationship. I may be one of the few who like Yoko's music, but I don't care. Revolution #9 off the White Album, this album, and Life with the Lions are really good.

If this was recorded by anyone other than John Lennon, it would never had been published let alone received the praise that it has from the \\"critics\\" that label it as pure genius. If I were to record a half hour's worth of noise and try to sell it, labeling it as unrefined genius, I would be the laughing stock of the whole midwest. When Lennon and Ono recorded it though, they were hailed as visionaries. Whatever.

If it is it's because it's in an incomphrensible musical langauge. The cover was the only thing this album was notable for--a nude portrait of a couple who had found love. It created controversy (EMI didn't want to distribute it). As avant-garde its too simplistic as music it's a disaster. Avoid unless you must have everything (including every fart, belch and toe nail trimming) from Lennon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh????????","review":"Two Virgins was an experimental journey into an avant-garde world of psychedelic sounds, snippets, piano pecking and John's and Yoko's screams and howls.

So, like a dummy I laid out good money for what is TOTAL GARBAGE.Noise. Junk. Offal. Piffle. You pick the negatory noun.The photos are ugly. The recordings are uglier.

Maybe it's because, like one said, they've got this vengeance complex against her for \\"breaking up the Beatles.\\" Or maybe it's something more innocent like not appreciating the avant garde or experimental (which I completely understand). I'd like now to lend a voice to the minority group of those in favor: This record and YOKO ONO/PLASTIC ONO BAND are unadulterated masterpieces to my ears. Ono and Lennon brought out the best in each other on these records. This stuff never gets tiresome to me.

Two nice features of this Ionic Pro are that it operates in total silence. The other feature is that there are no filters that need to be replaced, which should make this unit more cost efficient. Although I haven't had to do so yet, there is an inherent danger of residual electricity in the collection rods that must be discharged before touching them to clean them!

So I coud not tell how good or bad they are. But the product is good for the price. It eliminates the musty smell in the room with ions, and gives the fresh feeling.But if you're really looking for purifing the air , then you have to get a powerful regular air purifier (like honeywell). I have both. Ionic pro and a traditional large volume honeywell air purifier. Together it does the job well.I would recommend the product. I usually leave it on in the day time with my bedroom aired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke","review":"Ok, I have to flip flop from my previous review. It was working good, but just the other day after cleaning the plates and being sure to follow instructions of how to insert them correctly, the device doesn't work anymore. No lights no nothing. I've tried a few different things to get it to work, but without success. Its dead. The reliability of this product is now questionable in my view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ozone Generator","review":"This thing is literally an ozone generator. I turned it on and immediately was hit in the face with a wall of ozone. Within minutes there was so much ozone in the room, I had to shut it off. Even on low setting, I can't go to sleep. If you are looking for a good ozone generator, buy this. If you want an air purifier, get one with a blower motor and an air filter. Forget the \\"ionic\\" type. And that includes the Orick. They don't work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ionic Pro is noisy.","review":"When I first bought the Inoic Pro I was really happy with the product. We had just finished construction in the house and the Inoic Pro really cleaned up the dust. However, about 1-2 months later, the my Ionic Pro started to make little static noises. Eventually, the noises became more persistent and non-stop. While the Inoic Pro works, it's to0 noisy to leave on, it almost sounds like one of those blue light bug zappers you use during the summer and the Inoic Pro is zapping a bug every 30 seconds. I really hope that there is a way to complain to the manufacturer of this problem because for the price, it really would have been a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is a fire hazard","review":"While my ionic pro worked great for a month, it started making buzzing noises that have prgressively gotten worse.

Don't keep this product plugged in if you are not in the house, it is a definite fire hazard"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy an Ionic Breeze Instead","review":"I have an ionic breeze and an ionic pro, i wish i hadnt wasted my money on an ionic pro and got 2 ionic breezes. The Pro needs to be cleaned twice as frequently as the breeze, not becasue it collects more (actually it collects much less) but because it starts sparking in its chamber if theres a little dust on the collection grid. My breeze collects more, never sparks and works totally silently. Save yourself aggrevation go with the Ionic Breeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate pollen","review":"Wow! This really works!

Not knowing much about ionic air purifiers, except from the advertisements ontelevision, it seemed to be a good idea. I ran the machine for about 2 hours and got a bad headache and started to feel ill, also the machine emitted a bad smell while running it. (The plastic housing also smells bad). After reading the manual that came with it, it warns that you shouldcheck with your doctor if you have any medical problems, such as asthma, as the ozone that it emits is dangerous for people with asthma and other respitory problems. Consumer Reports magazine gave ionic air purifiers a bad review. (The headache went away when I turned off the machine and opened a window)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is not worth your money","review":"The Ionic Pro did not do what it is suppose to do. It makes too much noise and does not clean the air very well. The blue light on it is nice to see, but at night it is way too bright if you want to use it in your bedroom. Also the customer service from the manufacturer is terrible. They do not respond in a timely manner and give you the run around while they try to appease you with apologetic e-mails. It is worth it to buy a similar product that cost more, because they work and their customer service department gets you results."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRODUCT WILL NOT LAST VERY LONG","review":"WHen it did work, I didn't notice any improvement in air quality. Once it indicated that it needed cleaning, I followed the instructions to clean, but it never worked again. The clean light would just stay on.

Keep these Coverlets around your home and in your purse/car (along with alcohol wipes) for those little nicks you get when away from home.

Trust me when I say that this score is a must for every soundtrackcollector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant","review":"The most obvious problem with the score to Terminator 2 is that it is redundant. It consists of loud metallic clangs and late 80's/early 90's synthezized noises, and that's about it. It is without strings, percussion, or any real noticeable brass instruments. Scores can be done well with this sort of style (see the thrilling Speed score) but this one is just boring. It doesn't lend excitement or thrills to the action-all it does is give off a sense of menace about the machines. But the ultimate question is wether or not it serves the movie. Well, I definately think that if the music had more personality, the movie's action sequences would have been even more thrilling, but that's just me. Overall, this CD is not worth a purchase by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, erm, no.","review":"For a big budget film like this you would probably expect a super duper score, think again.

The only way I would trust that is was square would be to use a right angle to check for square. Mine was hard to set at 90o using just my hands (does not rotate smoothly).

My kids use it for school and I use it for email or whatever. I have got good use out of this machine and it was well worth the $99 I paid 4 yrs ago.Pros: -Prints fast and text looks good.-Toner lasts me over a year @ 1000 prints or so.-paper sits flat in bottom so it does not curl.Cons: -It does not hold much paper.

The printer still works just fine on Windows 7 64bit...and, get this, I'm still on the starter cartridge the printer came with even after all these years! I don't print too often, but when I do, the printer warms up quickly, feeds in the paper, and the print rolls out pretty fast. I have no complaints about this printer, but thats what it is...just a printer and it does the job well. I will probably end up replacing it with a new all-in-one. I've been looking for a new all-in-one device with a flatbed scanner (since my flatbed scanner isnt supported in Windows 7). So, I'd be replacing this due to that reason alone.

It's as if the entire document is \\"grayed out\\". Today I still print my black and white docs on my inkjet. The speed is a bit slower, but the quality doesn't look like a 15-year-old dot matrix in draft mode.

The only remedy Samsung Tech Support offered was to exchange my new printer for a used one at my shipping expense.

After hearing it for myself, I have to agree that it isn't quiet but it isn't that loud either. It isn't going to wake up your neighbors.Only problem I had with it is that it seem to draw a lot of power when it isn't in save power mode.

Also, the paper curls unbelievable due to the sharp curve in the print output deck. These things never happened with my old Brother 1440.I guess Brother is just trying to make cheap printers, both in terms of cost and quality.

It comes with Linux driver on installation CD, but it requires libgtk-1.2 because for some stupid reason engineers at Samsung decided that everyone will want to install driver using GUI (Graphic User Interface). Well, I need the installer to also work in CLI (not only be started from command line), and if it does not, I consider it a VERY BAD DESIGN. Requiring GUI to install printer driver is plain wrong, and I'm guessing that this may have contributed to the fact that none of the major Linux distributions include built-in driver for this printer. For those interested, I've had it working in Debian Sarge and Fedora, but Debian GNU/Linux testing/unstable (2.6.16-2-686) wont let you install the driver which comes with the printer. Oh well, next time I will think twice before buying anything from vendors who do not understand Linux or do not care about Linux users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't come with a data cable","review":"Great delivery, great price...but no warning anywhere that you need to purchase a USB cable separately.

Printing out PDF's is fast and sharp. About the noise, as it appears in almost all reviews, and concerned me before buying this one. When the printer starts up it is noisy, not overly, certainly wont wake the neighbors, and it doesn't last long - its a fan/motor sound. Once the printer starts printing it is not noisy and it cranks out the pages FAST. I am very happy with the printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior quality","review":"You could not print 3 pages continously without jamming ( the printer would pick up 2 to 3 pages from the paper tray at the same time and end up jam itself ).

The high notes work, sort of but are very out of tune. The lower notes however do not work at all, unless you blow so very softly you can hardly hear it at all.

The plastic recorders usually disassemble into 3 pieces. This one, however, does not. It is one solid unit. Now, my 5 year old is downstairs crying and wanting another recorder. She'll have to have this exact one, or it won't be the same. I will buy another one, because it's like the first one. That's the only reason.

He has produced many great works, but this is one of the few discs that shed some light on Zappa's world view, as opposed to his criticism of other world views and politics. The basics here lie in some of the 'incomprehensible dialogue', as well as FZ's juxtaposition of Varesian music and more 'pop-oriented' stuff. The key segment is the piece of dialogue where Motorhead Sherwood tells about the 'Big Note'. This is Zappa's cosmology, as explained in interviews in The Frank Zappa Companion. His concept of time is essential too, the 'when' question as he calls it, clarifies a lot for us human beings. And these two things, the time concept and the big note concept are the keys to this magnificent disc. It is quite difficult, of course, but nonetheless essential.

Michael Pearson's experience as a fiction writer is obvious, and there is a strong sense of wit and humor throughout the book. Plus the British point of view is an interesting angle to take.I can't understand why there are almost no reviews for this title.

The miracles of gold dustings and healings are prevalent and very real. The experiences encountered make one hungry for more of God's manifest presence. God longs to bless His people and this book is a testimony to that fact. God is making his presence known in ways that cannot be explained away by skeptics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-Fi","review":"Roger Corman gets slammed a lot for his cheesier productions, OK fair enough; but there is still sometimes a kind of engaging quality to some of his work. Man With The X-ray Eyes is one of those films. Despite low-budget production standards and early 60's special effects, this film is kind of spooky. I honestly feel that this is a minor sci-fi gem that no collection should be without. By the way, Ray Milland also made a great little cult film of his own around this time, called: Panic In The Year Zero. In a way, scarier than most monster movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic B Movie","review":"If I had spent mor on this movie I would have been upset. As it is, it is a classic of the genre, and you get what you pay for with these movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Corman movie","review":"Ray Milland plays Dr. James Xavier, who's invented some eye drops that give the test subject X-ray vision. Unable to find a test subject, he uses them on himself. And they work. At first he can see through such things as clothes (always fun at a party with beautiful women). As he starts using the eye drops more they become more effective, even too effective.Directed by Roger Corman, this movie was made around the same time as the Corman/Vincent Price movies, and like those, it's a pretty ambitious project, much superior to Corman's earlier ultra-low budget movies such as \\"Creature from the Haunted Sea\\", both when it comes to production values and more importantly to the quality of the script. Ray Milland does a fine job in the lead and Diana Van der Vlis and Don Rickles also deliver good performances in this entertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matthew 5:29","review":"The same director (Roger Corman) that brought you \\"Attack of the Giant Crab Monsters\\" (1957) now brings you to new depths of depravity.

The message is so important that it was transferred to DVD.Moderation in all things. What happens if you get too much of a good thing?Dr. James Xavier finds out what it is like going beyond underwear. And into the mysteries of life. His creation of drops that let you see on a new plane can be dangerous. The more he drops the more he sees.The visual effects are worth the movie alone.

I bought this DVD along with Vol. 2 of A&C Funniest expecting to get COLORIZED versions of the Colgate Comedy A&C comedy routines, instead all I got was b/w versions of their bits. The bits are good, for sure, but I expected to get COLOR versions, not the b/w drab versions. I am very disappointed, I wanted these in color. I was also fooled with another Legend release supposedly releasing 3 Stooges bits in color, instead only a tiny piece was colorized and the majority of the Stooge 3 disc set that I got was in it's original b/w. WHERE'S THE COLORIZATION??? What's with the misleading advertising leading you to believe you're about to see a beautifully colorized DVD set, when instead you get literally a couple of minutes of some material colorized but 99% of the DVD is b/w.

I loved HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE VAMPIRE...... but and a HUGE but, I trudged through VAMPS IN THE CITY and was tempted not to finish it.The plot and premise was ludicrous, boring and not even that humorous. The whole reality show The Sexiest Man on Earth, was very far fetched, ridiculous and nonsensical. Even having the women from Roman's X-harem be the judges in the contest. PLUEAZE!!!!!There was little or no chemistry between Darcy and Austin and a lot of \\"Oh, how I hate that I am a vampire\\" bemoaning from Darcy to Austin about her situation. It was very annoying and you wanted to just smack her at times!!!This was a very poor sequel to HTMAMV, which I thoroughly enjoyed reading.

He is competing undercover as Sexiest man alive.I just didn't like the main characters. They were boring and ill-described. The shorty also lacked action. There was nothing really interesting going on. The author threw their \\"rushed-love\\" down our throat. They fell in love in a week? I know it's fiction, but come on.

I probably wouldn't have continued reading the other books. I almost didn't finish this one because I didn't like the main characters and to be honest I didn't care about them that much. I got so sick of Darcy whining about being a vampire and I feel like I barely got to know Austin at all, but what I did see really turned me off. I hated how disgusted he was with her after he found ouT she was a Vampire, couldn't even look at her. I hated how she forgave him so easily for betraying her and trying to kill her entire race. Also, i found it kind of creepy at the beginning when he was taking all those pics of her from the parking lot. It was also alittle silly how fast they fell in love. They had only known eachother for a few days and had barely spoken an entire sentence to eachother.

And how could she be so mad with Conner he saved her, and though she may not have been happy, the chick could have at least been grateful.I especially did not like the ending for this book and I do not give spoilers when writing reviews but, for those who have read this book you know what part in particular I am speaking of. I already know that the next book involves Angus and Emma (from the Stake-Out team) and all I want to know is why?

Currently there are none unless you have a $1000 Blue Ray or HD DVD player. Your 1080p television will not be any sharper than a 720p or 1080i but you will have paid a serious premium in price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well priced alternative to plasme","review":"Very good HD picture, easy controls.

The Sony was a 1080p and cost $1300 more than the Samsung which is only 1080i. I decided to buy the Samsung based on the following.1. Currently, no cable or dish provide broadcast at 1080p. They only broadcast at 1080i. So why pay more for a for something I can't get anyways.2. When it's all said and done, I'll be saving almost $1300.3.

It covers topics like the gift of virginity, health, heredity, age, temperament, weaknesses, and character. Sexual attraction will tempt you into marriage but will not sustain it. Similar temperaments (eg. neatness) will reduce tension within a marriage, but similar (spiritual) weaknesses should be avoided.

I suspect that because the unit designs to force the lens against the lens cap, some damage occurs through frequent use if you fail to remove the lens cap before turning the camera on. This is a definite design defect. Although I loved the camera for 10 months, and frequently used it instead of my Canon EOS 10D, this design defect basically sinks this unit as defective from the get-go. Avoid.However, in this edit of my review, I was able to fix the problem later by continuing to cycle the camera through a lens opening and closing and by forcing the retraction of the lense. (I know it is hard to explain.) Finally, the software matched the machinery and the system error vanished. What a hassle, but it saved sending the camera back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stationed in Iraq......","review":"and this camera is everything I wanted! Even more.

Our lens got stuck or something and the camera gave us a \\"SYSTEM ERROR\\" in which the lens would not get pushed in our out.4. Poor photos with low lighting (Very blurry), which includes indoors.5. Battery life pretty short. Half of its energy was gone when I had the thing on for 20 minutes and I didn't have it on the whole 20 minutes.I DID get some good photos from the camera. It's not as manual as I'd like it to be, but I recommend to get a lens protector to avoid the System Error. I tried the Canon S1 IS in Best Buy and it turned on really fast and took photos really fast indoors. Also it wasn't blurry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever to power on and too long between pics taken","review":"When you power on the Nikon 4300, it takes forever to be ready to take a picture (over 5 seconds).

When I got home and called Nikon they told me that it sounded like a problem with the chip, and would probably cost around $200 to fix. I was shocked and disgusted. I read other on line reviews from people who had a similar problem. I think it is a flaw in this model, and if so, I think Nikon should be a little more flexible at helping us get it fixed.

It takes wonderful pictures even in extremely dark areas with or without a flash. It captures beautiful color and detail has a great zoom and tons of options. The problem is unless you have a tripod with you at all times it is nearly impossible to get a good picture without any blur. This is not only from my experience, but also from friends and family who have used it as well. I even set it on a level rail and set the timer to take the picture and it came out blurred. So unless you want to carry a tripod all the time I would suggest buying one of the new Kodak cameras."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad service","review":"Within a year, there are problems with my menu dial knob.

My edition came autographed by Amber and Christopher Golden, so that alone was worth the money.

However, when I insert it into my rack from North Shore, the fit is tight enough that the open ends of the Lock Nut Carriage gets squeezed together a bit. This means that when you're trying to thread the bolt in, it's at a slightly off angle. Over and over, we could almost get the threads to catch, but then it would pop back out. Really frustrating. Bought a second one assuming that the first was just odd somehow and had the exact same problem. Maybe we just got a bad batch or maybe we're just idiots, but it kind of killed our big mountain bike trip so we're switching to a QuietRide from SoftRide. We'll see how that one works. I actually think the design of the TriMax is really slick and I assume it must be working on other receivers, but it didn't happen to work in mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"We bought this to solve movement of our bike rack. I have used it once for a short trip. It took me about 20 minutes to install. Getting the internal sleeve into the correct position takes some trial and error. I could probably do it in 15 minutes now, but I would definitely budget time to install it. Not great for a quick trip to the park. You really need a ratchet set to tighten the system up. The provided tool will tighten the unit, but not enough to keep it from moving I was able to create a solid connection with a ratchet. I do not leave this installed as some others do.

I also like the fact that it gives support over a much greater area than the rousseau. With the many cross members on the extention wings , your cutoffs never take a dive.

Inspired by Jimmy Page, also other prominent jazz and blues musicians he soon developed his own style as being a creative, technical and inventive slide guitarist. His style can be categorized as a folk blues balladeer.Though the music can get very complex at times,I find the style very relaxed and intimate.

This really does sound dated. Basically a hand full of musicians were still taken by the novelty of a modern (relatively for \\"68) recording studio. Fake phone conversations, meaningless jibber spoken into a mic (with lots of echo, that makes it so much more intriguing). Obviosly the cover and the eclectic collection of music (when there was a bit) was a spoof of the Beatles. Okay, so it's a spoof. What about it? It's kinda like watching a comedy spoofing another movie for not being funny and forgetting to be funny itself. Basically, if your in one of those hip circles who insists that Sgt. Peppers isn't a great album (which it is) simply because it is overrated (which it may be) than you might possibly find this album amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run of the mill weirdness","review":"A lot of people are seemingly impressed by weirdness and the social commentary. I can appreciate the weirdness, there are a lot of us who have a very off the wall absurd sense of humour. Zappa is far from unique in this; perhaps a lot of the boring types fail to understand this because they're not that type. I'll take some of the more inventive prog acts from then over this, this is overrated just like Zappa thought the Beatles were overrated. And the music is weirdness packaged as music. It's not clever or interesting. Supersister, the Dutch prog band did it better. I suppose that makes me one of those hippies or perhaps the establishment that the pompous Zappa raved about himself. His own biographer Barry Miles outs him as a pretentious control freak. Whatever, keep the myth alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Arrogant One Strikes Again","review":"I just recently gave this cd, or whatever it is, a listen and was amazed at the audacity of this man. While I agree with his take on the drug-induced 1960s, I was aghast at his pathetic lampooning of the Beatles-THE BEATLES. I feel that his mocking them might have a certain degree of validity had he been in the same musical league as John Lennon or Paul McCartney, but this clearly is not the case. It's interesting how so many praise this amateur as if he were the music world's second coming of Christ, when in fact, his music is so pathetically substandard."},{"rating":"2","title":"ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING","review":"This review is for the 2005 Original Master Recording of ONLY MONEY:I was not aware of this release until recently,and was hesitant to buy it as what I read in reviews gave me the impression it was not really superior to the 1995 Ryco/2012 ZFT versions(which are the same)-I think these regular releases sound great,but direct comparison to this OMR version shows OMR have done their usual audiophile magic-I've noticed tambourines and acoustic guitars I never paid attention to before,punchier bass and an overall clarity over the standard issue-Tape hiss is more noticible,however-Most fans may want to stick with the regular CD-very reasonably priced these days-But for anyone who considers this an iconic piece of the Zappa catalog,and is familiar with other OMR works,this CD will not disappoint you-and new copies seem to still be available for around $40-This is the definative version of the original mix!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Genius","review":"Frank Zappa/ The Mothers of Invention/ We're only in it for the money: I am a fan (of most) of Frank Zappa's music.

This may be a subversive masterpiece, but a masterpiece nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a Kind","review":"Zappa had a varied career and recorded all styles of music. But in the late 1960's, he was just getting started, and so of course this sounds like something recorded in that era. But wait. Listen to those lyrics. Zappa was a satirist and even picked on the grand pooh-bahs, the Beatles, parodying the Sgt. Pepper's album cover and ridiculing hippies. But Zappa also ridiculed the establishment, the cops, the schools, etc., etc., etc. What gives? Zappa was one of a kind, that's what gives. And this album is classic satire. But the songs are good, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love headphones...","review":"mixed with pot, this album will rip your hemespheres apart. The tunes are truly cool, while a chorus of ewok-like voices taunt you with flower powerslogans and absurdities. Feminism, sex, drugs, hippies, and music are all undressed.

I know high-pictched vocals were a norm for Zappa, but just think how good those songs would sound sung more, dare I say, conventionally.They ought to make a stage opera out of this album, a la Tommy. The plot could involve the government rounding up hippies into concentration camps in the 1960s. Wouldn't that be cool?

While its specified luminance of 1,400 candela per square meter is shared by similar flat panel lights from other makers, in use the M70 appears whiter and brighter than many others. Transparencies are very enjoyable to look at, due to the 5000 K. color temperature of the light.I use the M70 as a light source for a special View-Master stereo viewer, and it performs very well in this capacity. Details of how it was attached are on my 3-dviews website, under Technical.When used at home, it makes sense to use a power supply rather than the AAA batteries (which last a bit more than 2 hours per set of 4). Hakuba sells a dedicated power supply (in Japan, at least), but a Sony AC-E60A AC power adapter works perfectly, and functions at any household voltage. Any 6 volt DC power source of 500 mA or more with the right plug (center positive polarity) should power the M70 satisfactorily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds Great!!!","review":"This looks good, Sounds better.

The problem is that almost all new worm drive saws (including Skil) are incorporating a bump out in the end of the blade gaurd. This doesn't allow for the prazi to mount up at all.

It was a poorly designed setup. the first clue was that the main attacnment bolt (that comes in kit)that holds the chain spocket to the saw motor shaft. had damaged threads and you can't use the saw without that bolt...can you say Q.A or Q.C ? The beam saw once it was attached and working was not really centered with the Milwalkee worn drive saw shaft,which was bought new with this Prazi beam saw(it was to be a dedicated combo unit)The beam saw would operate with a sort of concentric motion around the center of saw shaft.The saw kept loosing up locked down saw parts, bolts would back out of the Prazi unit..

Like one other reviewer said, a lot was missing from this video (and I haven't even read the book). They could have used some of the time they \\"wasted\\" on the anecdotal details of discovery to include more material.

I am a huge fan of Lennon, But have begun to favour Yoko's music to John's. By far the best track is \\"Walking on thin Ice\\" with \\"No, No, No\\" coming a close second. ... It is Yoko's way of saying goodbye to the man she loved. ...Her voice may not be that of an angel... but the emotions she portrays are nothing less than beautiful. The album is slightly Avanteguard, for example \\"Mind weaver\\" begins with Sean talking to Yoko about a story that John told him. So, don't buy this album if you listen to music for a good beat or catchy tune, but if you listen to music to be enthrawled with emotion, then this album is a must. The album cover showing the spectacles John was wearing when he was shot caused contreversy when first released, but it symbolises the message that the album shares with us...that John is sorely missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Listenable-after all these years!","review":"Lots of us bought this album in 1981. We bought it to support Yoko after John's death, and the gunshots on \\"No, No, No\\" were a matter of much discussion at the time, as well as the memorable cover photo.Now after all these years I finally bough this remastered CD version. The inclusion of \\"Walking on Thin Ice\\" is a huge plus, as well as the wonderful job remastering the original album.Now, 20 years later, this album does not sound dated.

Her voice can be compared to fingernails on a chalkboard. Her navel-gazing poetry is just as bad as her vocals. Am I bitter that this no-talent woman broke up the Beatles? You bet.I will give this to Yoko: she was a driving force to the re-civilization of Central Park, and for that I am grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY Underated.","review":"Don't write this off as another one of \\"those\\" albums. This is a really great album. There is very minimal shrieking and the lyrics are very heartfelt. It's painful to listen to at times because Yoko conveys the universal emotions that everyone feels after a serious loss so well in all of her songs. Rather than trivializing John's death by screaming and shrieking about it (this is not Plastic Ono Band 2), she managed to pull herself together and make a really great record. Minus one star because her voice begins to grate after awhile and not all the songs are winners, but as a whole this is pretty damn good. And the cover photo is worth the price of the whole album by itself. Pretty powerful stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ono Stands Alone","review":"I had bought Double Fantasy, and being the first time I had listened to Yoko, I was suprised how good her music was. The play on songs between her and John complimented each other. This album puts Yoko standing on her own. Although she has released solo albums before, John had always been there behind the scenes. I was suprised how in one song she can have a haunting melody and in another thundering guitars of pain and rage. From trying to move forward with Goodbye Sadness to No, No, No and She gets down on Her Knees to Toyboat she has put full frontal pain and rage and grief to the listener. She may not be at the top of the charts, but she is just as talented musically and lyrically than most artists of today. If you buy only one album of Yoko's, this is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is she kidding?","review":"She must be.

I suspect there can be a solution by adding some sort of noise filtering on the adapter.It can be mitigated by using faders (so the audio does not go on/off), but it is still persistent, and the fader solution requires a 3rd party product (like PocketPlayer).I used two different adapters (I purchased two, one for my phone and one for another Samsung) -- it does not seem to be a problem on the other Samsung model (A707).I'll be using a bluetooth wireless earphones from here on out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure this is the correct accessory for your phone!!!","review":"The description for this item doesn't specify whether it's for a Blackjack I or II.

I hate how they don't seem to care whatsoever about the kid; he's just ignored and forgotten through most of the tale. Also, the whole romance triangle between Mary--Arthur--Karl--O'Connell was just ridiculous and irrelevant, especially considering how out of the blue the ending was.Crocodile on the Sandbank (Amelia Peabody, Book 1)was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"As a fan of historical mysteries, I was looking forward to starting this popular series. I was deeply disappointed. First of all, the character of Amelia Peabody is not appealing, and through her the author reveals that she has only a very superficial understanding of Victorian values and thinking. (Although if you don't mind an author sticking a character with modern sensibilities in period dress, maybe this is for you.) Furthermore, the mystery was simply not that interesting. I found myself reading only to finish the book, for I had little interest in finding out who committed the murders. The success of this series and the acclaim the author has received truly baffle me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"Dull and inane come to mind. Consists mostly of Peabody's artificially \\"catty\\" - sometimes racist - first-person remarks about everyone she meets (even the cat), fuzzy descriptions of Egyptian \\"archaeology\\" (...). The plot is slow moving, cliché and peopled with characters that come across as cardboard cutouts. I found more of pennance than pleasure in this read. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The plot line was painfully predictable, the characters underdeveloped, and the egotism of the heroine unreal and unbearable. The editor, if there was one, was asleep. The Curse of the Pharaohs lives on in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Tedious and inane come to mind. It is written as a first person narrative consisting almost entirely of a stream of disparaging comments about everyone else written in a \\"catty\\" pseudo-feminist style, rambling descriptions of Egyptian archaeology - real or imagined - thinly veiled racist comments about the \\"ignorant natives\\" of Egypt and inept sexual innuendo. The book is very slow moving and the plot seems forced. The characters do not come across as real. Very disappointing.

But this book is not of that caliber. The main character/narrator was one of the most annoying I have ever encountered. And her husband [the other main character] was a pompous idiot whom she adored - and loved having sex with, apparently. I enjoy good banter and did like those old Hepburn/Tracy movies even as they made me cringe sometimes. But these two... ugh. The soap-opera nature of the mystery did not help either. I really cannot recommend this book... but I know it has been popular with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction of Ramses","review":"Another wonderful book in the Amelia Peabody series.

It is as delightful now as it was the first time. Others have provided great storyline reviews, so i will not add one that is only in full agreement of a 5 star rating. I am, however, disappointed in the amount of \\"typos\\" present in the Kindle editions. Some are so bad as to take a few seconds to discern the correct meaning in context. For that reason alone I've dropped a 5 star rating to a four as I think the mistakes will detract from a great experience for someone new to the books just enough to be a nuisance.

I think some things may be hard for a shy girl to say to someone else, but letting a girl know what makes a mean girl tick helps them gain the insight that often we don't acquire until adult (and when everything is over anyway!). This book explains basically that a girl's mean behavior says nothing about your worth as a person, and gives advice on how to handle it. Another important element that is included is that doing mean behavior back is not recommended, and the explanation for that is given too.

I feel like I'm reading about my own friends and the kids in my school with different names. Dr. Karres also explains why girls act the way they do and gives good ideas for how to act and what to say when kids act out and get really mean or think they are better than anyone else. I tried a few ideas in this book and they really work! I am also learning more about why I act they way I do sometimes and get in sad or down moods because of all the things that go on with kids around me.

I never had problems like this before, and after some research on the ZA support site, I found other users who were having similar problems with their processors overclocking. VSMON.exe seems to be the culprit, and is the main component of the Zone Alarm product. Everything seems fine, as long as I don't try to use video over the internet(including IM webcams).

Thanks.","review":"I must question the vocacity of this and similar reviews here that report how easy it is to install and operate NAS 7. I've been researching the major AV suite programs and reviews for 2 weeks. I was leaning towards NAS 7 until I read numerous posts on their own forum that report problems with install and operation. I am concerned with 3 issues their own moderator disclosed on 1-17-07: 1) error in Windows security cebter alert; 2) expert rules are not saved after restart; and 3) kl1 service can really slow the program. There were also valid complaints with issues relating to the existance of other AV files and programs still present during install. I currently have Norton Internet Security 2005, so if I can't get an honest review, I'll have no choice but to continue subscriptions on my current AV suite.

When you try to install this file, it probably won't install correctly. Back to tech support e-mails. At that point, you get 4 pages of instructions, which include booting in safe mode, running \\"regedit\\", deleting registry keys manually, etc. I did get the program running, but took many hours spread out over several weeks.The program itself is satisfactory.

I've been into RH for about 20 years (with a perference to his earlier material) and I know that a lot of his records contain hit and miss material, but as a fan, I anticipate taking the crunchy with the smooth. However, Spooked ranks with Robyn's best. The amazing Dylan cover, \\"Trying to Get to Heaven...\\" the romping \\"We're Gonna Live in the Trees\\" the beautiful \\"Full Moon in My Soul\\" (which would not sound out of place on a Wilco record) and \\"Flanagan's Song\\" which recalls Eye's \\"Linctus House\\" all elevate this record from a 4 to a 5 in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Organically Grown","review":"As has been pointed out in other reviews here, this one evokes \\"Eye\\" and \\"I often dream of trains\\", two of Robyn's great, mostly unplugged albums. Most of this CD was evidently recorded live, but I think I hear a few backwards guitars, which may have served as base tracks upon which Robyn, Gillian Welch, and David Rawlings laid the live tracks. He likes to alternate between acoustic and electric from album to album(and within a given album for that matter). He's a master of taking the acoustic songs later, turning them sideways and playing them with a 5 piece band. There are several tracks on this CD which are suited for that, and will undoubtedly resurface that way in a year or two, which is something to look forward to. In the meantime, enjoy this one. It's got a great organic feel, but there are lots of latent intricacies, which like all things organic, will continue to grow lushly into the cracks and crevices in the back of your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par Hitchcock","review":"I feel that this is Robyn's weakest CD in years. There are a couple of good songs (like Television) but most of the CD is very unpolished. It almost sounds like Hitchcock had a recording session set up and had to very quickly bang out a few songs. So we are treated to some rehashed roots and blues structured songs with some psychodelic window dressing. Hitchcock's lyrics can be very quirky but I've never found them to sound forced. Here they sound very forced to me. I also wish he would leave the Dylan covers for whatever private parties he might be playing at. He does a very straight version of a Dylan song on this CD which of course begs for a comparison. Hitchcock's version does not compare well.

Was it the paper-thin -- and universally idiotic -- characters? the click-bang attempts at humor? the juvenile, harried, \\"breathless\\" prose? I suppose I'll never know, but it's not worth re-reading the book to find out.

The performance captured here is better than anything I've heard from Zappa (except for maybe \\"Freak Out!\\" and \\"Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar\\"). And it's up there with the best of Beefheart's records, though I admit to being a big fan of the Captain's later work such as \\"Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)\\" and \\"Ice Cream for Crow.\\" Although this live performance was a sort of \\"celebration\\" of America's bicentennial, it still holds up...things really haven't changed all that much.

I had just heard my first Zappa (Apostrophe) a few weeks earlier and it did not take much coaxing to check the show out. I have around 65 FZ cd's and still growing. This album has many outstanding cuts. It is a treat to hear Captain Beefheart doing the vocals on several of the cuts. It is a live album but the guitars are searing and it is a Five Star rating on sound. If you want to hear one of the ultimate Zappa songs check out Muffin Man. It was a show closer for quite a few years. The guitar in this song is one of my favorites of Frank. Other highlights include Debra Caddabra, Carolina Hard-Core Ectasy, Poofter's Froth Wyoming Plans Ahead to name a few. The guitar in Advance Romance is also a treat and the song goes for over 11 minutes.

I once refused to lend the cassette (!) to some friends, telling them that they were not ready for it. It was sort of a Tom Sawyer whitewashing the fence thing, but I knew they would love it, but I also knew they would not give it a fair listen under any other circumstances.The incredible thing is that they turned this out from a live performance. The synchronization, the timing, the remarkably abrupt shifts in style and substance are truly remarkable.

Didn't fix the problem. I also toyed with other cables as well. By the time I figured I'd been had, I'd been had. It was too late to return the system. Also, unlike the others, my experience is that the sub will perform it's whoopie cushion impersonations in the middle of the most dramatic moments while watching movies (so not just when your audio system isn't in use).

It now works great, and the sheath isn't hurt nor deformed. I think it looks much better than the modern Leatherman sheaths.

I'm really not into these bars anymore but will continue to eat one every other week or so until they're gone because they're paid for. Athletes might think they are the shiznit I wouldn't know"},{"rating":"1","title":"tastes rancid","review":"great ingredients, but tastes odd, kind of rancid even though the exp date is next year. I don't know if it hasn't been stored correctly or this is just the way it tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"300 calories, texture of paste or play-dough","review":"Having tried the Green+ bars and been disappointed, I was excited to try these Active Greens bars based on the positive reviews here on Amazon. Boy, was I let down. These bars have the texture of paste, and a lingering aftertaste that is reminiscent of aspartame or splenda. They are also loaded with fat and calories, making them the caloric equivalent of a personal lasagne or half a pizza!For the price, these bars are a total rip-off. If you really want green foods in your diet, take Green Vibrance powder in the morning like I do. It tastes wonderful and mixes easily with rice milk. In the meantime, people should actually taste one of these before buying the box. Because these Active Green bars are pretty deadly.I would describe them as slightly better than astronaut ice cream and comprable to play-dough. Avoid these and try the Pure Bars or Larabars, which are delicious and have 40% less calories.Or buy these and reget it...It's your choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes bad","review":"The problem is the taste. It's very bad. I and everyone I've shared them with agrees. I have had Organic Food Bar's blueberry and other varieties which I liked v. much. This protein variety just doesn't taste good at all---the rice protein flavor is in full force. Try one before you buy a box, or you'll be counting down the days till you've finished of the $2 bars! The nutritional stats of course are great.That said, I don't know of a good soy-free vegan bar with so much protein. Let us know if you find one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so much better than I thought it would be","review":"I am not someone who normally eats health bars and was expecting a horrible, \\"healthy\\" tasting bar. I got a great tasting bar that did not taste \\"healthy\\" at all. It brought my PH level back to acceptable levels and makes a good on the go breakfast. I like the bar better if it is refrigerated (but I'm a texture person)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a really healthy bar!","review":"I follow a low-sodium, low-protein diet, so it's difficult to maintain. These bars make it easier. They taste delicious, they're nutritious, and there's a variety of choices. It's better to get your greens this way than always eating vegetables and salads (good, but it gets old), mixing powders into drinks or downing endless capsules. I like the green bar and the oatmeal. I'm not too fond of the chocolate bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Food Bar!","review":"Organic Food Bars are fantastic they provide you with a host of important vitamins and minerals. However, they are not your typical crunchy, hard to swallow, food bars. They are moist and delicious sweetened with all organic sugars. Great Buy, excellent service, and quick shipping. Thanks for this wonderful meal or midday snack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bar","review":"It's difficult to find a food-bar as nutritious and tasty as the ones in this product line, and I've tried them all...

Basically real food in bar form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presto Bread slicing System with Electric Knife","review":"Boy oh boy was this ever a big help.

One negative is that it requires a lot of water pressure and I'm afraid of what our water bill is going to look like!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"I love, love, LOVE this shower head. It's HUGE- kind of feels like taking a shower outside during a warm, torrential rainstorm. I was a bit reticent to purchase this because of the price, but I can now say it was definitely worth it. Installation was quick and easy, and the directions were very clear. Highly recommended!(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

Easy to install."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing shower head if you have the necessary pressure","review":"I have good water pressure in my home and standard 1/2\\" suppy lines so that is all you need to make this shower head incredible. It is the absolute best! It doesn't have that pressurized jet effect that other rainshower heads have...instead the water dumps out as if there is no flow restrictor in the showerhead.

The nail puller requires some cusshioning or it's narrow profile may dent when pulling nails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell someone you like about this timesaving device!","review":"This is now a permanent addition to my primary handyman tool bag. It puts my old pry bars to shame and the ability to pull nails where the heads had stripped is a real attribute. Nice sharp (careful!) pry end enables getting behind material and I also bought the 10-Inch model as they work as a great team to move along trim and such to remove trim and such without breaking anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, This Is Not The One","review":"This is made in China and is not as thin and finely tapered as the original Japanese version.It's OK, but it's a BIG disappointment if you were looking for the original. At this price it should be the gen-u-ine article, Made In Japan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great title but a big DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"The Title was excellent, but the book broke down into storytelling and facts about investing from someone who probably only uses CNBC as a factfinding reference. Very simplistic advice, goes into detail on Mutual Funds, REITs(defines them).Such things anyone past junior high school age would know.I should write my own tomes and pocket the money, that would be my own fix for other sources of income. You'd be better served reading \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Grinds beautifully, but the switch often jams","review":"Though this grinder does a nice job grinding my coffee beans, the switch mechanism has little margin for error. About once a week, when I try to operate the grinder, the switch will not engage and the grinder will not operate. Only after I empty the beans out and give the machine a good shake will the lid finally go on tightly and the switch will engage. I am not particularly messy. This should not happen with a 3 month old coffee grinder.This grinder was a replacement for a seven year old Krups that I discarded due to the dullness of the blades (not surprising), but I never had a switch problem with that one, or the new Krups I bought for home. I regret not sticking with Krups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for grinding, cord not hidable","review":"Although it says in the description that the cord is easily hidable, I still haven't found a way to hide it within the grinder, since neither the manual is explaining how. Otherwise a good grinder, nice and stulish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, works bad","review":"This looks great - nice red color, but I am disappointed in its performance. My old Braun coffee grinder took 33 secs to grind coffee to espresso style fine powder. This new machine took 1 min 30 secs to grind, which is 3 times as long. The blades look dull, even brand new.The motor is fine, probably as strong as the Braun, but the blades did not do the job.I still find the Braun grinder superior to every other version. Note: do not buy Braun if its made in Mexico, as these versions 'leak' coffee dust into the motor - the seals are a problem. I wrote repeatedly to Braun, but to no effect. Use the Braun models made in Spain - absolutely the best! Stay away from Cuisinart, they need to improve the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biassed and no clear criteria for coverage of composers","review":"It is not only the exclusion of composers but the fact that there is no indication of the criteria used for including or excluding them or for the depth of coverage given. There is no way to infer why are ,for example , Don Gillis or the author himself given more than twice the coverage given to Mauro Giuliani, just to mention something that can be found from page 143 to 146. There are plenty of examples like this. There are 8 works by Mr Gilder, and less than a dozen works by George Philippe Teleman, none by Tartini, Giusepe Torelli or Johann Pachelbel...! I really felt disappointed with the recomendation of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"My CD - Texas Tornados","review":"Sound was fine but it wasn't formatted properly or something - I couldn't pick out any song in particular that I wanted to hear; it would only play in sequence if at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book...","review":"...not a classic in the same sense as The Good Earth, but wonderful reading nonetheless. Pearl Buck had a way of telling stories and drawing characters like no one else. One is always sorry when the book comes to a close, and we wish we could be swept out of our chair and into wherever Mrs. Buck's stories take us. Tzu-Hsi was a fascinating woman that the reader can come very close to in this telling while also wondering what kind of human being she truly was. This book is well worth reading; in fact ANYTHING by Pearl Buck is rewarding and transporting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting read","review":"Perhaps not one of Pearl Buck's best known novels, Imperial Woman is still fascinating. It gives the reader a glimpse of the Manchu period of Chinese history."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgettable work -- one of Pearl's best","review":"Pearl Buck never ceases to amaze all who are fortunate enough to come across any of her works. The Imperial Woman is an astoundingly human book about Tzu Hsi, the Empress Dowager of the Forbidden City, and her ability to move people to this day with her fierce, courageous spirit. One might think she was Queen Elizabeth reincarnated. Be ready to read on and on -- you won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GREAT FAVORITE","review":"THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT BOOK BY PEARL BUCK, THAT I ALSO READ AT LEAST 40 YEARS AGO. ITS WAS GREAT TO SEE HOW THINGS WERE OR COULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN ANCIENT CHINA. ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS BY PEARL BUCK. THANKS FOR MAKING IT AVAILABLE FOR ME TO BUY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps one of the best books ever written.","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. The characters leap out of the pages, and the descriptions make you feel like you are actually there. You really sympathize with Tzu-Hsi. It's like watching a movie in your mind. There are only four chapters, about 100 pages in length, each. This makes reading a little lengthy, but it is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely love this book","review":"i recently read this book for the second time..the first time i read it i was in 9th grade...but as i was reading it after so many years i felt it being so fresh in my mind,pearl s buck has portrayed the character of dowager so beautifully that u simply adore her for her courage & sharp mind....she surely is an example for the women of all over the world that if you have the courage & determination you can face anything in life.i love this book,i would love my daughter to read this book(iam gonna have to wait for a long time as she is only 2 yet)!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great NOVEL, but has huge historical errors!","review":"This is the first book I read about Tzu Hsi, and I found it totally engrossing. After reading a number of other, more recent biographical works on her reign, it is sad to see how so many very false assumptions about her (upon which Pearl Buck bases many of the key assumptions of this novel) have created a very distorted view of her as an individual, a leader, and particulalry as a woman.Pearl S. Buck writes in her Foreward \\"I have tried to portray Tzu Hsi as accurately as possible from available resources....\\" and this, unfortunately, is the book's biggest flaw. The scholarship was often totally false and grossly distorted, and so western writers perpetuated many false assumptions about her.Read Sterling Seagrave's Dragon Lady if you want a more accurate portrayal of her."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those novels that remains in your mind forever...","review":"Powerful prose & imagery from a writer who learned to write, it is said, from the Bible. It reads much like the story of Esther from the old Testament. Pearl Buck's characterizations are built up layer by careful layer with simple words and in spare phrases. This is a lovely book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul-jazz psychedelia","review":"Recorded in 1969, this record doesn't carry the reputation of a universally recognized, genre shifting classic as Miles Davis' \\"In a Silent Way\\" but Eddie Harris is a talent who deserves more attention than he gets. This record features his electronic saxophone modifications in the best light. What Eno would later do with Andy MacKay's saxophone on the first two Roxy Music albums, Harris is doing here, essentially. The cut \\"I'm Gonna Leave You By Yourself\\" just makes you want to stand up and shout \\"Yeah!\\" as the climactic solo wails on beyond and into ecstatic rejection of emotional negatvity. Eddie Harris is in my list of top 5 sax players ever, and this album is reason number one."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome color","review":"I have tryed many types of dye and special effects lasts by far the longest with the brightest color"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a True Blue by Any Means","review":"While Special Effects is the BEST semi-permanent hair color out there, Blue Velvet falls very short where the actual color is concerned. I read all the reviews stating it was more of a purple than blue but decided to try it anyway. Needless to say, upon receipt of the color, it didn't even LOOK blue in the bottle, let alone on my hair (which is bleached up to almost platinum). It was very dark and had a strong purple hue to it; with each shampoo, it turned more and more purple. NOT BLUE. I must admit that the purple is brilliant and I'm getting tons of compliments but I wanted blue. So if you want an amazing purple, get the Blue Velvet. If you want a true blue, well, I'm going to try the Electric Blue next and see how that comes out. I really, really wanted a deep royal blue but Special Effects doesn't seem to have one yet. Hopefully, they will reconfigure the Blue Velvet formula or come up with something new soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this color!","review":"The color is amazing. Fades into a pretty shade of purple after a while and then almost a pinkish.

It washed out within a week. I was disappointed & was looking forward to that nice blue highlight in the black hair but I didn't get it for long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Indigo color","review":"This blue can sometimes seem purple even when freshly dyed depending on your hair and the tone after you bleached. I LOVE this color! This indigo is great because it fades to purple, unlike most blues which tend to fade to green. I love that about this color in particular!Be warned that this dye stains EVERYTHING, even your hands and skin, and especially tiles and bathtubs. Not to worry, usually it gets out with bleach or alcohol, but I have had a few stains that simply will not come out of the surface they touched for years. On the bright side, Special Effects is by far the longest lasting semi-permanent hair color I've ever had the pleasure to use!Use wisely, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stains way to easy.","review":"When I read to be prepared for bleeding nothing could have prepared me for how bad it was. I did my full head. To start off it stained almost everything it touched from skin, my shower, my sink. I'd hate to see what it would have done to walls/floor! Then it would bleed and dye my forehead and neck purple (it was blue dye) so I was constantly rubbing my forehead and neck to keep it off. I ordered Blue Velvet and it went right to purple. Yes, I followed the directions. :) As for how long it stayed in the hair. This was pretty good. It stayed in for about 2 weeks, some parts a little longer. This was washing my hair once a day in luke warm water. So if your looking at doing just to top parts of your hair (nothing that rubs on skin) its worth it. Or as long as your careful when using/rinsing it out (stains)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this!","review":"I bought two fans from Amazon, Kensington 62648 FlyFan USB Notebook Fan and the Thermaltake Mobile Fan II External USB Cooling Fan.Kensington FlyFan is noisy, it has a high pitch noise that is quite annoying.

The fan-blades are soft, and the thing puts out plenty of cooling air... when it works. The motor's sealed-in, however, so it overheats, and Kensington even included a temperature-switch to cut the fan off when it becomes too warm; unfortunately, this means that to restartn the fan, you apparently hyave to remove it from the USB port and set it aside for awhile. Also unfortunately, the fan overheated in *both* of mine after 5-10 minutes, every time. Now, after a grand total of 2 hours use of each, they're dead as doornails; the motors are toast.

This works muscles I've never felt before, and I do a lot of different core workouts for MMA. I felt like the first time I had ever worked out in my entire life, my abs, obliques, hamstrings and quads are all so sore from this deal.

It still is as musical and funny as it was when it was made."},{"rating":"2","title":"An uneven triumph.","review":"What should not get lost in the shuffle here is that when the band strides into the intro of \\"Peaches En Regalia\\", you realize that Frank and his band by this point had become classic rock-jazz fusion artists with peers only in the jazz and classical worlds. (So you have to forgive the embarrassing stuff.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good live album.","review":"This is a pretty good live album, the only reason it gets four stars and not five is because of \\"do you like my new car\\".

Anyone who knows this Album from the days of vinyl will recognize after listening to the first track that you have been ripped off!!!!! LITERALLY. The vinyl tracks flowed but the CD has been hacked.......parts left out from each and every track. Each track has been chopped off in the beginning of the track and again at the end. What a tragedy!

Do yourself a favor, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A masterpiece...if you're 15 years old","review":"Hey, I'm sorry he's dead, but Frank Zappa had all the sense of humor of people writing on toilet walls. It's funny if you're male and just hitting puberty; if you still find it funny 20 years or even 2 years later, your development has arrested. This album is first among equals in Zappa's \\"humor\\" output for the most unfunny groupie jokes and the least effective use of his band's talents...or his own. During his life, Zappa crowed constantly about how stupid people were overall and maybe he had a point; a large number of people bought this and his other albums and they continue to do so today. P.T. Barnum would've been proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is progressive Zappa with lots of history.","review":"This album has history built throughout it. Look at the cover of Humble Pie - Rocking the Fillmore and you will see Frank Zappa as a coming concert. Fillmore East shows that Frank Zappa in a live recording is as high quality as his studio albums (a tribute to his perfectionist). Great party album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zappa and The Turtles!","review":"Using the name of the band \\"The Mothers\\" is a misnomer here. This disc is a live set with The Turtles. And while it may not be the best live recording or best CD in Zappa's discography (\\"Willie The Pimp\\" got shortened and only part one is presented here) but it does have that certain charm.Tracks 1 through 8 are essentially one very long version of \\"The Groupie Routine\\". It's quite raunchy and deliciously fun! \\"The Mud Shark\\" is a very catchy track and you may find yourself just humming it to yourself for no real reason. Track 8 is a fun punchline to the tracks that came before it. The rest is primo Zappa with some amazing solos. Afterwards, Track 11 is a great salute to bebop. It's a fantastic closer to a very good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Marriage of Figaro","review":"This album is rock burlesque, Francis Vincent Zappa style. Move over Amadeus. A bizzare and crude yet classic view into the 20th century through the Maestros eye. Salieris descriptions of Mozart are brought to mind. Vital with energy. I truly love the Little House intro. Somebody explain to me how one man in one life could compose and perform such diverse works like Fillmore East, Burnt Weeny Sandwich, Uncle Meat, Bongo Fury, Were only in it for the Money, Hot Rats, Waka Jawaka, One Size, Cruisn with Ruben, Tinseltown, Zoot Allures, Roxy, etc, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, horrible, great fun","review":"In which Frank lets his quondam lead singers, Flo and Eddie, recreate before a live audience the repulsive negotiations of an archetypal groupie and an archetypal rock star. I shouldn't really find this album funny, but I do, if only because of the sheer preposterousness of not only performing this kind of thing but actually releasing it as a live album. The band is actually very good, in a shambling early 70s kinda way, and Flo and Eddie (aka Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan of The Turtles, in case you didn't know - remember \\"Happy Together\\"? It forms the climax to this album! ) had a sort of sleazy naivety that none of Zappa's other singers have ever tried to recreate (for all their gifts, the rest of them end up sounding like Zappa wannabes.) It also has a storming live version of \\"Peaches en Regalia\\". Maybe not as evilly pointed and musically intricate as \\"Roxy and Elsewhere\\" or \\"Zappa in New York\\", but still a vital antidote to pretentious rock piety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Frank at his best","review":"I think that the positive reviews of this album have more to do with the happy memories it brings some of the reviewers than its actual musical content. Listened to today, the humor is heavy-handed and unfunny, the skits are annoying, and Flo and Eddie are unbearably irritating, whether they're singing or attempting to make jokes with a very snide and unpleasant Zappa. A self-satisfied, smug feeling of \\"Aren't we so clever, making fun of pop music!\\" permeates this disc. It's mean-spirited, snide and unfunny. I like a lot of Frank's work, and when he was at his best he could be very funny. This isn't his best work. Most unforgivably, the Mothers sound very tame and rote, with valuable playing time surrendered to the tiresome Flo and Eddie, whose appeal eternally escapes me. I gave this a chance long ago and it hasn't grown on me since. Give this a pass and get one of Frank's classics instead, like \\"Hot Rats\\" or \\"Apostrophe.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring images for students of trompe l'oeil.","review":"As a student of trompe l'oeil I purchased this book hoping to get new ideas and inspiring images.

Starting out with only one video camera and $7000, he produced a film that captured the attention of Hollywood mainstream. In viewing his \\"10 minute film school\\" and \\"10 minute cooking school\\" sections, you see that he is a very down to earth artist. He makes his own scores to movies, edits, produces...he's the all in one movie maker.The Mexico Trilogy epitomizes the start of Rodriguez's career and how he transitions from movie to movie with the knowledge he has gained through experience.

It is the only film I know that actually shows real death by killing on film. The main story though is about the director trying to discover if their is a real snuff film instead of various people catching killings on camera. This film is the best one about death, it blows Faces of Death out of the water and any other fake death films.

The other four remained hard and crumbly, even after soaking individual pieces for 15 minutes (the good roll became right as soon as it hit the water).

Any longer and they get very difficult to deal with and put on flat. If you put the strips on completely flat and only use a few layers, they will allow for more detail to show through (like if you want to see nipples or belly button). If you want to hide detail and make everything look more rounded, use more strips and don't worry about them being perfectly flat.

I had one person preparing the strips and two people placing them on me. Make sure that you wait 10 extra minutes when you think it's dry before you take it off, just to be sure. We also stuffed it with old towels so that the edges wouldn't get messed up while it was setting over night. I wore a bra and panties under the cast, and they cleaned up easily enough and were not ruined. We had a great result and I can't wait to paint it.

We were able to pop the cast off in less than 15 minutes and it was fully dry a day later. Also, there was enough material leftover to do at least one more cast, so it might be fun for others to do one cast in both the 2nd and 3rd trimesters.

You can't imagine the usefulness of it until you have one in your hand. It eclipses all other pry bars. For trim it is simply outstanding. You can remove delicate moldings without damage. I have never used another bar that even comes close for this. It pulls the smallest of nails with ease , even nails without a head. The claw grips the shank like a vise. It also works on larger nails. You can lift drywall with it. You can scrape with it. The list of uses is unending and it gets longer every day.Buy about five of these because everyone who touches it will want one. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shark is Sharp!","review":"This is a great compliment to the smaller model; the extra length works better on glue coat and ring shank nails that are well set. The flat end will get under trim almost as easily as a putty knife. The cat's paw nail puller is very sharp, both the tips and the slot, so it will grip headless nails with just a tap on the heel. The one caution: when using the cat's paw end, wear a leather glove to protect the palm of your hand from the sharp corners of the wide blade when yanking on it.I also use it to do some scraping and cleaning out inside corners. The heel of the cat's paw also can be used as a tack hammer. You will find more uses for this tool everytime you go to work. The quality of the forging and finish is great.

I called the manufacturer in the hopes that I didn't set the machine properly but had an extremely frustrating conversation with their \\"customer service\\" representative who explained (not so patiently) that it is not a design flaw. The manufacturer intended for the machine to create an inch of lead in tape each time you print out a label. She acknowledged that they log calls EVERY day complaining about the wasted tape but insists they cannot do anything about it. Given the low cost of the machine, the real money-maker is in the cost of the tape itself so cutting off an inch of tape each time you use the machine tends to add up in wasted money.

Yes, the manufacturer can help it, if they wanted to.

Not only does it waste Brother's ridiculously expensive tape, but it also fails to automatically trim labels symmetrically on both sides. This means the user has to MANUALLY TRIM at least one side with a pair of scissors to center the text neatly on the label. Oh, and while I'm on the subject of the text . . .

In the instruction manual, it states that only the Brother AC adapter should be used and any other will invalidate the warranty. Why is it that only a Brother adapter can be used when AC adapters are supposed to be standard? A tactic to increase sales? The adapter itself costs an additional 15 to 20 dollars. In addition, I agree with some of the other reviewers that a significant amount of label is wasted with each printing due to the empty space on either side that must be cut off. The 2 line printing does look very nice. I have not used many of the other features and so cannot comment on those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Tape Problem","review":"The Brother P-Touch is designed to waste tape.

I bought this TV in December and it worked great for about a month. The cooling fan for the bulb started malfunctioning and would only allow the TV to work for a few minutes before shutting it down. I reported the problem to Samsung and have waited for three weeks with no resolution. They say the reason for the delay is the lack of a local authorized repair center to perform the in-home repair.

What a mistake! The delivery truck broke down so I received the TV later than promised.

Hooked the TV up and realized why I should not have bought this thing online. The picture is terrible!

Mr. Temkin's writing is rarely emotional, never vengeful, which may seem somewhat incongruous with the level of the tragedy he experienced. His entire family perished, after all; he barely escaped. And he encountered physical hardship and anti-Semitism in Russia. But he gives a straight-forward account of the Holocaust in Poland, his rather extraordinary rise in rank in the Soviet Army, and his \\"just war\\" -- his personal battle against Fascism. Credit belongs to Mr. Temkin's family for persuading him to share his very interesting memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Just War","review":"My Just War was with a doubt a very good book especially if you're intrested in ww2.

It is an interesting book that allows the reader to feel, and almost see, the horror of WW II from the Polish/Russian perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Narrative","review":"No matter how many times one hears Mahler's music a good analysis of the main ideas and motifs is immeasaurably helpful. This DVD does just that. Clear,and concise, it leads the listener/viewer to a fuller understanding of Mahler's creative use of music to paint a broad sense of intimacy and reverence to the world we live in and to our humble yet human existence in the universe. With this assessment of the Second Symphony, the music becomes more beautiful in its spiritual scope. The DVD is a welcome component to our appreciation of Mahler's genius. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juvenile Adventure, Peruvian Style","review":"MAX IS MISSING, an entertaining juvenile adventure set in Peru, is sparked by a good cast, crisp direction and beautiful location filming.

Max comes into possession of a sacred Incan artifact, unwillingly partners up with a young Indian panhandler his own age, and the chase is on.

Victorinox has made what they call a \\"running change\\". They have replaced the 8x magnifying lens surrounded with gray plastic by a 5x lens surrounded by clear plastic. Not only is this new lens flimsier and more likely to break off, but also it will be harder to start a fire with it in an emergency survival situation. Definitely this change is a change for the worse. I don't why Victorinox made this change except to save a few bucks in manufacturing the knife? Luckily, I called Victorinox customer support and they are aware of this problem and said that they will gladly switch out the clear plastic-surrounded lens with a gray-plastic surrounded lens if I send the knife to their Repairs department."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice knife, bad pouch","review":"I have had a Swiss Army knife for a very long time, I lost it unfortunately and bought this new one.

I ordered two, one for a friend's son as a graduation gift and one for myself as a replacement for a recently misplaced Explorer. Why the disappointment? The pouch is useless: the knife does not fit the pouch, it sits too high and you cannot secure the snap on the cover. The hand-lens, (one of the reasons I value this model along with the cork screw), is now made of flimsy clear plastic, not the classic gray solid framed lens shown in the Amazon advert. If the lens breaks, as it surely will someday, it will be impossible to replace. The knife itself otherwise met my expectations.

Lady Sheba (Jessie Wicker Bell) received it not from the Goddess, but from correspondence with witches in England, who later regretted it.Much of the material is also found elsewhere, on the net, in other books, etc.. Nothing new or exciting to be found in this one, but if you are interested in it as an historical curiosity, pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a very good book with usable guidelines.","review":"Lady Sheba was the first Witch I know of who was willing to go public with her coven's book of shadows. Some of the contents dated back to the burning times when nothing could be written, all had to be committed to memory by coven members. Parts of the book were very touching for anyone who has been involved in the practice of magicke.

Another world, another time, another dimension? It doesn't matter, the message transcends time and space. It tells a story that parallels the racial tensions and persecutions our own country has survived, a story that compares a society ruled by the precepts of man to a righteous nation emulating the true principles of Christianity.

But at least Cliff Eidelman's music score was fairly decent. It's not brilliant, certainly not a patch on Vangelis' score for 1492: Conquest of Paradise or the works of James Horner, Jerry Goldsmith or John Williams, but its not bad either.

The description states that it is Rhodium plated, but I have to truly wonder if it is, or how much, with the way the pendant current looks.My husband has worn other sterling silver jewelry continually without issue, so I don't think it's his body chemistry reacting to the metal.To be honest the metal looks as though I had bought it from a corner drugstore.

At the end, the \\"punchline\\" depicts all these kids dressed in cute costumes, and you realize that all the grossness was in their imaginations. Well, I don't like this for two reasons. First, I don't like the technique of exaggeration followed by \\"just kidding.\\" Secondly, I don't get why it is good to encourage imagining gross or scary images, especially at the young age the reading level of this book seems to imply.Arden Druce's other Halloween book called Halloween Night is illustrated more conventionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant story, hate the heroine","review":"The first Elizabeth Adler book i read was The Rich Shall Inherit.

It cranes the back of your skull very well.

As my business developed I was encountered by many friends and relatives saying that I shouldn't strive to make money and that money did not bring happiness. They even quoted scripture justifying their beliefs. I couldn't defend myself against their misuse of the Word of God because I was not savy in that arena myself. Reading \\"Becoming a Millionaire God's Way\\" helped me understand those quotes and their True meaning. I Thank God for individuals like Dr. Anderson for compiling wisdom and true knowledge the way that he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Joke","review":"Anderson contends that God's perfect will consists of four things: 1. Get saved 2. Live right 3. Get rich 4. Build the kingdom. He also believes that Christians ought to dress better than other people. He goes on to say that \\"a careful reading\\" of the gospels reveals that Christ relied heavily on wealthy people to accomplish His ministerial goals (yet he fails to elaborate on what this \\"careful reading\\" consists of).This book should be called, \\"How to use the Bible to justify your selfish ambition.\\" People who want the best that the temporal world has to offer will be drawn to this book, but it is a far cry from the teachings of Christ. Man looks at the outer appearance but God looks at the heart. Please read 1 Timothy 6 before, during, and after reading this book.Is material wealth really what God wants for us? If so, we had better alert all the Christians in thrid-world countries. Those guys need to get their act together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just Hype!","review":"Contrary to what some people may think, this book is NOT just another \\"name it, claim it\\" book from a prosperity preacher. Dr. Anderson does far more than simply hype you up; but he truly gives you practical and easy to integrate strategies. More important is the fact that he establishes a firm foundation for the biblical reasons for obtaining great wealth - hence the \\"...God's Way\\" in the title. Even if you think all that \\"prosperity stuff\\" is not for you, I encourage you to read this book. It is one of the few I've seen with the scriptural backing and common sense logic that might just change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a surprise gift for my husband that was on his wish list.

I wanted sound Biblical principles along with wise advice and motivation. This book did not disappoint. Although Dr. Anderson repeats allot of financial points found in other books, he takes the time at the beginning of his book to make sure 'your head in in the right place'. People say fear can be a great motivator but I agree with Anderson that fear is a demotivator and freezes people in moving forward. There is no fear in in God.The book also gives some great ideas for budgeting, tithing, giving and investing and the reasons why.I highly recommend this book to people who are looking for a solid read away from the hype of some other writers.Kind Regards,Larry J Clark[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Concept okay, theology very weak","review":"The way the author used scripture to support his argument was pathetic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Parallel to \\"Message to Garcia\\"","review":"An incredible book.

Took less than 5 minutes to connect DVD and VCR in the back and to figure out how to tune using the remote (since I tune through my VCR). Pressing the TV/VCR button on the remote control repeatedly switches between each of the various input modes (2 sets of inputs in back, 1 set in front). The set-up menus are easy to use, once you get the hang of them, making it easy to control everything from treble and bass to brightness and contrast from your easy chair. There is also a sleep function, an on/off timer, and a locking function. The speakers are left and right of the screen, but the television is not so wide that it won't fit in an entertainment center, which was a consideration.

The title of the book is misleading because from reading the it, it became apparent to me that the author did not intend on writing a serious, thorough, or even thoughtful examination of PR and its history. The author basically summarizes the work of other people - lots of other peoples, except this is done very unevenly so the reader does not get a solid impression of the subject matter. While the book is broken up into chapters, these chapters are not chronologically ordered, so one cannot follow the material from Chapter 1 - the beginning to Chapter X - the present.

Ewen is obviously fairly left-wing, and paints conservative PR figures as \\"necromancers\\" repeatedly, while defending FDR's PR efforts in the depression as noble. There was also a real failure to identify other historical forces that shaped PR and America's faith in technological progress (as delivered by industry), besides the evil conniving of PR working for industry. This failure makes me wonder a little about the scholarship that supports this book. It's too emotional.

Juhi Chawla and Ketki Dave steal the show with their natural comedic abilities. Asrani is great as the sympathetic film buff boss. Govinda too is likable. He and Juhi are great as the ideal neighbour. I would have liked to see Tabu do more comedy but she's stuck with a serious role of which she does nothing short of a decent job. Even Johnny Lever (whom I find intolerable in almost every other movie) is enjoyable (though his character is hateful).

This would be Zappa's first album to go gold in the U.S. and would actually get some airplay on more progressive oriented radio stations here. To many longtime Zappa fans this album was a bit of a commercial sell out, while at the same time it opened up Frank's music to a whole new set of fans. I have mixed feelings about this album, some of it is brilliant and some I find a bit annoying. \\"I Am The Slime\\", \\"Dirty Love\\", \\"Dinah Moe Hum\\" and \\"Montana\\" are all prime Zappa satire. On the other hand songs like \\"50/50\\" and \\"Zomby Woof\\" grate on my ears every time I listen to them.

Camarillo Brillo is about an encounter with a voodoo lady, 50-50 features the screaming lyrics of Ricky Lancelotti, and Zomby Woof is the musically strangest song on the album. In all, this is an interesting piece of work that Zappa has made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Up until this album, Frank had been consistently great and uncommercialized. This was the turning point, the start of the long slow slide into slicker mediocrity. The song lyrics no longer mattered, were not thought provoking, and his music no longer had a huge impact on one's mind and one's life. With this album, he became a commodity like everyone else in rock.

Only one song (\\"I'm the Slime\\") even relatively meets his reputation. The rest of the album consists of trashy, unamusing novelty songs (\\"Dinah-Moe Hum\\" \\"Dirty Love\\") or tracks too senseless to even warrant that modest title (\\"Fifty-Fifty\\" \\"Montana\\"). The guitar-playing is sublime, laid-back and funky. Unlike the songwriting, it is acceptable, but nothing any two-bit hack, leftover from the psychedelic movement could not do.

Your record player was donated to charity?Well, go buy a record player and a copy of the old vinyl version of this, because the current cd is garbage!In the mid 80's, Zappa decided that the drum and bass sounds on two of his album, WOIIFTM and Ruben, were simply not up to snuff. He made the thoroughly bizarre decision to re-record those parts with current band members.The result is something like a modern remix of a sixties-era track - it just doesn't work.

They are so bad I bought a $10 Caravaggio book from Taschen and tried to cross-reference. Awkward, but better than relying on the fuzzy reproductions in this book. Robb points out that the life of Caravaggio remains mysterious. Robb's version of it is exactly that: his version. He takes great pains to back up his opinions, but apparently he did his own translations. Did anyone edit his translations? The biographical elements of this book I find questionable, and to some extent he admits that they are. On a more positive note, however, Robb's commentary on the major paintings is thoughtful and fascinating. If this book remains in publication, better reproductions would certainly be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caravaggio","review":"This is a fascinating book. It gives the reader a nearly physical experience of life in the Renaissance Italy that Caravaggio knew. The descriptions of specific paintings is absolutely right: even without the excellent illustrations. What also becames clear, was exactly how new, different, bold and shocking was Caravaggio's art.No biography of Caravaggio can concentrate on Caravaggio the artist-inovator and ignore Caravaggio the rebel-bad-boy. The presentation of the sexual indescretions, the equivical social status and ideological independence which caused the rift between Caravaggio and the incresingly conservative authorities in Rome read like chapers from a Mario Puzo godfather novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Imagination","review":"As Amazon organizes reviews by date, the sole review (writen by noted Caravaggio scholar David Stone) which attacks this book for its unscholarly tendency to unashamedly make things up is buried deep on the last page. Therefore, I thought I'd add another to make this fact a little more visible to the casual shopper. A few others have noted the appalling grammar and syntax, but the real crime is the baselessness of Robb's conclusions. Does no one care about evidence any more? Do none of you who loved this book find anything wrong with Robb's practice of examining complex, vague, and contradictory sources, choosing the most dramatic answer possible, and presenting it as an irrefutable truth? Caravaggio was an unconventional, brilliant man who lived a wild and crazy life--stick with the evidence and you'll still be amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more comprehensive then the other books","review":"I ordered two guidebooks on what to do with children in LA, and this is by far the better of the two. For one thing, it's literally three times as big as the other one. At over 800 pages, it really and truly is the only book you'll need. Clearly the author really has been to them; she takes care to note important details like cost and hours, as well as appropriate age ranges. And it's full of really interesting places I'd never heard of even after 10 years of living in Los Angeles. I confess that after spending an afternoon scoping out places to take the little one, I had half a dozen places bookmarked that *I* want to see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it does quite well","review":"I bought one of these from Grainger. I lengthened the air hose using same size fuel hose, and had to put a needle valve in the air line on the gun for better control of air flow. With those changes the thing works great. Lays down an even bead. I use an add-on caulking tip with a 1/8 inch hole. With this gun I can lay a bead down that you can't see to cover baseboard-to-wall and door frame cracks. Different caulks will push out very differently so you need fine air pressure and flow control. I use about 5 psi air pressure and the needle valve open only a small amount to lay down Polyseamseal All-purpose caulk, which is quite soft. An on-unit air regulator and 10 ft hose sure would enhance it's ease of use. Taking all things into account, I'm glad I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAULK MASTER AIR GUN","review":"I WAS HAVING FUN WITH, MY DAD I WORKED TOGATHER ON HOMES 25 YEARS.

The band's tight, the recording is perfect. And then there's Frank. The funny stuff is really funny (Punky's Whips, The Illinois Enema Bandit) and the guitar is unmatched (The Black Page, I Promise.) The remastered sound is great--has a real kick to it. Zappa fans probably already have this, but the curious to learn what Frank Zappa was like live could do no better than this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"good on LP, great on CD","review":"I've owned this one for 25 years or so, originally on LP. On LP this one was merely very good. The sound on the LP was very thin. The CD has much improved sound quality, and it has several tracks not on the LP. The infamous \\"Punky's Whips\\" was censored off the original LP. \\"Cruising for Burgers\\" and \\"Pound for a Brown\\" are very different from the Uncle Meat versions and great. \\"I Am the Slime\\" has Zappa doing half the vocals over vampire movie type music and then Don Pardo, the announcer from the original Saturday Night Live, hollering the other half. The added tracks and improved sound make all the difference!This album and \\"Roxy and Elsewhere\\" are great examples of his \\"Big Band\\" sound. The band includes Ray White, one of FZ's best vocalists, and Randy Becker on trumpet and Michael Brecker on tenor tax. They do great solos on \\"Purple Lagoon\\", although FZ somehow found it necessary to mess up the trumpet solo with sound treatments. Overall very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Band?","review":"This particular band is very tight and has quite a unique sound.

I watched it and immediately fell in love with it. I went online to look up the original short story by Poe to compare and contrast what i had seen. And i intend to check out Roger Corman/Vincent Price's adaptation as well. As we all know, Vincent Price was the master of horror and all movies related to Poe! I think all the actors and actresses, some fresh faces and others well known like Wes Bentley and Michael Madsen. Wes Bentley has that unique look and presence that makes him perfect for his part as Professor Merrick and the actress playing Ligeia couldn't be more fitting! Inspite of her 'dark' designs to do whatever it takes to live forever, i found myself ralling for her success. This is definitely a DVD i will purchase to add to my movie library at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie's writer was Edgar Allan Poo","review":"I was shocked to see this movie was 90 minutes long. It felt like 4 hours! Slow, boring, confusing, irritating.... I'm amazed I possessed the sheer willpower to make it all the way to the end of this dreadful piece. An extremely tough movie to get through. It doesn't really offer anything in the way of entertainment. If you have nothing, and I mean NOTHING, better to do then you could give it a shot. Otherwise there are hundreds of thousands of superior films. Such as Under Siege or 2012 or Cops and Robertsons or Boomerang or Troll or..... Well you get the idea. Just be warned, two stars was VERY generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb, DumbDumb. Need I say more?","review":"What else can I say about this film?

It fails miserably.I've seen quite a few Fangoria Frighfest movies and I haven't cared for one. Hence, this is the last one I will see."},{"rating":"1","title":"EMPTY TOMB","review":"This is the 2nd FRIGHTFEST I've seen out of the 8, and I hope the other 6 are better.Loosely based on Poe's somber poem, THE TOMB is snail-paced, predictable with surprisingly poor performances from Wes Bentley, Eric Roberts and Michael Madsen.Not frightening at all and dull as dishwater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.

Myself, I'm in the camp of people enjoy their newer outings. None of the songs on this album struck any kind of chord with me. At the time it was released, it may have felt really worthwhile to a great many people. But if that's the case, then the music hasn't aged well. I'm not happy to admit that I found nothing here worth getting excited about (as I really am a fan of this group), but there's no way around it; the whole of this disc is simply mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From This Band","review":"I first heard Breaking Benjamin's first single \\"Polyamorous\\", at first I thought it was some sort of a joke, the lyrics of this band could use a little work. You have to give them props for at least trying but the boring vocals and guitar we've all heard a million times on the radio doesn't cut it. I would advise to stay away from this band if you truly value music, it's obvious this group is set around the ages of 13 to 16.STAY AWAY!!!Go buy \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Metallica\\" or at least should I dare say \\"Cold\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!!!!!!!!","review":"This CD is great.

I liv ein the area where they grew up and toured at for the last two years. They have a EP out, which they only made 2000 copies of it has 5 songs on it; Home, Medicate, Polyamorous, Water, & Shallow Bay. They are a little different than what is on Saturate, they are a bit stripped down, but better, I think. If you want to know more, let me know. They Rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest CDs I've Heard","review":"This is the best album of 2002 and I see no sign of another disc eclipsing it anytime soon. The first song, \\"Wish I May\\", is the best with colorful, thought-provoking lyrics about friendship and the life that people leave behind. Another highlight is track four \\"Skin\\". This is just a catchy rock anthem that you will put on repeat. Just put the whole thing on endless repeat and I defy you not to do the air drums/air guitar. The only songs that keep this from being a perfect album are the last few but even they grow on you. If you end up liking this album, appreciating the lilting, sometimes haunting melodies, check out Outspoken. If your musical tastes overlap with mine to that point, needing meaningful lyrics to get really into an album, be sure and check out The Handsome Family and Atomic Eyes; they're from different genres but their songs are both eerily poetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys rock!!!","review":"I have followed these guys since they started and I must admit that I was nervous that the record company would kill their sound. Although some of the songs on the album sound a little different than I have heard them performed, they still rock. I can't stop listening to the CD. I will be very surprised if these guys don't make it big."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album is great","review":"this album is great. i first heard of this band because my brothers old drum teacher, Jeremy Hummel, is the drummer for this band, which is quite cool. i listened to the ep everyday and i was highly anticipating the release of this album. all of the songs are great but some of my favorites are \\"wish i may\\", \\"skin\\", \\"polyamorous\\", \\"natural life\\", \\"next to nothing\\", and \\"medicate\\". that is most of the songs on the cd which means they are all very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Band","review":"I first heard of Breaking Benjamin when i heard \\"Wish I May\\" on the credits of Wrong Turn DVD...and I instantly became hooked, so I decided to go out and get Saturate and I was totally blown away on how good the whole CD was..I was pretty much expecting it to be just a good single, but as time passes, and I listened to the CD more I was unable to take it out of my CD player..there is not 1 single song on this CD that I don't like, and then I purchased \\"We're Not Alone Here\\" first day it came out, once again I was amazed on their sophomore effort...to this day, there is not one BB song I don not like..even including non released tracks like (ordinary man, firefly, and halo's 2 Blow me away)...Breaking Benjamin is my favorite group and I hope there 3rd CD is as good as the first 2.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get both albums, you won't be sorry!","review":"Heard these guys from a Half-Life2 Video online (So Cold, other album).

But one simple review cannot easily describe the feeling I have for this disc. My friends all think I'm crazy minus a few, and I admit I'm obsessive when it comes to this band. Not only is every single freakin' song killer, but it raises the bar to a level that good, honest, heavy modern rock should sound like. Each song is well-balanced and thought provoking in its own way. Honestly, the reason I'm posting again is because I've heard the new song, \\"So Cold\\", and I'm awestruck. This lead single leads me to believe there is much more to Breaking Benjamin than their breathtaking debut, \\"Saturate\\". But for those of you who are unfamiliar, start here. Try a listen to \\"Medicate\\", \\"Phase\\", and \\"Shallow Bay\\"; three of the best songs I've ever heard period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Music","review":"I'd have to say.. Breaking Benjamin is an outstanding band, bought the CD only upon hearing Polyamorous.. and was not let down..A bit of different style of music, well worth it the purchase.

Its great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Depending on your style of rock and what not this could be one of the best cd's made in a while. This melody/hardrock/alter band coming from another band called \\"Lifers\\" is one of the best new rock groups around. If you like the mix with melody/hardrock you will love this cd. I have played it over and over and im not sick of it yet. Probably my favorite Cd for the 2000's and i cant wait for their sophmore album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Breaking Benjamin","review":"Saturate is my most played CD of Breaking Benjamin's. The CD is so much more raw and powerful while keeping that melody. I've had this CD for awhile and I still can't get enough of hard tracks like Medicate, my personal favorite Natural Life, Home, and Phase. All of the songs are great including their hidden track at the end of the last song. If you are looking to get into Breaking Benjamin and don't know where to start then this is the place. Ben's voice can be both soothing and bruising and it's so unique it gives the band a different sound no one else can copy. If you're a fan of Chevelle, Seether, or other bands that combine both melody and screaming in a perfect blend then you'll like what you get here."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST","review":"I love this CD!! It's the right variation hard and soft!! Every song is wonderful!! I really like \\"skin\\" and \\"next to nothing\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ALBUM OF 2002","review":"\\"Saturate\\" is one of my favorite albums ever, and definitely the best album of the year IMO. I love every single song on this album. Actually, I had to listen to the album 3 or 4 times thru before I really started liking it, but I sure am glad I did. It seems like I loved every song so much, that I was ready for one song to end cause I couldn't take the anticipation of the next, I was ready to hear it. All these songs are very catchy and could easily become hit singles across the country, or world for that matter. My favorite songs are: Home, Polyamorous, No Games, and Next To Nothing.01 - Wish I May - 3/502 - Medicate - 4/503 - Polyamorous - 5/504 - Skin - 4/505 - Natural Life - 4/506 - Next To Nothing - 5/507 - Water - 3/508 - Home - 5/509 - Phase - 4/510 - No Games - 5/511 - Sugarcoat - 4/512 - Shallow Bay - 4/513 - Forever (Hidden Track) - 4/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something different for the nu-masses","review":"Let me start off by saying that I'm not much for nu-metal, but Breaking Benjamin is something different all together. I find most of the music in this genre to be redundant and after a few listen's the cd would start sitting on the bottom of your shelf. I can practically promise you that Saturate will not sit on your shelf for a long long time.I first got into Breaking Benjamin about a year or so ago when I heard Polyamorous on a Internet radio station. then, like most I assume, I downloaded a few songs and was very impressed. I ordered the cd the next day. this is music that you can listen to whether you like mainstream rock or even a little harder stuff. buy it, listen to it, enjoy it to the fullest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Rock Gateway Drug","review":"As the pop-punk of my younger years started to lose it's edge, I begun looking to other types of rock to fulfill my musical addiction. Don't get me wrong, I still like a handful of the more modern punk acts (falloutboy, simple plan ect.), but they're few and far beyond these days. Breaking benjamin was like a gateway drug, one that exposed me to other, more talented acts, but still kept me coming back for more of them. \\"Saturate\\" brought the catchy hooks that made me feel at home, but there was something more about it too, something more advanced, something more original, something more than pop-punk could ever be. This isn't a rock album that's going to change your life, but if you've got a friend still in a nu-metal/ mtvpunk/hip-hop stage, give em' \\"saturate\\" and watch them evolve before your eyes. If nothing else, \\"saturate\\" has the power to expose you to something better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saturated with ho-hum 'prog' rock.","review":"THEORY OF A DEADMAN, SEETHER, REVIS, DOUBLEDROP, AUDIOVENT, etc, etc, etc. All of these new bands sound the same, just like BREAKING BENJAMIN.

I recently purchased your debut album Saturate and was rendered ill with the first innocent listen. You're riffs all sound incredibly alike and as boring as the one previous.

You steal ideas from TooL, Metallica, Nirvana, and anything else that deserves 5 stars, just so that you may imitate thier success.Nothing is new, interesting, captivating, or reletively creative.

I'm not sure if they had different band members in this album or if it was because it was an old album but I don't have a song I like on it. I'm one of those people who can listen to a album and get attached to at least 1 song and hate the rest, or dislike them, but there wasn't that 1 song in this record. I don't know what is wrong with it but it doesn't sound like the Breaking Benjamin I know in the other 2 albums I own....I can't wait to hear new music because the new music seems better than this. By far!. Sad but true :/ so disappointed...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nickleback?","review":"First off before my review. I dont think ive ever heard another band sound anything like Nickleback. Nickleback is the most least talented bands ever. They only get play time from their pop-rock mainstream singles which you only get one per album. The rest of their songs are just filler. Breaking Benjamin doesnt sound anything like them and well, they're just better than Nickleback. Saturate is a great cd but i do agree with another reviewer about We Are Not Alone being better. The little accent thing that Burnley does is a little annoying when used for every line but he does improve upon it in their sophomore cd. Overall this album gets 4 stars bc of Polyamorous and No Games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Future bargain bin selection.","review":"If Nu-Metal is this generation's answer to Hair Bands, these guys are certainly Britney Foxx.

I bought their cd and I haven't stopped listening to it. Saturate isn't one of those albums you buy and it only has two hit songs, no this cd you can listen from start to finish and not get tired of it or have to skip songs. Just a few of my favorites are Medicate, Shallow Bay, No Games, Wish I May, Polyamorous, Skin, Sugarcoat, and Home. Home is one of my favorites because the song has a tie in with the movie Wizard of Oz and I thought it was very original. If there was one cd I would buy it would definately have to be this one.

Now I buy CDs based on Amazon research --- looking for CDs recommended by people who listen to music that I like. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. This time it did.Breaking Benjamin came from a search on people who listen to Chevelle. I really like Chevelle and I really like Breaking Benjamin also. Good rock with catchy guitar riffs and cool rhythms in the baseline and drums. And the vocals are at times rough and at times smooth. There is a song which eerie-ly sounds like Bush (who I can take or leave) and another that is reminicent of Shihad (now known as Pacifier --- one of my favorite bands of all time). Other than those two songs --- the rest feels really original to me.If you like Chevelle, you will like these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love the lyrics","review":"Breaking Benjamin has two members who used to be with Lifer. In fact the bands are good friends. I enjoy the honest lyrics the best but Breaking Benjamin is just flat out great. \\"No Games\\" is my favorite off the CD by far..this is something I'd recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Great","review":"Heard \\"Polyamorous\\" and I was impressed, so I got the CD and it's great. I was surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album!","review":"This cd and we are not alone are the best cds ever. Bens vocals and lyrics are outstanding. Every song on these two cds were great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid debut","review":"\\"Saturate\\" is one of those albums that blurs the line between metal and hard rock, and does it quite well. The songs have a definite metallic crunch here, but a lot of the choruses are more upbeat and poppy. It works well though.BB is reminiscent of a lot of other bands at times on this cd, including Tool, Nickleback, Sevendust, Nirvana, and even Everclear (For some odd reason \\"Skin\\" reminds me of \\"You Make Me Feel Like a Whore\\"). They have a very dynamic sound though, Ben's vocal range is good, and he sings well. Musically, it's a solid album. \\"Natural Life\\" and \\"Phase\\" sound Tool-influenced, and have some complex riffs and hooks. \\"Wish I May\\" is a cool opener, sounding a bit like Nickleback at first. Singles \\"Polyamorous\\" and \\"Medicate\\" are good, catchy, harder songs. Overall, its a good album that sounds a little like everything else, without sounding too much like anything else, if that makes sense. I'd give it a 9/10.Best Songs: Shallow Bay, Sugarcoat, Natural Life, No Games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product.

Most Americans support traditional marriage which is evidenced by the continual support given it when this issue is put on the ballot for the people to vote on. Most negative reviews are about their disagreement not showing flaws in the research. The eveidence is overwhelming. Get engaged is the point. The larger voice in the democracy should not allow a very vocal minority to force us to support what we do not believe. Why? This is America. Bring your ideas to the arena of public opinion and stand them up with hard facts and data. If it's compelling we will agree. If not, all ideas are not equal. Some things do not work as the facts show in this work. If we really love America, society, and people we will point out that some behaviors wreck lives and society and other ideas bring blessing and peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hatred","review":"This man if full of hate.

If you're a fan of Mr. Dobson then you will be thrilled with this book. If you're looking for a reasoned analysis of the issues surrounding same-sex unions and American society then I'd recommend you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"El Stinko","review":"As is typical of misguided religious zealots like GW Bush or the Pope, Dobson relies on outmoded, ignorant ways of thinking to defend his arguments about gays. He is a prime example of why all of us should be suspicious of the medical profession. His thinking is repugnant; the cover of the book, with the wedding ring in CROSSHAIRS, is a disgrace. Shame on you Dobson. I'd rather go to hell for eternity than be in heaven with people like you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and Unconvincing Read","review":"As I read this book I felt it was deeply based on 'feelings' rather than straight facts. There is no evidence to back up most of his theories. If I were to guess, I don't think God was behind the making of this book at all. And as a Christian I would rather read a well written piece of literature from some one who had God backing him/her up all the way.I have no patience for people who are trying to get their point across in a non-christian manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Overview of America's Marital Crisis","review":"I've read a few other books on the subject of homosexuality in general and same sex marriage in particular, and this title is one of the best I have found. Dobson begins by describing the present state of marriages in America. He then gives a brief history of how we have slumped towards increasing acceptance of gay marriages.The best part of this volume is the latter half. Dobson makes several powerful, convincing arguments as to why same-sex marriages have a harmful effect on our entire society. The author then concludes his work by prescribing how people can get involved, stopping the moral erosion and preserving the very institution of marriage itself.This book is short and to-the-point. It could easily be read in one sitting. I recommend it highly to everyone who desires an understanding of the Christian, Biblical perspective on America's marital crisis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only got a star because ZERO wasn't an option","review":"This book is amazing in its ignorance. I'd say the continually rising divorce rate is more of a threat to the institution of marriage than the marriages of consenting adults. I don't buy the \\"it isn't natural\\" nonsense either. That is a rallying cry for those who are either uneducated or blind. Homosexuality has existed from the beginning of time in nearly every species this planet has ever seen. It's also funny when people who don't know anyone who is gay try to sound like they understand what it's like to be homosexual. This whole book is full of this faulty logic. Keep preaching to the choir Dr. Dobson. You're not moving this discussion forward, just blabbing away with hate and intolerance and a startling lack of empathy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book filled with false correlations, lacks citations in MANY statements, and is overall deeply rooted in pure fear.","review":"I read this book today in one sitting at the library. It is discretely littered with sexism and homophobia, but often times they are attempted to be covered up by statements such as \\"We love gay people BUT...\\" and so on. I almost wanted to ask the library if I could purchase it from them so I could use it 50 years in the future as a prime example of discrimination towards the LGBT community.Anyways, if you read this title, please, for our future children, families, and husbands and wives, do not be convinced by this book. It draws flawed conclusions, false correlations, and accuses homosexuality as the fault for nearly EVERY negative thing occurring in society.It also is laced with fear mongering tactics like I have never ever experienced in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing on \\"fire\\" is Dobson's pants.","review":"This book stands for everything that is NOT of God and Dobson's God definitely does not need to make secular laws. I hope all who read this garbage will see through this man who makes millions off of your fear and his hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is NO \\"Gay Agenda\\"","review":"There is no such thing as the \\"gay agenda\\" that the right-wing likes to complain about so much. All gay people want to do is be able to get married, adopt kids, and live their lives without constantly being told how \\"evil\\" they are. And by the way, anyone who actually takes Dobson seriously should do a little research into the number of social-scientists and researchers who have said Dobson has misrepresented their work."},{"rating":"1","title":"HITLER WAS RIGHT, THANK YOU JAMES DOBSON!!!","review":"Kudos to Dobson for blowing the lid off these scheming queers. Might I also recomend The Big Book of Jewish Conspiracies by Joshua Neuman; cuz you see \\"Like Adolf Hitler, who overran his European neighbors...\\" the author also fears the unknown and thinks gays have no better way to spend their time than to \\"implement a master plan to utterly destroy the family\\". Better idea, buy Mein Kampf and replace the word jew with gay, it'll be pretty much the same book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish i could do zero stars","review":"This book is hateful and spiteful. Gay people are equals and should have the rights of anyone else. I can't believe that so many people in America still believe archaic thought. While the rest of the world progresses toward non-discriminatory policies, the Christian right, like James Dobson promotes in this book, further separates the USA from the first world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who paid him to write this trash?","review":"You may have heard of a James Madison who, in the Federalist No. 10, warned us by saying:\\"The purpose of the Constitution is to restrict the majority's ability to harm a minority.\\"If the author had read The constitution before writing his book, he would understand what James Madison also called the \\"Father of the Constitution\\" meant.He meant that the constitution is to open rights to citizens and not limit them, he meant that people like James Dobson should spend their time reading the Constitution and try to open their minds instead of writing a hateful,odious, shameless and monstrous book trying to DESTROY our precious Constitution.The book is not worth spending a dime on. None of the arguments will convince an educated adult.What kind of monster is he to jeopardize our Constitution in order feed his biggotry?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps your office clean...","review":"Other than a little streaking, these wipes keep your office very clean and sanitized, so I have no complaints!Oh yeah, I haven't tried it, but they recommend that you don't use on glass or unfinished wood..."},{"rating":"2","title":"lenox plaster master blade","review":"blade is great for cutting lath & plaster & rock lath does'nt were out easily but the blades could be thicker so they don't bend as easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, Funny and often Profound","review":"Dispatches from Armageddon is a wonderfully entertaining and thought-provoking read. Michael York's writing is as engaging as his acting, while he generously shares his trials and triumphs, not only about the day-to-day process of creating a movie, but in the unique and fascinating daily experience of being Michael York. Although a fascinating look into making a film, it is much more than that. For it teems with acting advice, travel adventure, private moments, memorable quotations, humor and humility. And best of all, we are offered not only insight into how an actor works, but, more importantly, how a true gentleman lives. It is sincere and it is human, and each chapter unfolds like letters from a friend. This book is insightful, funny, and often profound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blades, stay sharp quite a while","review":"These blades can really take a beating and continue to maintain their cutting power.

The horn - dominated numbers fit perfectly with Frank's unique wah - wah style and George Duke's impressive keyboard work to produce an album that has lasted through time. From the long title cut to the ultra-funky keyboard riff of \\"Eat that Question\\" to the impressive, jazzy, and spacey sounds of \\"Blessed Relief,\\" this album is definitely worth buying if you are into FZ's jazz-fusion instrumental works. Other albums that I would characterize with this album are: Hot Rats, Waka-Jawaka, Studio Tan, and Sleep Dirt. Get this CD and groove to FZ at his finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy If you want to play on a CD player or PC","review":"The music gets five stars (it is a classic Zappa albulm), however I cannot play the music on a CD player, DVD player, or Blu Ray player. I tried to download it to itues from a pc and it won't play in the CDROM drive. There is a cool little Grab Wazoo mini poster as part of the packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just when you thought you had a handle on Zappa","review":"One of the many things I loved about our late, lamented Frank was his unpredictable versatility. Just when you thought you had a handle on what he was doing, he released an album like \\"Lumpy Gravy\\", \\"Cruisin' With Ruben and the Jets\\", or this one.This is Zappa's jazz big band album and man, is it amazing! French horns, tubas and all kinds of brass pop out of the recording at you along with the usual \\"Abnuceals Emuukha Electronic Orchestra\\" type of approach.I saw this band (which featured jazzman George Duke)in Chicago and they were amazing, although Frank was bemoaning the fact that they were'nt much on the \\"crazy stage antics\\" side of the equation. I sure wish I could go back and relive that episode from the non-rock side of Zappa.\\"Eat that question\\" and \\"For Calvin's Next Two Hitch-hikers\\" are top ten Zappa compositions, in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"no gaps in the spirit","review":"Concerning comments made by another reviewer about the gaps between tracks: At least on \\"Rahsaan Rahsaan\\" (and this is currently the only available CD issue), it's not much of a problem. Track 1 \\"The Seeker\\" is a medley, Rahsaan's quick trip through jazz history, running 17:21 without any gaps.Tracks 3-7 were recorded live at the Villlage Vanguard, and while there are gaps between the songs, it's not much of an annoyance. \\"Rahsaan Rahsaan\\" clocks in at 40:20--it's a short album. Collectables did a good job with the mastering. No actual music is cut off by a gap.So I wouldn't let the gap issue prevent you from purchasing this album. It's not Rahsaan's best, but it's nonetheless enjoyable and worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother labels","review":"If you are addicted to labelling EVERYTHING like I am, then you always need more and more tape.The gold on black looks great and matches right in on my Nikon cameras and lenses.This is a great product at a great price.

Fast forward the time frame a little to the age of steam an age that never existed save in such classics as Jules Verne's 20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea. This first adventure surrounds an evil artifact and one teenage girl's thirst for vengeance. Firearms exist in this adventure so DMs need to be a little wary about the possibility of the PCs getting their hands on them. However they are considered exotic weapons so getting them and using them may not be that much of an option. Privateer Press's website promises further development of this setting if you find you like the idea after running this adventure of a Steampunk style campaign. It's a refreshing idea whose time has come. Looking for a change of view and change of seting to a more \\"civilized\\" age? Try this adventure on for size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, poorly executed","review":"I owned and ran this book at one point and time, and my players detested it. The Iron Kingdoms and some of its unique culture and flair offers some nice flavor and possibilities, but my players absolutely felt the adventure way too linear, and too prone to highly restricting free will. The plot line plods along without possible tangents or opportunities or guidance to the DMs out there to go \\"off track\\" due to player choices, and defaults too much into antagonist confrontation situations where players have no hope to win and achieve victory. Obvioiusly there will be moments in games where players can't win the battles, but there should be glimmers of moments where highly creative groups have at least the slimmest chance and this book didn't offer that. People were selling this book at one point here for over $100, and that's just nuts. To me, it's worth the base $10 if nothing else for the content to add to a campaign environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Account of Witchcraft","review":"This is a great read for anyone interested in a cohesive, historical account of the place and meaning of witchcraft and magic in Europe.

I imagined everything in black and white throughout my quick gallop through these wonderful pages.Having never read a Linda Barnes mystery before, I was enthralled by the gritty language, the down-and-dirty description of the Boston streets, the no-nonsense tone, and above all, the main character, PI Carlotta Carlyle.Written in the mid 80s, this book is not outdated in the least. The plot concerns a group of Irish-American cabbies, all over 50, who may be running money and guns for the now-severly-restricted IRA. Accidentally stumbling into their activities while investigating a missing persons case, Carlotta finds herself in very deep trouble--the kind that can easily end in murder.This is a perfect book to devour one lazy afternoon while shutting the rest of the world out. I loved it, and intend to sample more Linda Barnes mysteries from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Female P. I. Book","review":"This is the first book in the Carlotta Carlyle series. It is in the same tradition as other female P. I. series such as Sue Grafton. Carlotta is single and moonlights by driving a cab. In this book you will also be introduced to her somewhat wacky roommate and her mob connected boyfriend as well as her \\"little sister\\", Paolina. Carlotta is very independent and after all is said and done, seems to want to do the best thing for people. In this book she is hired by an elderly lady to find her missing brother who turns out to be involved with the IRA. There are other twists and the ending came as a surprise to me. I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to others; especially to those who like \\"hard boiled\\" type mysteries with a female protagonist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feisty heroine","review":"Carlotta Carlyle doesn't go by the book, which may explain her defection from the Boston Police Department and her subsequent jobs as a cab driver and private investigator. In this first novel of the series, she is approached by an elderly woman named Margaret Devers who is concerned about the disappearance of her brother Eugene. Carlotta takes on the case, but comes up with a lot of blind alleys in her search for the missing man. She returns to her job as a cab driver to do undercover work and introduces us to the dispatcher Gloria who shows a lot of potential as a supporting character, as well as her partner Sam, a former lover of Carlotta's, whose family is into organized crime. Another nice touch is the Big Sister--Little Sister relationship between Carlotta and a young school girl named Paolina. Before the dust settles, Carlotta is involved with the IRA and drug pushers, but she never loses her \\"moxie\\" or her sense of humor. This is a good series with lots of potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"I <3 This Book","review":"I happened to come across another book in this series and liked it.

The dialogue is stilted and odd, much like his other books, but it works in those because of the paranormal/fantasy element. Here it was just incredibly off putting to me. The premise was a very interesting one, but I would have to say this book made me stop reading Piers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you'd expect -- and better for it","review":"If you're a fan of Anthony's 'Xanth' novels, you should probably approach this one with caution. Much like his earlier 'Incarnations of Immortality' series, this is fantasy of the darkest nature. Combining both supernatural and psychological horror, Anthony weaves his tale around a haunted tree, the spirit of which both befriends and terrorizes a grieving family. You're never quite sure where things might go, but twists do not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful and intelligent","review":"There was a day when Piers was known for more than his stupid and silly fantasies, and this is one the best books from those times. Much of the scenery and background is taken from his real life, but here he creates more suspense and drama than I've ever seen in any of his books. The characters are real and believeable, the writing is tight and descriptive, and the overall suspense of the book keeps you turning the pages until the very end -- where the book goes from suspense/horror to outright light fantasy. But hey, I'm not complaining, at least it's not some cope out, splatter the wall with blood ending that Stephen King has come up with a hundred and one times already. I highly recommend this book to all who are even remotely interested in this genre of writing; it is not, however, for those who are incapable of conceiving of literature beyond Xanth."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to ruin a great album.","review":"Add more bass to a recording doesn't mean that it sound well.

This is a dark, moody, yet laid-back record full of beautifully shifting tones. Zappa's voice is relaxed and warm, relaying tales of torture chambers, artificial girlfriends as well as spoofing the social/disco scene of the time. The vocal tunes are interspersed with incredibly inspired instrumentals, showcasing the beauty of Zappa's guitar technique (see \\"Black Napkins\\" for pure rapture\\") as well as his innovative new recording method, known as xenochrony, whereby he combined tracks recorded at unrelated performances on different occasions into the one song, with effective results. \\"Zoot\\" is a laid-back string of tracks, leaving one completely satisfied upon reaching its end.

This carafe spills more coffee all over my kitchen counter than in my cup when I attempt to pour.

Produces plastic taste in coffee - that is if you don't leave the lid up to allow the water to dry out after brewing. Makes you wonder what kind of toxins are making their way into your coffee.3. Carafe spills while pouring - I know this sounds unbelievable, but the poor design of the lid results in a mess when pouring at a moderate rate.I would advise against buying this coffeemaker. It looks good, but that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off and a Disappointment","review":"My purchase decision was based on the amount of coffee I make each day and small amount of counter real estate it takes.Whoever designed this did a horrible job. You have to dispense your coffee over the sink or you will end up spilling half of what is in the carafe all over your counter. No matter which angle, velocity or whether or not the lid is on or off when you pour, half of the coffee will end up on the side of the carafe or slide down the edge of your cup.When I called Cuisinart to complain, the CSR was not helpful at all and told me he never had a problem with it in their \\"lab\\". They would not take it back or replace it. If anyone ever decides to do a class action on Cuisinart for this model, please let me know. I would like to add in half of my coffee receipts for this year in the claim as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee, until ...","review":"I agree with the design flaws that are mentioned - yet I quickly learned that if you pour the coffee very slowly, the carafe wouldn't dribble. My knuckles didn't like the sharp \\"tooth\\" on the inside of the carafe rim (that helped to hold the lid while pouring) which could almost cut you when drying out the pot. I also didn't like the fact that the water filler / basket access lid always dripped condensation down the back side of the maker during clean-up. The final straw with this maker was when the cord melted. Sure, it was up against the back side of a toaster oven - but in my opinion, all counter-top appliances should have heat resistant cords.

For some reason, coffee doesn't all go into the pot. Some, just a little, runs down the side onto the hot plate. Unfortunately, it is enough to rust it. I also hate the way it pours. I now keep it over the sink, as some coffee always runs down the side and drips off the bottom when pouring. One star is a compliment, only because zero is not available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart 4 cup stainless NEVER AGAIN.","review":"I recently purchased this 4 cup stainless coffee maker and spend more time cleaning up the mess than I do drinking the coffee. I can honestly say that I have never experienced anything like it. First of all, when you pour the water in to the resevoir it is a task to get it all in there without spilling over the side due to the small size opening. Once the finished product is poured in to your coffee cup it spills all over the place no matter how careful you are. Additionally, the design of the handle for the filter basket gets in the way of the filter upon removal. This model clearly missed the testing and development phase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an insulated carafe","review":"Good value & makes good coffee, but the carafe is not insulated and the spout is so undersized that coffee drips down the side of the pot when poured -- so I have to give it 2 of 5 stars.

Actually, the leak was from any part of the plastic rim. When the plastic rim and the carafe body were separated (you need to unscrew the handle off and free the metal piece that locks the rim tight to the carafe), I found a piece of tube-seal inside the groove of the rim. The tube-seal was in several places crushed flat. The leaks came from those flattened areas of the seal. I was able to restore the original round shape of the tube-seal by hand. Once the restored tube-seal was put back in the groove of the plastic rim and the handle screwed back on, the leaks stopped. This 4-cut coffee maker is a good design and fine to look at.

It works well and haven't experienced any of the pouring/messes that others have had - Mr. Coffee pots always left the counter and maker itself a mess, so this little one is just fine. My only regret is that their definition of a cup is 5 oz., so a third mug of coffee is out of the question unless a second pot is brewed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at making messes","review":"I just brewed my fourth batch of coffee with this thing, only to discover coffee and grounds pouring over the side of the filter basket and all over my desk! What a mess... The culprit seems to be the little valve at the bottom of the filter basket that is supposed to open when the decanter is under it. Even though the basket and decanter were set fully in place, the valve didn't open. Upon careful inspection, it looks like the decanter has to be positioned exactly correctly on its hotplate to avoid this situation, i.e. you have to visually check that the valve is being pressed all the way upward prior to brewing.I have another, larger coffee maker with a \\"pause and serve\\" feature and have brewed hundreds, if not thousands of pots of coffee with it and never had an issue with the valve. This Cuisinart unit must be very poorly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, extremely poor execution.","review":"I mirror the sentiments from previous reviewers. This should have been a great addition to our kitchen. I hate burned coffee so the stainless steel pot seemed like a good idea. I'm the only coffee drinker in the family so the 4 cup size is perfect. However, this product is chalk full of design flaws. Major dripping when pouring from pot. Difficult to fill reservoir. Reservoir cover sheds condensed steam down the back of the unit. Makes you wonder whether they tested this unit at all before deploying to market. Junk, junk, junk. Don't let the shills hired by marketing companies to write reviews fool you. This product is complete garbage. On the plus side, it does make good coffee- too bad half goes down the drain when you try and pour a cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a MESS","review":"Carafe leaks when trying to pour coffee and/or water. Also, when you flip the top up after brewing, if there is condensation it drips down the back. This coffeemaker is such a mess. You can pour fast or slow but there's no way not to make MESS every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Dissapointed","review":"So I absolutely love the color pink, thus the reason for this purchase. I am terribly dissapointed...the reviews are right. I just now made my first cup of coffee, and while pouring it, I would say a good half cup of liquid dribbled out onto the counter, staining it. The pink rim that looks like it has been sealed to the stainless steal leaks. It was almost funny how much liquid leaked out. It's a bit ridiculous to be honest. If you love pink like I do, it still is not worth getting this machine. I am sad to say that this will be going back, and I will be without a pink coffee maker :("},{"rating":"2","title":"coffee lover","review":"I love this coffeemaker because I am able to make a cup of coffee and have it come out right.

I will never buy another brand. There is no glass carafe to break and it's the most reliable coffeemaker I ever had!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential but falls short.","review":"I agree with all of the reviewers that rated this poorly. I liked the size of the coffeemaker, since I'm the only one in my family who drinks coffee, the automatic shut-off, brew-pause feature, and the stainless-steel carafe, but the carafe leaks coffee when you pour it and I mean LEAKS, not drips. You lose nearly half your coffee pouring it. Clearly, a poor design issue and should be recalled. My brew-pause feature no longer works. This coffeemaker also doesn't seem to make hot coffee. My coffee comes out warm and if I use milk forget it, it's pretty much a cold cup of coffee. Such a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK coffee, but a dribble carafe and messy!","review":"First the good news - the stainless carafe, it fits under the overhead counter and brews OK coffee. Now the bad news. The dratted carafe is like a joke dribble cup and this is the messiest thing you can imagine. Something leaks water and coffee onto the hotplate, and it bubbles and boils and throws nasty black gunk onto the counter top. The gunk seems to be the result of a chemical reaction with the aluminum hotplate and is ugly stuff. I have yet to figure out where it comes from - it just appears. Cuisinart hit a real low with this one. I cannot imagine how they put it into production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a pretty face","review":"Handsome machine, as one would expect from this company, and just the right size for the two of us but a real pain to use. Just closing the lid is problematical - sometimes it goes down easily, sometimes it doesn't - and just try pouring coffee without spilling. After struggling for about six months, we've given up and decided to buy a non-Cuisinart replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"consumer review Cusinart 4-cup coffee pot","review":"I like the size, style and sturdy carafe. Pretty quiet to brew, typical slow drip brewing though. Also, can't find a carafe that doesn't \\"leak\\" or \\"spill\\" the coffee some as I'm pouring it into my cup! Footprint size is great for a tiny kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will be my second one and I really like it.","review":"I'm kind of bummed about the all the negative reviews to this brew maker and probably wouldn't have bought it if I hadn't already owned the black one for a few years now. Admittedly, pouring from the carafe is a bit of an issue but with the sink right next to the machine, I simply remove the lid and pour over the sink. I mean, don't you have to rinse the carafe anyway? I was/am excited to see this in pink and am looking forward to seeing every morning. It makes great coffee, is easy to use, and doesn't take up a lot of space. Yeah for the pink!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to pour","review":"This coffeemaker is impossible to pour without spilling. We have been using it for about 6 months now, and one has to be a practical Zen Master to get the art of dribbling it out (not too fast, not too slow) in order to not get coffee all over the place.Now, if you were going to make a coffeemaker, don't you think that a standard thing like pouring coffee would be one of things that you'd pay attention to?I am disappointed in Cuisinart - I have always loved their stuff, but we are going to have to upgrade to a coffee maker without this fatal flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable design","review":"The coffee itself turns out great, and it's plenty hot. The problem is trying to get the coffee in the cup. You cannot pour from the spout on the carafe. It will dribble, spill, and pour down the side of the container every time. It doesn't matter how slow/fast you pour or what angle you use. Overflow is a problem too, although I don't know how this happens as the pot isn't actually full. Did anyone at Cuisinart actually try to use this? I'd suggest a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"hot plate coating peels off","review":"Do not buy this coffeemaker. The tefelon coating peels off and Cuisinart requires $10 for shipping a new unit plus you must pay to ship old unit back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart DCC-450BK 4 cup coffee maker","review":"This is a product that Cuisinart should take off market. It's a piece of junk. You can't pour coffee out of thecarafe without it going every where except the cup.

I'll never feel the same about Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this contraption.","review":"Horrible design. Coffee spills easily when poured from carafe, making a mess. Coffee pot doesn't stay on for very long, so if you'd like to leisurely sit and enjoy your coffee before getting the second cup, forget it. My coffee pot started to leak around the filter holder. The coffee dripped and burned on the heater, eventually rusting the heating element. The whole thing ended up in the trash after a year and a half. I don't know what Cuisinart was thinking when they gave this design a green light. I thought that I would get a quality coffee pot based on the name Cuisinart, but no. I won't buy one of their products unless I research it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"fine if you don't mind having to pour each cup over the sink","review":"i've had this thing for about a year now. in general it gets the job done. but i have reached a breaking point with the constant mess this thing makes. a brain surgeon would not have a still enough hand to pour herself a cup without splashing coffee all over the place. i've taken to pouring my coffee over the sink. but really who can bear it? at first i thought maybe there's a hole in the carafe. i took a good look. no hole in the carafe. JUST A BIG FAT HOLE IN THE DESIGN. seriously. it splashes all over the place, wasting good coffee, soiling white shirts, dirtying the floors, running down the side of the mug, in general just wreaking havoc in the morning, a time that is stressful enough all on its own.i'm throwing mine out. maybe it's time to go back to the french press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful Carafe","review":"This thing leaked from the very first day I made coffee. I have recently thought of replacing the carafe 'til I read some of the reviews here. I had emailed Cuisinart during the first week of owning this thing and told them of my problem. Never an acknowledgement or answer. The leak, as stated in the reviews, is where the plastic meets the metal on the body of the carafe, not from the spout. This thing is a waste of money. I replaced it with a coffee press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a year of minimal use","review":"Not only did it never seem to make a good cup of coffee (especially when you use a gold filter rather than paper ones), but it broke after a year of rather minimal use. It just won't turn on no matter how much I mess with it.The coffee I made in it I never enjoyed drinking, but since it was for my office, I needed to choke it down anyway in my desperate need of caffeine. The coffee always tasted off in a way I can't describe accurately. The size is perfect for a cubicle, but it's just not worth it for the taste and value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reconsideration of old review","review":"After having owned this for over a year, I think my original review was overly enthusiastic. It seems that it would make more sense to just heat a couple cups of water and pour it through the coffee in a filter cone. Cleaning this little 2-cup appliance is not as easy as cleaning a kettle and a cup. There is no way to access the cavities where water remains after perking. Lifting up the lid during the percolation cycle is an invitation to an explosive scald. I think electric coffee makers are best for larger volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless junk","review":"Do not buy this. It is a worthless piece of junk. The carafe leaks coffee all over the counter. The auto shutoff is too short. I'd take it back, but I suspect they won't accept the pieces it's in now. Major mistake on my part, one I won't repeat. Don't buy this JUNK."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite coffee maker","review":"I've owned THREE of these. I burn them out after a few years of heavy use.

The gold one they sell here,Cuisinart GTF Gold Tone Filter, is perfect. I've only ever bought one of those.SPILL MUCH? HERE'S A TIP: Yes, it will spill coffee if you pour like a drunken sailor. You have three options: be patient and pour slowly over a sink OR pour while holding the lid open OR do what I do. I drill out some of the plastic in the spout to make the holes bigger and create more room to pour. If you don't have a drill, get a friend who does. Just use a drill bit slightly larger than the holes. Ideally you want to get two or three of the holes to be a single hole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor design","review":"If a company like Cuisinart can't design a coffee pot that will pour without spilling it's contents all over the counter, should I buy any of their other products? (I think not!) How could they have NOT tested this product to see how it pours? There is no way to pour from this coffee pot, except to allow just a tiny trickle of coffee to leave the pot.

The brew-pause feature stops working. It's almost impossible to pour anything from the carafe without dribbling. I called Cuisinart customer service and was told about the once a month regimen of brewing with vinegar, letting the vinegar brew sit for 40 minutes, then scrubbing with a bottle brush. When I rejected customer service's maintenance routine as too time consuming, I was referred to the retailer for to try to return it.Other coffee makers that I own or have owned worked very well with not more than once a year vinegar maintenance."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not pour without dripping","review":"This coffee maker is nice looking and compact, but I can rarely pour a cup (either water into the machine or coffee out of the carafe) without dripping all over the counter.

Maybe ours is defective, but I wouldn't chance it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and robust coffee maker","review":"After seeing one of these in use for a number of years (so they certainly last), I decided to buy my own and was not disappointed. The coffee maker itself is easy to clean as well as the pot (metal so don't worry about breaking it). It's certainly not huge but makes enough coffee for me on one go. I don't think I have any real complaints about this coffee maker, as the coffee always tastes great. Of course you could certainly have more features, but you should realize when you're buying this one that it's all about simplicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I am very disappointed in this coffeemaker. Had one that i bought 6 years ago and loved it. When it broke i ordered another one. The quality now is very poor. The plastic and stainless steel is very thin.

Would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing product","review":"I bought this product two years ago; at first I was satisfied with its performance, but during the past year I have encountered the same problem other reviewers have mentioned: when pouring the coffee after brewing, steady leakage occurs from the carafe. This causes a puddle of coffee on the countertop (and less coffee in your cup). It's now so bad that I have to pour the coffee into the cup over my sink, to catch the leakage. This is very disappointing, considering Cuisinart's reputation. I love my Cuisinart food processor (I've had the same model for almost twenty years), but cannot recommend this coffeemaker, which I am replacing ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Hot","review":"The water is only heated lukewarn to the point that coffee is noticeably weaker than other coffee makers.Can't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The carafe drips as I pour water into the reservoir no matter what my method or how slow I pour.

It's great for one, and for an elderly person (carafe is not breakable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What We Expected","review":"We are disappointed in this coffeemaker for the following reasons: Being unhappy that this 4-cup coffeemaker really makes only one mug of coffee, I called the company. Their representative told me that their standard for one cup is 5 oz., which means that to fill one mug you need to fill to their 3-cup marker. Also, the carafe is poorly designed making it impossible to get all of the coffee out, due to a plastic lip at the top of the carafe. This is also a problem when washing and rinsing - can't get all of the water out. The coffee is not hot enough even when used immediately after brewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart 4-cup coffee maker","review":"The Cuisinart 4-cup coffee maker is poorly designed. The electric cord is so short that it must be positioned in front of an outlet to be plugged in. The most frustrating thing about it is that the heating element automatically turns off much too soon. Before I have finished my first cup of coffee, the second cup has cooled off while still in the pot. The lid must be pried off for cleaning. A little knob on top would have solved this problem. I always had a high opinion of Cuisinart products before this, but I don't now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design and expensive","review":"I bought this coffee maker hoping that the Cuisinart brand meant good quality and design. The device does make good coffee, but the stainless carafe drips -- a lot. Apparently, the plastic rim around the top of the carafe causes coffee to spill. I've taken to pouring coffee over the kitchen sink, so I don't have to spend as much time cleaning up. You can spend much less and get a coffee maker that is just as good and less of a hassle to use. I'm going back to my faithful and dripless Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG \\"ZERO\\"","review":"I'd give this 4 - cup Cuisinart coffeemaker a big ZERO. The design flaw is inexcusable - it drips. The pour spout on the carafe is so tiny that you can not possibly pour a cup of coffee without dripping coffee on the countertop. Not only that, when you try to fill the reservoir - water goes everywhere. The little rocker on/off switch is hard to maneuver with one hand - you have to hold the machine down with one hand and turn the maker on with the other. Cuisinart can surely beat this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 oz. \\"cups\\" are NOT cups!","review":"I just opened my coffeemaker, all excited to have coffee again after the last one broke. I figured even if someone else came over, 4 cups would be enough for us. Sure, it would have been.. if 4 \\"cups\\" in Cuisinart-land really meant cups. However, it means 5oz. Normal cups are 8oz. That means that this coffeemaker can make 20oz, or 2.5 normal-people cups. Definitely a trick marketing ploy in my opinion. Why not be more explicit about it on the box? Or use a different word from \\"cups.\\"I'm only doing the research now and the product has been discontinued from Cuisinart [...] .Hmm.. the coffee isn't that good either.. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd Read the Reviews","review":"I've loved every Cuisinart appliance I've owned until now.

I'm not careless and I've tried every which way, but it just doesn't work. The coffee is never hot enough. Also, it doesn't brew nearly as quickly as my 4-cup Mr Coffee did. And I could overlook those problems if it brewed a good tasting coffee, but it doesn't. Tried different coffees and varied amount of coffee used. Let's not forget to mention how inconvenient the on/off button is. Need 2 hands to manipulate.Oh yeah, the auto off works, but that just isn't enough to make me happy. Sorry I bought it. Would return it if I had kept the box, so looks like Goodwill has a Cuisinart 4-cup coffeemaker coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Coffee Flavor","review":"I own a 12 cup Cuisinart coffee maker that makes delicious coffee.

I would advise one to do a taste test on this model before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st time review","review":"After reading all the negative reviews for this product I almost didn't buy it. Lots of complaints about pouring and taste. I have found that after reading reviews on many different products, a large percentage of the negative ones have to do with the user, not the product. When a reputable manufacturer has the same product on the market for an extended time you can be sure they will redesign it for legitimate complaints. I can't figure out why my pot had none of the problems many critics experienced. It performs perfectly has no pouring problems and the coffee is great. I recommend it highly and am glad I bought it. Surely this wasn't just luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"six months of pouring coffee mess, then death","review":"The \\"carafe\\" would not pour without dribbling. Very aggravating. And, like another reviewer mentioned, coffee gets cold almost immediately after it shuts off in 30 minutes. I was heating a lot of coffee in the microwave.

And, no more Cuisinart products for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed","review":"This feels like one of those products that was never tested before it was released. It's not that it's a lemon, it's just that using it day to day, you discover it's packed with a myriad of little annoying features.Here's a few:When you pour from the coffee pot, it almost always dribbles down the side, spilling coffee everywhere.The coffee pot doesn't slide easily into place.The top lid doesn't close down easily or secure properly.It's four tea cups of coffee, but only two standard mugs of coffee.Because the pot is stainless steel, it's hard to know when the coffee is done and ready to serve.There's no indicator that the coffee is done and ready to serveActually, that may be all of my complaints, but really, that's everything this coffee maker is supposed to do. How can you screw up everyone of them? I guess the power source works okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply good coffee!","review":"This coffee maker is very simple to use and very easy to clean. I really like the flavor it brews, also. I do agree with one other reviewer about the stainless steel carafe not keeping the coffee warm enough after the hot plate shuts off, but it's not a thermal carafe so it was not expected to. Besides, it's a four cup (or 2 1/2 big cups) machine...sooo usually my coffee is gone within that time anyways. mmmm. That was a good cup of Joe.If you are looking for a great cup of coffee with ease of use this is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAB little addition to my pink breakfast environment.","review":"I've read some previous reviews complaining that this little carafe does not pour well. While that is true in some ways, if one is careful not to tip the full carafe too far it does not spill at all. Just to be safe I do pour it over the sink. Nevertheless, if not in a hurry it will indeed pour without much of a spill, if any.The color is perfect, just as it appears in the advertisement. It is fast and easy to use. I purchased it for my master suite's bathroom because yes, that is how much I adore having my coffee first thing in the morning. I rev up this cheery little machine, carry the carafe to my studio and voila, I am set for the next hour. Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't usually give negative reviews, but.....","review":"This coffee maker annoys me enough that I will take the time to review it. I'm giving it one star simply because they don't allow any lower rating. My disappointment is because this is a Cuisanart, a brand I used to trust. I also like the idea of a stainless steel carafe that would not break the way my last glass carafe did. What I dislike most about the coffee maker is the stainless steel carafe for two reasons. It dribbles when you pour and it makes cold coffee and I have to let the coffee sit on the burner for 10 minutes after the brew is finished so it will be hot enough to drink after I put the milk in. I am glad they cut the price by 60% because at least it doesn't feel so much like I got ripped off by Cuisinart. In this price range there are half a dozen better coffee makers by other brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes small is better","review":"We just received the black one as a gift from my sis & her hubby. It's just my husband and I and the huge coffee maker we had was just to much. We are really liking this machine. We especially like the carafe. It is hard to put the water into it using the carafe but it was also hard to put the water into our big one. I solved that by using a measuring cup. So far we are not having a problem pouring the coffee from the carafe into a cup and it's very hot. I have to have my coffee very hot. With our other one, I had to microwave my coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice for a small desktop but not built to last","review":"Had this Cuisinart coffee maker for a year now. The coffee was fairly decent in quality compared to some its larger siblings from the same company, but the unit just isn't built to last. First, I had to return this item after a few months since the element stopped heating the hot plate at one point. Second, the plastic rim around the coffee pot now leaks when I try to pour from the pot. It used to take a steady hand to prevent spills before (very easy to do with this model). However, now it leaks not matter what since the sealant holding the plastic to the metal pot no longer holds up and leaks all the time. This after just under a year of use (I use the machine about 3 times a week at work)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine!","review":"Bought this to use in our RV - we don't usually drink a whole pot of coffee while camping, so the four-cup coffee maker fit the bill. The color of red is not bright red, but matches our red kitchen items just fine. The insulated carafe is a nice idea (especially if, like us, you don't want a glass carafe that can break in a bouncy camping vehicle going down the road), but doesn't really keep the coffee any warmer because the lid is vented and the heat escapes out the venting holes. Still, it makes coffee like you want it made and works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"We like this product. Would make two small changes. 1. I woul;d make it 25% larger capacity to enable two \\"American\\" size cups of coffee with a few drops left over. 2> There is a plastic rim around the stainless carafe with a bit of a rim so that one cannot get every last drop out of same. Not a big deal by any means. Would just be slick to have a one piece stainless carafe with no plastic rim piece.It would be nice if carafe were glass and to be able to see the level of liquid inside but it is so nice not to have to worry about breaking it that I think it is a good trade off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"The carafe isn't insulated, coffee is either cooked or cold.

As soon as I got it out of the box I could see that the pot size was too small for even 2 cups of coffee. I had expected 4 5-oz cups worth for a total of 20 oz. which is enough for two 10-oz cups. I filled the carafe with water and poured it into a measuring cup. Sure enough! Less than 16 ounces! If all you want is one cup of coffee this is a lot of trouble and clean up to go through, but it will probably meet your needs. The idea of putting the remaining 2 or 3 ounces of coffee on the little warmer plate is a joke though. It will be smoke pudding in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.....

It worked fine until two weeks ago when a critical plastic element broke. (Keep in mind, this was used seasonally, not daily for thee years.) Because I was so pleased with the black model originally, I purchased a white one for home. The carafe lip is slightly different, and all the reviews that describe it as dribbling or dripping when pouring are on target. It's a pain in the neck. The same design flaw is true of the red model which I purchased for our office. You cannot pour it without it dribbling down the side of the carafe, at least by the end of the pot. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Coffee Maker with no threat of carafe breaking!","review":"The glass carafes of the last two coffee makers cracked in an untimely manner.

The contents drip down the side no matter how carefully you pour. Leaving the lid on while pouring works better than taking it off, but either way have a rag ready. There are better options.

Within about a month the plastic handle for the coffee filter holder broke off and could not be repaired. A replacement part was not available.Yesterday the my coffeemaker would not turn on/off. I noticed several other reviewers here had trouble with the on/off switch as well.Two years is way too soon for an appliance such as this one to stop working.

It was a nice size for one person who drinks only one cup of coffee per day and it made decent-tasting coffee. However, I, too, had issues with it spilling water and coffee all over the place regardless of how careful I was. And two weeks ago it began shutting itself off after only a minute or two of brewing. Now it won't stay on for more than a second.I've gone out and purchased aBraun KF590E Impressions Digital 10-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker. Unfortunately, it's much larger, but brews a better-tasting cup of coffee.

I find myself brewing more to compensate for the spillage that will inevitably occur."},{"rating":"1","title":"spillage always a problem","review":"I wanted to like this coffee maker because of the stainless steel pot, but unfortunately the problems outweigh the great advantage of a durable pot. The main problem is spilling--either from the coffee brewing so fast that it overflows the paper cone, or from pouring as carefully as possible and still having spillage from the spout. If I can find another small pot with stainless pot I will ditch this one ASAP.

While this fit the bill, its design has a few flaws that make it a pain to use. The pot lid does not fit correctly and drips all over the place when filling your cup. Makes it very incovenient as I have to wipe up spills constantly. The interior unit that houses the coffee filter does not rest securely in its seat so the lid never completely closes. More of an asthetic thing, but Cuisinart should have design engineers that would have spotted this.

Downside, it leaks.

Do NOT buy this coffee maker for any reason! It is almost impossible to pour the coffee without spilling it. The pour spout is flat. What were they thinking? You need to use your nails to pry the lid off the carafe. Stupid design all around. It barely holds enough water to make coffee for 2 mugs. It is hard to fill compared to the other brands. It takes twice as long to brew a pot. The claim that you can interrupt the cycle to pour a cup is false. It keeps brewing and sputtering. Messy and slow.

It does make good coffee. However, it spills, it sloshes, it makes an enormous mess. I pour it slowly, I pour it quickly, I pour it with the lid on and with the lid off the carafe- doesn't matter. I end up with water everywhere when I'm filling it up, and I end up with coffee everywhere when I'm trying to pour a cup. It's also nearly impossible to pour all the water into the reservoir - there's far too much lip on the carafe cover, and the angle is very awkward.If you do manage to end up with some coffee in your cup, it IS good, and it does stay very hot. I'm not sure that's worth the extreme irritation first thing each morning, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"Bought it due to good brand reputation and some good reviews. Only (& irredeemable) problem is: Every single cup tastes like stainless steel! The carafe, which looks good, destroys the flavor.

Don't waste your money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Mess!","review":"I'm usually a huge fan of Cuisinart products, but was very disappointed with this coffee maker. Despite attempts to pour more slowly or with the carafe less than full, it leaks all over every time I pour a cup of coffee.

I plan to replace it as soon as I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps coffe hot--that's its only advantage--poor performance and quality.","review":"Purchased the unit about 6 months ago and have never been happy with it. The heating plate under the pot started to rust; the pot leaks every time it's poured; it's almost impossible to pour water into the water chamber without spilling it; the handle of the coffee basket broke within a few months; and two days ago the entire top of the unit snapped off when we opened it to pour in the water.

It's ok but far superior to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy coating","review":"I've only had this coffee maker for a few months and already the coating on the surface that the pot sits on is flaking. There's a big bare metal spot that is constantly growing in size.I must say that it does make fair coffee and I haven't had the spillage problems that others have had.It does seen to be cheaply make. The pot seems to me to be made of aluminum rather than stainless steel.But I am really concerned about the heating and safety as the coating continues to peel off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have listened to the negative reviews.............","review":"I would not recommend this coffeemaker to anyone. The coffee does taste funny and I didn't realize it might be the metal pot. Also, DO NOT pour the coffee unless your cup is over the sink as one quarter of the coffee spills out.

The only thing I like about it is the size!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product!","review":"I bought one of these a few years ago thinking it would be nice to have the unbreakable carafe. This is without a doubt the worst coffee maker I have ever owned. I would have returned it, but could not find my receipt. Carafe leaks around the rim, the pause and pour feature does not work most of the time. I have a Krups and broke the glass carafe, but I would not buy anything from Cuisinart again."},{"rating":"1","title":"drippy mess","review":"Horrible design.

I don't know if it's the steel carafe (I've used only glass carafes before) or if there's something screwy with the way the coffee brews, but the flavor is flat out disappointing. Someone suggested in another review that the coffee's flavor has a plastic tinge, and it may be that, I guess. Coffee reacting with something else. Chemical. Unpleasant. I'm buying a replacement.

It doesn't have all the bells and whistles but it has the heat base which keeps the coffee warm for about an hour (a very useful feature!). It's not programmable, but it makes four cups in a few minutes so that's not a feature that's missed very much. The only gripe I have with this coffee maker is that it is difficult to pour out the last drops of coffee.If you're looking for a small compact stylish coffee maker and only need 2-3 cups a day, then this is a good choice. We also bought the permanent filter, which has been a good investment for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to Mr. Coffee","review":"My experiences parallels the 1-Stars reviews.

I am done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I've only had this thing for a few weeks, but I don't like it already. I agree with the others that the carafe is flawed. I can't pour slowly enough to keep coffee from getting all over my counter.I also don't like the fact that it's not really \\"thermal\\". It does shut off after the coffee is brewed, and it rapidly gets cold. The first cup is fine, but the second is always lukewarm.

Because, the water runs thru so darn fast that if you look at your coffee grounds, some are not even wet.

It makes decent coffee, but the design makes it a pain to use.- It's awkward to fill the water reservoir since the lid is in the way and only provides a narrow window of access- When pouring the coffee it spills all over the counter regardless of whether it's a fast or slow pour.- You have to make sure the pot is perfectly seated and the lid on the machine is closed tight or the coffee will backup in the filter basket making a mess. Even when I ensure that everything is seated properly, it will still occasionally back up in the basket until I press down on the lid.It's being relegated to my coffee maker graveyard shortly since I just ordered a Zojirushi 5 cup maker.

I noticed a lot of others on amazon and BB&B have similar complaints about it leaking everywhere, the water pumping into the basket too quickly and overflowing the edges of the filter, grounds in the pot, and the stainless steel carafe is not insulated (I can't believe how fast the coffee gets cold!)

I've been using it for about 10 months now:Pluses:Looks nice, brews hot coffee very quickly.Minuses:Since it brews coffee very fast, the coffee doesn't steep as long in the filter, I found you actually need MORE coffee grounds to make a comparably strong pot of coffee compared to my old Mr. Coffee maker, which let the coffee drain slower.The carafe drips all over the place when you're pouring. I kept thinking the lid was on wrong but it does, in fact, dribble like a joke. I see many other people are complaining about the same poor design.The stainless steel carafe makes it difficult to see how much coffee is left. And although it looks like it's one of those insulated carafes, it is not.As a \\"safety\\" feature, the coffee maker turns itself off automatically after only 15 minutes. This would be fine (and expected) if it was an insulted carafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carafe Drips","review":"Received this coffee maker for my birthday. It basically does what it is designed to do and more. The \\"and more\\" part is the dripping of coffee on the counter and the dribbling of the coffee to the bottom outside of the carafe with subsequent transfer to the hot plate. I have tried pouring ever so slowly, stuck my tongue out the right side and left side of my mouth while pouring to no avail. The really sad thing is that I just saw a GE 4 cup coffee maker, the exact same design, sans the metal carafe, for $10 at Walmart. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaking Carafe and terrible design","review":"The carafe leaks when trying to pour coffee and/or water.

The red and stainless steel are a nice change from the typical black or white plastic, and the small footprint was an asset in a small kitchen. However, a number of shortcomings have become evident. The design of the carafe is flawed: you can't pour out all the coffee without removing the cover. The black rubber feet leave marks on the counter. The light on the on/off switch is impossible to see in direct sunlight, and the rocker switch is annoying on its own merits. I wouldn't purchase this again, and my experience with other Cuisinart products has been disappointing. Unfortunately, it's difficult to find a well-designed four cup coffee maker at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, poor design","review":"This little coffee maker should have been perfect for me, but the longer I used it the more maddening it became. The spout of the carafe is poorly designed, and it is impossible to pour a cup without the coffee dribbling and leaking all over the place. The lid of the water tank is also awkward, so filling it without spillage is also difficult. The spring-loaded drip-stop feature works most of the time, but not all the time, so don't remove the pot while still brewing, even though you're supposed to be able to do so.The materials and assembly quality of this coffee maker are good, and it makes a decent cup of coffee, but it also makes a mess in the process. Making four cups of coffee shouldn't mean having to clean up a cup's worth of spilled or leaked coffee and water.After hearing me complain about this thing, my mother gave me a Mr. Coffee TF5 4-cup coffee maker as a gift that is much, much better, and I'm very happy with it. This Quisinart went straight to the dumpster."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Buy","review":"Nice looking; goes with my urban loft. The downside to the stainless carafe is that you can't see the coffee in the pot while you're making it, so you have to guess when it's done based on the drip sounds (or lack thereof), though there is a handy drip-pause feature. Also, the carafe-top clips in instead of opening with a lever so you can't peek into the pot easily. The upside is that it's much easier to maintain than a glass carafe...you don't get that impossible to remove sludge accumulating on the bottom if you accidentally leave it on for too long or forget to wash the carafe one morning. As far as the coffee goes, you get what you pay for: of course it's not as good as what a Bunn/other high-end machine would produce, but it's smooth-tasting and good for the average coffee-lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes coffee taste like you licked a 9-volt battery","review":"I've had this coffee maker for about three months...and yes all the things people complain about are true: hard to poor, spout drips, condensation on the flip cover, messy, etc. But to be fair all coffee makers (or any appliance for that matter) have their little nuances. I could forgive all of these shortcomings but what I can't forgive is the taste. The coffee taste like it's been in a stale rusty canteen for six months. From the very first cup the metal taste obliterates any subtle flavors the coffee has. I assume it is a result of a stainless carafe that is not lined with glass. I (or my wife) am in no way a coffee snob but we can't stand that metal taste. I don't understand why more people haven't addressed this issue in their reviews. We are looking to replace this machine ASAP.Otherwise, general quality is quite good. I think if we could replace the carafe with a glass one this would be a good little coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standard","review":"I just returned this coffee maker, because the spring on the bottom of the drip unit did not operate properly.

I had 2 previous models that failed in the same manner so I believe there is a design flaw and I am disappointed that Cuisinart does not make a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv my coffee","review":"It's just right for the single guy who doesn't like to wash up afterwards. Not much to it, keeping it simple. I like that. The auto shut off is great. It's steel so if I had a ruff nite and drop it, no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the side of those who say it is not a quality coffee maker.","review":"I love Cuisinart appliances...normally. This is bit of a disappointment. It does leak when you pour no matter what. It comes out of the spout and also around the rim where the pink plastic meets the stainless steel. For those who say theirs does not leak, they lucked out and got a good seal around the rim. We will try to fix it and see how it works then. It is okay if you drink coffee fast, but that is not me. I will stick with my Mr. Coffee coffee maker for now. This is a cute, but not so worthwhile appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but a odd taste","review":"I purchased this item as it was red and perfect for just the two of us. It came in scratched, not bad but noticeable and but very happy about it overall, until we made coffee in it the next day. Wow the taste was simply horrid, tasted of plastic, maybe metal but it was a no go for us. I sent it back right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carafe needs to be redesigned","review":"I bought this $29 coffee maker after first buying and returning a $10 Mr. Coffee 4 cup coffee maker simply because they (Mr. Coffee) changed the filter basket. I went to 4 stores and couldn't find filters for a 4 cup maker (the supermarkets and CVC only carried the larger size).Basically, you are paying 3 times as much for the Cuisinart marque because they both do a fine job of making decent coffee. My beef with the item is that while the carafe is nice in stainless since one can not break it, it does a horrible job of pouring the coffee, i.e., expect to pour 8 oz. in your cup and an ounce on the counter. I wrote to Cuisinart and they never responded. I would rather go back to a glass carafe then constantly have to clean up the counter after trying to pour my coffee. This is the reason I only gave two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every time I use it, it makes a mess","review":"I have owned this coffee maker for over six months and I have found that it is imposible to pour from the carafe without it having it leak all over. I'm actually shopping for a new one when I found this same model and decided to leave the review. Save yourself the trouble buy another coffe maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Exactly As It Should","review":"This is the perfect coffee maker for the single person/coffee drinker. It works exactly as it should, with none of the complicated nonsense. I also urge everyone to completely disregard any negative reviews about \\"leaking\\". The pot does not leak. If you pour very quickly and at an extreme angle (easy to do with such a small pot), a few drops can come out of the receptacle in the center of the lid. It should be an embarrassment that so many people have failed to grasp the concept after more than 1 or 2 occurrences. The coffee maker works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mornning coffee nyc","review":"While I generally like Cuisanart products, I'm sorry to say this coffee maker is the worst. It's close to impossible not to spill when pouring from the carafe. I pour very slowly, I've tried different heights--doesn't help. It also overflows constantly while brewing. And the \\"brew pause\\" has never worked. I've tried everything--less water, fewer beans, finest grind possible--all possible grinds-nothing works. I just have to say it's a lemon. The company has sent me new parts, even a new carafe--it makes no difference. I'm appreciative of their concern, but bottom line is THIS IS A BAD PRODUCT!!! i'M SORT OF RESIGNED AT THIS POINT--SO I'M HOPING IT WILL GIVE OUT SOON & I CAN GET A MR. COFFEE. Cuisanart would probably replace this one, but why replace a lemon with a lemon? And what to do with this one? I don't want to donate a lemon to Goodwill, nor create unnecessary refuse--so I'll wait I guess til it goes kerplunk for good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst coffee maker ever!","review":"This was a total waste of money; after struggling with it for a month I have thrown it away and bought a new one. The hot water boiling through the filter spills over carrying grounds both into the coffee in the carafe and all over the kitchen counter, the carafe is badly designed and spills every time it is used, I could go on but can't be bothered. Do yourself a favour and get a different coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Cuisinart","review":"This should have been ideal. Right size, good brand name, cone filter, stainless steel...It brews 4 six ounce cups in 8 minutes, which gives you a weak brew.The stainless steel carafe is very hot and when I held the handle and my knuckles touched the carafe, OUCH!Don't remove the carafe until all four cups are brewed or the filter will drip.I expected more from Cuisinart. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad design, cannot pour coffee without spilling almost as much as gets to the cup.","review":"Very poor design, spills as much as hits the cup. the brewer part seems ok but it's just not worth the hassle. Mine is going into the trash this week, money down the drain (or into the landfill)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such poor design, should be recalled","review":"The carafe is so poorly designed that there is virtually no way to pour a cup of coffee without spilling about 5% of every single cup of coffee. This item should have been recalled and destroyed, not sold to unsuspecting customers online to reduce the likelihood of a customer returning the product. I am very dissatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play with the lid!","review":"I received this a few days ago to replace my old coffee maker. The first day was a disaster - it dripped more coffee onto the floor than into the cup. I figured I would keep it one more day and see if I could find out why this happened. After a few minutes I discovered that I had to put the top of the carafe on correctly to get it to snap in. The next day, not taking any chances, I held my cup over the sink and held my breath. Not one drop spilled from the carafe.It lost a star from me because it shuts down to fast.Other than that I think it is a gem.I have prime so I ordered it from Amazon. As promised it came in two days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee is good if you like the taste of plastic chemicals","review":"Length:: 1:08 MinsOur review of the Cuisinart 4 Cup Coffee maker with Stainless Steel Carafe and our Experience with Cuisinart Customer Service"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dribbles","review":"Makes great coffee, brews fast.

Am thinking of it as being this year's Christmas present for the households..."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too much","review":"We didn't get this through Amazon and were totally disgusted with it. It was unable to perform the basic function of pouring a cup of coffee without dribbling it everywhere. This is bad enough when pouring coffee and is even worse when filling the base unit. Didn't make any difference to pour slowly or quickly, with or without the lid. Although it seems to make sense to have a stainless carafe, not being able to see what's left in the pot is a bit of a pain and I'm sure is the reason for the 30 minute shut off. The problem is that 30 minutes is a bit short and only seems to add to the annoyance. Furthermore, Cuisinart simply ignored attempts to contact them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart 4 cup coffe pot","review":"Makes a great cup of coffee, doesn't drip, unless you try to pour too fast and get coffee out at the edges of the spout.

You can count on it always dripping and making a mess. I would think that Cuisinart could design a carafe that doesn't drip, but this is not it. It always drips, so if you get this, count on always pouring over the sink. Just a bad design really. The plastic ring around the top of the carafe allows coffee to drip down the side every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Little Coffee Maker","review":"Reading some of the negative reviews here, I was somewhat hesitant getting that little coffee machine.I got it anyway, and I am very happy that I did. It now gives me good hot coffee every time.It never leakes a drop, and the carafe pours just perfectly. Also, I don't have to worry abouta cracking or breaking glass carafe. Will buy another one as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee...color me red","review":"Terrific little coffee maker. Very fast ...coffee tastes good ...looks great in my kitchen.

I would probably not buy it agin because of the time issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like","review":"I've had two Mr. Coffee 4 cup brewers, and while they were okay. So far, I like this machine much better. It brews the coffee quickier. The only thing do not like is the location of the on/off switch. It is in an inconvenient location, as well as, being spring loaded. I would prefer it to be in the front of the unit. Overall I like it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes coffee, but spills all over creation.","review":"I like that this makes four cups of coffee, and it is REALLY easy to use.

Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"MESSY MESSY MESSY","review":"I cannot believe all the positive reviews this coffeemaker gets. I've had it for 5 months now & I hate it. It was a gift from my mom so I feel obligated to use the blasted thing.It is impossible to pour either into the maker or into my mug without massive spillage. Hate this stupid thing. Cuisart should be ashamed to make such a lousy coffee pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guzzle or else...","review":"I bought a 4 cup coffee maker because I live alone. I appreciate many of the features of this Cuisinart coffee maker, but one of them is ridiculous. The coffee maker is equipped with a auto-shut-off. that's fine...but I can never get to my second cup of coffee because the darn thing has shut itself off and the coffee is cold. I enjoy a slow, relaxed cup of coffee. I think having an auto-shut off is fine but it should be set to give one enough time to have his/her 2 cups of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad choice","review":"This unit lasted a little over a year.

Looks nice, but leaks whenever pours. Doesn't appear defective, but I'll probably throw it away soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but good","review":"I have had the most success with this coffee maker by warming up the stainless carafe prior to starting the brew cycle. The Stainless is so cold, that I believe doing this prior to brewing helps the coffee to stay hot longer.Please note: This morning I tried pouring a cup before it was done brewing and the coffee was very strong, which was fine. However the rest of the carafe was dreadfully weak. You will want to wait until it's done brewing. (I suspect this would be the case with any 4-cup drip system)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed","review":"The only redeeming feature of this Cuisinart 4-cup coffee maker is the sleek black and silver design. After that, it rapidly goes downhill. It is frustratingly difficult to pour water from the carafe into the chamber unless it's done extremely slow and with accurate positioning. Even then, water still tends to dribble out and create a mess. The lid, itself, is VERY poorly designed with it's molded, round \\"grip\\" to supposedly remove the lid from the carafe. The only way I can remove it is to insert a sharp pointed object into one of the front pouring holes and pry it off! I've also occasionally had a problem with the water not filtering down through the grounds, creating a coffee ground lake in the upper chamber and a mess below. I think the designer should go back to the drawing-board for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"under performer","review":"The stainless steel carafe is all but completely useless. Must pour over the sink because you're likely to spill more that pour. And there's no apparent advantage to the stainless, so you're probably better off with a glass carafe which will come cleaner with a simple rinse. Needless to say, i'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart DCC-450BK Coffee undrinkable due to bad odor","review":"Despite multiple cleanings and running about 20 pots of water through the coffee maker, I've been unable to get rid of the strong 'plastic-like' odor that permeates the coffee.

I'm working with Cuisinart now to get a replacement. Not sure how that will work out, so I can't comment on their response. This appears to be a fairly widespread issue with this carafe.3) Electrical chord should be longer.4) Small but stupid design error. The on/off button is hard to push so you have to hold the coffee maker still in order to push it.5) There are far too many better designed coffee makers in this price range to chose this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dribbles","review":"I like the size but it usually dribbles onto the counter when I pour coffee.

Staying true to the film though, the music mostly stays away from country and tries for a more 50's doo-wop feeling. Their harmonies work just as good in this style as country and it's good to hear them trying new things.If you enjoyed the film (and who didn't) then you're sure to be won over by this CD. Kids and adults alike will enjoy the catchy tunes and clever lyrics (\\"I love to take you dancing and sweep you off your tentacles\\") which are included in the booklet so you can learn them and sing along.

An analysis of each potential problem area is presented along with suggestions for solutions. The book takes into consideration the typical reactions of husbands and wives when their marriage is threatened. Having read many books on marital discord, infidelity, separation and divorce, this book was one which presented practical, realistic goals for the tedious process of reconciliation. The book addressed situations in which reconciliation is not the best course to take, but left that lengthy discussion to other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"I should have read the description more carefully.

Nope. His insights are dry and old and no different than what drives any body to do anything. We all seek happiness because we are unhappy and there is always an underlying stress or anxiety about this. So why do some people collect? Or eat too much, or ski, or sky dive, or on an on and on. EVERYONE does SOMETHING to seek because they feel insecure and not sustained in the Universe. So collecting is not in the least unique.

Thomas talbott lays out the arguments in a fair and balanced manner, but clearly demonstrates that the Bible, pure logic and common sense all conspire to suggest that all sinners (eventually) will be reconciled to God and enjoy eternity with Him. My path began in Roman Catholicism, moved through a period of sinful \\"what the heck?\\", landed in a true Faith in the salvation of Jesus ... but with one problem remaining. Universal reconcilliation (and I hate titles or labels) has closed that last \\"hole\\" in my belief system, such as it is.

There are four discs, the first disc is 198 minutes long and has seven episodes, the second disc is 176 minutes and has five episodes, disc three is 198 minutes and has six episodes, and disc four has bonus features.

I highly recommend this book to every pregnant woman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell it, girlfriend!","review":"Despite the title, Joanne Kimes' book is not negative, nor does it \\"dis\\" the precious gift of childbearing. Instead, it provides comfort and a few good laughs for the woman struggling through her pregnancy.When I found this book, I was about eleven weeks pregnant with my first baby and had more than had it with the all-day sickness, burping, fatigue, etc. I'd never complained so much in my life, nor felt so miserable for such an extended period of time. On top of that, I felt guilty for not being more grateful for the beautiful gift God had given my husband and me, guilty for not having a better attitude.Reading Ms. Kimes' personal testimony and practical tips made me realize that I was not alone in my suffering, and that it wouldn't last forever. If your pregnancy is not measuring up to the blissful time you've been led to believe it must be, and you need some solace and cheering up, I believe reading this book will help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated Information","review":"When I first read this book, I laughed at the first two pages. Then I just ended up feeling sorry for the author's daughter--who will one day read this and learn just how much her mother hated being pregnant with her. Then I was just shocked at how outdated it was. She has such a bitter attitude towards pregnancy, it makes you wonder why she didn't just adopt instead.On top of that, her information is outdated and one-sided. Aside from interviewing doctors, it seems like she didn't put much research or thought into her pregnancy. Never do we get the entire picture of all our choices when it comes to medical care, labor, and labor pain management. Foods that are healthy (ex- pasteurized soft cheeses) are completely banned in this book.Parts of pregnancy suck, but it doesn't have to suck that bad. In fact, many of the \\"unavoidable torture\\" the author talks about can totally be worked around while keeping mom and baby healthy (and in some cases, safer) than what she suggests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Normal pregnancy? Then spend your money on other books","review":"I purchased this book based on the witty title and other reviews. I have been disappointed with the content, but that's probably because I have experienced an uneventful pregnancy. I found that I could not relate to the seemingly unending trials the author endured throughout her pregnancy. I do give the author credit for her funny moments and frank manner in her story telling. They gave me a chuckle every now and then. Overall, I found that the What to Expect series and The Modern Girl's Guide to Motherhood were much more informative and helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks as much as pregnancy...","review":"Though the concept of sharing real life problems experienced during pregnancy is a great one, the author is extremely biased toward hospital birth managed by OBs.At one point, the author actually defends episiotomies... she seems to blindly accept every procedure her physician pushes upon her, and she looks at him as being responcible for the outcome of her birth. It was both infuriating and saddening.If you are looking for a book to make you laugh a little, this is cute. If you are looking for a book that might actually aid or assist you in making informed choices concerning your pregnancy or birth, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This BOOK Sucks....","review":"I thought this book would be amusing and at least somewhat informative. It is neither. The author just thinks she has a sense of humor. Not really a helpful and informative tidbit of info in the entire book. What a waste of reading time.

If you always wake up in a good mood and think being pregnant is the best thing that has ever happened to you... DONT BUY IT. This book is not for the cheerleader type who is always smiling. I LOVE THIS BOOK. It is a realistic look at pregnancy without the \\"being pregnant is a wonderful gift\\" outlook. I love my child. I am glad to have my child and having a child is a gift. What you have to go through to get the child is not always all roses. This book addresses that with an unyielding sense of humor and makes you realize that you might not be the only one who appreciates the gift (or light) at the end of the miserable experience tunnel but not necessarily the experience itself. I think this book really helped me deal with issues I was having with a rough pregnancy and made me feel better about everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and FUN","review":"Such a cute book, with LOTS of information. Joanne become your best pregnancy friend, you confide in her in you time of need and look forward to her witty comments about you ailments, worries, or husband!!

It is definately worth the $13 I paid for it...Thanks for writing this, Joanne!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious - a must read for all pregnant gals!","review":"I loved this book! It was funny, blunt, and to the point! I had no questions about what was going to be happening to my pregnant self after reading this book because everything was covered - and it was everything that no one wants to discuss or talk about. I didn't realize so many odd things could happen while being pregnant, and thankfully for this book I was up to speed as to what could happen. I've passed it on to my pregnant friends and will continue to do so because she speaks the truth - and in a fun, engaging read too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Political hit for the most part","review":"This is a good CD for the most part. Randy Edelman did an effective job of driving the pulse of the movie with this music. Tracks: 1, 7, & 9 are my favorites. Although track 6 is nice also as it adds a very majestic classical touch to the collection and track 7 adds a very melodic caribbean feeling that's nice and soothing. Track 16 also does an excellent job of summarizing and accentuating the concept of the entire CD. I highly recommend this CD to those that enjoyed the movie. I give it 4 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Chinese-made Piece of Junk.","review":"While the notes are accurate during the time this concertina works, this concertina has buttons that stick, and notes that stay open even when the button isn't pressed.If you're thinking of taking it apart to try and repair it, good luck. The screws pictured above don't turn very easily. Obviously they weren't meant for taking back out. If you get them out, though, you then have to deal with the fact that the place to access the buttons is -GLUED SHUT-. So good luck getting in there.Also, I had to make a new hole in the hand straps to get it tight enough, but that may just be because I have scrawny hands.If you're looking for a cheap and affordable one to try to learn on, I'd pass on this one, even though it is a 30-button.

Very useful for any woman, regardless of social or economic status; whether in corporate, retail, construction or in high school. This book is cleverly compiled by viewpoints of 25 different professional women each covering a chapter, (which I found made for a more interesting read). The topics range from etiquette, to assertiveness skills, managing finances, marketing yourself (by dressing professionally etc.,)When you read this book, it will not only give you the tools to BECOMING a professional, but if you already are a professional, you may find that the tools will serve as useful reminders for us to ACT more professionally. Unfortunately, during the hustle and bustle of surviving as women in a competitive environment, we forget to act professionally. For example, we often confuse being assertive with being aggressive.

Actually you don't even need the timer feature because of the speed it brewed. Unfortunately, aside from that, the coffee maker itself has been a disappointment. First of all, after a month it stopped working...so we sent it back and received a replacement. The top on both models warped and has never closed correctly. When pouring, you need to remove the lid (not a flip top) otherwise you end up pouring half a cup on the counter. Now after about another year, the pump has stopped !!! Do yourself a favor, go buy a cheap Mr. Coffee or Black and Decker. They all make coffee just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dunno about you, but my coffeemaker is great!","review":"Unlike some of the reviews below, my Melitta hasn't burned out or anything of the sort. It just makes great hot coffee faster than any maker I've ever had.Also, unlike someone's review below, the version I have turns off automatically after 2 hours.Some high points:- carafe doesn't spill when you pour (try doing this with a Krups or a Braun. Spills everywhere!)- brewing time: seems twice as fast as any other maker and still with great taste- coffee taste and temperature: very good taste and HOT. Maybe my other makers weren't so good or getting old, but this maker makes hotter coffe than any other I've tried.Low points:- I wish I got the white version. I think the buttons would be easier to read- water spout: hard to get the water from a Brita pitcher into the spout witout spilling a bitOtherwise, I'd recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I made a good choice!","review":"as an average I brew 3-4 pots of coffee per day. And have worn out a few by now, so I do have a comparison. This coffeemaker looks very good,it's the fastest one I have had and it is easy to clean. The carafe pours without spilling(I have had some that did). One minor detail I miss on this one, is the floating ball in the water indicator,so that one can see the water level at a glance.The plastic material seems to be a better quality ,Previous filterbaskets I 've had usually remained discolored after a few uses, this one looks new after several. uses.

We loved that it was a 12 cup unit, it's control buttons were NOT on the base, but up high on the unit where they couldn't get bumped by dishes, etc. on the counter, and it has a cone filter. HOWEVER, after approx. 6 weeks, my husband came down to find coffee all over the counter, dripping onto the floor, and the overflowing liquid had infiltrated the electronics so the display was in a tailspin; steaming, blackened l.e.d. display, and no working controls. We cleaned it up as best we could, let it dry out for about a week, and it did it again.To our dismay, about two weeks after purchasing the unit, we recommended it to my mother-in-law. She bought the same model (from Target, as ours was) and began to have the same exact problem a month into owning it. Needless to say, we are not recommending it to anyone else, and have replaced our defunct brewer with a model by Kenmore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken, broken, broken...","review":"This will be the third time I've returned this model to get one that works. I bought it several months ago. The first one shorted out and started smoking for no reason at all. The carafe on the second one shattered when I put the lid on, gentle as can be.

This coffeemaker is poorly made, unreliable, and very delicate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the absent-minded","review":"This came as a gift, to replace a 10-year-old Black & Decker, which worked until movers dropped it last week. I am 66 and, what is significant for this review, I have vision no better than is common for that age. I have made only one pot of coffee with the Melitta so far. Coffee was excellent, but (1) the black-on-black identification on the buttons is impossible to read, (2) the clock is not lighted, and (3), unless one uses the delay timer (which, since I am retired, I do not), there is no timed automatic shutoff. The first two attributes are annoyances, but the third is a safety concern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Controls very hard to read","review":"Got this to replace an old Krups that wasn't programmable. Likes: fast brew, coffee very hot (almost too hot!). Dislikes: controls are black-on-black buttons, can't see clock without bending down to view head on, can't program \\"on\\" time to hold after brewing for more than 2 hours. I ended up returning this one and spending a little more to get a Braun KF580."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have been very disappointed with this coffeepot. If you don't have the carafe placed just right, you can end up with a big mess. I have cleaned numerous ones. I now have to stay with the pot when it starts to brew to make sure that the water is trickling out of the filter properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buttons and overheating","review":"I had this machine for about 1 1/2 years. I followed the instructions of cleaning once a month with vinegar. As I was doing this, this past weekend I came back to the display blacked out. I tried to turn off the machine and the buttons weren't working either. I had to unplug the machine to get it to turn off. After a few minutes the display came back on. I set the clock and the timer but could not use the on/off button. I had other machines that lasted years. I will never buy a Melitta coffee pot again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome, then it DIED!","review":"I thought this coffee maker was the answer when I first bought it. I'd researched it well and it made fast, hot, excellent tasting coffee. Then about 6 months later it died! Started holding water in the filter, spilling grinds all over and generally making a huge mess.I went with the Cuisinart coffee maker and what a difference! It's slower, but the construction of the coffee maker far surpasses the plastic of the Melitta and I know it will last longer. My advice, check out Cuisinart before you spend your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken carafe","review":"I owned this coffee maker for about a week. One morning, on the way from the sink to the coffee maker with the carafe FULL of water, the glass carafe completely separated from the metal frame and exploded upon impact with my ceramic tile floor.Water and shattered glass all over everything.Imagine if that pot had been filled with 12 cups of hot coffee....."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Only It Wouldn't Self-Destruct","review":"I love the fact that this machine brews so quickly, and I thought it was the answer to my coffee-fiend prayers, but the first one I bought had to be returned after 2 weeks when smoke began pouring out from under the lid. I thought it had to be a single defective machine, and bought another. This one lasted slightly longer, about 4 months, before it self-destructed. Time to wake up and smell the coffee and get a different brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't last long","review":"My husband and I bought this exact coffeemaker less than 3 months ago and this morning I couldn't wait for a cup of hot coffee and of all mornings the darn thing stopped working. This is not the first coffeemaker of this kind we have bought, we like it so much better that any other ones because the hot plate gets the coffee real hot, but this maker sure doesn't last long!!! Don't you think the maker could make this a little better than having a life spam of 3 months? To bad we haven't found another coffee maker that makes HOT coffee because if we do I'll NEVER buy this one again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This coffee maker works fantastic","review":"I love this coffee maker. The coffee tastes great and is a fast brew. I use it everyday and have not had any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy !!!","review":"While the coffee maker has the feature of automatic brew I originally wanted, I am quite disappointed in the \\"pour while brewing\\" feature, as it drips when carafe is pulled out.Also, I am disappointed in how messy the top cover gets from the brewing process. I guess because the water flows so fast, it splatters the grounds onto the top and they collect there, then when I lift it up, the collected moisture dribbles down into the water canister (where only water should go). This is the worst part of the design. My Braun worked well for 15 years, I was wanting the auto brew feature, now I wished I had kept my cheap Braun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short curcuit and smoke","review":"For two months, we loved this coffee pot thanks to the hot and fast brew. Yesterday, the unit short curcuited when water overflowed into the heating element. Smoke was coming out of the rear of the unit. In a silly attempt to make a second pot of coffee, smoke continued billowing out of the rear of the unit and large sparks flew when I unplugged it from the electrical outlet. We are immensely disappointed as it brewed, for two months,a great cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"great , tasting, fast brew but broke down","review":"The coffee is great, hot and quick in the mornings but the 'on' button broke a few weeks after purchase. The store replaced machine but a year later, the 'on' button is worn out again. I don't think hitting the 'on' button once a day should have worn it out. Shopping for a new brand now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melitta Fast Brew Coffeemaker","review":"I have had my Melitta Fast Brew Coffeemaker for just over a year. While it brews coffee fast, it has some features which definitely need improving. (1) Water indicator hard to read unless in bright light. (2) It's easy to pour water into the coffee grounds while trying to pour it into the reservoir. (3) It seems to brew inconsistently, even though we are very careful about putting the same amount of water and coffee in each time. (4) Our unit just went haywire and has to be replaced. I think it should have a much longer life! (and yes, I cleaned it regularly with white vinegar) We're going to replace it with a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melitta 12 Cup Digital Coffeemaker","review":"My old brand was a Melitta with a wonderful atomic clock which I loved. The coffee maker broke so we bought another Melitta on Amazon with a clock but the only way to see the clock would be with a flashlight and magnifying glass. I was so displeased I put in back in the box and bought another brand. Why would they put a clock in a coffeemaker without a light in it, it is virtually useless. When they had a good thing they change and go to a really bad thing. So I don't think very highly of this new coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work Well","review":"This thing had watery coffee compared to my Mr. Coffee unit. I'm going back to Mr. Coffee.The water fill indicator looks like it is from 20 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this coffeemaker","review":"Purchased this unit after having gone through 4 Black & Decker deluxe machines in 18 months. Like the B&D brand, the Melitta didn't live up to daily use of one pot a day, maybe 2 pots if we had company. WE've had this one 3 months now and it's not good. Did all the same things noted above - if coffee grounds are too fine the basket overflows backing up onto the counter, floor and into machine itself. Very difficult to pour water into on the tiny right hand side opening. Makes a good cup of Joe and extra hot. But it's still not good. The clock timer never worked correctly. Target stores near me don't carry any longer so I can't exchange it w/in 90 days. I purchased a cheapo Toastmaster for $7.88 yesterday instead. I'm through w/expensive machines. B4 the Black&Deckers we had a $200 Krups. It died at the 11 month mark, Krups wouldn't fix it. All these coffee makers are junk made in 3rd world countries. Welcome to \\"low low prices\\" folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TWO-out-of-TWO","review":"My first Melitta Fast Brew didn't last a year, so I sent it back to the manufacturer for a replacement. I used the replacement 3, yes THREE, times before it broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Coffee Maker I've Ever Used","review":"This is by far the worst coffee maker I've ever used, and I've had several. Any time you make more than 6-8 cups, you end up with a big mess to clean up b/c the water dispension doesn't keep up with the coffee in the basket, and often times I end up with grounds in the coffee. (Just today I had to sift out 3 tablespoons of coffee grounds after making 12 cups! Unbelievable.) Do yourself a favor and purchase a different type; this one is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melitta MEFB2B coffeemaker","review":"I researched coffeemakers quite a bit before purchasing this one. It works well, is easy to set up, and I haven't had a bit of trouble with it in the last year. It makes very good coffee, fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 year coffee maker","review":"It worked great for over 3 years. Then noticed a puddle of water and didn't know at first where it was coming from. Later my husband found out it was the coffee maker that was leaking all over our counter. A big puddle! Another down fall is it doesn't shut off once and awhile, we had to unplug it and plug it back in."},{"rating":"2","title":"wake up and smell the coffee","review":"Had this machine for about two years---and never a spill. Coffee does brew fast and tastes terriffic particularly if you like the Melitta brand coffee. Coffee is hot but not as piping hot as I like it, but no drip machine gives you that anyway. For that I recommend the Faberware electric perk. Carafe is a bit flimsy and cracked the first one with very little effort. Had to order a replacement directly from the manufacturer which took a while. All in all a quality product and a steal for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this machine","review":"I have had the Fast Brew for almost 2 years and it is still the best coffee maker I have ever had. The part is that it's FAST as the name implies and the coffee tastes great. I have not used the automatic brewing because of the speed which it brews...I just set it up at night and push start in the morning so I have fresh coffee when I know I am ready for it. I would give it 5 stars except that like all coffee makers I have owned, it has a small pour-in space for water. Also the lid to the pot does not always snap on properly after washing. All of this I can live with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"I purchased one of these a few months ago and it worked well for awhile but then it started to overheat and the bottom of the coffeemaker was partially melted. Potential fire hazard"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY - Here's why...","review":"We really liked this coffee maker - it brewed a mess of coffee fast - was attractive in a retro way - and worked fine. But then the electronics (clock & timer) starting getting weird. In about 6 months, every time you made coffee the display would go blank - and you couldn't even turn the coffee maker off! My uneducated guess is that there's a LOT OF HEAT being generated right around the PCB board (clock / timer) and it fries itself each time you make coffee. There's another review here with the same complaint. ALSO - difficult to fill if you are LEFT HANDED. You can only fill the reservoir from the right - so I had to switch hands to pour in the water with my right hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor craftmanship","review":"I open the box followed the instruction and poof it stop working. This was a gift that I wanted and now I still without. It is truly sad when a product fail the standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morning suprises","review":"12/03Pros of the Melitta Fast Brew Coffeemaker:brews coffee fastthe coffee is tastyCons:The fresh smell of coffee wakes you up each morning. Wanting a cup immediately, I go into the kitchen ane there it is, all over the floor and counter, only two inches in the pot with the grounds floating in it. That is the most frustrating thing that has happened.The reservoir's location and size need improvements. I use a soda bottle to pour water in. If you try using the pot which comes with it to pour water in, a lot of the water will get in the container for the coffee grounds.Today, my heating element stopped working. I think it has to do with these morning surprises.I plan to take it back to Target today. I am hoping I can get something different, but I will probably have to get the same one again. we, will see. Have a happy holiday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"After about 6 weeks it simply stopped brewing coffee. It pretended everything was OK - all the right lights came on etc. but it didn't push the water through the system.I took it back to target, who exchanged it for a new one, which lasted 18 months before developing the same fault.While it was working, it brewed decent coffee (and pretty quickly, too). However, the \\"drip-stop\\" mechanism is a bit dodgy - if the caraffe isn't perfectly in place, it prevents the water coming out into the carafe, and consequently you get it all over your kitchen counter. Due to the proximity of the fill hole and the filter basket, you also get grounds in the tank.I'd suggest looking at other machines - I replaced mine with a Braun Aroma Deluxe (same price); after three months, no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee maker from *ell","review":"I hate this coffee maker...It doesn't have a decent spring to let you grab a cup in mid brew. It's clock doesn't show anymore.The thing is possessed by something that is out to get me in the morning. I have coffee all over my counter and grounds are inside and outside the coffee maker. Do not buy this coffee maker. The fast brew was the only good thing, however the other things wrong with it does not make it a good buy. Going to Target to take it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Coffee Maker EVER","review":"This is the worst coffee maker I have ever had. When it works, it works great, but I have had 2 different machines break on me in the past 10 months. Coffee everywhere if the pot is not placed in exactly the correct spot, hot water tube can't bring water to coffee, heating plate falling down into the machine... everything that can go wrong, has gone wrong with this machine. On top of that, Target will not exchange my maker this time! I have contacted the manufacturer of this machine and am hoping that they will exchange it for another model that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This is the worst coffee pot I've ever owned. It makes a *huge* mess everytime you brew coffee, with grounds getting everywhere. In addition, just 2 months after I bought it, it short-circuited and broke, with smoke billowing out of the unit. I liked the concept and the hot, fast coffee, but I never could get a decent cup of coffee out of this machine. I disliked it so much I'll never buy a Melita product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente Voz, Musica, Letra, Como siempre Gloria","review":"Un disco totalmente en la linea de lo que ella ha hecho desde siempre, un disco con mas de 8 años de espera, el cual recuerda bastante a los 90's, lo cual no quiere decir que es malo, es un excelente disco, las canciones estan muy bien hechas, hace gala de su voz (parece que canta en vivo en algunas notas).Todas las canciones son muy buenas, cada una tiene algo en especial, lo recomiendo ampliamante!"},{"rating":"2","title":"La nueva Gloria","review":"Este Cd me encanto, La Primera vez que lo escucho las canciones que mas me gustaron fueron Como Nace el Universo, La nota roja, y Timbres postales al cielo.

She points out that if you hate all vice, you hate mankind - a vice in itself. One must then, she argues, choose which of the ordinary everyday vices are really the worst. She nominates cruelty as the vice to best avoid, but points out that this is not the same at all as avoiding hipocracy as the worst, and that working hardest at avoiding the sin of pride - which basically is the scorn of God - also will produce different priorities and results."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I was an intel fan.. i had a 3.2 pentium 4 and heard for games that the amd would beat it... so i measured my comp video test and scored a 200 then switched the card out and got a 325... on the test this is a significant difference.. i went from playing doom 3 on mid quality and 800X600 and stayed about 34 FPS except on big scenes i went to about 25 then with the same video card and the processor changed i got 1280 by 1024 and max quality and the avg was still above 34!! i ranged around a 40 on a fight scene and 48 normal"},{"rating":"1","title":"As far as I can tell, these do nothing","review":"After several months, we have caught no roaches and it seems like the ones running around are getting bigger.

After 3+ months some of the victor traps had caught 1 or 2 roaches, but none of the Black Flag ones had. It could have just been bad luck (maybe I just happened to put the Black Flag ones where we didn't have roaches) but I'll follow the evidence and just buy the Victor ones from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better roach traps","review":"Here in Hawaii, we've got these roach traps that look to be imported from Asia. They're fairly ubiquitous, and you don't see brands like this very often. I ordered this on Amazon just to give it a shot, to compare its efficacy in luring roaches to their doom in the glue. It's not very effective.When I placed this into a particular roach laden area, I had about 4 captures over a one week period. The Hoy Hoy (import) trap had at least three times that. While the import trap is more troublesome to assemble, I don't feel that this was a very good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't caught American cockroach but...","review":"I have (at least) several American cockroaches (the giant ones). They come into the kitchen through our garage. Thought I'd lay some of these cheaply priced traps down to catch some of them. Haven't caught any yet and it's been over 2 months (or longer). Not sure they're attracting any of the giant cockroaches; haven't yet tried baiting the traps but may help. However, have caught many little geckos (or lizards?). So if you have a problem with geckos/lizards, here's your solution. I'm giving 2 instead of 3 stars because I'm a little disappointed to not have caught any roaches; but their price-cheapness offsets any real disappointment I may have."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great- traps the roches inside motel; no cleanup problems.","review":"I just checked the inside of the roach motel that I laid out on the floor about 6 weeks ago, (wanting to replace the motel with a new one).

I have seen roaches run in there and run back out, which just shows that the glue they are supposed to get stuck in doesn't work. It doesn't lure them either.

We haven't had a fire, so I can't say how well they work in that scenario, but we had to replace one of them after about a year because it started sounding brief alarms for no reason in the middle of the night. Since all nine are interconnected, they all sounded. It was rather unsettling. The replacement has been fine so far, but a couple of days ago another unit initiated one brief spurious alarm, so now I'm keeping my eye on that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Non-Nuisance Alarm","review":"Bought 3 of these and 3 alarms with carbon-monoxide detection from Kiddie.

My wife and I were expecting our first baby and I decided that that had to stop. I read a lot of reviews and decided to go with these because I wanted quality without spending a fortune.
