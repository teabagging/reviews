Unfortunately, I found the highlights to be less than inspirational and, in one chapter, violating the promise of obedience.Chapter five tells the story of the Crowleys.

This book was a prime example, reading it made my heart weep that anyone could feel so empty or whatever inside that they would abandon reason - that which makes us more than just another animal - and accept any of this. The so-called self-help industry is awash in this feel good nonsense, with the only goal of parting you from your money.

Some concepts within are useful (essential versus social self), but it's application just about ends there. It over-values the emotion of joy while ruling out every other emotion in the spectrum as \\"unhealthy\\", attempts to foster unrealistic expectations in it's readers and strikes me as all but useless to anyone not middle to upper class in social status. At one point, it even recommends I try \\"projecting\\" my thoughts into someone else's mind to boost my intuition.

As it turns out, most of the films in this collection put the blame squarely on the US for inciting the WTC attacks. A few, like the Chilean story, imply that the attack was poetic justice. Some actually seem to trivialize the loss of life on 9/11. Even the US entry, directed by Sean Penn, has an ambiguous ending that could be interpreted as seeing positives in the attack (flowers begin to blossom in the newfound sunlight created by the collapse of the towers).On the plus side, all of the films are technically slick. In particular, I thought the darkly comic Isreali entry was brilliantly staged and photographed.I'm a liberal. I welcome a diversity of views. But I also value honesty.

Every song sounds the same, and is nothing like the songs off his much better albums Heartbreaker, Gold, and Demolition. I really believe Ryan put together this album under pressure by his record company. Ryan Adams never had a style of music that you could lump into a category and play on the radio. In fact, i may have only heard ONE Ryan Adams song on the radio EVER -- Firecracker. His label probably wanted a hit album - something mainstream, something that could get big airplay, which means big tours, which means big album sales, which means big money. Think about it. Listen to his song Rock 'n Roll off the new album: he says it loud and clear that he just doesnt feel cool singing rock and roll. It's the only song that resembles any of his earlier work, and he spells it out -- he just doesnt like this album. I dont think youll like it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"the unfortunate decline continues","review":"Not that I have anything against him. I really like heartbreaker. Fantastic CD. I am happy that he has found commercial success. Unfortunately, that has come at the price of the heart of his music, which i think gives it any staying power or worthiness of more than one listen. It certainly lacks what made Heartbreaker great, and what made the following CD's ok. You might like it, but that means you like crappy music. Oh well, so be it.

Yes, he has clearly proven that many times over... but that doesn't mean this album contains good music.I just don't dig it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This must be a joke","review":"Ryan has written many great songs, from whiskeytown on. One thing that has separated him from that thing that became a bandwagon of Alt/Country-Singer/Songwriters was the many years he has been doing it and doing it well. I always thought of him as one of the better songwriters of the times. His music was engaging and developed thru his records. He has used many styles and been very good at them. What ever style he chose country/ folk/ pop/ rock... he did them well.Rock and Roll on the other hand is the most disappointing thing I've ever heard. The title track sounds like he wrote it in the 3rd grade after listening to KISS play Beth over and over again. I'm glad he made a rocking record. But,I don't think there is any need to cover such cliche topics with generic music and terrible lyrics.LOve is Hell 1&2 are twice as good as this thrown together BLAH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wallflowers meet Nirvana (at their worst)","review":"Does anyone remember Semisonic? Well... they're back. Errr wait no, they're not. It's Ryan Adams latest, and who could have thought of a more inappropriately titled album? I am a huge fan of Adam's Heartbreaker and his Whiskeytown discs, and this is something very different. You may have noticed the title of this review and asked \\"Nirvana?\\" Adam's himself claims that this album has some Nirvana-esque influence. Picture this, Jacob Dylan's voice cracking along side a guitar that has enough feedback to make the White Stripes sound produced. The verses are thin, the choruses lacking. None of the lyrical genius I witnessed in Heartbreaker.P.S.Rock n Roll?Where did that come from, this is just a pop album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor effort","review":"Listening to a record company that tells you not to release something? Sounds very sell-out-ish. And the record really shows it too. Ripped off riffs, lame lyrics. It's a horrible cd all the way around. Too bad because Ryan used to be one of my favorite songwriters. Love Is Hell is better, but only slightly and only because the lyrics are very well-written as compared to the junk on Rock & Roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I found the 'B'","review":"I think I found the 'B' that (B)Ryan Adams has been looking for.This is terrible stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Wasted","review":"After several subjective reviews of this CD I can only conclude that I wasted my money. The recording quality was terrible, very tinny and washed out. I adjusted my EQ over and over but I still failed to produce any bass worth mentioning. To top it off Adams decided to leave off such classics diehard fans such as myself were thirsting for, such as \\"Cuts Like a Knife\\" and \\"Run To You.\\" Do your self a favor and pass on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it. Buy the Love Is Hell duo instead.","review":"As others have said, its not Gold and its not Demolition. And its certainly not \\"good\\" Rock N Roll. You've heard the story, his record label thought \\"Love Is Hell\\" wasn't worth releasing and sent him back to the studio. Apparently this is his joke on them. There are a couple of decent songs here, but for the life of me, I can't figure out the 5 stars heaped on it. Lots of mindless music cranked out here and not much else. Go directly to Love Is Hell 1 & 2 and you'll find yourself enjoying the \\"record\\" that should have earned a 5 star rating. And you'll say, \\"what were those record execs thinking? This is great!\\" This is one of Ryan Adams' great tragedies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"As much as I loved his last album, Gold, and his previous work with Whiskeytown, I'm am severly disappointed by this album. His writing and performance on Rock N Roll is horrendous. It's one of those cds that gets progressively worse the more times you hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best when aged","review":"I got this CD the day it came and was frankly, a little disappointed. I was more of a fan of his mellow \\"ballads\\" from Gold like \\"Goodnight Hollywood Boulevard\\" and this disc is packed with more, well, rock n roll. So I let this CD age sitting in my car and popped in in the CD player about a week and a half later... and now I love it. \\"Wish You Were Here\\" is great and so is \\"Anybody Wanna Take Me Home?\\" I take my initial criticisms of \\"Rock N Roll\\" back, this album kicks ass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ryan Adam's other musical dimension","review":"The bad reviews comes as quite a suprise coming from Ryan Adams fans who seem oddly suprised that his sound has changed. If the pieces haven't fallen together yet, Ryan gave clear signs of his fascination with the Smiths/Morrissey in the opening track of Heartbreaker when he argues with a friend about which album a \\"Everyday is like Sunday\\" is on. The new release \\"So Alive\\" finds Adam's vocals sounding a lot like Morrissey which should be the next big hint.Ryan is attempting nothing new as a lot of people assumes he has, his other influences have just surfaced in this album, the ghosts of Madchester are alive and well in Adam's songs. The people that seem suprised just haven't been paying attention.The new album is reminscent of the luminous sound of James, the Sundays, and the Smiths. The songs are a refreshing oasis from the tired nu-metal fad that unfortunately dominates much of radio today."},{"rating":"1","title":"very lame","review":"This album is such a complete disaster that it makes you wonder if the formerly talented Mr. Adams has indeed lost his mind. Sure this 'rocks', which basically means there's some heavy electric guitar scattered across the album. But this new found heaviness results in an album that favours sound over songwriting. These songs are horribly trad-rock, generic and mediocre, more Stereophonics than Stones if you know what I mean. To be honest, when I heard that Ryan was making a rock album, I was thrilled and envisioned a bunch of rootsy, blues flavoured Stones-like rockers. Instead we get this mess, apparently delivered with a straight face. The Love Is Hell EP's aren't great either but they're better (and cheaper) than this pile of garbage. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"I love Ryan Adams. I have all of his music. I just got this to basically complete my collection, but this SUCKS.

There is no Ryan Adams on this record, only Bryan Adams trying to imitate the Smiths. At lease have Johnny Marr writing the music and playing guitar if foolish enough to do such a thing. But OK - after a few listens we upgrade it to 3 stars for he was really having a go at his record company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your nickel...","review":"I've got a couple Ryan Adams cd's, including Demolition and Gold. These are solid albums but unfortunately Rock n Roll is not. Too many beers...or something...the songs are a big let down. Let's hope the next one has a bit more heart and soul behind it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ryan shows his roots","review":"Do all of you think Ryan Adams is just an alt/country/indie musician like on the Whiskeytown stuff and his first two albums. Well, he isn't. Look at his background. He grew up in rock n' roll and punk. This album is amazing. I love the straight-up rock n roll. It's about time somebody played rock n' roll again. This album in my opinion is his best, because i knew he had this in him. I like the other albums also, but I was hoping he would do an album that showed his roots. This album does show his rock n roll roots, and his album with Jesse Malin under the name of The Finger \\"We Are F*** You\\" shows his hardcore punk roots. If you say you are a Ryan Adams fan and you don't like, you aren't a real fan, because it means you know nothing about his background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant","review":"This is not enjoyable at all. I love Ryan Adams' other music and I love Rock and Roll, but I can hardly even listen to most of this CD. For something really good, check out the Ryan Adams Live In Jamaica DVD. That's good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"i'm a huge ryan adams fan, ... but the poor content of this cd is so disappointing. the incredibly beautiful lyrics and passion that is in ever other cd is just not there, .. seems fake..plastic.., please, save your money, pick up heartbreaker instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Ryan Adams is the best songwriter working today. If you need proof, just listen to \\"In My Time of Need.\\" He channels desperation, and alcohol-fueled hope better than anyone. His previous 2 albums, B-Side collection, and catalogue with Whiskeytown all attest to his talent. \\"Rock N Roll\\" continues on this path...but just barely. Some of the tracks are excellent, notably \\"So Alive\\" and \\"Rock and Roll.\\" However, much of the rest of the CD falls into disposability. All in all, its a must have - simply because its Ryan Adams. Still, if you need to choose, pick up \\"Heartbreaker\\" or \\"Love is Hell.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasant surprise","review":"I didn't know anything about Ryan Adams (except for \\"so alive\\") but my girlfriend picked up the CD for me. I expected the worst and was pleasantly suprised. This is actually a very solid CD that I would liken to some of Pete Yorn's efforts. It's simple, it moves along at a good pace, and it's catchy as hell. If you're hitting the road, take this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spliffs and riffs....may not always mix","review":"Let me preface by stating that I am of the opinion that \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Gold\\" are two of the best rock n' roll statements yet issued this century. This album, however, feels rushed and oddly disconnected, relying too much on Strokes-style repetitive riffs...I believe I read somewhere that this album was recorded as a quick substitute for \\"Love is Hell\\", and it feels like it. There are a lot of big choruses here, perhaps in homage to the alternative 80's, but still the proceedings never really transcend into greatness. There are some tracks that almost make it, like the \\"Boy\\"-era U2 stomp of 'So Alive', the Smiths melancholy of 'Anybody Wanna Take Me Home' and a bit of that haunting quality that spiked \\"Heartbreaker\\" can be heard in 'Luminol' and 'Burning Photographs', but thats about it. That leaves 10 more largely forgettable tracks. Take heed, you're not getting anything approaching vintage Ryan on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best - For a good reason","review":"Most of the folks who are fan's of RA will agree that this isn't the best album. There's a good reason for this. Ryan wanted to release a much more sombre album. The record execs said it was too \\"down\\" and told him they wanted something a little more \\"Rock and Roll.\\" Adams provided these recording and (probably out of spite) released it under the title \\"Rock and Roll\\". I think this was a big FYOU to the label and his heart probably wasn't in it, for the most part. He went on shortly thereafter to release the record he wanted to on his own in the form of two EPs \\"Love is Hell\\" Parts 1 and 2. Love is Hell is the real Ryan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've tried to get into it...","review":"I listened to this album first in a music store and decided against it. A friend of mine told me that she really liked it so, a few months later, I went to another music store and listened to it again and thought, \\"What the hell...\\" I have tried on several occasions to listen to it, and I can't get through more than a few songs (frankly, I can't even remember which ones I can tolerate). While I'm disappointed, I'd rather spend my money on a crappy Ryan Adams CD than on some of the other stuff that's out there. Perhaps my disappointment stems from the fact that he is capable of so much more (or at least of making music that is more compatible with my tastes).I saw Ryan and the Cardinals last fall and, to my great joy, they played songs from every album EXCEPT this one. If that's not an indication of the artist's own feelings about the music, then I don't know what is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drugs, sex and ...","review":"Rock N RollLike Neil Young, Ryan Adams has a rock'n roll heart. Sure, he sings country, but not all the time. He does like to turn up the amp, pull out the Fender, and rock--which exactly is what he does here. Almost all of the songs on this CD are rockers, with a solid beat, good lead guitar, and great lyrics.Some of the subjects of the songs: Luminol (the stuff used to detect blood on CSI), a teenager no longer taking her prescription meds (Do Miss America), 1974 (the year of Adam's birth), burning photographs of an ex-lover, and shooting up cocaine in the back of a car.Although not your usual work-a-day subject matters, the stories are told with good poetry and accented with music that fits the story.Well worth the listen--not because its by Ryan Adams, but because it is great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat catchy and fun, but distinctly mediocre","review":"I have to admit, I like this album a fair deal. The songs are catchy, but they're very very simple, and they fall apart on multiple listens. The lyrics are boring, the riffs are boring, and the whole thing feels really, really phony, and it feels like all Adams is doing is making up something about himself to make a few bucks, and it's shameful in the end. I have nothing against an artist like Adams changing genres...I'm not so attached to Whiskeytown that I can't let it go...but his rock efforts are really quite weak. Give us a break, Adams, and put some effort into what you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"something a little different","review":"Okay, Ryan Adams has a bit of a consistency issue. That maybe true, but I LOVE this album. Unapologetic, cranking up the amps, loaded with attitude, big riffs and heart. This is the perfect album for blasting in the car, with the top down on a hot summer day. Highly recommended!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frisbee Anyone???","review":"Too bad you can't give negative numbers because this cd certainly derserves one. After wasting my lunch hour to obtain this piece of garbage, I wanted to throw it out into coming traffic after the fourth song. I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of this artist but have heard good things and read some reviews for this cd and others by him. Though I realize through the years.....reviews by fellow music lovers most of time are just a waste of print, this time I took their advice.....much to my dismay again. The lyrics may be worthy but the recording and the music in general deserve any title but that of rock and roll. I finally gave the cd to my wife to give away at her work, and much to my surprise........someone bit, poor sap. While the jackass who confused this artist with Bryan Adams is quite amusing, his point is well taken. Skip the cd and buy a twelve pack, you won't regret that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure how to rate it yet, but...","review":"I think its interesting that people deride this CD for sounding so bland and mid-tempo... if you listen to the songs you realize that most of them are in the style of other bands... listen to This is it, it sounds soo much like The Strokes, Luminol with Foo Fighters, 1974 with Smashing Pumpkins, etc...just my two cents"},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative Crap","review":"I don't understand how so many people think this album is genius. It's just a watered down version of Paul Westerberg's worst material (post replacements rock tunes - westerberg's worst stuff). I understand that Ryan is 'eclectic' and 'prolific', but this stuff should never have seen the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Ryan Adams please stand up?","review":"Lyrically, this is the same Ryan Adams that fans have come to appreciate on Gold, Demolition, and the sequential Love Is Hell EP's. But someone stole his voice! It's as if these songs were laid down while Ryan was in a drunken stake and his p.r. people dragged him into the studio with promises of \\"yea, yea, we'll lay down your tracks later\\". Fundamentally, he remains true to himself- raspy, love-lorn, and brilliant, but if his other Love is Hell EP's can stand to prove anything, it's that musically he was duped into this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Congole Musiki","review":"A great analysis of Congolese/Zairean Music.

The historical incident, obscure to most of us, is well known to Texans, the retaliation for the Battle of San Jacinto. We come to know what drives some of them and the regrets of others. Mostly, we marvel at their capacity for survival. When everything is taken away from them; when they live day after day in toil and torture, infested with an army of lice and tested by disease after disease, they still have the ability to experience the small joy that comes with the minutest reprieve.There is little joy in reading the book, though the author presents the story as well we could expect.

Later I looked at the bottom of the griddle and saw that the heating element makes one loop around the bottom surface, which explains the uneven heating.I've never had an electric griddle before, so I don't know if this is normal.

In addition, the headset plays a long tone (3-5 seconds) when you get a voicemail. Quite annoying - you have to ask the person to repeat what they said every time it happens.

If you're relying on only 1 or 2 books to cover everything, you're already in trouble as disasters never follow a set script.The Author of this particular book lived through the London Blitz and learned a few things that many authors of other known survival books can only imagine as possibilities. Don't get me wrong, I've gotten lots of good information from other books on the same subject, but this one led me to think of lots of things that the others did not.A wide variety of books on the subject is the best approach.

But including this info wouldn't sell books, would it? She offers 100 pages with some rather absurd theories, e.g., electric blankets are bad for you, then launches into recipes only!

I researched many of these kinds of books and this is the best one. Amazon gave the best price compared to other stores, including online ones. The reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because in our school system, we have Nursery & Kindergarten and we also have pre-school before Nursery (although pre-school and Nursery are technically optional).

You just simply add water in the pan & put the buffet on top. This is a very inexpensive option for a buffet server...outstanding for the occational catorer too.I also like the 20 qt capacity for very large amounts of chili or stew...wonderful for a huge croud! You can easily add 4 corned beefs and 3 heads of cabbage for St. Patty's Day. This is amazing for entertaining on a budget & it cooks the food perfectly.

After listening to it more and more, I was hooked. I keep finding, even now, songs on the compilation that I didn't know I liked and that I want to listen to more. Although I wish there was more of a n international representation, this album is full of simply great pop songs dating from the late 70s to the 2000s.

Secondly, Un reve may be the first true marriage between the clinical precision of electronic music and the fiery power of rock. Pinhas' guitar almost literally sounds like a mastadon in heat as it charges its way through a jungle of massive, mechanized percussion (Francois Auger) and violent synthesizers. Un reve is really the first in a long wave of albums that would come later that can be truly classified as \\"Cold Wave,\\" a legitimate precursor to such industrial bands as Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire and Fad Gadget.

I liked the look and I liked the features of this model. For months I was very pleased with these fans. Then after six months of faultless operation they both died within two weeks of each other. It was like they had a \\"death chip\\" in their controller or something.

Somewhere inside, the blades were contacting another piece of plastic.

The other 2 simply died; one met its end rather suddenly and the other endured slow, ever-more creaking demise.

Live and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HOT MESS!!!!!","review":"I had purchased two of these fans, and dealt with the same drama as other customers. I bought them primarily because of their appearance, and the remote control features. After a month, both of them made a very annoying screeching noise that was the worse. One of the units had motor oil leaking out of the bottom of it. I was very disappoined because both of these fans cost way too much money for me to have to deal with such trouble. I just broke down and purchsed another fan that was cheaper, blew more air, and was just as quiet. Do not waste your money on this product. The only thing it is good for is looking pretty. Other than that, it is the horrible!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept,but poor quality","review":"I purchased this fan about a year ago for my kitchen.The air circulation was very good,but the fan wobbled and had an annoying noise.The sound would get so bad,that I would just turn it off.Now it has totally stopped working!I liked the idea of the style,because it fit well in small places and also set up higher,so you could feel the breeze better then regular fans.You would think that the company would have more pride in their products,to improve on a good idea and not be happy with the poor quality.What makes for happy customers and increasing sales is a good product and fair dealings from the company.I will purchase a new fan,but will return to a more reliable company.I don't expect the Bionaire Company will be in the fan business much longer,unless improvements in product and service are made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for air circulation but weary about power.","review":"This fan looks great, works well, and is very quiet. The breeze feature auctually simulates a outdoor breeze and it save space. Since I have only used it in the fall weather, I don't know how powefull it will be in the dead of summer when the weather is extremely hot. In addition, since you can't adjust the height, you have to be within the height vacinity in order to fully appreciate the air flow. This is not a problem for me because I use it my living and I am usually sitting down which puts me within the height vacinity of the fan. Despite these drawbacks, I do like the way the fan works and I am satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inferior product","review":"I bought one of these in April, and put it into service in May. After less than 2 weeks use, it simply died. The remote worked, the little LED lights lit, but the fan didn't blow air. I returned it to the manufacturer (at my expense PLUS $10), and received a replacement about 3 weeks later. After just over 2 weeks use, the replacement died. I e-mailed the manufacturer, but received no response. Since I already have $70+ invested in the original fan plus shipping the first one plus $10, I'm thinking I may just chalk it up as a bad experience and cross Bionaire off my list of brands I would buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fan, cheap base","review":"Our first fan arrived broken.

In both cases the cool quite breeze is very refreshing. There are a few other settings but I only seem to need the oscillate option.In short this is a good fan that surely wont disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sterling doing his Tom Clancy bit","review":"While not mindblowing like some of Sterling's other books, this was defenatly a good read. I think that if you like Bruce Sterling's work, especially his last several novels, than you will certainly enjoy Zenith Angle."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Short: Awful","review":"This is an awful book.Was there a ghost writer involved? Did Sterling turn his name into a brand, much like Tom Clancy? I really hope so. This is a worse read, than even the dreary NetForce books from brand Clancy. (And that is saying something).Awful storyline, awful characters, awful grasp of technology, awful love affair.Bruce what happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak..A short story writ too long","review":"Overall, this was a disappointment. Either you like Sterling's prose or you don't. I happen to like it but this book is less than a novel that what seems like a long treatment for a novel. Plot points come and turn on a dime with little involvement of characters or even explaination. Bits and pieces sparkle with Sterling's take on things but these flashes are far and few in between. You really don't care that much about any of the characters and when the main protagonist goes through huge, mostly unexplained behavior shifts, you really don't care. I only kept reading it to the end just to see if Sterling would put him and the reader out of their misery. I think I'm going to have to re-read \\"islands in the net\\" to wash the bad taste of this one out of my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"A peculiar book. Sterling's descriptions of technological gadgets and governmental processes are convincing, but Zenith Angle seems to be missing some things. An obvious or compelling plot, for one - you can read 3/4 of the way through the book without figuring out what exactly is the point of the book. The characterizations are weird - a mixture of colorful, dull, and just plain odd. For a hundred or so pages it seems like it might be a good read, and then after a couple hundred pages more you realize you have just about run out of pages, and it hasn't become a good read yet.Each page is well written, but taken as a whole, the book's pages add up to surprisingly little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way below his usual form. Buy something else","review":"This was a real disappointment. I finished it just to see if anything decent would happen. It didn't.It's a poorly-constructed ramble of a dot-commer who moves into Federal government and foils a \\"dastardly\\" plot in the post 9/11 era - all rubbish. The plot moves in fits and starts. The main character is unbelievable. The bit about using spam as an energy source is utterly pathetic (I don't think that would count as a spoiler).To summarise, if you want a good read, check out Richard Morgan's \\"Altered Carbon\\" or \\"Fallen Angels\\", or Stephenson's Baroque Cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"Bruce, man, I have to say this is your *worst* work ever. Someone wrote in another review that readers who have a background in the sciences or information technology will appreciate this book. If only that were true. Anyone who has a vague understanding of any technology will immediately be hit with the realization that just about nothing in this book has any grounding in reality.See, when you're writing typical science fiction, you can get away with some vague handwaving about certain techno-things accompanied by random jargon. But when you're talking about stuff that actually could exist - it falls very flat. Very. I mean, spam powered laser weapons?And the unbelievable characters - this guy who spends millions, perhaps billions, on a scientific facility to create a fixed in place weapon that he wants to sell for $750 million? Why not skim a little off the construction budget there, guy?Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing","review":"He writes like he's trying to write paragraphs for an ADHD 12-year old.

I wish I hadn't bothered to finish it. Had it been written by anyone else, I would have put it down within 50 pages. Being Sterling, I figured it would get better, but it didn't. I would recommend almost any of his other books highly, but don't get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A short book that took forever","review":"I wook in the technical industry and watch a lot of Alias. When I heard that this book was about spies and IT, I went out and bought it. It is somewhat technical and he does become a \\"spy\\". But, I just kept waiting for it to get real interesting. It is the type of book you can get from the public library later on in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I've come to expect a lot more from Bruce Sterling, starting with amazing shaper / mechanist universe, aka Schismatrix Plus. All his other works are very good, though none invoked in me the same sense of wonder. Reading \\"Zenith Angle\\" was shocking, knowing Bruce Sterling cannot be this awful! Mind you, this book ranks fine with most other populist crap printed today, but for Sterling to have his name associated with this book should be devastating! I am truly sorry that some of Sterling's peers, such as Gibson, Rucker and even Varley exhibit similar letdowns in their latest books. Perhaps they should consider being less of visionaries and more of simply good authors / writers. 3rd grade language, terrible charachterization, jerky story line and no excitement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing product","review":"We've tried numerous times to cook recipes in this crock. We use a Rival cook-book especially for their products. None have ever come out right. It does not get hot enough, and the lid leaks moisture out. Even on the 4-hour (high) setting it still takes almost 8 hours to cook a big roast. We have an older Rival crockpot that works perfectly, and my mother uses a 3-year old crock that works perfectly too. But no such luck with this one! And Rival's warranty is worthless. It would cost us as much to ship the crockpot back for replacement as it would to just buy a new one. And we WON'T buy another Rival this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really programmable","review":"I have been disap[pointed with this one--the buttons only allow you to choose high or low, and the times are already preprogrammed and cannot be altered.

I love it! I have had it for about 6 years. It cooks great. The only negative is that the exterior gets pretty hot. However, the instruction booklet states that it will and that it is ok. I just make sure that nothing is touching it that could possibly melt like plastic bags, etc. I put it on my laminate counter top and it has never been a problem. The glass lid does fit slightly loose, but it is supposed to.I cook most of my dishes on the high setting for either 4 or 6 hours then it rolls over to the warm setting until we are ready to eat. It has always been perfect. I love the large oval shape. I can cook large roasts with potatoes and other vegetables without crowding.I bought mine at Sam's and it came with 2 crocks...a single one and a divided one. I am sorry to hear of other's problems.

The cover showed \\"1981\\" as the date, and the code S 1558A also appeared.Like other reviewers, I thought there were too few songs included.The quality was poor with plenty of distortions and volume dips, something I've seen in several old cassettes, probably the result of degradation with age. I generally avoid used cassettes now, but sometimes you can't get what you want on CD.One of the songs listed on the cover was not on the cassette. \\"I Believe\\" was missing, and in its place was a second track of \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\".I'm hoping to get the \\"complete hits\\" CD (28 tracks) for Xmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"The folks that were responsible to ship this did a great job.

Thanks for the memories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Not So Historical Novel","review":"Actually the tie-in to actual history is quite good, this period is something of a passion of mine and I haven't caught the author in a historical mistake yet. I particularly enjoy her characterization of Elizabeth I.On the other hand however her period detail is simply awful. The Duke of Norfolk's household is Victorian rather than Elizabethan. A nobleman would not have a housekeeper but a Steward for example and the servants would not eat in the kitchen but in hall. The use of first names by all and sundry is irritating, in those days a lady would call even her husband 'Master Stannard', and a man-servant would not be called 'Master Brockley'.Ursula herself is far too Nineties in her sensibility, especially in her attitude towards religion. Interesting as the mysteries are I simply cannot cope with the anachronisms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows promise","review":"The best part of the book is not what it is, but what it could be. It is a beautifully written novel that never quite lives up to what the reader might expect. However, it does show Domingue's talent and, given that this is her first novel, promise.The characters were interesting, but usually one-dimensional. I had a bit of trouble being interested in anyone besides Amy or Razi--although I can't say that there were any characters that bored me or disgusted me. It was an interesting, but not overly intricate, story that seemed to be stuck in the very familiar territory of ghost romances.However, reading it was not a waste of time and, while it did fall short in some areas, I still look forward to Domingue's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Lovely Bones' meets 'Ghost'","review":"So many comparisons to 'The Lovely Bones', but to me it echoed the movie 'Ghost' in it's themes of great loves that are tragically lost,and how one moves through that pain. (okay, if 'Ghost' was made up of highly intelligent and culturally progressive men and women.)Still, at it's core, this is one big fat romantic story covering nearly a century in the life and afterlife of Razi Nolan, a young woman on the early cusp of the woman's movement whose life is tragically cut short. She chooses to live in the world between life and death in order to discover what became of her one great love Andrew. Their story is interspersed with a young married couple going through their own issues invloving loss, who she chooses to 'haunt'.Beautifully written, it's a book I found myself devouring in large quantities like a favorite ice cream. While for me it missed on some of the emotional wallop I think was intended, it still was a promising debut from a writer to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love throughout the Ages","review":"Everything about this book was brilliant. I never saw the ending coming, I was always completely engaged, and I just couldn't read fast enough. I fell in love with Razi's spunky nature and boldness. Razi was decently before her time, with her secret meeting with women handing out contraceptives during the 20s. This story touched my heart like no other book I have ever read. Seeing the love between Razi and her boyfriend and the family Razi haunts in the present we see how times have changed and how they have stayed the same throughout the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The AIR is not so thin!","review":"This novel is a wonderful foray into the space that we wonder about between life and death. A woman's life is over, but her existence in the \\"thin air\\" continues as she watches what might have been and what really is, now that she is gone.There is a touch of mystery, voyeurism, intrigue, regret and finally acceptance and resolution.Beautifully written and wholly believable because of the writer's ability to transport you into the \\"thin air\\" along with her main character. If you liked the Lovely Bones or the Time Traveler's Wife, you will find this similar, yet completely different, and just as enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"no regrets","review":"I was reluctant to read this book because of the many comparisons to \\"The Lovely Bones\\". I adored that book and the last thing I wanted was a regurgitation of it. After reading, I understood the comparisons because both books are so beautiful and deal with roughly the same topic. Miss Domingue's command of the English language, when translating emotions, is so powerful that I am certain she will not only be a great author, but has been a great poet. I aspire to be half as wonderful. The only problem with the book was the skewering of time periods but this didn't happen often. I can't fault the author - I believe I became lost in thought and memories. I await her next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"This was a wonderful story from the perspective of a ghost. It really drew me in... the only thing I was slightly annoyed with was the way it kept jumping between times but... I got used to it pretty quick and was entralled with the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"It isn't \\"Lovely\\" by any means","review":"Just because the main character is dead doesn't make it comparable to Alice Sebold's book. I wanted to love this book, the 1920s New Orleans setting really appealed to me. The plotting was contrived, particularly the idea that a ghost would write letters to track someone down. The denouement was laughable. Frankly, a real let down and a waste of an afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethereal beauty written in words","review":"I just finished this book and I was almost wholly taken with its ethereal beauty. Our heroine, Razi Nolan, is a charming, \\"venturesome\\" girl who dies and is then left in \\"the between\\", neither alive nor truly gone. She exists in the present, but her yearning for past things are often brought to the forefront. She gets what she once wished for -immortality- (\\"One lifetime isn't enough to make all the trouble of which I'm capable\\") and it's not quite what she had expected. The author writes of love and loss as one who has deeply experienced both of these things. This novel is especially heartbreaking and poignant with New Orleans as its locale. It's what Alice Hoffman would have written at the height of her talent if she were Southern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Enjoyable!","review":"I had put this book on my Christmas wish list, and am so glad I did! It has become one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. Not only do the characters and their lives draw you in and hold on to you, but the thought provoking ideas of what \\"life after death\\" is like sparks the imagination long after setting the book down. This book touches on many issues, comparing lives of women and couples in the 1920's to modern times, as well as dealing with the death of a loved one. The emotions are strong. You \\"feel\\" for the characters. You find yourself asking if you yourself would stay between or move beyond. I have and will continue to recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Lovely Bones - Much Better","review":"One of the things that irks me is seeing the reviews and blurbs that compare this book to the Lovely Bones. Had I believed them, I would never have picked this one up. I did not like the Lovely Bones at all, it was too preachy, and frankly, it did not hold my attention.This novel, however, draws you in by giving characters we can really care about. Razi was a kick in life and in the afterlife. I really enjoyed the pace and feel of this book. It is a great summertime read, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mercy of Thin Air","review":"This book was used for our book club. While it was not a big hit with some, others really enjoyed it. There was much discussion with many points of view and interpretations. I would still recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor???","review":"I have to confess I found this a laborious read. The concept was good -- highly creative -- but, the writing? Yikes. Whoever edited this manuscript did an injustice to the author as well as the reader. From people putting things \\"on the ground\\" instead of on the floor (Huh??? When did they go outdoors???), to anachronisms, to some of the most bizarre useages imagineable, I have never been so distracted from a story by it's language. The line that put me on the floor giggling was a scene where the dead girl's ex and her dad are commiserating and both men \\"mash\\" their forearms to their eyes. Good lord. What an image!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just not a five","review":"I really enjoyed this book, however I couldn't give it a five because I didn't LOVE it. It is a great love story, I enjoyed the history that the author discussed with the women's movement, (how approriate right now with women't rights being threatened), but I just couldn't quite buy the ghosts writing letters....Besides that, I read the book in one sitting, I couldn't put it down, although again, I guessed the \\"secret\\" of the story early on....but the book is beautifully written, the characters are really well developed, and over all an interesting and unusual read. I don't think anyone will be sorry if they read this....I look forward to the author's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love That Continues After Death...","review":"I loved this book! The main character experiences a love that continues after her death as a young woman. She lingers on earth as a spirit or \\"ghost\\", learning, and eventually teaching other spirits, how to interact with the real world without harm. The book carries us through many years, and follows her as she attempts to find out what happened to her true love, as well as friends and family, after her own passing. The characters are well-developed and I was drawn to them, and into their lives. The ending, and the answer to her quest to find her long-lost love, is a surprise. A fascinating read for anyone interested in the spiritual realm, or who enjoys a great love story. Let's hope for more of the same from this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazingly well put together film","review":"All too often, a film that has a high degree of originality accomplishes that at the expense of its entertainment value. This film is a striking exception. It is original from beginning to end, and well deserves its substantial box office success. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young love at its sweetest and darkest points","review":"I loved this film that is so cute and honest in its storytelling and background music. It is a love story about two young people who find their way in a big city from a small town. They are young and bright eyed but also seriously under-employed. Young man is an architect who happens to work in a greeting card company, composing designs and text for the Hallmark like card. A young woman, pretty and free spirited is employed as assistant in the same place.Story is told in non-linear fashion and it mingles the start of their love affair as well as the end of it and a hartbreak of a young man. The story is told from his point of view and it is peppered by beautiful music (of the anti-establishment kind, i.e. \\"Smiths\\") and deep, raw emotion.I find film to be honest and sincere and for that reason, I really liked the story. My take is that this is one of the better romantic movies ever and it fits every generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Movie With A Somewhat Odd Point Of Reference","review":"I liked this movie, but did not love it which is why I passed it on to a friend with the message 'pass it on to someone else'. The plot is about a guy who experiences the ups and downs in his relationship with a girl named Summer. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel were great as the boyfriend and Summer. The supporting cast was good. Dialogue was realistic. Cinematography was good.The negatives? Mostly for me it was the script. The scenes seemed to bounce around in a non-chronolgical order that took a little time to get used to. The end result unfortunately gave away the ending. There was no real element of surprise because the viewer was able to figure out where the main characters were coming from.For what it's worth, this was a good movie but also one that is fairly easy to forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fox Searchlight's people: take note this BD doesn't work","review":"Lot of people and journalists think this is a great movie, so I bought it.

A good movie to deal with a breakup."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I don't understand what the point is.Sure, you're told straight off the bat \\"this isn't a love story\\". But Summer is so flat despite her quirks and enigmatic-y-ism that when she finally makes her decision I didn't really care about her happiness. I don't want to give anything away, so that's all I can say.There was some interesting stuff going on in the main man's story, but his \\"revelation\\" about his work wasn't really that fair, so it also falls flat. You do feel for him, though.YMMV. For me, it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie was not what I expected","review":"I am a big fan of artsy movies.

So I thought I\\"d check out another of Zooey's works. Unfortunately \\"500 days\\" is a rewrite of the age-old \\"belle dame sans merci\\" with a few strokes of color and music for added interest. \\"Summer\\" is a cold, distant, yet exciting young woman who easily captures the misguided passion of Gordon-Levitt's character. As she sends him mixed signals, he becomes more smitten, until she suddenly breaks up with him. The end has a redeeming twist in which Tom realizes that he wasn't exactly the attentive lover that Summer needed, and their chemistry wasn't all that perfect either. Save for that flash of clarity, the rest of the movie is a sickening ride through the angst of unrequited love, which I didn't particularly enjoy. I'll be sticking to Deschanel's more flesh-and-blood, lovable character \\"Jess\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it from a guy that knows","review":"This movie was amazing.

You know that feeling when you're just starting a relationship? When every look is fraught with meaning, every sentence analyzed for double entendre? That's this movie. That giddiness oozes from the entire first half of the movie. It doesn't hurt that the cast list reads like a list of my favorite under appreciated actors. The stars, the beautiful Zoey Deschanel and JGL are both starting to get some recognition... but years after this movie. One of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This movie is quirky, fun, and original.

I wish someone would have told me that this is not a happy movie. Through most of the movie we see the couple falling in love and falling apart. I have meet lots of girls like Summer, and I hate them. They use guys and tell them they are going to do it, and than keep pulling guys in for the kill. I hated waiting that again on the TV screen.I loved the acting and the writing. If I had gone into this movie know that it was going to be a downer but interesting, than I would have been ok with it. But Light warming and fun it was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like the story in this film.","review":"This movie had all the makings for greatness and a fun movie experience, except that in the end, it became academic, a self-help guide to getting over a relationship with a commitment-phobe who took advantage of the generous heart of an individual who proclaimed with his whole being that he was in love. It seems criminal to indulge in a relationship and lovemaking when in your heart you know that you can't see your life going forward with the person. To glamorize and romanticize this in a film was just sad and disappointing. Too bad. There were so many moments in this film that I just loved. It is filled with wonderful detail and sweetness. I particularly loved the Hall & Oates dance sequence. But for all of it's goodness, it is overwhelmed and washed away when this film ends with a train wreck and the story's shabby attempt to substitute the mess with a patchwork rainbow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artsy references do not make for depth.","review":"I repeat my title: artsy references do not make for depth. Neither does a non-linear time frame, even if it is meant to evoke the way memory functions. With as common a theme as he loves her/she loves him not, this should be a character driven drama to make the audience feel the emotional conflict. The characters are too thinly drawn here to evoke that response. Honestly, I knew more about Charlie Brown, Lucy, and the red headed girl from Charles Schulz's four panel cartoons than I do about the leads in this movie. The direct camera interviews seem formulaic after TV shows like \\"The Office.\\" The narrator seems more like an apologist for this unsympathetic love affair than an omniscient voice. The only reason I am giving this mediocre movie two stars is the charismatic lead actors. I would like to see Zoey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in something more worthy of their talent.

The clever language and thin satire are hard to perceive, much less appreciate, being smothered in foul language, graphic sex, and the profane, making this novel unsuitable for high-school students (though it is on some YA lists) and undesirable for most other humans.

How can one tell?If you are squeamish about what you read or otherwise limit the foul language, sexual content, or ravings against religion in your reading, then you will want to skip this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre first effort","review":"Why is it that if someone doesn't like a book there's always a crowd of people who insist those readers \\"just didn't get it\\"? I have discussed this book with many \\"intelligent and engaged\\" readers who had justifiably critical things to say about it. The book has funny parts, particularly those dealing with the inanities of high school life, but apart from the narrator the characters are flat, unappealing, and nauseatingly pretentious. I look forward to reading something by the author that isn't partly autobiographical, since for whatever reason he doesn't appear capable of distancing himself enough from the subject matter to write a truly brilliant parody.

This book is a non-stop page turner, and Handler's evocation of the adolescent mentality is disturbingly realistic. The \\"study questions\\" at the end of each chapter are a brilliant addition. If the popular culture parodies are somewhat facile and will date prematurely (who will recognize \\"Winnie Moprah\\" in 50 years?), they are entertaining nevertheless. My main criticism is that upon rereading, there are too many questionable instances where other characters are interacting with the imaginary one, in ways that would not be possible unless they saw her too.

The book is full of questions, but almost no answers, but yet, you can answer all, know all, and see all. You are the thinker there, for you are the only answerer of your thoughts, and I'm the answerer of mine. There are sorrows in life and in the book too, but the sorrows in the book can only be answered by you; take your pick, go or stay, you answer. I will answer mine, and you answer yours.

Over the years I have bought this classic and delightful story for new members of my own family, as well as friend's children. This special edition has beautiful illustrations that add to the enjoyment as children get to know Badger and Mr. Toad and all the other myriad denizens of the river bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be great for children","review":"It was about a mole who takes a trip with a river rat and meets other animals. I found it boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever","review":"What can you say about this gorgeous book? Nothing could do it justice. It's a classic of English lyricism. It's something every child should be read, although the vocabulary can be challenging for children to read on their own. It's a book for the family to cherish.This version is nicely made with lovely illustrations. It belongs on the bookshelf between Alice In Wonderland and Winnie the Pooh. Although the illustrations are not, in my opinion, in quite the same class as those, the story is, and the prose style is more vibrant and evocative than either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Fantasy, wonder and awe!

I have read TWITW over 25 times in my 38 years, and each time it touches a chord in my heart. Very few other books that I have read create such beautiful mental imagery for me of the wonders of nature and leave me feeling so spiritually refreshed. This is probably not a book that should be read indiscriminately to very young children, but it is wonderful for school-age children and for adults that still know what it feels like to be a child. Although the animals throughout the book are treated as humans, this does not detract from the overall feel of the book, but rather adds to the childlike delight I feel everytime I read it. If I was to have to discard my 1000's of books, this would be one of the last ten to go. If you are a child (or are an adult that has not lost all of your innocense) TWITW is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice - but it is a dramatization, not an unabridged audio book","review":"I got this in order to have a version of Wind in the Willows with separate tracks (unlike the monstrous 2-part file I was able to purchase on iTunes).This version, however (and I imagine I just didn't look close at the description) is not an audio book, but a dramatization. It is fun to listen to for me (I am very familiar with the book - having read it several times as a child), but for my 5-year old daughter it can be harder to follow than the straight-up audio book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - buy this version from the UK Amazon","review":"I love this story.

The language and symbolism in this book are far too advanced for children under 13 (and possibly even older)! I tried reading it to my kids (ages 8 & 5) and I couldn't get past the first page without them grumbling and complaining.Here is one example sentence from the first page: \\"Something up above was calling him imperiously, and he made for the steep little tunnel which answered in his case to the gravelled carriage-drive owned by animals whose residences are nearer to the sun and air.\\"It is indeed beautiful writing, but way above the heads of children."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I never received this book.

Reprinted countless times in various versions, this wonderful tale of four friends on the Riverbank has held the imagination of several generations of children. Follow the stories of Mole, Ratty, Mr Badger and the irascible Toad as they have one adventure after another, woven with Grahame's brilliant talent for targetting all ages with his story-telling. Lose yourself as we go boating on the River, visiting Mole in his underground home, searching out the elusive Mr Badger in the Wild Wood, and finally fighting united against the weasels who are trying to take control of Toad Hall. Then, having thoroughly enjoyed the book (several times) seek out one of the better film/tv versions and enjoy the visuals all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHARMING","review":"Charming series of vignettes from the animal kingdom which.

We buy it periodically as gifts for adults and children alike. We love this new edition, with its gorgeous and plentiful illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put down Redwall and pick up The Wind in the Willows","review":"I really loved this book because there was a lot of action. Mr. Grahame is wonderful in the way that he combines people and animals so flawlessly. All of the characters are extremely realistic.Mr. Mole and Mr. Rat live by the river and are best friends. One of their other friends is Mr. Toad. Mr. Toad is what many people call vain but what I call stupid. He flits from fad to fad, never once doing something for more than a week at a time. Currently, he is absolutely obsesed with motor-cars. When Mr. Toad steals a motor-car and ends up in jail, the weasels take over his home. It takes all of the animals help to win back Toad Hall again.Anyone who enjoys a a great fantasy story will love The Wind in the Willows. However, I strongly recommend this book to the lovers of the Redwall series and Tailchaser's Song."},{"rating":"2","title":"For kids of ALL ages","review":"I have been reading this book to my 3-year old daughter. Although she may not understand all that I am reading she is captivated by my reading (using voices of course!) I forgot how wonderful this story is and how beautiful the language is. Now that my son has been born he joins us for our reading time and he is as captivated as his sister! If you are looking for something special to read that the whole family can share this is the book you should hunt for. I would even suggest splurging a little and get a copy with the pretty illustrations. This will be a book that your child will remember forever and hopefully will pass on to their children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"\\"The Wind in the Willows\\" remains a masterpiece, with adventures and talking animals to appeal to the kiddies, and lyrical descriptions and dry humor for their parents - but this edition is missing not only Ernest Shepard's evocative (and, some would say, essential) drawings, but every last one of the songs - and that really eviscerates the book. I don't know if the other versions available for Kindle have the entire book, but it would be worth paying something to get the real thing instead of just a part of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victorian writing that somehow isn't pretentious","review":"I remember a staging of this book when I was young that, like most kids' books turned in to plays, was confusing and kind of scary. I guess as I kid my attention span was so short I didn't even notice what was going on. Rereading this after a few years have passed, I now realize this is a masterpiece of style and characterizations. Unlike most books for kids, it doesn't condescend, and unlike a lot of Victorian style writing (in my opinion anyways), it doesn't have huge pretense. People are bugged by the fact that the animals are highly human, but I think that's part of the point. Chapter 7, especially, is above and beyond what most writers today could achieve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this now!","review":"True, this book is a classic. But contrary to some other reviews you may read on this site, the book earns its status as a classic. It's a brilliant adventure, and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming little book","review":"This is a charming little book, very famous, written for a child but clearly loved by adults also. Easily read in a matter of hours, perhaps on a train journey or a lovely sunny day in the garden. You will come away with a real feel good factor, following the lives and adventures of these enchanting (or in the case of toad, madcap) animals. Well worth a read, charming and funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"small classic","review":"Really enjoy the book but did not realize the size of the book was so small. It measures about 3x5\\".

We love these along with Thronton Burgess books. What a refreshing change from the 'extreme' cartoons and stories that are prevalent these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is not illustrated!","review":"We have this in a print edition, and it's one of our favorite books. We have read it countless times, and we love to pore over the amazing illustrations by Michael Hague.We have already downloaded a free edition of the book for Kindle (which we use on the iPad), but when we saw this same book available inexpensively we downloaded it right away.We were SO disappointed to find that the beautiful illustrations were nowhere to be found. Maybe it's an iPad thing, but be clear before you purchase that this is just the story, not the illustrations. My daughter's Kindle is also illustration-free.It is unclear when ordering whether it is or is not illustrated, but I think it is misleading to use the cover of such a lavishly-illustrated edition to advertise an edition with none.I'm still giving it 2 stars because it's such a great classic, the font is nice and easy to read, and it's not abridged. The print edition gets 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it so much more now than when I was a child","review":"The edition I read was published in about 1940 (original book published in 1908) and is exquisitely illustrated by Arthur Rackham and introduced by A. A. Milne (of Winnie the Pooh fame). This book unveils the wonderfully delightful and somewhat wacky world of Rat, Mole, Toad, Badger and other forest creatures and their lives on the river bank, in the wild wood and in the field. They are imbued with remarkably keen and poignant human traits, characteristics and emotions yet still keep some of their unique animal traits. Their adventures and misadventures are told in a rollicking, vivid, and sensuously descriptive style that defies description. I found it absolutely enchanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for bedtime reading","review":"I started reading this to my young boys at night when it's time for bed. I remember enjoying it as a kid the same way. It's a wonderful story with animals so it's easy to get them hooked.It takes one or two chapters to get them involved but once they know the rat and the mole they can't help but be eager to know what they are going to be doing next.One thing you need to be aware of is that the language is challenging for children so you need to be able to read and adjust the content on the fly. It's written in an old style with words and phrases kids won't understand. This will keep you on your toes as well.I have the kindle edition which is not as fine as having the real book with better pictures. However the kindle makes it easy to read without having the lights on so sleep comes faster!In a world of very quick, often simplified stories it's a pleasure to watch my kids enjoy a charming and rich story well told so they can use their imaginations."},{"rating":"2","title":"My granddaughter loves this book.","review":"I sent this book to my granddaughter as a welcome to the new school year gift.

This book was written BY Amy Carmichael.This hits the heart of what being a missionarey means. It is still valid for today. She has valuable insight for Christians who want to commit their all to God to be His servant with out reservation. She lived it, so certainly she is an authority on this subject. This book is a treasure not only because it is rare, but because such committment is rarer still. If you need encouragement to live out Romans 12:1 or to totally commit your life to Christ,to take the Gospel to those in darkness, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bend in The Road","review":"What a marvellous storyteller.I had previously only seen his movie of the book \\"NOTEBOOK\\",which we enjoyed.We found this story well written,riveting and very sad.Our next book will most certainly be one of Nicholas Sparks'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised and pleased by the book","review":"It is a little crazy to start reading a book like this when you have no knowledge that the author is really familiar with where and how you grew up. I bought this book thinking it was thin enough to be a little light reading (one of those waiting room books) but had to stop and back up several times when he wrote about geographical locations...then nod, smile and remember when I traveled similar roads or heard about those places on the news or from friends. The story itself captures characters that are truly believable for the region and way of life for some.Entertaining and charming is how I would describe reading this book. It is worth the small expense to feel good about life and love after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bend in the road","review":"This is a captivating and heart touching tale of two unfortuinate people who manage to find eachother and ignite eachother's lives. Miles, a young widower and Sarah, a victum of live's little misfortuines come together in a small southern town of New Bern and begin a beautiful relationship. Will the the past come back to haunt them, will they be able to overcome the hard times? Most importantly will their love survive it all? Read this heartwarming and suspenseful tale of two lovers, A bend in the road, by Nicolas Sparks to find out. I would recomend this book for almost all readers, it is somewhat sexual at times so i think that children 11 or older depending also on reading level would enjoy this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bend In The Road review","review":"A Bend In The Road is both a love novel and a mystery novel mixed in one. This makes the book more interesting to read then some of his other novels that are all about love. The book is very captivating and keeps you guessing through the whole thing. Miles the main character tends to get kind of annoying with all his anger and sometime ruins the book. The book overall though is very well written and I would recommend it to all Nicholas Sparks fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bend in the Road","review":"Great book, sad story, twisted ending.I have liked all of Nicholas Sparks books so far. I really didn't expect the ending though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bend in the road","review":"I am a usually a big fan of Nicholas Sparks but I have to say that I was disappointed with this one. My main complaint is that this story was SO predictable. Still worth reading but far from his best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one I liked up until the end and then threw it","review":"I started reading Sparks' books about a year ago. I have read about eight. I either really like his books or I end up throwing them at the end. This book was good, but like some of the others, I threw it at the end. He needs to write more books like, \\"The Lucky One\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"How predictable can you get? Very short fast read, if you can suffer through the trials and bad luck of Miles and Sarah. Although not a Sparks fan, I thought I'd try this one out. Obviously, not top on my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give this NO stars?","review":"Awful. Just awful. I enjoyed \\"The Notebook\\" and even \\"Message in a Bottle,\\" but since then Sparks is just mailing them in. What was his publisher thinking when it decided to let this one go to print? AWFUL. I'm thoroughly ashamed that I read it through to the end. I have only myself to blame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Unambitious","review":"Anyone could have written this book. So many cliches, predictable conversations, hollow characters. This is basically a Harlequin romance written by a man. I can't understand how this book graces the Bestsellers Lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"I don't know who Nicholas Sparks is and \\"A bend in the road\\" is his first book I read. I got it at the airport cause it was on the bestseller's rack. I'm amazed that such a boring book can make it to the #1 bestseller. The love story is totally boring and predictable. The so called mystery is very disappointing. I've read much better novels than this one. I'm a very emotional person and I cry quite often when reading novels. But this book didn't stir up my emotion at all. It's very easy to figure out who is the hit-and-run driver after you read the story abstract at the back-cover of the book and the first couple chapters. No suprise at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving Love Story With Some Mystery","review":"A Bend in the Road is another moving novel by Nicholas Sparks. I enjoyed this one much more than The Rescue, but not nearly as much as The Notebook or Message In A Bottle. Sparks adds a bit of mystery to this one to keep you guessing. If you want to try a fresh voice with depth and emotional impact while waiting for the next novel from Nicholas, check out Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin. Very similar to The Notebook and he's donating a dollar per book to breast cancer research. Can't wait for the next one from Nicholas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable...but who cares! I love Nicholas Sparks!!","review":"Even though this book wasn't much of a \\"mystery\\"---I had it figured out pretty early on---I still loved it.

You go through the motions with Miles, Sarah, Missy, and Jonah. Nicholas Sparks is a great writer. I can't wait for his new book. I hope they make a movie of this also."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not Sparks Best!","review":"Lots of non-sense babbling through this book, I felt like he was just trying to fill in the holes,I was very dissapointed in this book. I did not like the creepy weird thoughts of the hit & run driver. I typically give my books to friends who like to read, if it is a good book, but this I will donate. I wish I could get the time back that I wasted reading this, it was horrible as far as my opinion goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!","review":"This was my second Sparks novel. I really liked Safe Haven so I got this one from the library. I knew exactly what would happen in this book by about the 3rd chapter. I was entertained while reading it, but wouldn't recommend it. The love story was cheesy and, like I said, so predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bland read","review":"I was really disappointed in this book and I am glad I borrowed it from the library and didn't spend money for it.

You won't regret reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept reading hoping it would get better...it did not!","review":"Shallow, boring and very predictable. It seems Nicholas Sparks is unable to write with any substance, after The Notebook, his books all seem the same, hoaky themes with no depth of character or literary interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh boy","review":"This is the second Sparks book I've read. They are, unfortunately, not getting any better...I think this is the last one I'll bother with.Sparks gets a couple chapters into the book, after faithfully introducing the hero and heroine, then WHAM drops the first hint over your head as to who is the villain. A couple chapters later, WHAM, lets drop another hint just in case you missed the first one. Then, WHAM, one more...by now do you get who did it?! But interestingly enough, the reader is the ONLY one who figures it out. Not the hero, not the heroine. They are ignorant. You want to smack them, \\"wake up dummies!\\" And the hero and heroine go off on such irritating tangents that you can only conclude \\"maybe they deserve each other.\\"It's my own fault that I continued right up to the very-predictable end, when I could have left it in the airport for someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst novel I have read this year","review":"I wasn't expecting great literature, but Sparks' novel is so banal, with a boring and predictable plot and a comic-book level of writing, that I only finished because I had made a game of guessing the next cliched phrases the author was going to use (I listened to the audio book) - and I was doing pretty well at it. The character of Miles was especially ridiculous: devoted father turns into crazed avenger and abusive boyfriend (who seems for a while to forget he even has a son)? Far from being touched by this love story, it made me want to gag. I do NOT recommend wasting your time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bend in the Road","review":"As usual Nicholas Sparks does his magic in this book. This book touches you with Miles tragedy with the loss of his wie, concerns for his son and the meeting with Sarah but as usual he has a twist and a shocking secret to lock in your interest.I have read all but one of Nicholas's books and i have never been disappointed with the exception of Three weeks with my brother, which was informative regarding his sybling dynamics for the two of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book - always a great author!","review":"I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks books and I haven't read one of his books that I didn't like. Always a good read. Would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding! Who could not like this?!","review":"I was just browsing the bookstore and found this by no particular reason. In fact, I've never read any of his books before. I read this book in three days or less and could not wait to rush back to the bookstore the second I was finished to buy ALL of Sparks' books. I won't go into the story since you are able to read about it already, but I will say that it was a fantastic book with a wonderful love story, but with twists too, making you not want the book to end! Let me also add that I just finished 'The Notebook' today and I can't say for sure which one was better. I loved them both! I am about to start 'The Rescue' now. Ignore the bad reviews!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book!","review":"This is an absolutely great book! A gentle, uplifting love story and a bit of drama and mystery to go along together make this book one of my favorites and in my opinion, Nicholas Sparks' best book.The characters in this book are believable, the premise interesting, and Sparks' development of both is more than satisfying. It is hard for me to believe that Nicholas Sparks continues to write better with each book, but that seems to be the case, as is definitely evidenced in A Bend in the Road. Whether you're a long time Sparks fan or have yet to read a book, I would recommend this book in the highest terms!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparks does it again","review":"Nicholas Sparks is a master at creating humanistic love stories, and he has done it again in A BEND IN THE ROAD.The story of a man left to raise his son after the tragic death of his wife is sure to spark compassion and arouse regret in Spark's readers. We can't help but love Jonah, his young son, and its obvious why both fall in love with his teacher, Sara. But like all stories, this romance is too good to be true.The title of this novel is superbly chosen, as it holds both literal and methaphoric meaning to the novel. For readers familiar with Spark's, you'll love this latest story. If you're new to the author, be prepared for a sophiticated and mature story of love and loss. I'm already looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bend in the Road","review":"Amazing book! Very heart-touching and intriguing. I couldn't put the book down. I loved it and it is definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I love Nicholas Sparks but I was really disappointed in this book.

I don't know if there is anything about this book that I didn't like. I would recommend this boom to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bend in the Road","review":"This was my favorite book. I have read all books written by Nicholas sparks. The mixture of tragedy and romance was perfectly balanced. I love the way that all of his books teach a life lisson. This teaches to not take anything for granted. At any moment you can lose something that is close to you. Also taeches that while driving, eventhough you may think you are aware of everything that is going on there still can be more that is not visable to the eye. and it may jump out at any moment just as the dog did. Also you must never run away, you must face that reality of life. If you don't face up to your realityyour life may be chamged for the worse just as Brians was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read","review":"This book was again a page turner, hard to put down. Loved it. So far there hasn't been on book I have read by Nicholas Sparks that I haven't loved.A Bend in the Road"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one of his best","review":"A Bend in tbe Road is by far one of Sparks' greatest works yet. It doesn't top Message in a Bottle, but ranks up there right under it alongside The Rescue in my opinion. I picked up the book late one night to read a little before bed. Five hours later I was putting it down, only because I had finished it. The story was so compelling that nothing could take me away from it. I can't wait to see what Sparks writes next. It can't come soon enough! I highly recommend this book to everyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love despite a mean coincidence (?)","review":"There is one big secret that is revealed that deeply alters the way things are between the romantic leads, Miles and Sarah. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story, although it took some \\"convincing\\" for me to handle the secret. I guess I read somewhere that coincidences like this secret, do happen in real life. It is just terrible. But I loved how things worked out in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rewarding love story","review":"Nicolas Sparks never fails to deliver to his readers. This small town born client fell in love with the home town theme of characters, atmosphere and vivid imagery portrayed in every nook of this book. Although easily predictable, I was still carried through with ease and warmth as I turned each page of the story. I love the truth to the ending, good things can come out of bad situations. A \\"lifes' lesson\\" we all need to think about. Tomorrow always turns a page in our own lifes' story. Nicholas Sparks is always an inspirational read. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not favorite Sparks book, but good....","review":"Not one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books, but good none-the-less. Most times, his books get me right from the start. With this book, it didn't really start grabbing me until the second half. Lots of surprises (no spoilers here!) and twists in the plot. Some things I could guess, others I couldn't. All in all a fairly decent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite","review":"This was the first Nicholas Sparks I have read. I found it trite, shallow, gramatically incorrect with a plot that is so thin that you see the outcome 20 chapters before it arrived. The authors handling of conversation is so stilted and stiff (I accept that Miles had problems trying to \\"chat up\\" Sarah) that I wondered if it was his first attempt at writing. It is the sort of book I should hate to leave on a train just in case some poor unsuspecting soul should pick it up and start reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put \\"A Bend in the Road\\" down from reading it...","review":"When I approached the last few pages I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen at the end. For a second, I thought they weren't going to end up together at the end after Miles went out of town, and he wasn't going to let her know anything, by that I mean if they would end up even seeing each other after Miles found out that Sarah's brother was the killer of his late wife.This story tells about a sheriff in New Bern, who has a son that has trouble in school after his teacher lets Miles know that he needs to speak with him. Sarah, who is Jonah's teacher, ends up working with him extra after school to help him the subjects he's struggling with.After time, Miles starts and continues to date Sarah. That's when Sarah's brother ends up confessing to her that he killed Mile's late wife, accidentally.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading romance books. I guarantee you that you won't put this book down. Take my word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all a page turner...","review":"The book was OK, but not nearly as good as I thought it would be. All Nicholas Sparks books are so predictable and they're just so repetitive. I thought the characters in this book were especially unrealistic. Miles was ridiculous and irritating, and Jonah acted like he was 3 years old rather than 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pain in my head","review":"...from attempting to read this \\"not even worthy to be called a beach book\\" book! I picked it up to read on a plane and found I preferred the drone of the engines. Boring. Predictable. Shallow. Sappy. All this - and I didn't even get half-way into it!

I wanted to but it just wasn't a page turner in my opinion. I liked the relationship between Miles, Jonah and Sarah but 1/2 way through the story line kinda fell through and moved on to other things. I kept on reading and waiting for it to get better but it just never did. Every night as I read on my kindle in bed I would say to my husband \\"I am ready for this to start getting good!\\" My 2 fav Nicholas Sparks books = Safe Haven (LOVED it) and A Walk to Remember (very sweet)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you on your toes","review":"I have read all of Nicholas Sparks' books and I have loved every one of them. Although they all seem to keep the same sort of theme - they are all great. I've been waiting for this new book to come out and it was everything and more than what I expected. It had a little more mystery to it than any of his other books. I recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit dull","review":"I was very disappointed in the ending.

As soon as I met the character who would turn out to be the driver, I knew the rest of the story. It was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing. The story's decent. The text flows nicely, and the suspension of disbelief is strong, but where did Nick's originality go? Where's the sweet and innocent charm of The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe? It seems like he's run out of steam, or didn't care too much about this one.A decent book to read, but don't expect anything spectacular as you would with his earlier work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it - but was a bit predictable","review":"I knew there would be a connection with the main characters - and of course there was. But what happened after the connection was out in the open - was different from what I expected.

The killer talks to the reader in italics (very chilling) expressing his grief and sadness over what he has done. While Miles moves on with Sarah some unexpected info comes up about his wifes killer. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil it but PLEASE READ ! Read all of his books !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching Story","review":"The book \\"A Bend in the Road\\" tells the story of Miles Ryan who loses his wife in a hit and run accicdent. The book is generally about how he deals with the thought of no knowing who killed his wife and the challenge of moving on. Though some of the outcomes are a little bit far fetched, the story will touch your heart and remind you that sooner or later you have to move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"This book is really well written. It is not exactly a mystery, but it could well fit into that category. I gave it four stars because the ending seems a little hurried. It all came into place too soon. But, really, it is a good book. The ending can be a little surprising if you are not used to reading mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read.","review":"I like this book.

But when the secret is revealed Miles does not know if there is a future forhim and Sarah.The readers of this book made it seem so real, I was near tears.I have read: The NotebookThe Rescueand I will say they are all excellent reading. If you like drama with romanace Nicholas Sparks has the best.Try it you might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware the black dog!","review":"This intense novel is mainly a bittersweet romance, though the twists and turns involved in that small town in North Carolina complicate the matter. The climax toward the end was more than I could take at one sitting -- had to read it in snatches, as too much emotion was involved.It was a clever twist, and I was fooled as to the identity of the perpetrator of the misery to this couple and their families. And to think that this 'innocent' person might end up ruining the lives of all involved.This story was nothing like A WALK TO REMEMBER with the exception of a useless, early death to an important character. It was different, yet much alike; I hope the movie won't be such a tearjerker, though.This writer sitting among the daffodils (should have been tulips -- read the book and you will understand why) could fit the description of the main character of this book. Makes a reader wonder if he bases his stories on real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the immature, and angry men...","review":"Although I have enjoyed several of this author's previous novels, this one dissapoints. The main reason? A male character with the emotional maturity of a five-year-old. Two years after the death of his wife this guy is a self-indulgent rageaholic who can't get on with life. Yes, he is a good father and I admire that, but he is also impulsively angry, lacks self-awareness and is generally graceless when it comes to considering others' reactions to his wife's death. Yuck. As a man, I am tired of stereotypical (angry) and emotionally stunted male characters. How about a smart, sensitive, self-regulated guy for a change. I think I am most disenchanted with all the glowing reviews of the book by women readers. Is this behavior really romantic????"},{"rating":"1","title":"SNORE ....","review":"Oh Lord, please deliver me from this boring, plodding story line. If it were not for my fetish about finishing every book I read, this one would have been back on the shelf within the first few chapters.

Mr. Sparks first book was very enjoyable, I think they have progressively declined since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambler Scramblers Review","review":"A Bend in the Road is an emotional and intriguing book. Miles Ryan's life was torn apart when his wife Missy was killed in a hit and run accident. He felt that, as a cop and as a husband, it was his job to find the driver. He is trying to get through his problems when he meets his son's teacher, Sarah, a just divorced woman who is new to their town. They connect and work through their problems together but when they find out they are connected by a dreaded secret, they are pulled apart. One thing leads to another and Miles is highly doubting that he will ever see Sarah again. They don't know what they are going to do from there, but closure is soon found."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I lisetend to the audio casset & almost couldn't get through the whole thing...not only was the story sappy, but the person reading it made it even sappier. Nothing ruins a book more than the wrong person reading it. Too sweety for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A marketing product; not a creative novel","review":"I enjoyed the first Nicholas Sparks book I read, but now, after reading a few, it's apparent that Sparks writes for sales, to fill whatever contract, and not because he has a truly creative idea. A Bend in the Road is predictable and trite and is an insult to serious book lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing.","review":"This is the first book by Sparks that I've read. I've seen his books on bestseller lists and expected more. The plot was contrived, the abrupt ending too neat and convenient, and the characters unconvincing. The book seemed more like an extended Good Housekeeping romance story...maybe that's what Sparks writes. If so, this will be the last book of his that I read. I suppose I need to remember that \\"bestseller\\" does not mean literary excellence."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bend in the Road","review":"This book did not hold my attention at all. I felt that it was slow and I didn't care about any of the characters. They were all so pathetic that you really couldn't choose who to feel sorry for. The book was also Highly predictable. You knew everything that was going to happen from the first 3 chapters into the book. I felt that this book was a complete waste of time. Then again Nicholas' only good book was \\"The Notebook\\" and even that was slow at times and uneventful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy","review":"I really hate to do this, but it irks me that an over-rated author could get to be a best seller.

It was so boring and slow and I hope that he does not write any more like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste time reading this book","review":"This novel is boring and predictable. The abstract at the back cover of the book and the first couple chapters are more than enough to tell the entire story. It didn't touch the readers' emotion like I expected it would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone else hate the narrator's voice?","review":"This book is extremely predictable, and does anyone else hate the narrator's voice? The voice of Jonah is annoying, and there is no real emotion in any of the dialogue. I doubt this book is any better in the print version, either. BORING. I do not recommend it, even if you are looking for a really sappy romance. Read The Notebook instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Nicholas Sparks!","review":"Nicholas Sparks has touched my heart and moved me once again with A Bend In The Road.

Until then, I recommend a new book my reading group read called \\"Shade of the Maple\\" by Kirk Martin. Reminded me of \\"The Notebook\\", my favorite Sparks novel. I got so caught up in the characters in Shade of the Maple, I couldn't put it down. I cried harder than I ever have reading a novel, but at the same time felt a certain joy and happiness.

I don't normally read \\"romance\\" novels, but Sparks' work is always so comforting and digestible that I like to get one in over a long weekend. \\"A Bend in the Road\\" didn't disappoint - it was another story filled with likeable characters about whom you inevitably worry, contemplate and cheer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This book was by far the best book I think I have ever read.

It has an ending I never would have thought would have happened, but all in all I think that this will be my favorite book for a long time.

Couldn't put book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Disappointing","review":"I am an avid reader of Nicholas Sparks's novels, but, this latest by Sparks was truly disappointing. Other readers interested in Sparks should stick with \\"A Walk to Remember\\" or \\"The Notebook\\", which I consider his best works. \\"A Bend\\" is slightly above \\"The Rescue\\" (which was just INCREDIBLY disappointing as well), but, \\"A Bend\\" lacked Sparks's typical creativity and, therefore, was just too predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little depressing","review":"I have read a few different Nicholas Sparks books and loved A Walk to Remember. The Notebook was wonderful but I found this one to be a little depressing. There was the love aspect between Miles and Sarah but the fact that Miles kept dwelling on his dead wife Missy kept bringing me down and I felt so badly for his son. It seemed like different writing for Sparks...not his typical romance writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not one of Nicolas Spark's best","review":"Unlike other Spark's books the main character of this book was not a real likable guy. Miles was very selfish. He was so wrapped up in himself that he didn't notice that his son couldn't read or write. After he got involved with Sarah, he decided it was over without considering how his son would feel about it. When he was taking Brian into custody, he was driving more recklessly than Brian was when the accident happened. We were led to believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart that he let Brian go without pressing charges.The book was still a page turner (I read it in 5 hours) but didn't require any kleenex like other Spark's books. The ending left me wondering if Miles was indeed changing his selfish ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is truly amazing!","review":"If I could give this book negative stars, I would; I am absolutely flabergasted at these reviews. I had to read this book for our Book Club and found it to be the worst book I ever read and a total waste of my time! I am an avid reader and am angry when I read a book that is such garbage as this one was. Not only was it totally predictable, but Sparks' style is elementary. I read one other book by him for the same Book Club, and found it to be total dribble- what is the American public coming to?Better spending your time reading The Corrections- now that's a good use of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite Drivel. Terrible Narrative Style.","review":"It seems that, in every bookstore, there's a colossal wall of Nicholas Sparks books. A Bend in the Road appeared to be an interesting read, so I picked it up, only to be extremely disenchanted. The narrative was simply horrible! Sparks spoon-feeds the reader - explaining the obvious, and disclosing \\"clues\\" MUCH too explicitly. Furthermore, he REPEATS these superfluous ramblings ad nauseam. He DESCRIBES feelings and emotions, rather than allowing his reader to sense and experience them. This takes the very purpose and pleasure out of reading a book! I find that Sparks's writing style is trite, predictable, rudimentary... and even a bit patronizing to anyone with more than two brain cells. Sorry, Nicky!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEND IN THE ROAD","review":"I loved that the couple ended up together at the end even though you kind of wandered what would happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I absolutely loved it!!!

Perhaps he is allowing himself to write too many books too quickly! I was not sorry that I read it, but it left me wanting to read a Judy Picoult book! She writes books that make me want to stay up all night reading and yet not wanting to do that, as I don't want the book to end. This book lacked a sense of reality. I kept wondering, how do they have time to do this or that? I need more depth, I guess?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A love story/suspense mix","review":"An excellent read - what begins as a simple love story, develops into an exciting and complex suspense story.

Would definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Reading!","review":"I liked this book very much. It is a typical Nickolas Sparks novel. He tells a story that is true to life. It maynot be the ending you want, but it is about life, and sometimes, the ending is not what we would like for ourselves or others. I couldn't put A Bend in the Road down, and when I did, I couldn't wait to get back to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very clever - lifeless characters","review":"I just didn't buy into this book's plot. I have family in New Bern and I enjoyed his description of the town and life there (fairly accurate slice of life). However, the characters were awful. He never developed the romance into anything beyond infatuation. The two seemed to have nothing in common and no reason to stay together. The big cliffhanger is awful and then poorly handled by the characters creating artificial drama -- common in many people's lives, but something I like to avoid. I am actively waving people away from this book as trite and annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluff...fluff....where's my notebook...","review":"I have to agree with a previous reviewer...this is a beach read.

Once I start reading it, I can't put it down so I am done with it in 2 days. Then again, waiting for the next. This book was no different. You feel like you are in the story, you actually want to give advice to the characters. Now this one is my favorite. The ending is a little predictiable but it is still a great book. I love Nicholas Sparks, and now I can't wait till the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another ONE star","review":"I simply couldn't believe that this book was written by a New York Times bestselling Author.

Leo has to deal with a lot of stuff while his friend Tim is missing from what seems to be, alien abduction. He has to go through tough therapy which I could probably never do in my lifetime. Leo reacts unconcernedly but horrified, and the ending of this is horrific. All in all I would recommend this book to a sixth-grader who likes science-fiction; it gets two out of five stars on my scale.JC"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiasco, book or film?","review":"Oh, is this book flawed. There are a number of incorrect facts from the small (Madonna's confirmation name is Veronica, not one of her birth names as Parish states) to the large (General Bethlehem was a character in \\"The Postman\\" movie that was completely made up and did not exist in the novel the film was based on). There are some grammatical and spelling errors. The writing is a cross between Entertainment Weekly and Premiere, and one gets the distinct impression that each chapter was written as a separate article that was rejected by either rag (there's little chapter continuity). One has to wonder about several choices Parish made in what films he chose to discuss (\\"Town and Country\\"? \\"The Wild Party\\"?) while ignoring others he constantly mentions in passing (\\"Heaven's Gate\\" being the obvious choice)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight, Entertaining Look At Hollywood's Disasters","review":"Fiasco is a good overview of some of Hollywood's most notable failures. Parish spares no one in describing the unchecked egos, ulterior motives, and inability of anyone in charge to say no that made these failures as spectacular as they were. While it could get monotonous reading the same mistakes being repeated endlessly, Parish does his best to keep the stories interesting by making his writing unchallenging and light. In fact, if it weren't for his annoying habit of changing a person's possessive description from their first name to their last name and back (often within the same paragraph), Parish's writing style could be described as perfect for the topic.Film and business students could probably gain additional insights for their fields of study by reading this book. But, for most of us, Fiasco is a gossipy, enjoyable read about very bad decision making."},{"rating":"1","title":"flopola in more ways than one","review":"An interesting concept semi-doomed by a few built-in flaws and not a few glaring typos.Yes, you can hardly write a book about disastrously expensive films without including movies like Cleopatra, whose financial follies have already been covered ad nauseum for decades. But where are the chapters on such spectacular misfires as Myra Breckinridge, Hello Dolly, The Little Prince, Jonathon Livingston Seagull, Howard the Duck, Heaven's Gate and Bonfires of the Vanities?Case in point: As interesting as its offscreen travails may have been, The Wild Party (a scarely-remembered Raquel Welch \\"art\\" picture budgeted at under $1 million) was simply an unsuccessful film, not even in the same ballpark as the monumental bombs that are supposedly the book's focus. (And can this picture really have been shooting, as the author claims, from May 1974 to July 1975?)Typos aside, this book's biggest problem is that most of the material is old news to readers most likely to want to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiasco is a Fiasco","review":"I really anticipated reading this because I'm fascinated by Hollywood failures.

I could not put them down and was fascinated by what each generation of this family went through. At the time, I was studying American History and these books made everything click and placed it all in perspective. John Jakes is the one who inspired me to work towards my dream of a writing career and to pursue a degree in junior high or high school history. He is one of my very favorite authors. He makes history come alive and helps one to understand it all. The breathtaking romance and nail biting adventure and thrills are just the icing on the cake. I loved every book in the series, although the \\"Warriors\\" is my favorite and \\"Jeremiah\\", my favorite Kent family member. I look forward to rereading them all again soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for history lovers.","review":"Though this novel is fictional and truly a romance, this novel is full of accurate historical information.

Pillip is an interesting character,though a little unlikely in his experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"titillating trash","review":"I read all of the Kent Family chronicles when they were first published and I was a young adult. Even then, I was struck by the similarity to Herman Wouk's *Winds of War* (although not nearly as well written):Jakes and Wouk constantly are name-dropping--they have their characters always in personal contact with the great names of the day. Give me a break, and give the readership a little credit. Do they think no one will read their books if famous names are not littered throughout?A more serious concern I have with Jakes is his misogynism. Every single one of the Kent heroines was raped, and in the case of Amanda Kent, raped repeatedly at the age of 10. Please. I understand that Jakes was no doubt bowing to the trends of the 70s wherein rape seemed to hold a romantic (?) fascination for some editors, but even then I was repelled by the gratuitous abuse of women. And NEVER did it advance the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great epic historical novel cant wait to read the others","review":"The first novel in the 7 part series.

Philip Kent is the main character he flees England with his mother to get away from his Brother who wants them dead. When Philip arrives in America he meets a beatiful women adn gets involved in the Boston Tea Party. On the journey through out the book he come along maney historic figures.

To make matters worse, Ward Press seems not to have any web presence whatsoever, leading me to be rather suspicious, especially since, to my knowledge, all editions of this particular text are still under copyright, which is why they are not available through Google Books or any other scanning system.It's worth noting that nowhere in the description is the date of original publication mentioned for this, which is concerning, as it is important to know which edition of the repeatedly-revised original this actually is.I would love to be wrong in my suspicions, but I very much fear that I'm not."},{"rating":"2","title":"SMDM Done RIGHT....finally.","review":"I have edited this review because it has since been given a proper Region 1 release.

The picture quality is amazing, the sound is fantastic, and I could not possibly imagine how they could have made it better. All 3 of the original Pilot movies, the complete first season, and a handful of very excellent and well done bonus features. In short, this is the SMDM set we have been waiting for, and I am glad Universal finally got their head out of their collective asses and gave us what we have been waiting over 30 years for.No one needs to be told what the show is about, as far as I'm concerned, the concern should be about the quality of the product, and they really delivered.

That episode was in this first season. Other guest stars are William Shatner and Farrah Fawcett. There's even a DVD extra that highlights the many famous guest stars in the last disc.

Although the work is filled with discordant notes (often causing beat notes between the stereo channels), it hangs together, having recurring themes very much like traditional classical works. The final movement brings back the themes for a final crescendo. Having played it countless times since discovering Quatermass in the 1970s, I am thoroughly familiar with it and can whistle some of the segments, much to the puzzlement of those around me. By far, the best way to listen is with headphones or ear buds. I experience abstract colored patterns and moving objects in my mind during some parts of the recording. It's truly one-of-a-kind and a superb work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing.","review":"\\"Essay\\" is a generous term for the miasma of run-on sentences that comprise this book. The essays are rambling, egoistical and full of juvenile arguments, only a few of which are rescued by McCourt's humor. As in \\"A Monk Swimming\\" and \\"Singing My Him Song\\", McCourt shows a fine lyrical voice, but no cold eye for truth.

If it weren't for Brother Frank's brilliance, Malachy's work would very likely never see print.

He assumes that an overdose of love for children will result in sexual attraction for children. Rather, I see people of all ages and both genders needing people of all ages and both genders, and I see people of different age/gender groups fulfilling different needs.Research tells us that:1. a pedophile tends to lack early experience in nurturing children younger than himself2. pedophiles seldom offend against a child whom he had nurtured from infancy, and in fact, tends not to have nurtured any child from infancyIn light of these findings, one might conclude that pedophilia is impossible in an extended family setting, which is exactly what predominated until very recently in our evolutionary history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!

Mei Ng's portrayal of Chinese Mother/Daughter relationship is only realistic when there is mention of a daughter's protectiveness of her mother, but everything else is nothing but trash, especially the poorly phrased dialogue and regular exchanges between the family members.

I'll excuse flaws after flaws if something about the book catches me. This book, however, was such a chore to read. Ng's grammatical errors were obvious and frustrating. Sentence structures were poor, unimaginative and many times defensive even at times when it need not be.But her biggest flaw were her storytelling paths. They were unfocused, many times uninteresting, lacking grasp and shaky. I found myself trying to help her re-write her book.

It has two distinct areas: one well padded area for photo gear, the other unpadded for things like sweaters, etc.The camera compartment is not huge, but it will accommodate most peoples digital SLR, mid-range zoom, telephoto zoom and flash, and a few other modest size accessories. It's not a very good bag for a gadget freak you can't decide what to take, so takes everything.The top compartment serves two useful functions. It gives us a nice, somewhat roomy area for carrying odds and ends; and it extends the bag length so that it fits comfortably on the back. This design is also much lighter than most backback designs, which makes it more suited to those such as myself who don't like to lug tons on my back."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for long lens","review":"The ads is misleading, it can not match the need for a photographer with long lens. Look at the demo image in product description, What I can tell you is these two lens are all medium length.long lens+body > height of bottom apartment plus 4 inch.So you can not put the lens-attached SLR vertically like the demo image shows.long lens+body = width of bottom apartment.example: a 70-300mm lens attached to SLR camera, i have to either put it in top apartment (which is assumed to hold jackets, lunch and other stuffs according to ads), or i have to remove all \\"wall\\"s from the bottom apartment to lay down the camera and leaving \\"un-walled\\" little space for two medium-size lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Bag!","review":"I've had this bag for about a month now and i love it! it holds my 40d w/ 28-135 lens, 50mm prime lens and the 75-300 in the top compartment when needed.

It has gone with me on several trips out of town as well as day trips. There is a lot of room for camera equipment, and a small amount of room for other things in the top. There are also side pockets for small items or a bottle of water. There is not room for a lot of extra items, but if you are taking a day trip, and want all of your camera equipment, and a few other items, this works good.Overall, I like the bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect camera bag","review":"This camera bag is just the right size and weight for protecting your camera and having everything organized and accessible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome camera backpack!","review":"This backpack is great!

It has enough room in the bottom compartment for my Cannon digital camera and enough room for about four standard lenses.

I have a Nikon D80 with the 18-200MM lens. This bag holds the body & lens, spare batteries, memory cards, lens pen, battery charger, point&shoot camera and other stuff with no problem. The top part of the bag holds a good amount of other things and is very useful. I used this bag for a week-long family vacation at Disney and found it very useful. If someone needs a bag to carry a lot of lenses etc...this bag may be too small. But for the average family photographer I think it is very useful. It is comfortable however there is a lot of excess strap length to deal with, but not really problematic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Some, Not good for others","review":"I personally love this photo backpack. I bought it when I'm going to Europe so that I wouldn't have to carry a camera bag. The reason I titled my review the way I did is that it will not carry 5-10 accessories, etc. It fits just enough for a day trip, which why it's great for some. It is very comfortable, and the strap that can connect above the breast really helps with that comfort.

As a outdoor photographer I would say for non-professional use it is a good bag. However, for professionals it is not going to work. It has no tripod holding (although some Manfrotto tripods have a loop below the head that will allow you to stick two feet in the side pocket and attach the loop to the top handle on the bag with a clasp or d-ring). It also does not hold many lenses. A canon XTi with a 70-200mm is about all you will fit in the top. For a day pack or two lens set up and no tripod it is really good bag. But not for professional use. I still use it for quick hikes and like the bag. It is also a great backpack just to have around the house for general use. enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag, Very little room for prosumer and above gear.","review":"This is a very well designed bag. For what it is, it's great. However, if you have any gear of a prosumer or professional level, this bag's not going to fit much of it. I shoot with a Canon 40D with battery grip, which is a large camera. My primary lens is the 24-70mm L-series, which is also a big lens (not long, but large diameter). Combine these two in the lower compartment, and you barely have room for a flash. If you're really lucky, you might also be able to shove in a small 50mm or similar. The top compartment is reasonably large, but you'll probably end up throwing some gear up there that you couldn't fit in the bottom.I love this bag, but I'm probably trying to accomplish too much with it. I'm an avid hiker/climber, so the small size and layout are pluses. But, don't expect to take much with you in any great configuration."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"A great way to easily carry all your photo equipment on a walk-a-bout!

He is quick to point out any studies that are biased or flawed one way or another. Anyone that is interested in the wave of gun control going on in this country should read it.Mr. Lott will be in the state of Connecticut for a panel discussion on gun control on March 28th.

Rather than making an emotional argument, as most on the left of the political spectrum do, Dr. Lott documents the facts in several states that have greater trust in their honest citizens than do the more socialist areas of America.Dr. Lott debunks the myths held forth by HGI and the rest of the anti-2nd Amendment lobby. He points out their intentional distortion of the facts by presenting documentation on the subject. Dr. Lott has quantified the benefits, direct and indirect, from having a portion of the population carrying concealed weapons. He also points out that the crime rate amongst those with CCW's is almost zero.The book reads well and gives solid facts to support the argument for CCW's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you feel uncomfortable???","review":"This book has raised a lot of questions and stirred a lot emotions from me. However, after doing my own \\"internal\\" soul searching, I feel that Lott has a very sound argument.

County by county, state by state, fact by fact John Lott proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that \\"feel good\\" gun control legislation has allowed criminals to prosper while leaving law abiding citizens defenseless.Just as Ayn Rand showed in her timeless book \\"Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal\\", legislators often fail to take the big picture into consideration when making new laws. John Lott similarly shows statistically how our way of life can actually erode if we venture too far from The Constitution and especially The Bill of Rights.All of us who believe in The Constitution as it is written owe John Lott an extreme debt of gratitude. For now perhaps some of our legislators will be forced to uphold The Constitution, as they are sworn to do, rather than spend their political lives attempting to change it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank god","review":"I'll make this review short.

From a company who seems to have had customer complaints as far back as two years for the same issue and still no fixes!Save yourself $500.00.Panasonic is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit makes loud popping noise, then sound goes out","review":"I also purchased this system, and have experienced the same problem the fellow from Kentucky did; only I still had a picture after the sound went out. I have not yet spoken to Panasonic about this. I would like to find out how the guy from Kentucky knew this was a known problem. It did not do that until after a couple of months after we purchased the unit. Had I known this, I would not have purchased this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounded Great at First","review":"My wife selected this system because of the speakers and stands. I must admit that it sounded great for the price, at first. Several months of use and we got the same heart attack inducing popping sounds reported in most of the reviews here. The subwoofer/amp is extremely hot and the fan has stopped working. Panasonic was less than helpful, so I pulled it apart and found that even though the fan was good, the board would not supply any voltage to it. I would highly advise to go with another brand, as I will myself will be avoiding anything marked \\"Panasonic\\" in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the looks fool you","review":"I usually don't leave product reviews but because I feel burned so badly on this one I had to say something to warn everyone else. I was actually online searching for a way to remedy the popping and hissing, thinking I must have been doing something wrong, and then I ran across other reviews that were stating the same problem that I am having. This system really is pathetic peace of junk and I have been totally embarrassed by them on more than one occasion. They will pop and hiss (loudly) then the sound will totally disappear. Forget this system and don't give Panasonic another dime. If I were looking for a new system I would go with Bose. Yes, Bose systems are expensive but they know have payment options on their website and I can guarantee you won't get these types of reviews form their system."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had known.","review":"Quite simply, I was totally dissapointed.

There is a problem with it over heating and causing a loud poping sound after a couple hours of use. I talked with Panasonic about this and they will not admit to the problem, however, you can find several other people that have had the same problem on the net.When asked for replacement unit, I was told that I would have to take it to my local repair center to have a tech look at the unit. This unit is still under warrenty and it is going to take several days for the unit to be repaired. No sound or DVD while this takes place. I will never buy another Panasonic unit again, to bad because this was the best unit I found on the market. Guess next time I'll pay the extra money and get a Sony! At least they care about their customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks much better than it sounds","review":"Pro:1. Nice speaker stands - very practical and sturdy2. Video output is nice - as with most other component outputCon:1. Speaker cables are as thin as a couple strands of hair & you cannot upgrade because it's hidden in speaker stand2. Sound quality is really [bad]. You'll have to crank it upto near max level to hear anything (I've tried it on over 20 DVDs, CDs, VCDs)3. The bass is a JOKE. Can't believe they call it a woofer.4. Although they claim it plays CD-R, I've tried a few and they all skip or causes errors. Those CD-Rs play fine on my Toshiba DVD player.All in all, this system looks nice but it's not worth spending over [money amount]for. The sound is so weak that you'll do better with nice TV's build-in speakers (I know 'cuz my Sony Trusound speakers sound way better than this system). I'm taking mine back to circuit city for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound - Poor quality","review":"Good sound, easy to install and use. However it does have a build defect. After prolonged use it may overheat. As a result you will hear a very loud popping through speakers or system will shut down. Panasonic will not discuss defect, however my local Panasonic service center did comment they had seen a number of these returned for repair. There is also mention of individuals experiencing this issue on eCoustics.com. My service centers quote a 7 - 15 day wait to even look at the product, then additional time to fix. So I would look for a different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This the CHANCE...GO GET IT!!!","review":"I got it yesterday and as soon as I got it I installed it to unleash the magic of it. And it was a wonderful experience. I mean totally amazing. I tried my \\"LORD OF THE RINGS - TWO TOWERS\\" on it and it played it like I was watching it in the cinema hall. For the price of Amazon.com I must say it's worth it. I am a sony product lover but with this Panasonic Home Theatre I broke that rule!! Only go for the BEST!! Recommended to all....Go Get It while the prices are low!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE JUNK!","review":"What a piece of junk! After having this system for about 9 months, I noticed that the speakers started to make a loud snap, followed by loud crackling noises, and then would produce absolutely no sound for a few seconds. The snap would scare the daylights out of us as it was extremely loud and totally random. We have had it in for service TWICE by the Panasonic-authorized dealer that Panasonic referred us to. The second time we were told that the parts were on backorder from Panasonic. That was almost 2 months ago. So, our system has been sitting at the shop for 2 months. AVOID THIS SYSTEM AT ALL COSTS!!! It has been nothing but a hassle and repair from the Panasonic-authorized dealer has been a nightmare. Frankly, I can't believe that people would pay over $50 for a system with KNOWN problems, as clearly evidenced by all of the other reviewers that have had the same exact problem. I guess Panasonic is to cheap to put out a recall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracking & Popping from Speakers","review":"Like others, we have experienced loud cracking and popping sounds from the speakers. It first happened after 5 months of ownership. We took it to an authorized service center who couldn't fix it and then it was sent back to the company. We were told the unit is over-heating. We got it back after a 3 week wait and guess what? The cracking sound started again about 1 week later. Don't buy this equipment!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Known defect.","review":"After 4 months of dealing with Panasonic customer support and their authorized service centers I finally have an answer to what is causing the popping noise and sporadic sound loss. The Panasonic tech actually called me, which renewed a little faith in the company. He said it is a know issue with a number of these systems. Apparently a circuit board on the amplifier in the subwoofer is faulty.Now why does the authorized service centers not know this and why does the customer service personal guarantee you there is not a known defect in the product. I can't tell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaw dropping popping sounds","review":"Do not buy this system. Last night I heard extremely loud popping sounds coming out of the speakers while watching TV. I actually thought the speakers were going to explode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great system","review":"Great system. Nice sound. Beautiful design. Plays all formats you need.

The author should have picked one of these ten topics to write on because there's simply not enough room to adequately cover things like predestination in one chapter without creating straw men of both sides of the argument. Consistently caricatured positions to make his look better. Rarely came down solidly on one side. Argued against people without even citing their works, only citing dubious secondary sources. For example: the author spent multiple pages calling Barth a liberal and attacking neo-orthodox views of scripture, but didn't cite Barth or even a Barth scholar once.Awful. I would never give this to someone with questions about how to do missions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but not strong enough","review":"My son is new to lacrosse and the second time we used this item the plastic clasp that holds the ball and teather cord broke off.

In fact, the plot was hardly substantial, revolving around the partnership/relationship of Michael and Diana, and how their exes plotted to destroy their reputation and what they had. This was quite a disappointment, since the acclaimed Louise Bagshawe reputation emphasized girl-power, and this book lack it much. The ending was rather abrupt and unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Louise Bagshawe's Best","review":"I was rather disappointed in the love story featured in this book. HAving read and loved an earlier novel, Venus Envy and just adoring the love story in that novel, I was rather disappointed by the one in this book. I enjoyed the rest of the plot but found the love story rather wanting. It seemed to be to be rather crude and I could not see why these characters liked each other apart from the sex, that was all the relationship was about, no romance in it as far as I could see. I did not feel the characters were developed well enough, the growth of them as people was lacking and also disappointing.

One has to consider the sources in this film. Many of the narrators are ex-CIA from the Clinton years- people who basically failed to stop 9/11. Obviously, Federal law enforcement has a problem with the president's war on terror, which has minumized the FBI and the CIA.

The facts are there in parts and pieces, but it was not really put together well. Some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic. This DVD had an agenda and is not unbiased, and I think it failed at it's overall agenda. There is more than enough information pre-9/11 and post-9/11 to put together something more worthy and accurate than this DVD has attempted to do. If this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond, we are truly in trouble. The truth is out there, and I think this DVD tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together.

Where is the footage of Saddam gassing the Kurds, or the footage of the mass graves? And not one clip including any mention of the systematic rape and de-humanization of the Iraqi women. It seems the true details of Saddam's regime have been left primarily on the cutting room floor.

There was no attempt to present an opposing point of view, and the poorly disguised attempts to ridicule the President (even joking about his appearance in a flight uniform on the carrier) was beneath contempt and concrete evidence that this was a hoax created to influence the November election.

I've had it myself for over a week now, and I've put it through my own personal torture test (i'm 26 and i'm going for the fences here on every swing), and it's held up remarkably well. I initially had complaints with the fact that the power bands do get snagged on one of the knobs occasionally (as resonated in some of the other reviews here), but I figured out that you can eliminate that problem just by having the knob fact the same direction as the batting head, so i guess now I don't have any complaints anymore.

It has adjustable swing speeds and convenient for the team to use. We have been wanting one of these for our baseball team but really could not pay what other vendors were asking.

Replacement parts are expensive, I think. I shouldn't have to be replacing the hitting head within a year. Its designed to be hit. I guess the 90 day limited warranty says it all.In addition, I know my kids did not abuse this machine because I have to pull it out for them to play with and am with them when they use it. It is much too heavy for them to move at their ages.My neighbor has a similar device that is not the \\"Jeter\\" version.

It's very sturdy, and comes with stakes that you plunk right into the grass to help hold it down while used in the yard.

I used two rods and reels with minnows on one and artificial bait on the other.. I caught 14 bass that day. The biggest two weighed 8 lbs each. I highly recommend this product. It only takes a little and it really stays on for multiple casts. I plan to keep plenty on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves 500 Stars!!!!!","review":"Man I am still exploding from listening to this awesome display of melodic death metal. These guys rule!

He captured the euphoria, isolation, drive and the heart and essence of endurance running in a way I haven't seen done. He was lyrical and poetic in his descriptions of the epic battle of man against himself. I would recommend the book to any runner or to anyone who wonders why we run. The only criticism I have are the few moments in the book where Johnson seems to repeat emotions he is feeling that he already has delved into.

It's a wonderful story about the importance to look at life from a perspective of things that really matter that, as it turns out, are the simple things all around us all the time.

The start of the sequel didn't match up with either of the endings of the original, and I challenge anyone to explain the meaning behind the ending of the sequel.

As I am not a big fan of horror movies, that is a very good rating from me. Six women went in to the cave, none came out...In Descent 2, they take an elevator. They run into some annoying little flesh-eaters and the obligatory blood fest begins. Sound simple? It is. There is no more suspense than your average \\"what's around the next corner?\\" scenario.

So how can you have a Descent 2 with the person who died in the cave?In the Theatrical Descent, she wakes up in the car, but that is reversed or explained in the Original Uncut ending, that it was a Dream and she woke up in the cave. Her last vision being her Dead Daughters Brithday.You cannot reverse something that you already explained in the original Uncutversion that adds on to the theatrical Version.

The creatures spooked me, since I went camping the next night and jumped at every sound coming from the dark forest !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So it takes two","review":"I love the fist one; what a well done movie! \\"Then came part 2\\" Has you start to watch this one you see the magic start slipping away, descending down a dark hole. There are characters you really like and decent actors. the writers of this should stayed in a hole. The ending made no sense whatsoever. I feel these writers had no more ideas so they said \\" Hey lets trash this\\" Sorry my friends you need to go back to creative writing school and learn how to write. I could of written a better script then this.If you must know what happens from the first go for it. But I loved the ending of the first it made your mind wonder. Just remember it took two writers to for this one. i think Hollywood is slipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Descent 2","review":"Don't you hate it when you escape an ordeal, only to find yourself back because of evil people? Worst is when you have no memory so you can't stop yourself from going back. Anyway, this sequal was better than i thought. Two old faces from the first return in this film and they both keep the movie going. The other cave members were interesting and this film did feel like the first one, with more similitaries than a whole new experience. I don't know if there is going to be a part 3, bit if there is. i won't be shocked if it's a prequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far better than the average sequel","review":"The budget is a bit lower than the first one and there's not as much emotional baggage in this one, but it does exactly as a sequel should- it continues the story of the first one with good continuity and without a lot of rediculous additions like most sequels tend to add. You can basically edit the two movies together and it'll work fairly seamlessly.No it's not as good as the first one, but then again there's only a handful of sequels that ever were. It's still a good movie and worthy of the franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth Watching.","review":"Although this sequel does not quite reach the high pitch of terror achieved by the first film it is still very well done and well acted. A worthy sequel. Also do not mix up \\"The Descent\\", with \\"The Cave\\", a somewhat similar movie released at about the same time. \\"The Cave\\", is OK, but \\"The Descent\\", is something special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as Good as the Original","review":"The original is one of the best horror films of the last 10 years. When I read that a sequel had been made, I couldn't wait. While the sequel follows the same formula as the first, and, thus, suffers from a real surprise factor, it still rocks! Scares and gore abound. If you liked the original you owe it to yourself the watch the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE disappointment","review":"A misfire with only a few bright moments. With the writer/director of the original film producing this one, why didn't he clean up the awful script? So much goes wrong here - the lead character has zero depth here and goes from zombie to Ms Rambo - a character who has absolutely zero chance of living in the first film...umm...survives for part 2. Instead of being a surprising twist it was an \\" oh come on, you're kidding\\" moment. The new movie focuses on gore instead of suspense and intensity. The stupendously horrible last minute \\"twist\\" ending that makes no sense. Bad acting, bad writing, it is surprising the movie is such a mess, and a shame. Avoid as if it were the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucked horribly","review":"Caves were too light. Lost the scare factor.Creatures were shown too much and too clearly.

Director and cast really pulled it off. All the claustrophobia and tension is here along with real characters that you care about. I've read some of the negative reviews posted here, and while this movie does have many of the same elements of the first film, there is still plenty to enjoy. If you liked the first Descent you should like this. Great character arcs and loads of gore. I hope to see more of the crawlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It was not that good. It was such a let down compared to the 1st one, and especially considering what they could have done with it. Jeez! There were major plot holes, and the acting is really quite bad, and the dialogue, my God, I had my hand over my face. Some amazing gore and action sequences, but there is not one thing in this film that was not in the first one. We were looking fwd to this since 2006 when the 1st film came out and we saw it in the theater maybe 5 times. I knew it was a done deal when it went straight to DVD. I knew not to expect too much, but even still, I am very disappointed in this film. I can only hope Neil Marshall returns to helm the 3rd one and save the whole thing from certain death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have fixed the first movie, but . . ..","review":"I don't care what they said in \\"Scream,\\" I want a REASON for a villain to do something.

This might have worked better as a stand-alone film with different characters (or not) but The Descent 2 is light years away from the well-crafted first film. There was no tension, the characters do stupid things, and the monster design changed for the worse. The second film is supposed to take place 2 days later, so why would the Crawlers look different? Yeesh.If you like cave creepy-crawly movies this might work for you, but I felt like I wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trip back.","review":"Some remakes are great. This is not one of them.Aside from one surprise, the movie is pretty predictable and slow moving. It misses the storyline and character development of the first which made that movie all the more powerful. The sequel appeared to have been made because the first was so successful. Should have left what was dormant in the cave alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it!","review":"So, did you like the original Descent? Well, just imagine a less good version of that, and you've saved yourself an hour and a half! Adding more blood does not make a movie more tension-filled movie. Sorry, try again. Actually, DON'T! The Descent was a great horror movie with a damn good satisfying horror movie ending. The fact that Sarah never escaped the cave and just gave up while seeing visions of her dead daughter was scary! From the beginning of this movie on, it completely takes away from that dreadful conclusion. They just completely dumb it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing much to see here","review":"Some people in a cave with a monster. That's about it with nothing of any interest happening.

I highly recommend you spend your money on something other than this, or it's prequel, \\"Descent\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just watch the original again for about the same effect.","review":"This... was basically the same as the first movie, if the first movie was not very good. If you like watching extended scenes of heads being bashed in and blood splurting out of wounds, you will probably enjoy this film. For me, it passed the line from scary into silly, and while I certainly enjoy a good campy bloodsplatter fest now and again, it seems a shame to do that in a sequel to a film that was so much more than that.Really, if you liked The Descent because there were attractive women covered in blood attacking or being attacked by monsters... go for it! You will like this movie. But if you liked it for being a suspenseful, well done horror flick... skip the sequel and watch the first one again. Because seriously, it's pretty much the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good - until the horrible ending","review":"Despite the negative reviews, I decided to give Descent 2 a try. It is good escapist viewing with plenty of action and surprises. The crawlers are as vicious as in Descent and the blood and gore are increased from the original. I still enjoyed the movie - until the ending. Without going into what happened, it changed my perception of the movie. IMHO it was one of the worst movie endings ever.

The topics that the author discuss are very basic and not really pointing out any key concept. This book is more appropriate with the title such as 'Beginner Guide to PHP'. There are also typos throughtout the entire book. I spent more time correcting the errors in the code sample than graspping the concept itself.

But, otherwise, great concert pics for Iced Earth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Night of The Stormrider!!!","review":"This is my second Iced Earth album I bought, the first being Something Wicked Comes This Way, and I think this one is the better of the two. Although I like Matthew Barlows singing a lot, the vocalist on this C.D. is more entertaining to listen to. He goes from a clean voice, to a halford-like voice, to screaming, and sometimes even a death-metalish voice. He puts a lot of energy into the singing. As for the guitars, Jon Schaffer plays the riffs a lot faster than he does on the Something Wicked... album. A lot of the riff have the classic Maiden gallop in them, which makes it fun to listen to. Enough talking go buy the CD Already!Other Cd's that are similar:Judas Priest - PainkillerIron Maiden - Piece of MindMetallica - Master of Puppets"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here it goes again","review":"Yeah I knew, everyone has said it already but I'm at the computer and bored so I will say it to. This album is the pinnacle of early Iced Earth, I think there's a big difference between pre Dark Saga and post Dark Saga Iced Earth, but neither of those two periods are better or worse. Because of this I would have to say this and Something Wicked This Way Comes are tied for two greatest Iced Earth albums (although I'm looking forward to The Glorious Burden, Tim Owens is the man). Night of the Stormrider is an epic thrash-concept Metal album with some inspired writing and musicianship from all members of the band.

Lots of great songs, and of course, the NIGHT songs! Stormrider, Pure Evil, Desert Rain, and Travel In Stygian. All of them mention NIGHT. Jon Schaffer's riffs are grat, and John's singing is really good (I really love the scream in \\"Mystical End\\"). The only song that i can't stand is \\"Mystical End.\\" It takes place in the day.

This is just barely a Dortmunder book. Dortmunder is in it, but not much. If you know the Dortmunder gang, you might find some humor in the first half of the book. Otherwise, there are way too many new characters to make it interesting. When I finished the book, I felt cheated. My guess is that a young editor didn't feel confident enough to say to the money-making author: This is at best a first draft of the first two-thirds of a Dortmunder story that needs more Dortmunder."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Downward Road","review":"John Dortmunder's stock in trade is coming up with dazzlingly brilliant robbery schemes which then proceed to fall apart for completely unexpected (and usually very funny) reasons. In \\"The Road To Ruin\\", unfortunately, Dortmunder's plan isn't all that brilliant, and the way it falls apart isn't all that unexpected.Author Donald Westlake is still a consummate pro, however, so even in a subpar outing like this there are at least some good laughs scattered throughout. But if you're thinking of making this your introduction to the Dortmunder gang, please reconsider. Almost any other book in this series will do a better job of getting you hooked, except maybe \\"What's The Worst That Could Happen?\\" -- a great read, but funnier if you already know Dortmunder's case history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow","review":"I couldn't get into this one.

While it is not as outlandishly physical as stealing a cherry picker and dashing through London with Dortmunder in the bucket, (Nobody's Perfect,) it is extraordinary social satire. As a premise, the rich white-collar criminal who can't pay enough to keep servants opens the door for comic gold. Gangleader Dortmunder, a career criminal who looks like a disappointed bloodhound, has very little promise as a butler.Westlake is a master at weaving a plot from three capers getting in each other's way.

I use it as an excellent witnessing tool along with Bruce Marchiano's \\"Jesus Wept.\\" Against other reviews, I went ahead and purchased The Encounter: Paradise Lost. I stand in agreement with several other reviewers in that it is unbiblical to commit suicide and be Heaven bound. It's unscriptural. Once saved always saved is also false doctrine. Woe to those who preach false doctrines as you will have to answer God on the Day of Judgement. If they truly are in the process of making a third \\"Encounter\\" movie, I truly hope that they make it as successful and biblically accurate as the original. I won't be recommending this one to anyone and I am highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but they have one issue that ruins it.","review":"i liked the first and thought i would love the second one. however there is one part which is a very small part of the movie, a single moment really that ruins the movie. one of the characters sister who died from drug overdose. he said she is in heaven wih jesus because when she was a little girl she accepted jesus. i cant stand the false teaching that once saved always saved. its wrong and is opposite of what the bible says. the bible does not support the false once saved always saved lie. in fact there are tons of parts that proove the exact oposite. i am very disappinted that they would teach this. if it wasnt for this one isntance i would have given 4 or even 5, but it deserves a 1 for teaching false teachings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please, More Encounter","review":"I own the first Encounter movie and I was looking forward to Encounter Paradise Lost. I was not disappointed. I think it was uplifting like the first one that answers the question WHY? It is amazing that people would meet Jesus and not accept Him, but I quess it happens all the time,what a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From This Movie","review":"Wow, I was highly disappointed with the Encounter 2. The pureness, simplicity, and intricate character development of the first film are missing here. Instead we have a pseudo-Christian film that wants so badly to be a secular Hollywood action thriller instead of a movie glorifying Christ. Why do we need such senseless violence and gun play in a Christian film? A girl overdoses on heroin but she still goes to heaven because she gave her life to Christ when she was fourteen? Huh, does that make any sense?? I left the first film feeling encouraged and uplifted. After watching this movie I wanted to repent. Don't waste your time on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book & interesting reading","review":"Great book (series) that brings the Book Of Revelation closer to comprehension in everyday terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 star lemmings, crimeny!","review":"My kindergartener has a better grasp of the revealed word of God and definitely has shown flashes of better writing than the authors of Left Behind. All of these 5 star ratings make me ashamed to be a Christian. Why? Because the book is a lousy piece of fiction. I can only assume the high ratings are the result of the lemming behavior typical of the brainwashed victims of fundamentalist cultdom. Life is short - don't waste any of it on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a silly book...","review":"I am sorry I wasted my time with it...I should have \\"left it behind.\\" If the characters and plot line became any thinner the book would disappear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been left behind","review":"As a believer, I am embarrassed and concerned by this series. The heavy-handed preaching lacks charity, wisdom and literary craftsmanship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Revelation of Jesus Christ instead","review":"This book is disturbing--not because it describes the judgment of God, but because the prophecies of the book of Revelation are used in such a secular, sensationalist manner. It makes my soul recoil to see the holy Word of God presented as \\"religion lite\\" or mere entertainment.In the Bible, God is pretty clear that his word is not meant to be added to or subtracted from. I am certain this also means that God's Word is not meant to be dressed up or watered down and made into pretty, palatable fiction.Reading Revelation is really scary, especially if you have friends or family who are not believers. Even as a Christian, Reading about God's wrath and judgment of the human race makes me want to hide like a cockroach. But Christians and non-believers would be much better off to read Revelation than \\"Left Behind.\\" If reading Revelation doesn't get you on your feet, witnessing to EVERYONE about Christ, nothing will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and Dogmatic","review":"Why do people read this trash? It's very negative and dogmatic! Reading about end of times is very negative. Instead why don't you people read about peace, love and prosperity? If you want to buy a book that will enlighten you....GO read Deepak Chopras' books! THis book will only depress you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"Search on Tim LaHaye and you will find dozens of web pages that examine how his theology is shaky. Now combine that with Jerry B. Jenkins who writes on a third grade (if that) level. Judy Blume develops toddlers better than this man develops full grown men and women. The book is all exposition that barely has a purpose. The double stories are carefully wrapped around each other so the more interesting sub plot of a newspaper reporters search for the truth behind millions of disappearances forces you to read the torturous tale of an airline pilot who finds God and Jesus and must convert the world like a one man army of Hare Krishnas. If this first in a series is any example, all the books can be condensed to a novella."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This series of books are VERY poorly written. They are wannabe authors that want to squeeze out every dime they can by dragging it out for WAY too long. I wish it weren't so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simpson's Episode Says It All","review":"I just watched the new \\"Left Below\\" episode of the Simpson's last night that pretty much says it all. I can't believe the amount of Christians that literally believe that being taken up in the air means they will go flying out of vehicles they are driving, causing them to crash, etc. God, people can be so stupid. Even being beamed aboard a spaceship makes more sense! It's really said that all you pathetic, ignorant people are making these two fundamentalist authors rich. Don't you have better things to spend your money or your time with? Educate yourself instead of willfully dumbing yourself down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The trashy romance novel of religious literature","review":"I have to admit that part of my problem may have been that I had higher hopes for this book. One of my friends did his senior thesis on this series and, seeing that he had written about them in his thesis, I expected this book to be a well written novel; one of those books that really makes you think. I was very wrong. It is interesting enough, but the plot does not move very quickly and it seems as if it is written for someone who does not have a college education. If you are looking for a book to read on the beach during the summer, I recommend this series. It is not very intellectual and you can read it relatively quickly. However, if you are looking for a book to challenge you and really make you think... look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Fluff. Not bad if you want to kill some time, but to take this FICTION as truth telling the end of the world is to ignore billions of years of evidence to the contrary- the world isn't about to end, folks.Jesus' point was to be good to one another, not to run about willy-nilly, feeling superior that you're going to be taken in the Rapture!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky Writing","review":"I figured I'd check this book out just based on its sales (10 million people can't be wrong etc...) However, sadly I found it to be very poorly written and really really cliched. There was never a scene where I didn't feel like I had read it somewhere else before. I was amazed when I saw all the writing credits the co-authors had, considering how poorly written and constructed it was. The dialogue was so bad that I was laughing to myself. However, if you want to learn vaguely about \\"the rapture\\" in a well worn fiction format and haven't seen the omen then have a field day..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting!","review":"One of the best Christian fiction books I have ever read. Don't just stop at this one, either. There are quite a bit more in this series, plus more to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent Christian book to Explain Our Fate","review":"Left Behind was a great book. It was a suspenseful and captivating novel. It's about the end of time when the antichrist will come to rule the Earth and those who trust in Jesus Christ are raptured and sent to be with the Lord. So many people think the raptured ones just disappeared for no reason. A pilot comes hom eto find that his wife and son have disappeared and his daughter hadn't. The only thing for him to do was read about the Bible and he found out that they went to Heaven. His daughter wouldn't believe it. They spend the entire novel searching for God and a news reporter finds his faith and is caught up in the realms of the supposed \\"messiah\\". This is truly an awesome book that you wouldn't want to put down. It inspired me and helped me to know what to expect when the end did come. This was an awesome book."},{"rating":"1","title":"God only gives us \\"one \\"chance!","review":"I was really trying to get into this book but it took me weeks to even read the whole thing. It was entertaining in a way but so misleading for anyone not Bibically sound. God is only giving us this \\"one\\" chance on Earth...not \\"well, you didn't make the first round try again\\".. I'd hate people to get that idea from this book even if it is fictional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christians one-up Scientologists","review":"Have seen all the books at Costco (which says thay they are popular), and hey ... I hate to be \\"left behind\\" as much as the next guy. After all, the only other time I have fell into reading a truely lousy popular book was the L. Ron Hubbard's book \\"Battlefield Earth\\". I was not blindsided by the religious storyline, I knew what I was getting into, but pride myself on being a fan of good writing. Well, this is *not* good writing! You know how sometimes it takes a while to \\"get into\\" a book. Eventually the characters get interesting and you fall into the writers style. It never happens here, it was drugery from beginning to end. If you must read this do yourself a favor and purchase it as cheaply as possible (have seen on used book sites for a buck and a half), but the book is better \\"left behind\\" all together. There seem to be some zealots doing reviews so i'll just stay anonymous."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greatest Story Ever Sold","review":"my parents let me borrow their copy of this book thinking i might like it with my background in christian fundamentalism and my love for science fiction...i couldn't believe how poorly written it was! it reads as if it were written for a 6th grader. this book series is nothing more than a tool for fundamentalist recruitment of children and simpletons and a means for the authors to become rich beyond belief. wwjd? jesus would throw these millionaire \\"christians\\" out of the temple and onto the street and would teach them a thing or two about love, and forgiveness, and sharing. then he'd tell them to read \\"The Christ Conspiracy -- the Greatest Story Ever Sold\\" by Acharya S."},{"rating":"2","title":"After Left Behind, I had to read the other four books.","review":"The 5-books of the \\"Left Behind\\" series are spell- binding. I am looking forward to reading the sixth book, \\"The Assassins\\" due by August 99. The messages are riviting and based on the Bible. As I read, I envisioned actors I would like to see portraying the key characters in the forthcoming movie(s). I read all five books within two weeks and I work full-time. I have recommended the series to others and I am grateful to a very good friend who recommended the series to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rapture is Real","review":"You cannot read this book and not believe in the Rapture. Each character will remind you of yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting premise, decently written thriller","review":"The authors have obviously come upon a good idea and arewriting the heck out of it. A series I liked a bit better, althoughChristian readers might not be as thrilled, was Robert Doherty's AREA 51 series which is rewriting the entire history of mankind inside the format of a tense modern day thriller that weaves together many myths and legends. I highly recommend that series of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Book!!!!","review":"Once I got past the first two chapters I could'nt put it down, it is very Bible acurate, and it makes you think. I hope everyone likes this book as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simplistic for most who need to hear the 'message'.","review":"Arrogance is surely as wrong as lust, greed, and a host of other sins. Yet even before we get to the authors' message, we read [in the dedication] \\"For Alice MacDonald and Bonita Jenkins [the authors'mothers(?)], who ensured we would not be left behind\\". As a born-again Christian, I too hope I won't be left behind, but I have no way of knowing how God views my sins and whether my repentance is real. Only God knows the heart. And only God knows who will, and will not, be left behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have left it on the shelf!","review":"I am not one to quit reading a book, no matter how lousy, but I was tempted. I like apocalyptic fiction. This work made me feel like the time I let one of those guys in the white short sleeve shirts and ties in the house and was verbally pinned to my couch by his proselytizing. I don't like to have religion shoved down my throat in the guise of a promise of a good read. Yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"Left Behind is definitely one of the best books I've read. The characters are developed so well, you'll actually feel bad for Captain Steele and the others when they realize that their families were taken and they were left behind. The book raises alot of personal questions about the rapture and if you will be ready for it or not. I recommend this book to everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will you be left behind?","review":"There has been much speculation about end times, when will the Rapture occur, who is the antichrist and a whole host of other issues. Left Behind is a skillful dramatization of what the end times might be like and what the consequences of the Rapture might be for those that are left behind. One need not be a Christian or even familar with the Book of Revelation to enjoy the book. However, having knowledge of the Bible would help to enhance the reader's experience. I could hardly put the book down and it is very easy to follow. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"lackluster characters and sketchy writting","review":"If you're looking for complex characters, an exciting story and interesting plot development, keep looking because you won't find them in this book. For the life of me, i can't understand all the fuss surounding this book. Left Behind left me disapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Theology, worse writing!","review":"This is all based on Darbyism... a faulty British import theology of the 19th Century.Before Darby, the book of Revelation was understood to be \\"allegory\\", concerning the persecution of early Christians by the Emperor Domitian.Read Barbara Rossing's \\"The Rapture Exposed\\" to discover that the book of Revelation is really a message of HOPE! Our God is a God of Love, not a God of Destruction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Christians only.","review":"Side note: This book was obviously written for Christians only. It portrays non-Christians as ignorant people who are too proud to realize the Bible is right and tries to prove this point by setting the story in a world where biblical prophecies are coming true. Of course if prophecies came true you could believe in it, but not in the real world where the Bible - or any other scripture for that matter - doesn't hold up to critical analysis.As for the book itself, it is mildly interesting and it sets up for some interesting adventures to come, and it is obvious that it was written as a first part in a series, so it doesn't quite stand up as a good book on its own. If it had been a trilogy, I might have thought it interesting enough to read the other two volumes, but this book was definately not good enough for me to want to continue for more than ten more volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punky Doodle","review":"Left Behind: a Novel of Earth's Last Days starts with the occurance of the Rapture, the disappearances of all believers of Christ. A group of left behind people with an unknown relation to each other band together to fight against the Antichrist after learning about why all of these people vanished. Rayford Steele, an airplane pilot, connects with his daughter, Chloe, and his missing wife's pastor, Bruce. He and the group eventually meet Buck, a reporter for a magazine company.

It was very riveting and intriguing.I can see why some people might be disgruntled after reading this book. If I thought that I might be a candidate for being \\"left behind\\" I probably would be disgruntled too. But who are we (finite beings that we are) to tell an infinite God who He can chose and who He can't chose!The book was very well written. In my opinion, it was not disjointed at all. Sure there were a number of plots that were being woven together to make an integrated whole. That just made it all the more interesting and hard to put down. If a reader is only capable of following one plot at a time, then maybe they should stick to reading comic books."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book ever","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read! The lack of proper grammar, the poorly formed and ridiculous plot line and horribly constructed characters . . . This is one of the worst books ever and I barely made it past the first 100 pages. Not even worth the $0.00 it costs. Worst book ever, EVER!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the entire series!","review":"This book is the type of book that if you aren't a Christian when you start reading, you want to become one before you finish it. Have read the entire series in hardback. Anxious to re-read it on my kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur writing ruins an interesting premise.","review":"Interesting premise. No character development, or at most character development from one cardboard figure into another. Wimpy conclusion. Condescending tone.After what happens to Israel before the events of this book occur, I can't imagine the Rapture being necessary. After that, it just got worse.Nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its perfect timing.","review":"great wake-up call for all Christians.

Being raised as a Catholic, I recognized much of the theology this book was offering. I thought it was paced appropriately. I related to Buck Williams, the writer and skeptic, and was more swept away with his story than any of the other characters.Rayford Steele's transformation came far too fast for me, considering he had such a harsh illusion of his wife's faith. I did like the premise, and am interested to see where these characters go in future books. It was a good start, enough for me to buy the second in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a hardcover","review":"The book was suppose to be a hardcover, it was a paperback book.

I usually thought about this happening in the future. Yet, there are so many indications that Christ's return may not be as far away as we think. Thank you to the authors who helped bring the urgency of these end times to life. I have been changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wake-up call for the whole world!","review":"For Christians, who have the \\"blessed hope\\" of the Rapture, this book is entertaining and thought-provoking reading. It is one of our joys to imagine what our face-to-face meeting with our Lord in the air will be like. However, we mustn't forget the horrors that will be suffered by those 'left behind.' This book is a modern look at how some of the Bible's prophecies MIGHT come to fruition. And it should spur us on to greater evangelism so that no one will be left behind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One word....Phenomenal","review":"This book gripped me from page one and kept me until the end.

This is a must read for Christian and non-Christian alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating view of the lives of those \\"Left Behind\\".","review":"This book will leave you hanging in the end, so be sure to get the sequel, \\"Tribulation Force\\". \\"Left Behind\\" is easy reading, and has interresting twists that make it a hard one to put down.

Who would have thought to write an EOW book based on the biblical rapture? What a cool idea.I liked this book and fully intend to check out the other 8 books in the series. What a cool idea for an apocalyptic book. Even if you're not big on the Christian scene, it's still a neat EOW book. This book reminded me a lot of The Stand (although it is totally original in it's theme.) I also liked Earth the New Frontier which was another new EOW story out there.Read this book if you get a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting story and helps to understand Revelations.","review":"I loved this book! I am now on #4 of the series. It is such an interesting story. Not do you only learn a lot about the Rapture, Tribulation and Christ's return, but you get involved with the characters' lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very gripping. Hard to put down. A+ authors!","review":"The beginning, unlike some books, sets the stage for the story and you don't want to put it down. It demonstrates people's unbelief and horror of missing the Rapture of the Church. The characters represent the lives of people today: out for themselves, to worried about making money, etc. The book also is full of scripture references and shows how biblical prophecy could very well be fullfilled in the earth's last days. From the Anti-christ rising to power, to the two witnesses raising up the 144,000 jews, and the courage of new christians, this book scores a 10 with me. All christians who read this book and the rest of the series will be thankful they don't have to go through the Tribulation and will want to make sure that their friends and family won't have to either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly spine tingling","review":"I heard so much about this novel, maybe my expectations were too high. In all fairness, I just didn't find the writing of very high caliber, nor the characters, nor the overall development of the story and plot. Anyone who wants to experience a truly harrowing, credible account of Judgment Day ought to read THE LAST DAY, which is the finest such portrayal of The Last Days anyone has yet come up with. If you want to feel what it's like to be in the real presence of Divinity, this frightening but uplifting novel truly delivers the emotional charge that LEFT BEHIND simply doesn't. Unless I hear that this series gets better as it goes, I'm stopping here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"If you wish to solidify your negative religious teachings about a vengeful, punishing god who inflicts cruel and unusual punishment on his children by all means read all of these books.If you have had enough of this, I would recommend the books Conversations With God and An Encounter With A Prophet, books designed to get rid of these primitive concepts of god and introduce you to God's unconditional love for his children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than awful.","review":"A book for only the fanatical, non-thinking, mystic. Sadly, Tim LaHaye's writing is almost as bad as his theology so it isn't even an entertaining read. It's scary that there are people out there who relate this hype to biblical truth. Don't buy it, don't buy it, don't buy it. In fact, don't even check it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corrupted with Evaneglizing","review":"This book sparked my curiosity when I found it by happenstance on Amazon. I have always been interested in apocalyptic tales, and this novel seemed to be a perfect fit, thats until I began to read it. This book is just an outlet for Born-Again Christians to convert those who havent found the 'light'. Although I am Christian, I found this book overbearing and preachy, attempting to show those lost heathens what will occur once the Rapture occurs. The book only focused on the turmoil caused by the Rapture for about two seconds, then it seemed life began to be normal again, which I felt was absurd. The characters are interesting though, and I would have continued with the series if the authors hadn't spent so much time preaching to me. If you want to read a briliant apocalyptic tale that has Christian themes but does not force them down your throat, read Stephen King's The Stand, a true masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even more wonderfully bad than I expected!","review":"Unbearably stupid and worthless as fiction. There is no description of anything, and this Antichrist person is constantly described as 'eloquent' instead of shown to be eloquent through his dialogue. The worldview of the authors and their fans is morally repulsive, shockingly ignorant and lacking in any kind of humanity or humility. If you have half a brain and enjoy being made sick by the stupidity of people who are little more than apes, read this book immediately. You will be squirming on your couch in teary-eyed hysterics."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"charismatic but lacking in fundamentals\\"","review":"After reading the first 1/3, I thought it was charismatic but lacking in fundamentals.

This book reeks!","review":"Mr. LaHaye must have been sick the day they taught writing atwriter's school. His characters are thin, and his prose reads likeassembly instructions for a grill.

This work of fiction explains some of what is in the Bible concerning end times.The characters came alive throughout the pages.I was drawn into the pages by the creative skills of theauthor(s).The thought of everyone vanishing in the Rapture and being left behind is a nightmare. I think the writer(s) did a great job of painting a picture of what it would be like if that were to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Series","review":"With the exception of the second book, \\"Tribulation Force\\", these have been non-stop reading for me. I have enjoyed them tremendously. First of all, let me say, that I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ. So, you know where I stand as far as my faith in Jesus Christ. I enjoy the way the authors placed fictional characters with End Times Prophecy. Whether you want to believe these events will take place, or the authors took artistic liberties with the bible, these books are well written and page-turners."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Light of Further Review","review":"When the war drums were beating relative to the absurd American Iraq adventure, I started reading widely in the attempt to understand why the United States government felt compelled to become embroiled in this quagmire. This research led me to understand the insidious dispensationalist rapture cult theology, of which this series is a major part. It is led by folks who worship an end times fantasy that is ahistorical, anti-Scriptural, and without foundation. This mental contagion needs to be exposed for what it is. The \\"Left Behind\\" series is not an innocuous cartoon character rendering of Bible prophesy. It is rather a part of a much more sinister political strategy, which is manifested in the aforementioned, unprovoked Iraq invasion, and which could indeed culminate in World War III. It is critically important that this program is exposed for what it is such that we can know justice and love mercy while yet there is time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I have never been too religious and was at first uncertain about this book but once i started i couldn't stop and highly recommend this to any one who enjoys a good book"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend...and I cannot THANK her enough!

If you are looking for a spiritual book, try Herman Hesse's \\"Siddhartha\\", a book that shows that true spiritual understanding comes from no organized religion but from inner experiences. As for this, while I think that the attempt to push a Christian book into the public eye noble, the aproach is less than exemplary. This book should be left behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is poorly written","review":"I am a christian and I was prepared to cut this book some slack because I believe in the message, but I found it too pourly written to refer this book.

So I wanted to see if it was really as awful as he said. I shelled out a buck for a used copy and flipped through it. IT WAS TERRIBLE! Bad writing, laughable plot, stock characters... this baby's like a primer on How Not To Write.And the rest of the novels, and related spin-off series, seem like a decidedly un-Christian plot to cash in on millenialist hysteria. Though I'm biased, because I am in fact Jewish, I would recommend \\"Murder in the Mikdash\\" as overall a better portrayal of the Messanaic Era (if you must read such stuff)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, awful, writing","review":"A great idea for a novel, ruined by the most leaden writing.

The characters are very shallowly developed. Little description to what's going on around the characters, and the description that IS provided is poor. Too much bad dialogue, it's like reading a George Lucas script.

As the plot thickens, they are facing trials, ones that are a matter of life or death, such as being decieved by the Anti-christ. I recommend this book to the reader who enjoys inspiration titles. But, to the ones who don't, they may get bored. This book was very well written, with great personalities, such as Hattie Durham and Nicloae Carpathia. Tim Lahaye and Jerry B.

God willed it . . . and all the good people went to heaven but the bad people -- who seem perfectly good in most cases, except that one who had lust in his heart for a flight attendant -- were left behind. And wait -- I'm wrong! They *weren't* bad people, they just weren't *born again!*This is doubtless a very fine book for people who are born again, and eager to be reaffirmed in their faith that they are the chosen people, destined for an eternity of bliss.For evertone else: save your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the beginning of a great series!","review":"I love this book.

If you're a reader, than this book will burn your brain through its sheer badness. Diction, character development, plot...awful, awful, awful.If you're into it for the theology, you should know that the \\"pre-trib\\" Rapture scenario is a modern myth devised by a schismatic Fundamentalist sect in the early 1900s, and is completely foreign to historical Baptist, Reformed, and other Christian traditions.

Not only is the writing extremely simple and the descriptions of characters and environment anorexic, these books lack reality.

I was drawn to this book because of the quality of other endtimes novels, mainly We All Fall Down and The Christ Clone Trilogy, but there really is no similarity between those novels and Left Behind except Revelations. We All Fall Down is full of brilliant insights and fabulous writing Christ Clone is analytically impresive. Both authors made me look at both myself and the Bible in new light. Left Behind is poorly written and doesn't have anything new to say. The only thing interesting about this book is the subject matter, and the author's can't even claim that. If I were you, I'd avoid these books and stick to some of the other novels that tackle the subject with intellegence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please. What trash.","review":"An overwrought misinterpretation of the bible, suitable for those whose intellectual hunger stopped with \\"Mad Magazine\\".Overwritten in a breathlessly junior-high school voice, Tim Lahaye proves that what he lacks in knowledge of an all-loving God, he more than makes up for in his lack of a compassion for humanity - the children of God.I wouldn't allow my children to read this. Not because it's frightening, or because it's so shabbily written - but because it postulates a relationship with God that is vehemently anti-christian, anti-jew and just plainly wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judgment Day lite--","review":"If this is what's passing for a good read these days, we're all in serious trouble. Slow, dull, BADLY written, cliche-riddled, uninspired, draaaaagged out. Why does anyone waste time on such lightweight efforts when there are really excellent Judgment Day novels out there? If you haven't read Kleier's THE LAST DAY, you haven't read the best endtimes novel. It's a jewel. Also, King's THE STAND, while maybe not as much fun as LAST DAY, is still one of King's best works. Jenkins and Lehaye aren't in the same league."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Behind #1","review":"The series of books seems to have been written only to take advantage of the year 2000 hysteria.

It's only value is as a document of religious pathology, a book which derives from, and panders to, the most ignorant and fanatical brand of so-called \\"Christianity.\\" It is a product of a twisted subculture which is ignorant of Christian history and impervious to the real teachings of Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"AIN'T HINDSIGHT GREAT?","review":"This book is the only one in the series that comes ANYWHERE close to being a good read. For me, there was something oddly addictive about it, and even though I knew it was pretty bad writing I'm embarrassed to admit I let LEFT BEHIND #1 hook me into buying several of its sequels--- each of which became progressively lamer. Jenkins's writing skills(?) are really pretty bad, and the way they've ended each book with a \\"cliff-hanger\\" to lure the reader into buying the next has seemed more and more cynical and calculated. As a Christian, it's pretty scary to me the way so many people seem to be forgetting that these books are fiction and are taking them as a literal picture of the near future. If you want a good, well-written perspective on the way good and evil battle for men's souls, read THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS by C.S. LEWIS.

It is suspenseful and entertaining. I started reading and I did not want to stop. And when I did stop, I was looking forward to pick up where I left off. I did disagree with some small details of Bible prophecy, but it did not take away from the story. I gave this book to a friend who is a non-christian and he completely enjoyed the book also.

I agree it is not the best written novel out there, but it will do.Granted, I thought it was a little too far fetched, what with the moving of the U.N. to Babylon, and the one currency being pondered over, for as much as it was.But is it fiction, and that means you should try to suspend disbelief. I am actually very eager to see how this will turn out, I won't flock to the stores for the next installments.

I read this because a friend of mine is an ex-fundie and she still reads the series as a 'guilty pleasure'. It's such horrible drek, it's hard to even comprehend.The authors seem to have done little research beyond reading the bible, anything vaguely scientific is usually a little off. (I don't think I'd call Ethiopia as the middle-east, either - Libya? Maybe - but that's more North Africa). I stopped taking notes on annoyances after the first chapter. I'm surprised I didn't stop reading it totally. I guess, it's just like a literary car wreck, and I just can't stop looking.In all fairness, the Bible itself suffers from a weak narrative and lack of character development in many areas, so who's to blame the authors.

It is somewhat of a good idea, but this book was not written for an intellegent audience. Someone had to write a new inspirational book for our generation, seeing as how nothing overly relgious had been popular lately, but the fact that this book is religious is possibly the only reason it is so popular. Aside from the simply sentence structure and the vocabulary based at the 8th grade level, this book jumped around far too much to keep a decent plot at all.

Althought fiction, the \\"take away\\" message from Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim F. LaHaye is simply the gospel. They present a number of opportunities for the non-beliver to take a closer look at Biblical prophecy. Of course they present Christianity as the only true religion! That is what the authors believe(in response to another review). Their combination of fiction and Biblical prophecy is truly astounding.

I thought it was so stupid and corny! Readers can't take this stuff serious. To claim that this is \\"biblically based\\" is ludicrous. It is sheer speculation, and only represents one interpretation of Christian eschatology. Don't waste your time. If you want to learn about end-times prophecy, just read the Bible. If you want a riveting, action-packed thriller, stick with Tom Clancy or Stephen King. It's shameful that these two authors have to profit financially from the Bible, cloaking themselves in the terms of \\"ministering\\" when in reality they are merely exploiting the Bible as a source of entertainment.

Where is the mass hysteria that's certain to rise in such situations?The card-board characters are so poorly portrayed that the reader cannot sympathize with them even at the scenes designed to be tear-jerkers.Don't bother with this book, but if you're interested in the theme of \\"end of world\\", then don't miss Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\", which will leave behind \\"Left Behind\\" by a light year."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a zero if I could......","review":"Don't read this out of some misguided notion that it's the Christian thing to do.

There are Harlequins out there with better plot and character development, and the writing is on an elementary school level.

Basically, it plays of ignorant peoples fears of a biblical \\"end of times\\" scenario, where all the evil unbelievers are \\"left behind\\" to suffer god's wrath (you know, because he loves us!). Anyhow, it is written at about a 4th grade level and has the substance of a Hardy Boys adventure. (Actually, that's unfair to the Hardy Boys.) Anyhow, hundreds of years from now anthropologists will dig up one of these books thus hypothesizing that the 20th Century was a time of widespread imbecility and ignorance, a time when knuckle-draggers took up far to much space and breathed in far too much valuable air.

What a fantastic find! I am impressed with the ease that this books reads at and with the superb character job done by the writers. Tackling something as complex as the Rapture is a difficult challenge and I feel the writers have done so eloquently. They have done so in a way which is entirely believable. I have never been much of a reader of Christian material and I look forward enthusiastically to reading the other novels in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Behind","review":"I got this book for Christmas and was won over at once.

I knew when Walsch stated that you may have to leave your church to find God that someone would rise up and create a eternal threat to resurrect fear-based religion. \\"Religion \\" never had any other way but fear to keep its churches and bank accounts full.

It is horrid and I only read this cause somebody gave it to me. on its own it is utter crap. The only reason people read these is because it involves god and a silly notion of the future.

The dialogue is inane, the characters not realistic, and the plot unbelievable. For instance, one character lives in a trailer park and usually her parents get drunk and rowdy on the Friday night dances. One Friday, a preacher comes and says a few words before the music, and Vicki's father is on his knees with tears streaming down his face, ready to accept Jesus into his heart. I'm insulted by the high-handed writing in this book to try to convert the sinners of the world...before it's too late. Well, it's too late to get my time back from reading this book, but it's not too late for you shoppers. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad writing","review":"I've always been interested in books and movies that focus on Revelations (easily the most over interpreted book in the Bible). I had high hopes for this one, but it was a letdown. The fact that it is featured prominently in Christian bookstores should be a big indicator that the authors have an axe to grind, and they do so with very limited ability at writing compelling fiction. The characters are stilted and unbelievable - you develop not the slightest empathy for them. The dialogue is just as bad. The book caters to those who believe in Revelation literally rather than as a possible allegory. They should love this book - I did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable!","review":"Left Behind (book#1) by Tim F. LaHaye is a story that follows the lives of several characters that in the blink of an eye.....their lives changed. In an instant, millions of people around the world disappeared off the face of the earth. As you can imagine, this makes for a very interesting storyline. As they excitement builds in the storyline, Tim LaHaye has cleverly woven in the signs that are actually in the bible that some say are there to warn us of events to come. The part I liked the most about the book is that when ever it would make religious references they would be easy to understand what exactly they mean and it's really interesting to see how the character relates it to his own situation in such a real and possible way. It's really easy to imagine yourself in the same positions that they are in.This is a great book for both Christains and non-Christains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting, inspirational, thought provoking","review":"This book brings into focus how the book of Revelations fits modern times.

This book will change your outlook on your personal life, your beliefs, beliefs of your loved ones, and will create an acute awareness of how our present world may be headed this way. It may startle you, but it is an intriguing book, \\"moving fiction\\" is how it's catagorized, and it is.

However, the plot is shallow, the characters flat, and the writing is stilted and boring.

Pilot Rayford Steele and reporter Buck Williams are left behind after the Rapture of the church. As they search for their family and friends, they are confronted with the truth about the mysterious disapperances. Meanwhile, Nicolae Carpathia rises to power to eventually take over the world. The writing wasn't the best and the theology was questionable, but the story was a fun read. I couldn't put it down the first time, and even the second time it was pretty good.

Perhaps they were preaching to the choir but it left behind those of us who are unfamiliar with or disagree with their concept of the end times. Aside from 2 or 3 actual scripture references or allusions we simply have to take their word for it. They had plenty of opportunity even in a novel to let the Bible speak for itself without slowing down their plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not Christian, but I'm hooked on the series!","review":"This is such a good series! i can't wait to find out what happens! i'm almost done with the second one, and its as good as ever.

THe idea of a event like described in this book is just incredible. The book it self is very well written. The characters are described very well and you have a sense as if you know them, but alas thats why i only gave the book 4 stars instead of 5. It just seems the main characters are just too good.

As for me, I had to force myself to keep reading because it was too late to do a report on another book. I(being a Christian for almost 9 years now, with my basic bible knowledge plus) think the author has left a few important things out. No trumpet, nothing to make us want to read the other books in the series, and the author strays off the subject a little too often to name a few things that the author did. Some of the plot is too easily predicted, but personally, this book doesn't come close to satisfying me. Keep in mind though that this is my opinion and you may completely disagree with me and love this book.END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost good enough for the juevenile category.","review":"Biblical prophecy is a fascinating and controversial topic. There is nothing more exciting to the believer than speculation about the endtimes and the advent of Christ's return. And that is the only reason I can think of that explains the success of the Left Behind Series. If you are a fan of great literature, be prepared to be disappointed with the weak characterization, corny dialogue, and juevenile sentence structure. If you are a student of eschatology, be prepared to be disappointed in the total lack of scriptural backing. If you just love to read an interesting story, are able to overlook any intellectual aversions, and don't mind the fact that the conclusion of the series with book 12 is only \\"speculated\\", you might enjoy this.

The characters are one-demensional, the plot was predictible, the dialogue is bad, and the interior monologues are worse (By the end of the book i was ready to feed it to the paper shredder if one more character experienced a sudden urge to convert to christianity for no apparent reason.).As theology it was only slightly (very slightly) better. It was simplistic and way, way out to the right. If you want decent theological insight, read something by CS Lewis (the perelandra trilogy or the screwtape letters)."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"high literature\\" for fifth grade readers","review":"I read Left Behind to get a better understanding of what a politically powerful group of Americans is reading. It was a quick easy read. Without being too cynical, it was written with a depth and simple style that undoubtedly appeals to the target audience of fundamentalist Christians who want their belief in the Rapture validated. I am sure it is considered \\"high literature\\" by those who like to read fifth grade fiction. I would characterize it as biblical plagiarism by financially opportunistic writers with minimal writing skill.Don't waste your time or money on this book. It is an insult to serious readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christians beware","review":"As a Christian I decided that a Christian theme book would be an interesting read. However, I've been greatly disappointed in the entire series. I've gotten to Nicolae, and can't get through it. Most disturbing I've found subtly woven attacks on Catholics and a direct attack on the nature of the main Jewish character introduced early in the book. When the Jewish man tries to convince the reporter to pay for his time, his cabfare, etc....come on.....why doesn't the book just be racist and call him a \\"cheap Jew?\\" I'm not Jewish and I found this highly disturbing. Beware true Christians. Christian's don't weave hatred for others into their lives or their writings. Besides, do you think God would be happy having two authors write a book based on Revelations, where the Anti-Christ is patterned after Dracula, and is dating a flight attendant? Give me a break. Everyone, back to your faith!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Antisemitic, poorly written claptrap","review":"Aw jeez, if I could give this thing minus 50 stars I would. It had to be published by an obscure Christian publishing house because no reputable publisher would abide all the antisemitic digs the authors make. For example, there's going to be one world religion and a character states that it'll be hard to \\"get that past the Jews.\\" As if the hundreds of millions of Moslems, Buddhists and Hindus would just go along with it...? And Israel is the largest producing country in the world? Oh, that's rich. Israel is the size of Massachusetts, it has one major airport, one deep sea port, just a few hundred miles of railroad track and a population of 6 million, but it has surpassed the US, Russia and Brazil as a major agricultural producer?

I finished the whole series in less than three weeks, and have recommended it to everyone I know. Yes, it is based on the book of Revelation, and yes, it's considered Christian literature. The beauty of the Left Behind series is its simplicity. Some mentioned that the writing was far too simplistic... I have a college education, have been extremely successful in my life, yet I still enjoy reading books that are down to earth... The series speaks to the heart, for those who are willing to hear it.

I didn't find the initial characterization part particularly interesting, and Chloe's reluctance to accept Christ dragged on too long.On the positive side the pace picks up and it's an exciting, fun ride! I thought the Nicolae character is quite nicely constructed. Everything about him seemed so \\"good\\"! The idea of the series going on for 12 volumes seems a bit excessive, I bet they will have run out of steam by the 5th or 6th book. The Lord of he Rings only spanned 3 books, C.S.

IT IS A \\"MUST READ\\" FOR EVERYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, honestly","review":"I'm not even sure how to categorize this book. It purports to be fiction, but clearly takes itself a good deal more seriously than that. I suppose the genre it most closely fits into would be sci-fi. Taking it as sci- fi then, let me say the story bored me, the characterizations are weak, and the writing mediocre at best.For those who don't think the story is sci-fi but some sort of End of Days prophecy...well, who knows. Just about anything could be true, I suppose, including a nasty God. I can only say: Please don't doom me to an eternity spent with the characters in this book; I'd much rather just go quietly into that good night.I give the book one star only because it took some effort to type, I guess.

So God will suddenly take people, good and decent people, letting autos go wild, planes suddenly crash, an arbitrary age for taking children, killing more people with the results? All because some people think a certain way???No, God will not do that. This reduces God to the level of a 2 year old who is throwing a tantrum because someone doesn't think a certain way.

It appalls me to think that such simplistic and unimaginative writing could suck so many people in. While I am among those \\"seeking more answers\\" to the life of my soul, this book is only an example of literary effort at its worst, not to mention the religious bigotry. Just another commercial example of those who consider themselves \\"Saved\\" and use a book like this to besmerch every other religion on the face of this earth.

It is also a great reminder of our responsibility is before Jesus comes again. I know I don't want to be here for all that will occure after the rapture.

A good author manages to evoke senses and emotions experienced by the characters; lazy writing explicates storyline without involving the reader on whit. Such is the sorry endeavor of \\"Left Behind\\".The action packed end-times struggle covered in the subsequent 17 (!) books may be quick summer reads, but any comparison to Tom Clancy is out of line.This is vapid, cardboard Leave-it-to-Beaver drama that doesn't cut it.

I love the idea of getting a glimpse of one possible end of the world. But who came up with these characters? No one in these books behaves like a real person at all. Do the authors really think that if millions of people disappeared into thin air that the rest of the world would go on business as usual; continuing to work, travel, and maintain order? I beg to differ. There would be looting, suicides, chaos, distruction and pandemonium everywhere. For me, the books are just too unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"This book does a great job of putting things into perspective. For many it is hard to imagine the magnitude of Christ's second coming. But LaHaye & Jenkins seem to put everything into a clear view. You can almost imagine the event taking place. It is as if you are there personally, experiencing everything first hand. It is scripturally sound with what is written in the books of Revalation & Daniel. I strongly encourage any and all Christians to read this book.

On the one hand there are descriptions of how, with the disappearances of millions of people, there is social chaos with looting and blocked traffic. On the other hand a character is flying all over the world with no problem. It seems as if the two authors wrote their own sections and never successfully integrated them into a coherent story.

I don't think this would have been published if not for the religious angle. I think the the concept for the series (explaining Revelations) was a great idea, I only wish the books had been written by someone who could write. There is no character development, and the story is almost entirely conveyed through dialogue.

At the very least, some interesting perspectives (a native american's, a demon's, a dog's...). Wrong on both counts.This is just regurgitation of the apocolypse prophecied by the Christianity.

The writing is insipid, the constant preaching is tiresome, and the characters don't even begin to be believable. The other annoying thing is their trick of printing the book with huge margins, ultra-wide spacing, and large print. This was obviously just a trick to stretch 200 pages into 500.

Sandwiched between a mildly interesting premise in the start of the book and some action (Finally!) in the last chapter, are page after page of torpid brain death. It's easy to see, however, that this book would hold fervent appeal to the unimaginative types who blindly follow rapture doctrine.

It's funny that folks who espouse the Rapture and attendant details as expressed in these books style themselves as \\"biblical fundamentalists\\" who take the Scriptures literally.

Use the reason God gave you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning Warning Warning Warning Warning Warning","review":"I purchased this book solely based on the overwhelming 5 star ratings...I love a good work of fiction on those long airplane rides...Little did I suspect that this support comes from people who REALLY believe that this work is a probable non fiction outcome of the teachings/prophesies of the Bible.

It is a great introduction to the book of Revelation and what the End time may look like, on a personal level.

It was given to me as a joke. I started reading it one night and could not put it down until I was finished. It really opened my eyes to the spritual life that is possible. It was an amazing journey into fiction with christian belief at the heart. Great book for our times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The series is addicting!","review":"The reason this and all the other books were addicting is because the genre is interesting, and it was neat to see all of the prophesies come to life.

To some it may be scary because they don't know for sure where they're going. But every body needs to know where they will spend eternity.

I'm glad I didn't buy the book - picked it up at the library out of curiousity.If you are into poorly developed cardboard characters; breathless, wooden prose, and a silly plot - this book is for you. If not, regardless of your religious affiliation, you will hate it. Trust me.By the way, for you non-religious, non-christian folks out there: there are lot of religious folks - even Christians - who don't go in for the \\"end of the world\\" literal reading of the biblical Book of Revelation. (I am a non-religious non-christian myself but modern American evangelicalism is sort of a hobby of mine, so I know where Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins are coming from.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, poor execution","review":"Bad writing, good story. I think the authors were trying to follow the popularity of science fiction series that leave you dangling at the end of a book, thereby forcing you to buy the next in the series. Unfortunately, the writing isn't nearly as good as the early Robert Jordan, or Christian author C.S. Lewis. (Who didn't read the Narnia series as a child?) Too bad, because this was a great concept wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm writing about a less than solid Biblical view","review":"Christians, read your Bible. If you haven't read your Bible all the way through use the time you would have spent reading this series to catch up on Scripture reading. Let Scripture dictate your doctrine.The foundation of this entire series - the rapture - is a doctrine based on about three less-than-explicit verses. There is a lot more basis for other end-times beliefs.Non-Christians, I recomend you read something else if this would be your introduction to Christian beliefs. The writing just isn't that good, and the story is not representative of all Christian thought.I really feel uncomfortable \\"bashing\\" anyone's work, and I'm confident that the author's motives and intentions were pure. But I just can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A thoroughly disapointing work. A found it nothing more than thinly veiled religious rhetoric passed off as comptemorary fiction. I wish I had read the coverleaf more carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK!","review":"I read the book Left Behind. I thought it was a really good book. It was about these four kids who really don't belive in God, but their families did. Since the kids didn't belive in God, they didn't go to heaven. The people that did go to Heaven didn't take anything with them. Not even their fillings! I thought it was a really good teen and adult book. READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a great book to read, but do remember that it is fictional (although based on facts from the bible). In other words, nothing can replace what has already been written in the bible. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the author's story. It is a very quick read and I am anxious to read the remaining books in the series. This book was a little reminder to me to live as though today might be my last. I intend to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great series beginning!","review":"Once beginning the book, I just couldn't put it down. The book has you sitting on the edge of your seat, just waiting for what's going to happen next. The characters are developed in such a way, that you just want to know more, and more about them. My church school adult class decided to make this book a project for our first book reading group. I hadn't read fiction in quite a while, and found this book so enjoyable, yet made me do a lot of thinking! It also made me thirst for a deeper understanding of the Book of Revelations. Couldn't wait to start the next book of the series. If they're all like this, I guess I'll be reading the entire series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"I am loving this whole series.

I can't wait till the next one comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything BUT the message of Jesus","review":"This series delivers anything BUT the true message of Jesus. We can choose to dismantle the beautiful message that Jesus laid down his life to deliver to us, but in doing so we create a world full of the very things Jesus tried to save us from.I find very little distinction between hateful, violent works like this and some of the horrifying terrorists acts we have endured. They are of the same vibration (which is NOT Love).I agree with other reviewers who claim that this series is dangerous, especially for children.A series based on the messages of Love and Forgiveness that Jesus taught us may not be nearly as action packed but would least be a story worth telling.I will pray that all authors of hateful, discriminating works like this might eventually experience the true message of Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish...","review":"This series of books gave me nightmares. I read the first few, but they were just so violent and dark that I kept having dreams that the world had ended. I had to stop reading them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book really gets to the heart of Jesus' second coming. While I truly believe that this is only a novel, and it should never be seen as more than a novel, it gives a \\"real\\" interpretation of the Book of Revalation. I guarentee that this book will atleast get you thinking, and perhaps make you think twice about not taking your religion seriously"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I Wanted Proselytizing I Would Have Joined The Church","review":"When I look for a book within a certain genre, I try to respect the reviews, interpret the bestseller status, and as a final test read the synopsis. I feel that this book's authors (and its promoters) have resorted to a cheap brand of \\"bait and switch\\" in order to sell books. A thriller should be just that - not a crossover into religious preaching. I have to agree with the previous review: the potential for great storytelling gets bogged down by blatant attempts to proselytize. \\"Gee, maybe that church thing and God and religion, I took all wrong. Let me stroll on down to church and join up.\\" Please! I take my religious beliefs too seriously to be so loose about them.I tried to read this book. I really did. My first warning should have been that this was on the \\"Religion\\" shelf instead of \\"Fiction.\\" I give it one star because I somehow managed to make it to page 80."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy read","review":"A friend suggested the first book \\"Left Behind\\". I found it to be a very easy to read book. Although the charaters seem to be a little shallow, and the plot at times a little \\"hoaky\\", I still recommend the book. The first book explodes at the end and then just leaves you hanging - you'll have to buy the 2nd and then the 3rd and so on.By the time you've read the 3rd book, the characters are so familiar to you that you'll be wanting to know how things turn out.Whether you are a Christian or not, this is a great series of books that will entertain you. I didn't feel the message was strong enough to convert anyone to Christianity, but it'll be enough to get you thinking about the end-times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Catholic propaganda moves into mainstream","review":"The number of reviews by people apparently beside themselves with admiration for this book series is deeply saddening. \\"Left Behind\\" is written by a fundamentalist with a strong anti-Catholic bias. In fact, he even introduces God Himself to win his argument, when most Catholics are \\"left behind\\" in the book (always a tempting plot device). Thousands of people are getting their theology from a glossy but poorly written series of tabloid-quality books, while sneering at the holy, apostolic Church of Peter. What's wrong with this picture? This kind of stuff is not worthy of the mainstream attention it has received, not to mention prominent display in every Christian bookstore I've walked into. Smarten up, people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and Enjoyable","review":"I know I am lated in reading this novel considering that it was given to me in the beginning of this decade, but I cannot wait to read the next book in this series.Fear of the evitable ending of the world as we now know it is what kept me from reading this book. It is sad to say that I ran out of other novels as to how I finally gave in to reading this one. But let me tell you this book was awesome. I liked that it actually had a story line and that it had more than one main character. I liked that this book followed the Bible and included scriptures and was relatable. I would recommend this novel to anyone who wants to know about the end but is afraid of its Revelation.This novel helped with my fear, explained key future scenarios such as the holocaust, and the tribulation period, antichrist and so own. It gave me insight and brought about a hunger to learn more. An excellent novel and guide as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic if ever there was one!","review":"This book is great! Not only does it give me a feel of how life might be durinng end times, but the series only gets better! I learned so much and was inspired to read Revealation in my Bible!

The book arrived in a timly manner and in excellent condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, shallow and plain bad.","review":"This books reads like a a kindergarten kid telling you: \\"see? I told you mom would come\\". Its supposedly Bible-based scenarios are such a stretch that they make the parting of the Red Sea look like something I might see during my commute every day. And I see far more wonderous things , believe me. It is a moral fable of very low quality. Its 'simplistic' (not simple) views are a drag . It's characters reactions and behaviour are so unrealistic they become symbols: greed, lust...just like in a medieval tableau. Last time someone though that the Messiah would come with BIG announcements, there was some disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Me Cold","review":"I got the tape version of this book because my book group decided to read it. I think my first sign of trouble was the name of one of the main characters--Rayford Steele. Sounded like a 'bodice ripper' character to me. And, the anti-Christ character is a very shallow representation of a sort of charismatic, messianic 'baddie'. Why is he Russian? I also kept wondering 'what about Jews', but found they were neatly taken care of by God having appointed Jewish messengers who would convert the poor, unknowing souls to the one, true answer. I really do not understand the enormous appeal of this series of books. I am not a 'non-believer' but find the whole idea very unreal and uninteresting. I also felt I was being set up for the remainder of the series. The plot clanked along to a sort of badly done 'Right Stuff' image of the four saviors, who 'got it', ready to save the world from the Russian 'baddie'. Save me--from the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, at most","review":"One sentence echoed in my mind while I read this book; It could be so good. This book has so much potential but fails to ever reach it. The plot is interesting but the writing is far from quality. This book should become the definition of weekend reading. It DOES NOT challenge the mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you think this is good, read The Last Day . . .","review":"I read Left Behind, Assassins and Tribulation before I took a friend's recommendation and read another Judgment Day novel, Glen Kleier's The Last Day, which is INFINITELY better. There is vastly more story, provocative thought and soul rattling frights in The Last Day than in any of the above mentioned Jenkins/LaHaye books. That stuff is Judgment Day light in comparison and never delivers the deeper message and tensions that Last Day does. If you must read all these books, do yourself a favor and read them BEFORE you read Last Day, or you'll never go back to them. Last Day gives the whole experience that these lightweight attempts miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor literature","review":"Although this book had fewer flips back and forth between characters, it still is far too often for enjoyable reading. The story is interesting and I applaud their efforts, but the characters are shallow and Chloe is becoming very annoying; the characters are described time and again rather than developed and drawing the reader into that development. Perhaps the most annoying facet is the book describes a piece Chaim wrote, then includes a couple of pages of what Chaim wrote, and then all the other characters are greatly moved/touched/yada yada by it. I feel either it should be moving and not described or not included and we should just be told it was moving. To outline eschatology thought and then complement oneself through fictional characters seems extremely self-glorifying and nauseating.Skip this book. The fact that the number of books is jumping and that the overall plot development is slow and occurs mainly at the end of the book makes the authors seem greedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read them all, kind of wish I didn't","review":"The writing in this book and the books that follow is bland, redundant, and often times silly. While I can't argue with the authors' view of biblical prophecy, I can't wholey agree with it either. It is difficult for one to believe that good people can't get into heaven just because they are good, and that God would forsake all who do not call Jesus \\"Lord\\". It can also be quite disturbing to read literature that claims Christianity is the only hope for mankind and that all other religions are false. I say good for Tim and Jerry for taking a stand and not making a wishy washy, P.C. book for the masses to swallow. Work on the writing skills, but keep your stance. Tell the truth that everyone will eventually learn, whether they believe it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept, Bad writing","review":"I am a Christian and would like to promote books like this. However, to be honest, I would have to concede that the writing is mediocre at best. The characters are shallow and rarified. Their are few facets to them and they are unrealistic. For example, this whole story involves people who are left behind after the rapture in a 'godless' world, yet no one ever utters a word of profanity. Everyone behaves in a \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" manner and the bad guys say words like \\"heck\\" and \\"darn\\". The two main characters, Rayford and Buck, are exactly the same--BORING. Also, the plot is awfully thin and shallow. The characters rarely \\"do\\" anything but sit around and be contemplative. Overall, I feel the book series is a lot of slick packaging and marketing with little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the hype?","review":"All these five-star reviews makes this out to be the best book since the Bible. And sure, it was mildly interesting, but it wasn't THAT good. The characters were fairly cardboard, the theology was questionable, and the dialogue rather stilted. I fear that the church is starving for decent literature and instead is wasting its time on the literary equivalent of Twinkies. Or maybe Ding Dongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"For what it's worth..my two cents","review":"Like others who have posted here, this book was recommended to me with great fanfare. As someone who is a Christian, I looked forward to reading it with the hope that it presented a message which could be shared with my friends and family who are not Christian. Was I ever disappointed. And even more to the point, I was embarassed. This book is full of cliches, some of the most uninterestng characters I have ever experienced in litertature, and numerous (too many to name here)plot discrepencies. As a believer we are challenged to spread the gospel, this book does nothing to further the gospel in the eyes of the non-believer. My greatest concern is that any non-believer would foreever be flabbergasted at the simplistic writing style exhibited in this book.My recommendation is to spend time reading the Bible and let God's grace speak to you. This did nothing of the sort to me.Regards,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamentalist Propaganda","review":"'Left Behind' and the other books in this series are nothing more than fundamentalist evangelical christian propaganda written in the guise of fictional entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like It","review":"I love this book. I had to force myself to but it down so I don't read though it all at once. I find that the characters are very real, and other than the initial event (the Rapture) all of the following events sound realistically possible (in a novel). I have read many negative reviews from Christians denouncing that it doesn't exactly follow the Bible. And from others saying that it's nothing but religious evangelicalism. To all of those I say \\"It's a novel\\". It's fiction. It doesn't have to follow other sources and the writers can say what they want.To me it is a perfect mix, not too far out there and not too much preaching.I would recommend it to anyone interested. If you don't like the first book then don't read the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interestign Christian fiction","review":"Left Behind is an interesting book of Christian fiction. Thought and self examination of religious views will, of course, follow upon reading this book. That's not to say that one should replace beliefs by what is read in these pages; it is afterall represented as Christian fiction. What this book does is make you think about the subject.The story follows characters as they experience and search for answers to events around them concerning bizarre happenings related to what is believed to be written about in the Bible's Book of Revelations.It is evident by the reviews here that people vary widely in their beliefs on the subject and its details. Let us look at this as an impetus to thought provoking discourse about an interesting book of Christian fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Only The Triumph and the Glory was as stunning a book as LEFT BEHIND. I usually only read historical fiction but this stuff is FUTURE history so I guess that counts. The Rapture hits and the world starts reeling towards Judgement Day and Jenkins and LaFaye takes us along for the ride. Buy this book, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfair to compare Left Behind to Last Day","review":"I think that comparing any of the Left Behind series to Kleier's doomsday novel, The Last Day, is a mistake. Kleier's novel is a rivetting read and one of the finest suspense thrillers I've ever read, but I don't think it was intended to be a religious novel, per se. Left Behind is, and it creates the sort of gut-level religious awe many people are looking for. Last Day is more a thinking man's Judgment Day story. It creates an awe of a different kind, more provocative and profound, not so visceral, more mental. These books are different pieces of literature intended for different purposes. Very worthwhile, each in their own way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely incredible journey through last days!","review":"Lahaye & Jenkins did an incredible job of creating this episode. I haven't read more than 5 complete books my whole life. I'm now on the fourth book \\"Soul Harvest,\\" and I can't put it down.

The plot is intense and the characters are intriguing. I appreciate everyone's view of religion, but I do not respect those that claim only one is the 'right' one.

This book is great for anyone who has an open mind and loves good story telling, but no matter what it's based on, it is fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"After reading the negative reviews of some of the others here, I was skeptical of this novel. But it seems to me that those who said the negative things about this book seem closely related to the unbelievers protrayed in this wonderful piece of apocalyptic fiction. This is a thinking man's book - not dependent on superhyped action to see it through a shabby plot. One can not walk away from this book without an introspective look at one's self. Those who claim otherwise may need to worry where they'll be when the end does come. Read this book! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Behind","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It read like a novel and captured my interest from the very beginning.

As a novel it was boring and uninteresting with limited character development and it seemed to end in mid-story.I fault myself for not investigating the authors before getting this book, however there was nothing provided that hinted at the plot or story line when I checked it out on Amazon Kindle books.My guess is that one would have to read the entire series of these books to get to a point of relevence, an boring task I am not willing to take."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eyeopening account of what is to come for us all...","review":"I picked up this book with the intention of a good read. Halfway through, I felt that this book had truly touched my soul. I know the Bible and all the facts about the Rapture and Tribulation, but when seen from the perspective of those who did not transcend, well.... What an eye opener. While the book is based on nonfiction accounts from the Bible, the fictionalized portions bring the whole thing down to us. It is easy to read the Bible and let it fly over your head and say oh that is so true. But to hear how it could be lived out if we were to be left behind. All I can say, is it made me want to make sure of my committment so I wouldn't be. Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can read, READ THIS!","review":"This book is one of the most powerful works of fiction I have ever read.

This book is little more than an attempt to scare people into religious faith, and in that regard, most street preachers are more persuasive than this book.Strip away all the hype, all the contrived plot devices, all the fantastic imaginings, and you are left with endless unanswered questions: Is belief in God to be predicated merely on personal, subjective experience, or must I wait for a cataclysmic \\"Independence Day\\" kind of event? How do you have any certainty as to the identity (or benevolence) of your God? How do you ascertain the authenticity and reliability of your Bible?I will not be browbeaten into believing this kind of empty propaganda.

If that was not bad enough, the story makes no sense. It is simply a rehash of a bible story forced, with little thought, into modern times.Even if you suspend your belief of logic, common sense, and reality, the book fails miserably at character development - there is none. The characters are one dimensional, mindless puppets of this heavily religious story.If you are still interested, just read the bible and throw in some modern terms like airplane and iPod and you will at least be reading a real book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible","review":"I can not believe this book, much less any of the others in the series, has become such a big deal. I barely made it half way through Left Behind and could not take it any more. It was like being forced to watch some low-budget, poorly written, poorly acted movie of the week. I am so disappointed that other Christians are finding this series worth their time and money.I also do not see the need for a Left Behind series directed toward youth.

That is not to say that it was particularly gripping. The book is extremely simply written. Large text, simple sentences, uncomplicated plot devices, and a pre-determined plot (guess what, god wins...).I did enjoy the book from a brain junk-food perspective. The story is an interesting read. The concept is quite intriguing, even if from a secular standpoint.Minus the religious babble thrown into the book, it's an okay read -- something to occupy your mind while, say, sitting on a subway train or in an airplane flying across the country.I can't say I was religiously moved by the book, and frankly, it fairly drips with religious admoninitions.

But as literature goes, to be honest, these books are NOT very well written. The characters are thin, artificial, the writing forced and simplistic. A far deeper and more compelling Apocalyptic novel is Glenn Kleier's THE LAST DAY. Although NOT biblically accurate in many apsects, the story is hugely suspenseful and the spiritual nature far deeper than any of the three books of this series I've read so far, APOLLYON, TRIBULATION and LEFT BEHIND. Because of this, I found THE LAST DAY considerably more fulfilling, spiritually, and certainly more thrilling from a literary perspective. If your interest is a superior story, and less the scriptural application, THE LAST DAY is a more rewarding read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of this genre","review":"I was taken in by all the hype on this novel. It is not nearlyso well crafted, suspenseful, frightening or intelligent as GlennKleier's THE LAST DAY. THE LAST DAY is the final word in End Time novels and the best of the batch of millennium novels to hit the bookstands. If you found anything of interest in LEFT BEHIND, you will go ballistic over THE LAST DAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Captivating!!!","review":"Over the years I have heard many sermons based on the book of Revelations. All of them confusing, scary, and were completely beyond comprehension. This series--Left Behind, et al, was truly a God-send. Not only is it written in understandable \\"story\\" form but the references to biblical scripture allows the reader to research the passages for him/herself.Each publication in this series has been awaited with great anticipation. We have the complete set of books (to this date) and am now looking for the unabridged audio cassettes to complement the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"you don't have to be religious to enjoy","review":"Someone was telling me about this book and I was doubtful considering it was a christian read...next thing I know 10 other people were jumping in the conversation and telling me what a great book it was...so I thought what the heck? I have been a left behind addict ever since...just finished book #11 and can't wait for the final one. My only recommendation, which is easy now, is to read one after the other...it was very tough to wait for the next edition to come out several months later. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"This book has really opened my eyes! I absolutly loved it, I can't wait to read the next three books in this series!

This book is not just a good read, it really makes you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Very disappointed in the quality of writing put out by a reputable publisher. I read the first book and cringed, but kept on to book 2 because the subject is interesting. I tried to start book 3 and couldn't force myself any longer. It's rushed and cliched in many places with a few intriguing segments in between. I'm sad that such a potentially high-impact and magnetic subject was handled with so little concern for literary quality. Pop novels at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Enjoyed enjoyed enjoyed! Well developed charartors, lots of action, I am looking forward to reading more from this Author. I recommend this book Left Behind"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too repetitive","review":"Maybe ,if written as a short story, this tale would have been better. Not as satisfying as a tv show due to repetitions of action and thoughts attempting to disguise Bible metaphors to be literal guidelines for current day. Another way to force people to a narrow outlined relationship with God based on fear of the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"My bad","review":"Should have sought out a review. The subject matter, from the first few pages, was a lot more limited than I would have expected from the title. More of a religious perspective than i appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not well written but an excellent message","review":"While the actual writing style seems as though the book came from the young adult section and many of the characters are shallow and underdeveloped, the book still carries an important message. It is easy reading and each moral and lesson is spelled out for the reader. However, one is still able to feel the heart behind the plot of this frightening and hopeful tale and the idea is a very powerful one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book Ever","review":"This book is ,without a doubt, the worst book I have ever read. If I could give it a negative rating, I would. It just reeks.First, neither Mr. Lahaye or Mr. Jenkins can write above the level of a three year old. Their depiction of female characters is attrocious, and offensive to all the women I know who have read it. In addition, the behavior of the charecters is ludicrous. Do you people actually believe that after half the worlds population disappears, we will all just return to our daily lives? Finally, the authors wouldn't know sublety if it slapped them in the face. They have no idea how to hint at a plot point or a charecter trait, they just come right out and say it. Sometimes that kind of straightforwardness helps get a point across, but it justs adds to the lists of Problems with this book. Do not, under any circumstances, bye this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly frightening tactics here.","review":"Where does one begin? I find it truly frightening that so many people treat this series of books as gospel when it is FICTION. In an age of wars and civil strife based on intolerance, these authors have much to answer for in their expression of righteous intolerance for other faiths. The world does not need more poison in any form. People, if you seek true spiritual connection, go to the original texts and meditate on them and not to authors who use such questionable fear tactics to convert people back into their disturbingly narrow view of the Divine. Remember this series is fiction with an AGENDA and should be approached with healthy skepticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling read...","review":"...for both Christians and non-believers alike. Although written as a fictional account, the book will give readers a glimpse of a possible timeline of events that could happen as foretold in the Book of Revelation.The plot draws you in right from the start when the rapture occurs and makes you truly think: \\"what if I am taken and my love ones are not? or \\"what if I am the one left behind?\\". \\"How would life be without them?\\"Hard to put down as you follow the stories of Rayford Steele (the 747 captain) and Buck Williams (the ace reporter) as they try to make sense of what has happened. Be prepared to read into the early hours of the morning.Try Tribulation Force next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fiction?","review":"Thiss is the one that will hook you into the series. I've read all but \\"The Indwelling\\"(just strarting) and they all make for interesting reading. This is one of the best in the series, maybe the best. No need to preach here but the books do a pretty good job of it. 1215 reviews and counting, so pick em. It is a quick read so you can get through it fast, it'll definitely have you thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real let down","review":"The book had an excellent idea and failed in the execution. The writing is infantile in nature and the message is heavy handed at best. If it were even a little bit better, I might consider reading the next one. As it is now, I am not sure it is worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE don't give these books to your children!","review":"Using stultifying cliches and stereotypes, these books teach prejudice and hatred. I started reading the first one because I want, as a teen librarian, to be familiar with the work in my collection. I didn't get very far before I felt nauseous and had to stop. I skimmed through the book and found more of the same.If you want to teach your children to be Christians, fine. These books, however, will teach your kids to hate anyone that isn't a 'good Christian'. How 'Christian' is that? When the book says that a Christian wouldn't cheat someone, a Christian would show modesty, a Christian would be compassionate, etc, what it's saying by implication is that these behaviors are perfectly normal for non-Christians. To a Buddhist, a Muslim, a Jew, or an atheist like myself, this is incredibly insulting.Please don't expose your impressionable children to this poorly written garbage. The world needs more love, not less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"I thought this was a good read but not quite a great read, mainly because of character development or lack thereof. There were also times in the book where the dialogue was a bit cheesy or at least could have been better, especially between two intellectuals like Buck and Chloe. Outside of that and some events that seemed to happen a little too easily the book for me was a good read that I would recommend to others, especially non-Christians, it might just get them to think about where they would stand if this really happened. I think what I liked most about it was it starts off fast so you get hooked on the story right from the beginning, I've read books that took almost half the book to do that but fortunately this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"LEFT BEHIND","review":"In this exciting story, based on the theme of the Second Coming in the bible, millions disappear from around the earth. Vehicles lose their drivers; airliners lose their pilots. The chaos that results is awful. Babies, children, parents, clergymen, ordinary church-folk, suddenly gone. The world is plunged into disarray, war, and starvation. But out of chaos a new world order may arise, if a strong leader can be found. Interpretations abound: aliens, sinister new technology, or the ancient prophecy may be true - they may have been taken to heaven. Air line pilot Rayford Steele loses his wife, and like all those left behind he must come to terms with his separation and make sense of it all. This is the first of the thought provoking Left Behind series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another money-making series","review":"I purchased this book because it was scheduled for a book discussion group with which I am involved. I am not happy that a book with an agenda like this was recommended to the group. Besides that, it is so simplistic, so banal, and so obvious. I am familiar with the book of Revelation and aware that there are many, many interpretations of the so-called end times. For an author to take one interpretation and build a series of books on it is just too much to accept. It certainly is not what I would call literature; the plot was so easily figured out in advance and the characters were so obviously designed to fit in with the story-line. I'm sorry to see stuff like this on the best seller lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Behind--A Must Read (and Read Again)","review":"No matter where you stand in your personal beliefs, Tim Lahaye and Jerry Jenkins will call you to self-examination. There is no way to either put this book down or remain passive during your reading. It calls for a decision without ever asking for one. This book could as easily be pulled from the headlines of USA Today or off of a television news magazine as from its source, the Bible. The development of characters and the plot place you as one of the participants deciding your own fate.This book is one that can not be kept to one's self. After spending the last 12 years on airplanes and reading during much of my travel, no book has stimulated as much comment as Left Behind. I have yet to be on a flight where no one has read it. Do not miss out. On either the book or to the opportunities it calls you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have fun with it!","review":"I have never been a big reader. A friend recommended this book to me and I thought I would check it out! Well I am very glad that I did, myself being an 8-year veteran of Catholic School I figured I would find this book interesting and I was very right.This is a really interesting and fun book to read, a \\"why can't I stop reading this\\" page turning thriller! The one thing to remember is not to take this book so seriously and to please remember that it is just a story. Even though it is based on Revelation in the bible doesn't mean this story is a word for word translation. This book is one mans view on the topic and very well done in fact!I would have to recommend this book to anyone with an interest in revelation and the end of the world; it certainly does make you think!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful story, poorly written","review":"The story of the Rapture of the Church should be a gripping read - a true page turner - an all-nighter. Unfortunately, this attempt to capture the drama of those left behind, is cliche ridden and so poorly written that it was all I could do to finish the book. The characters are one-dimensional, the dialog is awkward, and the plot devises are predictable. The authors are certainly to be commended for attempting to bring the story to the mass market, but this book is a dismal failure as literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Behind is awesome!","review":"I really honestly don't know how people can not like this book and say that it says we're all going to hell. I believe it says the very opposite. It encouraged me to look at my faith and love God even more than I already do. It has a very well-written plot that kept me reading all night! What everyone goes through and thinks about the Rapture makes the book all the more interesting to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I think this book was great. But, the end was \\"blah\\". But, I really do recommend this book. If you're into this kinda stuff, and even if your not, it's just a really great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"rapture porn at it's finest","review":"I read this book years ago when it first came out, and sadly also read several of the sequels. Having a few years to consider leads me to the conclusion that it may have been the worst set of books I ever wasted time on (and I read the entire Twilight series!).Opinions on this story will be bitterly divisive.. but that is of course the authors intent."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book takes you on a real faith journey!","review":"Left Behind is a novel by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. I really enjoyed reading this book, and can understand why it is a best seller. For all Christians who are strong in their faith, I would recommend reading this book. In this fiction book the theme is about the rapture, and this novel reveals how the world will end. Rayford Steele, a pilot, is flying one day and comes to the realization that half of his crew is gone. They are gone but all their valuables and clothes are still there like they just disappeared. How can this be? Is it God? Is it Nature? He has to try to make sense of what is going on while he is home. Can he still be saved? Can he figure out what is going on? This marvelous book takes the reader on a journey with many twists and turns. I would encourage people to read this to get some idea of the authors theory of what will happen to all mankind at the time of the rapture."},{"rating":"2","title":"It made me a true believer in The Almighty God !!!!!!!!","review":"Before I read this book I was not a full beliver in Jesus Christ. The first one made me cry just for the fact it was so much me... They keep getting better and better!!!! Great Job"},{"rating":"2","title":"definately made me concerned for the future of the un-saved","review":"I could not get enough of this book. I stayed up all night to finish it! Left Behind really made me think about where I was spiritually, which was a very good thing. Since reading it I have redidicated my life the only Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I recommned this book to everyone, it's extremely easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't want to be LEFT BEHIND!","review":"Powerful book....read the entire series...I have and it has changed my life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"This book was awesome, as were all the others in this series! I found myself reading in the car, at home, at work, anywhere I could. I have recommended the books to several friends and family members, they all love the books too. I can't wait for the next one to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Plot Is Excellent","review":"Tim LaHaye and Jery B. Jenkins keep you from putting this book down. It combines action, suspense, and the truth about the Rapture of God's People for a winning combination. You'll learn about things you've never even thought about happening in the end times. I reccomend this book to people above the age of 12."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and moving","review":"This is the most amazing book I have ever read in my life! Not only did this book give me a stronger and more loving relationship with God but it also helped me understand the book of Revelations. Since I am only 12 years old this book really spoke to me. This book helped me understand the way life could be without truly knowing and loving God.I recommend this book to everyone and especially to those people that aren't sure about their relationship with God or people that aren't sure about what could happen without God to protect them.I loved this book so much because of the book's suspenseful plot and I also loved how the book didn't hold anything back from the readers. This book told you the truth and if there is one thing that you can't deny then it's the truth. I can't wait to read the Tribulation Force and the other books in the Left Behind Series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Plot, not enough though","review":"The book begins with the rapture(the end of the world), and a pilot sad about his wife dying. It does not get better. The terrible writing is hidden through engaging characters, with horrid description. A 3rd grader could read it. It is annonyingly simplistic, but interesting. Read at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging, yet dangerous","review":"This book is a page-turner. Like Jerry Jenkins' other books, it is easy to read and difficult to put down. Unfortunately, this book quickly falls apart as the theology becomes stranger and stranger. Jenkins' can write a good story, but when a theology that does not even make sense is the focus, the story line falls apart. Jenkins' should have just written a story and left LaHaye's theology to a non-fiction book.Unfortunately, this books attempt to scare individuals into a conversion experience. They promote a theology that has only been recently adopted by any members of the Christian church. Although I think that fiction, literature, and the arts in general can serve as a vehicle for discussing theology, the otherwhelming popularity of these books is ultimate dangerous both for individuals and the Christian church as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nutter's wet dream","review":"This is a great book if you subscribe to the modern American fundamentalist world view. See the world as clearly black and white, good v evil, have every word in your bible highlighted? Then this book and series for that matter is right up your alley. If you are more into the blood and gore aspect of the coming calamities to be visited upon the non-believers, skip ahead to the end of the series, where things get real interesting, you will see Jesus in a new light...err, darkness. Tired of wondering what the wonderful rapture and subsequent events of the book of revelations will bring, well hurry up and buy the book silly. Daddy, I mean pastor Joe gives it two thumbs pointed to the heavens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to read even if you disagree","review":"Left Behind is one of the greatest books I've ever read! It is a great story and I have enjoyed the Left Behind series greatly. I am a Catholic and so I don't agree with the authors' views of the end times (even though I used to- I'm a fundamentalist convert to the Catholic Church) but it is still a great story to read, regardless of your religious views. If nothing else, it gets people to think about knowing Jesus Christ. I can't wait till the next book comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religeous Mumbo Jumbo, badly written.","review":"Religeous mumbo jumbo, and badly written. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"This could've been a great book -- the concept is ripe for a great piece of fiction. However, the authors of \\"Left Behind\\" have ruined a decent storyline with shameless preaching, utterly ridiculous fear tactics, and just flat-out bad writing. The characters are shallow simpletons, the story is narrow-minded and predictable, and the Fundamentalist slant set forth (basically that anyone who doesn't believe in their brand of God -- a vengeful one) is down-right insulting. I, personally, believe in a loving God, thinking for myself, and taking PERSONAL responsibility for my actions. Obviously, the authors of this series do not agree. I can't think of a bigger waste of time than to go on to read the next 6 books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"You could have warned me it was a Bible study book","review":"I though I would get a good \\"literary\\" novel - one that you would really like reading late at night... but oh s*** it was a Bible study. Maybe it is generally known these Left Behind books are religious? (At least, I know it by now). However, could you please warn us foreigners about these? Being a devout Christian I have not got anything against these guy's ideas; I would just like to know what I am purchasing, and, I would prefer keeping religion and novels separate. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really people?","review":"I couldn't get past chapter 5 of the first book without feeling like someone was giving me a bible lesson. Looked up LaHaye and found out he's ultra anti-gay and even anti-Catholic minister. I'm neither, but I have problems with people who don't tolerate other people's beliefs and made me realize why I wasn't enjoying this book. Being raised with the bible, I see how followers are attracted to this type of story, but its just some minister trying to preach his ways with a fictional novel that he actually believes is true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow what an amazing book.","review":"As someone who is to a point not religious in anyway. I found this book to be very good. I normally tend to keep away from book that will try to preach religion at me.This book captured my intrest two night ago and I spent the whole time reading this book. This book has it all.The story is one that would only seem to be something you would see in the movies.I don't want to give to much away in spoiler, but all I have to say is to read this book and give it some thought. I had kept away from these books due to the fact that they were in the religion section of my bookstore, but having borrowed this from a friend all I have to say is I can't wait to read the rest in the series. I only hope that this was a start to a wonderful set of book that I will enjoy and recommend to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointing. . .","review":"The only readers who will come away satisfied with this series (I quit halfway through \\"Soul Harvest\\") are fundamentalist who can't get enough of the same ol' fire and brimstone. These books are the shallowest of shallow, with about as much intellectual stimulation as a bowl of cold oatmeal. There are vastly more exciting and fearsome novels on the subject of The Last Day--not the least of which is the novel by the same name--\\"The Last Day.\\" If you have the mental wherewithal for a really scary spiritual ride, \\"The Last Day\\" delivers a story of unsurpassed suspense and controversy. If you just like to sit back and veg out, stick with this juvenile \\"Left Behind\\" stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Behind!","review":"I was given this book from a friend, and was hooked. I loved the plot and, unlike some other reviewers, felt the characters were engaging. There are so many reviewers who are against this book because of their religious beliefs.

I plan on picking up a bible soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving, a tad philocentric","review":"I have enjoyed every single one of these tapes. The reader,Andrew Muller (?) is the best audio book reader I have heard. Thestory is captivating and compelling, and the suspense is immense (especially if you get them one tape at a time). However, at times the tone can be philocentric, and the whole premise of the story is based on what is most likely a misinterpretation of the original context. Yeshua Marya (Ancient Aramaic for the Master Jesus) never intended for us to worship him, only to follow his teachings. He tried to tell us again and again that we are his brothers, and God our Father. The Roman Catholic Church twisted the original teachings, and put fear and damnation into the equation.

The plot is weak and chock-full of bland, superfluous details. Buck's part of the story is particularly uninteresting. There are just too many things going on all at once. His part of the story gives us the specifics of how he plugged in his computer to an outlet and how his subconscious waking system didn't work one day when he wanted to get up at 8 and instead woke up 45 minutes later.I also believe that the end-times view this book supports has no biblical backing, though this is not the reason why I gave this book only one star. I hold to the Postmillenialist viewpoint and would love to have a discussion if you have any questions/arguments about this particular viewpoint or end-times in general.

It is almost a sad confirmation of the common stereotype of fundamentalist Christians being uneducated yokels that so many of them think this is great writing. Here's my take: I'd enjoy a good \\"end of times\\" story - this just isn't it. The Left Behind series is amateurish and poorly written and just plain astonishing to me that it has had such huge success. P.T. Barnum once said that no one ever went broke understimating the intelligence of the American public and this series proves it. Christians should demand better writing from their revered authors. Go read some C.S. Lewis or something - please."},{"rating":"2","title":"You owe it to yourself to read this and be changed.","review":"I was not expecting much when I received this as a gift. I've always been unsettled and somewhat afraid by talk of the rapture. This book makes it all so clear. I recognized the events as prophecy but it had been so confusing to me before. I now feel so much more at ease about the future AND am taking steps to change my life. You owe to yourself whether you believe in the second coming or not, to examine this book. You won't be sorry.

As the saying goes, 'only in the U.S.A.' - no other nation on earth could produce such a camp, vulgar phenomenon of such popularity.

I think most people were \\"guilted\\" into reading and confessing to enjoy it by their christian bothers and sisters. What better way to sell a book but by using guilt? Mel Gibson is having success with the Passion for the same reason. People are made to feel like they are letting god down if they don't see this movie or read this book. They are like sheep, blindly led to empty their wallets into the pockets of their leaders.AMEN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Science Fiction or Religious Fiction ?","review":"Believability and common sense are completely ignored in this religious novel.

Clever but silly story that would be considered science fiction without the fanatical religious background. Cannot recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dogma","review":"This is religious dogma thinly disguised as popular fiction.

If I wanted a religious book, I would have downloaded the bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"Rereading this series. It has been several years since the first reading. I love the way the author has brought the rapture to life.

It is so great to see the authors' imaginations taking shape and developing over the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"the authors do a great job the plot an story was amazing i love this book they are pretty close to how the bible pridects it great Christian read i highly recomend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will that be me?","review":"As a christian, many of us do not think about what will happen a Jesus returns to rapture his church, even the ones of us who are \\"Sunday Christians\\" consider ourselves safe. This book has opened the idea of what would happen if the rapture were to occur today or tommorrow, would you be ready? If the answer to this question was yes, then get ready for an exciting read only to find yourself praying for the characters, as many of them will remind you of people know and love in your own life. If the answer is no, then prepare for a bumpy ride and to question many \\"fundamental truths\\" you hold. As for the \\"Sunday Christians\\", the character Bruce Barnes will be like looking in a mirror. Either way the series is sure to bring many questions to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bore!Chick book?","review":"I love this genre & the series has some entertainment value but I really had to trod through this first one. Can you say boring?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"The characters are plastic and unbelievable; the writing style is tedious and painful. It's not good fiction; it's not factual; it's not good writing ... it's not worth reading. Just because someone comes up with a unique idea, doesn't make a book worthwhile. Reading should serve some purpose ... entertainment, information or SOMETHING. This offered nothing. I had to push myself to finish, and I only did that because a friend had recommended it. I will not waste my my time on any other books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad","review":"I downloaded this when it was free for Kindle & I am glad I did not waste my money. The beginning was not too bad, but by the middle of the book the plot had virtually disappeared and the characters were incredibly boring. I tried to finish it as I hate to abandon a book, but I could not take it anymore and gave up about 3/4 of the way through it. I'm not sure why this series was so popular. . .it's definitely not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing Interpretation but Poor Writing","review":"I have to admit that I've read all of the books in the series because I'm interested in how the authors interpret latter days prophecy. However, these are some of the poorest written books I've read. These books are written for, perhaps, the sixth grade reading level. Of course, I know many children are reading heavy classics by that age, so I'm sure I'm being generous.I think that if you're starving for wholesome, Christian-minded books you might enjoy this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC READING!!!!","review":"I've just finished reading both Left Behind and Tribulation Force, and all I can say is that if you don't know where you're going when you die, reading these books will make you want to make a decision about how you want to spend eternity. This series is not just for Christians - in fact, I learned about them from a co-worker who is an avid reader. After you've read Left Behind you'll want to start reading Tribulation Force. Now I'm getting ready to read the third book, Nicolae. Exciting, inspiring, and thought- provoking reading for anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that will open your eyes, and heart to God.","review":"I have always wanted to know more about the Rapture. So on the advice of several trusted indivuduals, I picked up a copy of Left Behind. WOW! This is one heavy book. It was one of the most well-written books I have ever had the pleasure to read. It not only quotes scripture, but references it so that readers can go to the Bible later and see it for themselves. It reads like any other mystery, but with a more profound message at it's heart. I recommend it to the most devout Christian down to the newest seeker. It will answer just as many questions as it will pose in your mind and heart. I just started the second book in the series yesterday, and am already one third through it. I plan to read them all and so should you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best read ever-next to the Bible.","review":"These books have changed my life and my families. If it weren't for these books my family wouldn't be back on track with God today. I beleive God has used Jenkins/LaHaye to get the word out by writing these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unhealthy reading","review":"I developed a sort of horrified fascination with this series - I read the first six books before getting hold of myself. And I find it hard to explain to myself what I saw in them. Was it the writing? Surely not. The writing is poor. The appealing characters? But there aren't any. Do the books have any great spiritual value? They do not. (God isn't mentioned all that much.) No, I think it was sheer prurient interest in the depiction of evil, if anything. If you're a Christian, you might want to evaluate your motivations for reading this stuff quite carefully. If you're not, you'll find them amusing - but please try not to laugh at the fantasies of sincere people. It's unkind, and bad for the soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christ Clone Trilogy is SO MUCH BETTER!!","review":"I stopped reading this series after #4 (Soul Harvest). I kept reading Left Behind hoping it would get better. It didn't. I also read (actually started reading) We All Fall Down, but there the foul language was SO EXCESSIVE I couldn't keep going. Finally I read the books of The Christ Clone Trilogy (why do I feel like Goldilocks here?) and it was \\"just right!\\" Actually it was GREAT! So if you're tired of Buck and Rayford playing James Bond, and all the females in the LB world cooing, have a look at The Christ Clone Trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Racist, fanatical and dangerous. Paper cut-out characters, thread-bare plot and very poorly written (no more than a 6th grade reading level). I find it hard to undertand how anyone could accept this as a good example of writing or of Christian principles. If anything, this book would turn people away from Christianity. How could anyone want to be like any of these characters - prejudiced, narrow-minded and having a total disregard for the concerns of others - is beyond comprehension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited from the original version","review":"I read this book shortly after it was released and I'm re-reading the Kindle version right now. Something I noticed today that is now incredibly jarring to me - all the mentions of Pastor Billings' VHS tape that he'd recorded have been changed to \\"DVD\\". Furthermore, when Rayford is taking stock of all the items that were taken in the break-in, he notices that iPods are missing - when they weren't in the original. I could ignore it easier if the editors hadn't done such a sloppy job - Rayford mentions wanting to leave the DVD \\"in the VCR\\", and that he'd \\"rewound\\" it for Chloe to watch later. Incredibly bad job. I keep wondering what else they've changed in the series to keep up with the times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flee from this garbage","review":"This whole series does nothing but promote a doctrine of devils. A true spiritual study of the Word tears up the so called theology used behind this tripe. If you are truly interested in growing spiritually, having a relationship with God, and understanding the truth concerning Jesus; I highly recommend \\"Whose Right It Is\\" by Dr. Kelley Varner. If you are only interested in titillating your mind with the imaginations of man, read \\"Left Behind.\\" I hope to God my left behind is still planted right here when the church comes to its fullness in Christ (Eph 4:11-13). I was chosen by Jesus to \\"bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain\\" (John 15:16)The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.(Proverbs 10:30)Once again, I recommend \\"Whose Right It Is\\" by Dr. Kelley Varner. It will truly help you if you are sincerely seeking the truth and are a true worshipper of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dogmaric to the core...","review":"As the other reader, I am astonished to see that these clumsy dogmatic series became bestsellers! I could understand if they had an engaging plot, compelling characters, etc. These books should be rather filed under \\"non fiction\\"...Myself being a Christian, I watch with extreme disappointment at this type of dogmatism marginalizing Christianity further and further out. It is truly ironic how preachers of the first truly supranational religion digress into plain xenophobia... Everything global comes from Antichrist - the Net, Euro, WTO, what else? I suggest you go back and watch Omen all over, it will be more fun. Alternatively, I would suggest C.S. Lewis's Cosmic Trilogy as tolerant Christianity - or Good Omens by Gaiman and Pratchett - for fun and enjoyement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST read!!!","review":"I read the Left Behind Series about ten years ago, and I just started over again. This book is terrific! What a great story! It certainly puts a good spin on how it could happen, once Jesus takes his church. Great for believers in Jesus Christ, and perfect for your friends who might be on the fence about Christ! If somebody does not have the certainty of where they will spend eternity........this will definitely get them thinking......I recommend all books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is fiction, folks..","review":"And bad fiction, to boot. Why are readers grasping at badly-written novels as expressions of religious truth? LaHaye's interpretation of Revelation is just that - an interpretation. what's more, the whole scenario is deeply anti-Catholic - if you read what LaHaye has written in his other End times books, you'll see that he consistently and at length defines the Catholic Church as the Whore of Babylon mentioned in Revelation. Why does anyone want to send their money to this bigoted theological scam?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Theologically poor and very shallow","review":"I read the first two books in this series, and was appalled at the story: if it was JUST fiction (and not \\"based\\" on the Bible), I would leave well enough alone. But this is supposedly based on the Word of God. Reader beware! It scares me to think that people think this is a good read, or inspiring. Let me say this, the easy-believism in this story should be enough to drive any sincere believer away! But the church today seems to like this sort of fluffy nonsense. And let's not discuss eschatology here. To say that it is almost non-existent would be an understatement. And I think that the antichrist is absolutely not believable. I'm sure that Mr. LaHaye is a nice man, but the content of this book is dangerously lacking in substance and faith. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of god-awful filth","review":"Not only does this series hammer in its political opinions and \\"we're-right-you're-wrong-so-no-pity-for-you\\" religious persona (far removed from most Christians), this book has terrible pacing, serious problems concerning character morality and far more space devoted to telephone conversations than either evangelism or action. It tells when it should show, forgets when it should forgive and generally lacks any redeeming feature.I laughed at one point while reading, when one of the Mary Sues hit his head in a genre-busting bit of slapstick. Even though he should have been injured enough to seek some sort of medical help (\\"his hair matted down with blood\\"), this scrape is ignored and promptly forgotten.Bad characterization, clumsy theology and a bit of a bore. Don't read this series as it is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamentalist Fiction","review":"This series describes itself as fiction, and it is truly that. If you only read it at that level, and expect merely to pass the time, then it certainly will do no harm. But the writers intend more than that--they want it to evangelize. They believe that the silly narrative they weave, of dematerializing bodies, will actually happen. These are the teachings of the fundamentalist Protestant philosophy of \\"Dispensationalist Premillennialism.\\" Catholics and Mainline Protestants will realize that it is based on a literalistic reading of the Book of Revelation, which ignores the actual context in which Revelation was written. LaHaye and Jenkins think that when Revelation speaks of giant locusts attacking the earth with stinging tails, that this will literally occur! Given such silliness, one must wonder why the books are selling as well as they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I read this and two or three of the subsequent novels just to see what believers in the Rapture think is going to happen in the near future. What a bunch of self-righteous crap! I realize that the true believers will sef-righteously think I'm well on my way to hell, but the truth is they are deluded and go against every Christian principal I've ever learned, first and foremost of which is \\"Judge not lest ye be judged.\\" This is a truly dangerous point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish There Was Such A Thing As 0 Stars","review":"I consider myself to be a very good Christian. I go to church regularly, and help out the best I can. But this book is terrible. I'm sorry to say, but it is very poorly written. It is for Christians who are afraid of going to hell. It's silly! If you know you're a good person, you shouldn't worry yourself about whether or not you'll make it. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritually Uplifting!","review":"I couldn't stop listening to this book. I bought the first audio book because I had a long drive and it looked interesting. Now I have read some of the other reviews, and I don't know if the audio version is that much more \\"alive\\" but I could feel all the emotions that the characters were going through. At times I forgot that I would not be one of those left behind. This book, and the rest, are going through all my friends' hands. I don't want any of them to be Left Behind. I am so excited to read that there will be 6 more in the series. I will run out and buy each as soon as they hit the bookstores!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you thinking, long after you finish it.","review":"Not what you'd expect in a \\"christian book\\". This book had it all...suspense, drama, and lot's of thought provoking content. I was pleased to find out that this is just the first in a series so I have much more good reading to look forward to. It's hard to read this and look at the news the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! The author makes you feel like your there!","review":"This is a must read. It is a good book for anyone. You develop a bond with the characters.You really get to know them. I strongly suggest this book for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grabs you from the first word and does not let you go.","review":"My wife and I began reading this book together and have been unable to put it down. We have only stopped reading when sleeping, eating or work demanded otherwise. It is one of the most intriguing, suspenseful books I have read in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so popular?","review":"I just finished reading Left Behind and while I think the whole premise could have made a very interesting story I think this was just plain boring. I couldn't help but feel that the authors were trying to justify why certain religious groups feel the need to knock on strangers' doors and try to preach to them. I also felt that there might have been a touch of anti-semitism in this book and even though I'm a Catholic, I couldn't help feeling a little annoyed at this sentiment. In conclusion, this could have been an excellent book, but maybe it needs to cut down on the preaching and delve a little more into character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating extrapolation of End Time events!","review":"As a new Christian, I was given this book to read, and I must admit it was difficult for me to get started and get into it. However, having just finished it, I highly recommend it to everyone who might consider themselves a Christian. The way that the authors take the events of Revelation and the end times and weave them into a completely believable and very frightening picture of just what it might be like is awesome. One of the things I have struggled with when reading the Bible is the fact that it all is based on the lifestyle of the time it was written, so I have found this work a spectacular read, and very provocative. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty fair reading. Though slanted to one viewpoint.","review":"I thought the relationships were a little simple minded but it was still readable. I liked Steiger's new end times 'Alien Rapture' which fits my own personal beliefs. Pick a view point and you can find a book on it on amazon.com. This is a pretty good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice story, but very short in the fact dept.","review":"LaHay and Jenkins are getting good reviews not by the literary community, but rather the senselessly devout Christian community who represent the overwhelming majority of their audience: They are preaching to the choir. Their story is long on imagination, faith and occult and very short on fact, authenticity and legitimacy. I gave it two stars because I liked the style and added zero more for substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Behind (Left Behind #1)","review":"A must read! Teffific novel -- kept my mind whirring through the entire read. Everyone should read this book. It is an eye-opener for anyone, no matter where they are with their spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Behind is a very eye opener to the end of times","review":"Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins have by far outdone themselves. Left Behind is probably as close as the real thing gets next to the Bible. They take the reader through each spell-binding picture of what will happen. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time and felt like I was apart of this book as well. It was scary to realize that Nicolae Carpathia had so much influence.(AntiChrist) I would not think there could be the possibility of New World Order but he will try to make it happen. Buck, Rayford, Chloe and Bruce have an extremely large task of taking Nicolae on and I'm very interested in seeing what follows in the other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will change your life-- for ever!","review":"I reently finished reading this book for the third time and again it how precious life and your time really is.This book is about Jesus coming to rapture his true followers, and it follows a family around after the dissapperances. Rayford and Chloe Steele accept Christ and This series outlines what will take place when this event in time happens.This book is one of my favorites because it has a good story line to it but it is also very informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting theme, bad writing","review":"Of course the end of the world as we know it is a very interesting theme, specially when your loved ones disappear in front of your eyes. But, the characters were created from common cliches, the situations are very stupid and a six year old child can imagine where they're going. I suppose is a best-seller because speak about religion, nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subject matter has been done better elsewhere.","review":"The subject matter of this book has been done with much better style and grace in other books such as \\" The End \\" by Matt Ronan or \\"Next : A Poetic Odyssey \\" by Lee Frank."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most page-turning action novels I've ever read.","review":"This book is a must read for believer and non-believer alike. It proves that a novel without foul language and grotesque scenes or plot can be fast-paced, thrilling and very entertaining. Also chilling enough to make you think, and to make you want more. The authors must have known they would be writing a series from the start...they know how to get you hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revelation brought to life...","review":"Left Behind was the greatest book I have ever read, other that the Bible of course! It shows people what to expect when the end times come, they have given you actual people to feel their pain and sorrow with and their different reactions.I am almost halfway through Tribulation Force and I can't wait to pick it up and start reading it again!I am 16 and it has really made me evaluate my life and spiritual walk with God. I realised I have been slacking with my reading my Bible. It tought me I shouldn't wait for I might be Left Behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping..I couldn't put it down!","review":"The title of this book sounded intriguing, so I bought it on a whim. Boy, was it worth it! The way the authors used two different storylines, and bounced back and forth between the two was great. I found myself wanting more free time to continue reading every chance I got. Not just for the religion reader, this book captures your imagination and takes you away. I'm now starting the second in the series, \\"Tribulation Force\\", and I've already bought the third book, \\"Nicolae\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK ROCKS THE HOUSE!","review":"WOW! This book is amazing. Not only did it pull me in right away, the message is incredible. It makes me want to pick up my bible right away and read through the entire book of Revelation to understand more fully the Rapture. I can't wait to read the other books in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great book","review":"I was supprisingly pleased with the work of LaHaye and Jenkins. The book deals with the complex thoughts that have escalated in interest over the last couple of years. Once I had started, the plot of a man searching for tuth among his sins left me restless for more. His passion to lead his daughter to the light is surpassed only by his new love of God. I was so impressed with the book, that in a matter of three days I had finished all 468 pages, and was searching for a bookstore that carried the other two series. I thouroughly enjoyed this book. It will leave you speachless, like it has left me =^)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read and A Must Share","review":"After reading this book I have been moved to earnestly pray for not only my unsaved loved ones but all those whose have no personal relationship with Jesus Christ. This book helped me to re-examine my walk as a Christian. I read this book in three days and read \\"Tribulation Force\\" in 2 days.

It is so real that it will make you stop and think about your life and are you really ready for the end of time and the returning of Christ. The people in the book are very interesting and you can't skip any part because you won't understand later on what is happening. I have also read the second of this series and can't wait for the third one to come out. Put this book on your must read list because you won't want to miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - makes you think!","review":"Wonder what the last days or years of man on earth might be like? This book is a great rendition of how things might be from a Christian viewpoint, based on Biblical prophecy! For those who know anything about what the Bible says about the end times, these authors make the biblical prophecies come alive in the context of today's world. For those who don't know or understand much from the Bible, this book is sure to provoke deeper thought and questions. However, even if you don't care about any of that - this is a great read on its own merits! My only complaint is that it ended too soon - now I'm anxious for the sequel to arrive on my doorstep! Don't miss it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbound fiction","review":"I LOVED this book. It all starts off with a normal, everyday person at work. He is a pilot and he has to deal with the emotion, and stress when people just disappear from his airplane (and from around the world.) It has several real life charaters that has to deal with this end-of-the-earth days. Many of which don't seem to understand what has happened. It is a gripper with a slightly slow period in the first 1/4 of the book. However it makes up for it in the twist and turns that you don't see coming. It includes the basics of the last chapter in the Bible. It is wonderful to have some fiction that is based on the bible. It is not a replacement for the Bible. And it should not give anyone the ideal that this is what the bible says exactly. But it is great for a fun loving drama fiction that keeps you on your seat. I think even a non-believer would love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book will keep you on the path of holiness","review":"I could not put the book down. from the time of the disappearance of the passengers on the plane to the disappearance of the saints, the book keeps you on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your eyes will roll so often, they'll be sore","review":"The premise was interesting, but the execution was atrocious. I imagine the main appeal of this book is its juvenile writing, which makes it easy to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book with silly plot","review":"First off, I am a Christian, and although I'm not quite finished with this book, and I've already decided that I won't be reading the rest of the series. While \\"Left Behind\\" is a pretty good read, I'm finding the plot to be so convoluted that it's hard to really believe. The plot drags and the characters are so thinly developed that I don't really care if they get saved or not, although I did do a mental cheer when Rayford accepted Jesus as his Saviour, but I saw that coming from Page 1 so it was no surprise. I'm hoping that it's just because it's a multi-book series and that LaHaye and Jenkins will develop the characters more in later books. I was really looking forward to reading the entire series--it came highly recommended by some friends--that all I can say is that I'm really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift from God","review":"As a practicing Catholic, I had been warned that the series is not favorable to my religion. I found that the reading was both enjoyable and inspirational. The foundation of my beliefs are based in our Lord, so I found myself becomming completely enthralled. As a writer, I know that these books were a gift from God not only to the readers but also to the writers. I pray that all who believe or want to believe will read this book and pass it on to someone they love, so that none may be left behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"I loved this book. My friends lent me it, and I picked it up and once I started reading it, I couldn't stop. After I finished, I gave the book back to my friend and went out bought it along with the next two! This series is wonderful and exciting, and you can really get into it and feel like your'e there in the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For every person who wonders where our world is headed!","review":"If you are not a Christian and want to know what you are truly missing and how this might relate to your life, you should read this book. If you are a Christian and want to read something that confirms or reinforces your walk with Christ, you must read this book! Everyone can get something from this book! It was one of the most powerful non-threatening Christian books that I have ever read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"Many of my Mississippi fundamentalist coworkers recommended this book. After reading it, I found that I was extremely depressed. It was an obvious and poorly written fundamentalist \\"tract\\". If this book can warrant 5 stars by American readers, I have grave concerns about the intelligence of the American public. What an embarrassing book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left behind","review":"This book was a VERY slow read for me. It was very simple at best and the characters were so ordinary that I never really connected with them . The story was also quite predictable with absolutely NO twists and/or turns. Not a good reading experience for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"A friend of mine loaned this book to me, raving about the story. The packaging on the book is well done and makes it appear as if it's much bigger than it truly is. Upon reading though, I found the book to lack the depth that I presumed was there. The characters are very flat, the writing is juvenile at times, but the plot kept me going.There is so much potential in the story here, but I don't feel the writers have taken the time with their work to polish it and add depth to their work. It looks as if they're kicking two of these books out per year, which leads me to believe they're more interested in churning them out rather than creating a quality piece of fiction.Still, I keep reading them. The plot is just enough to keep me moving forward. I do see the agenda in these books, and as a Catholic, I feel somewhat offended by this. I feel like they've done a lot of stereotyping in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable but, come on!!","review":"I have to admit, I thought this was an enjoyable little book. The whole basis behind it is pretty worthless though. Honestly, I don't see anywhere in the Bible where it mentions the word rapture. If you look at the history of rapture theory it starts with a guy named John Nelson Darby who lived the 19th century. The earlier Christians and Apostles never taught rapture theory for the simple reason it was not there. If this book had been more fictional I would have given it a higher rating, but making the Bible say what it does not? I won't go for that. Good fiction, but not truth. If you believe this book tells the truth read the Bible for your self. I really don't believe you'll see anything that will lead you to believe the theory behind this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Catholic Bashing","review":"I had the misfortune of reading this whole series because I received it as a gift and couldn't easily exchange it. The characters are poorly developed, the choices they make are obvious and simple. The plot is so transparent that you can see through it. The book is amateurishly written and embarrasingly trite. The treatise of Buck and Chloe's \\"cookie sharing\\" in the second book was so saccharine I almost gave up reading it at that point.My biggest concern, even outweighing its amateurish presentation, is the continuous (and NOT subtle) attacks on the Catholic Church (particularly in \\"Tribulation Farce\\", er, \\"Force\\"). It's time for Christians to get past that and focus on what we agree on, not how we're different. This stuff is a retread of the same Protestant versus Catholic diatribe and slanderous use of biblical misinterpretation that has kept the Church separate since the \\"reformation.\\" The authors need to get off that holier than thou pulpit."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars: Generous.....","review":"A while back, I wanted to see what all the fuss what about the \\"Left Behind\\" series of books. So, I picked up the first few books and read through them in about a week. I soon realized this purely speculative rendition of the end times was mildly entertaining, but that was about it. I think this book, and the following editions amount to interesting books about the same level of writing as stories about gunfighters in the old west. The very fact that Lahaye is profiting off his version of the book of Revelation is slightly alarming, but this is the USA, and he can do, as he pleases.With all that said, this book was mildly entertaining, but purely speculative in nature. It seems every 100 years someone figures out this is going to be the end of time, and they can prove it.I wish Tim Lahaye would get back to teaching people how to study the bible, and less about worrying about the end of time.

This book is nothing but a less entertaining read and very inaccurate as to the book of Revelations. Go back to sunday school and learn more before writing incorrect info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Story, Silly Plot","review":"Not an interesting read, dumb plot. It's hard to believe that educated people believe this nonsense.Let's put two things together and see what we come up with. First, when bodies are buried, they begin to rot. Within a few months, a buried body turns to bones. Second, these bodies are supposed to resurrect to be with Jesus one day when he returns. Conclusion, rotted bodies are one day going to come out of their graves and float into the sky. I don't know about you but this sounds like a pretty frightening prospect and would be better described as a revised plot for Night of the Living Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sermon in Sheep's Clothing ...","review":"If it's \\"preaching to the choir\\" you want then this your book. If it's a good story you want then skip this thinly disguised revision of The Revelation. I left my copy on an airplane ... and then I disappeared."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it less than one star I would","review":"After hearing all the hype about this book my expectations may have been a little high. But I think my disappointment would have been as great even without the buildup. One reviewer pointed out that it was written for the 'low brow' crowd - readers of Clancy and Grisham were mentioned. I would have to disagree - this book is *much* worse than Clancy and Grisham. In fact it is the worst writing I've seen published. It may well be true that the story is exciting - but if you are used to grammatical and syntactically correct writing you might not be able to continue reading long enough to judge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing!","review":"In my opinion this book and its sequels (and who knows how many more there will be before these authors are done?) are more likely to drive people away from embracing Christianity than to win them over. Even if one accepts the literacy of the biblical prophecies from which the plot claims to derive, it will be impossible for the majority of intelligent readers to wade through the abysmally pitiful quality of the writing itself. The Bible itself, on the other hand, is richly, compellingly, and beautifully written. If LaHaye and Jenkins had helped author the New Testament, it would have vanished into obscurity centuries ago. Do these people have an editor? Hello?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning... for evangelicals only.","review":"Being a fan of end of the world type writing, I bought this at a used book store during my vacation after quickly reading the back cover. Missing a couple words on the summary was my downfall as this book is basically an evangelical message all the way through. I thought it was a bit odd how a christian conversion was mentioned heavily in the first few pages. After further reading i was dismayed to find this is an evangelical sstory and series...and a roughly written one at that. i gave up after about 100 pages. The early premise is based on israel being attacked by russia after israel creates a fertilizer that allows them to grow stuff anywhere. Why would russia attack over that? The poorly laid premise just allows the author to get into the heart of the religious message about a group that is trying to convert and save christians for the end of the world. religious folks will probably love it...everyone else, avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave this false teaching behind...","review":"Leave this false rapture teaching behind.

Fact of the matter is, I'm turned off by organized religion.OK, that said, I picked up this book at the urging of a friend. The best word for me to use was entranced. I was entranced. I read this book in 2 days (and that's WITH chasing a 2-year-old!) and am new reading #2 in the series.Above all, the book got me thinking, and that's a start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't reading supposed to be fun?","review":"I was horribly disapointed with 'Left Behind #1'. A great premise quickly bogs down into a dull tedious slog. I didn't enjoy the experience one bit ( It reads like the authors didn't enjoy the write much either). Not only was the characterization weak, there was no memorable action and the prose was lifeless and uninspired, some bits were just downright unbelievably corny. The only sense of wonder I was left with was where Mr. Jerry B. Jenkins and Mr. Tim F. Lahaye got the idea they would need so many different books to get their story across. Eleven installments of this! come off it guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Although the story itself is interesting. How could it not be? The Rapture? However, despite that and some very suspect conclusions about how everyone would react to such an event, the one thing that I didnt like was the writing. It was not very good and the characters were totally unsympathetic and unbelievable. I wanted to like this novel, but it was not to be. If you want end of the world stories by those who can write, try Earth Abides, Day of the Triffids or even The Stand. Stephen King's writing towers over these two."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIDN'T NEED A BOOK MARK!","review":"One of the best books I've read. Couldn't put it down.

This series is an example of both defects at once. If taken at all seriously, it is an intellectual and spiritual insult to Christians and non-Christians alike, and it reduces religion itself to an idiotic who's in, who's out fraternity initation rite with a pornographic obsession with imagining another's damnation. Read it as you might read Mein Kampf: just to experience how a dangerously wacky mind works. But it is so thoroughly trashy, that even at that level it is hard to stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Behind","review":"An unusual story that's not for most readers. It's based upon the controversial \\"rapture of the church\\" and the \\"tribulation\\" that follows. (To learn more about these 2 subjects you can search the web.) I found the story that revolved around the Investigative Newspaper Reporter interesting. However, the story that revolved around the Airline Pilot spent to much time preaching the virtues of religion. Thus the story was dragged out too long. And if you are not deeply religious you are certain to find the preaching overwhelms the story. Lastly, the first book ended in the middle of a climactic scene. This was surely done to interest you in buying the next book, however, I'll pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done.","review":"In their LEFT BEHIND series, Lahaye and Jenkins try to make their readers feel better about the \\"end times.\\" I'm sure that their books have turned many hearts toward Christ, but I find them to be very poorly done. The plot races along, leaving everything else in the book behind. The characters are undeveloped and are more like stock characters than real people. I've listened to intelligent people talk about these books--how terrific and \\"well written\\" they are. It makes me sad to think that these people, college-educated,professional people, can't tell the difference between good, polished writing, and a glossy-covered freshman English writing exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book of Revelation goes commercial","review":"This is a poorly written book. To call it a novel raises its credibility too high. This book reads like an 8th graders interpretation of an \\"end-times\\" Babptist sermon. Don't waste your money when you can get this message for free at any fundamentalist church."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor meal of a book","review":"Is this book were a meal, it would be a bowl of water thin apologetic soup, some hard cheese literalism, a club-you-over-the-head morality sandwich, a side of paper-thin character chips with a heaping bowl of word salad, to go.Although it definitely leaves a stong taste in your mouth, it's just not very filling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"Really liked this series but have been a fan of Tim LaHaye for a years. My husband and both sons read the whole sereies and could hardly wait for then next one to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"What would you do if you missed going to heaven?","review":"The premier book in the best-selling Left Behind series offers readers the opportunity to explore the option of what earth would look like and how people might respond if they missed the Rapture, (the taking of all believers to heaven). In the book, the main character Rayford Steele, has lost his wife to the Rapture, and thus begins the free-for-all quest of searching for other family members. Other characters emerge and attempt to begin a relationship with the God who had already called His people home, all the while fighting to survive a world lost in utter chaos. This book is an interesting perspective on the possibilities of life after what Christians call the Rapture.This was a book I reviewed for Tyndale House Publishers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic - A must read","review":"Left Behind is the best book ever! It's a great start to the series. If you like apocalyptic fiction this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All should read and heed","review":"I have read each book in the \\"Left Behind\\" series. I am an avid believer in the Bible and that it is the inspired word of God. I have come to believe that the \\"Left Behind\\" series, (though it's characters are fictional, it's foundation is Biblical,) is an \\"INSPIRED\\" writting. I would highly recommend this series to anyone, believer or not, who is in search of the truth about how things are to be in the end times. If, like myself you have ever read the book of Revelations but did not understand it, this series will bring what you have read to light. If you read this series with an open mind and a searching heart, it will inspire you too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Story on Earth","review":"When I first picked up this book and started to read it I really didn't understand what was going on. The next time I picked it up it made a whole lot more since to me. Everytime I picked it up to read it again I was excited about what was going to happen. This has been the best book I have ever read in my life. It is such a great book, if you start reading it you will have a hard time putting it down. It just gave me chills of excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"All who think this is good writing need to be taken by God..","review":"I have read some bad books before, but this is quite possible the worst one I have had the misfortune to pick up. I could not make it past page 75. Terrible writing, bad plot, one-dimensional characters. But hey, in a country where reality TV is such a hit, what do you expect, garbage sells! Of course, that will not change the minds of the religious zealots that have flocked to this series like a bunch of mindless sheep. Do yourself a favor, read something else...By the way, is there way to give this a negative 5?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Locustchopters,microchips and demons oh my!!!","review":"The left behind series is equal to the star trek series on TV. Highly entertaining but not much truth. Starting with this book and throughout the entire series many assumptions are made on scripture, but yet proclaimed as truth. Ever seen the word \\"microchip\\" in the bible? Neither have I.For entertainment purposes this is a fun series, but the way the authors and the boys from DTS< Dallas Theological Seminary> have pushed this book as being not that far from the truth.Lahaye has taken a relatively new perespevitve on eschatology, which is pre millennial dispensationalism, and has \\"brainwashed\\" over 65 million readers into believing that dispensationalism has always been there from day one.A honest one on one with your pastor or a brief study in Church History shows a way different approach to eschatology<last things>>.So sit back, have a good laugh and don't worry about demons in helicopters attacking you in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reminded me of L.Ron Hubbard's \\"science fiction\\"","review":"I bought this book because the premise looked interesting, and thought it might be an complex, intelligent science fiction story. Instead, I found that the characters were poorly developed, the writing was not very sophisticated (long portions of the story are told by long speeches with no logic or explanation) and the dialogue was contrived (e.g., there is a random anti-abortion passage that is plopped into the story with no context). Very disapppointing, considering this could have been a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE PROPAGANDA MINISTERS HAVE STRUCK AGAIN","review":"This book is written like a propaganda minister would've written about the Jews in WWII Germany. It is arrogant, self-serving, demonizing tripe, and it's pseudo-intellectual rants made me feel like the authors were signing me up for Sunday services. This book is not dangerous unless you believe that this will actually happen. If that's the case, I suggest you read Carl Sagan's \\"A Demon-Haunted World.\\" Maybe then you'll learn something about the world you live in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover horribly misleading.....","review":"I got this book last week at a local thrift store. I read the cover, back of book, 1st page, and reviews. Not once was it mentioned this was a religious propaganda book.

I'm betting it's on Jerry Falwell's 10 ten reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult to human intelligence!","review":"What a load of bunk. It is even a waste of time to write a review.

If you have any knowledge of End Times then you can not dispute the real life view points to this novel. The Characters are every day people just like you and I.

Read your Bible and see what it has to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, but poor writing","review":"My summary says it all. I am just doing my part to bring the overall rating of this book down. A very quick read with a great concept, but something is lost in the writing and blatant propaganda."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is very exciting and interesting","review":"The book Left Behind is great for kids my age. Jud learned that you can't get to heaven unless you believe in Jesus. It explains that you should listen to your parents because they only want the best for you.I'm looking forward to reading the next book in this great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"With God Nothing is Impossible?","review":"I'm not saying I didn't think the book was bad, but I just feel that is was a little implausable. The idea of a whole fleet of aircraft being destroyed by a storm is a little out there, but still it could happen. The fact that a man could rise from nothing to become a world leader. It's possible. But I have to draw the line on the UN wanting to move to \\"New Babalon.\\" That's just my spin on it. I also want to say that I can't wait to get my hands on the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Behind Series","review":"The Left Behind series of books are a good read. Each succeeding book continues the saga of Rayford Steele, his daughter, Buck Williams, and others that come into their lives as they try to survive in a world turned upside down after they are left behind at the Rapture of Jesus' belivers. You get to follow along as the people who are left behind try to find the truth behind all the disappearances and what it means. As you read each succeeding book you find out who discovers the truth, who doesn't, who the Antichrist is and his agenda, and how events lead to the numerous disasters and plagues that are predicted in the Bible. All-in-all a very satisfying series and a very good read in my humble opinion. I hopw this review helps. Enjoy the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many sequels are there going to be?","review":"Shouldn't the fact that they are going to come out with so many sequels suggest to you that the authors are in this solely for the money? Also, I find the author comment quite characteristic. All he (JBJ) can talk about is the number of copies sold... Now there is a real writer! As for the book, if you like \\"National Enquirer\\", you will love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show me some Truth!","review":"I have found that in the past Tim Lahaye has had a lot of Good things to say. But here is a good question for everyone who has read the book. Is that really the GOD you serve and Love? I think NOT! I could hardly even make it through the book because to be honest with you, if that is the kind of God I have now come to love, I would turn my back on HIM and Hope to Burn in hell forever. ( I MEAN THAT) This book talks about a GOD that does not exist. The God I know is Loving as a matter of fact my Bible says \\" God IS love.\\" this book has a very demented thinking on the last days. I think Lahaye and Jenkins need to go Back and study Revelations again. After they figure out God IS NOT Schitzophrenic. I do belive in the rapture and so on... but I believe that God has more influential power than the evil one of this world. God is not setting out to destroy everything he created especially me and you. God truly does love his children unconditionally with unfailing grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best way to read Revelations","review":"I was born and raised in a church and unable to ever understand the book of Revelations until I read this book and the ones that follow. Before I picked it up, I was on the edge of devoting my life to Christ and this series gave me the push I needed to commit. We all have the same doubts...that His second coming will not happen in our life time, but LaHaye and Jenkins lead us to believe otherwise. The characters are addicting and it is possible to become emotionally attached to each one; I have cried at more than one moment and that is not a regular occurance for me. I know my review will not outshine those that are already written, but I feel the need to share just how important this novel has been in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather give it ZERO stars, but that's not a choice","review":"TERRIBLE writing. Maybe if you had never read another work of fiction in your life, or a comic book, or seen any movie or cartoon, you may be able to think this was an OK book. But for the rest of us; the characters are one-dimensional, the plot is obvious, the \\"creativity\\" is lame, etc. It is disappointing that an interesting idea was implemented so poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gutter culture trash","review":"This book does nothing more than glorify fairy tales the gutter culture trash of our society try and use to molest our children.

The only reason anyone would slam this series is if it hit too close to home."},{"rating":"2","title":"The frighting truth twisted in with a great plot.","review":"\\"Left Behind\\" was a really good book, the people in it were believable.The authors did a wonderful job of mixing the horror of the Rapture with the fact that there was still hope for the Latter Day Saints. The way they made me believe that Nicloea Capathia was the best thing that could happen to Earth, and then reveiled his identity as the Antichrist was amazing. The thing that I like most was that they really pushed the point that with out God there was no way anyone could survive the seven years of tribulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope for agnostic loved ones!","review":"Many of my loved ones reject the Mesianic message.My response has been to try to model the Christian life and to love them unconditionally.They are \\"turned off\\" by any evangelical attempts.My agnostic husband (who reads the newspaper) told me he had heard that many people accepted Christ after reading the first book, Left Behind. I found it by running a \\"Christian fiction\\" search in my local public library, where I found a total of 10 books! Knowing nothing about it, I reserved it anyway. I have new hope for my beloved unbelievers; the shere popularity of this series is bound to affect them. I was broken-hearted to have finished the Mitford series.

The writing is skin-deep, badly organized, and hardly moving. The premise sounds interesting, but it's never taken anywhere, just squandered on terrible prose, plot and small minds.If you're a Christian who thinks that any book that tries to shove Jesus in the reader's face is holy, go ahead and read it. But for the smart fraction of our population, and those spiritual men and women who refuse to let tripe like this represent their beautiful faith--or, in other words, know good writing from bad writing--stay far, far away from this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written Propaganda","review":"What I was hoping to be a gripping fictional account of the rapture turned out to be a poorly written piece of propaganda.Seeing others review it as well written is frustrating. The writing is flimsy and disjointed...not worthy of an honorable mention in a high school writing contest.A book with this plot could have been a spectacular work with a fresh view of Christian beliefs...instead I see it as just a cheap vehicle for an elitist and arrogant message.The idea that a great portion of the Earth's population will be \\"left behind\\" is, in my opinion, absurd. However, I respect that this concept is embraced by many.I also suspect that the very wide margins, large print and more than ample spacing between lines were used to add size and physical depth to the book...to make it appear more than it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"It is often unfortunately rare to find engrossing fiction work by contemporary \\"Christian\\" authors. This book was not just good Christian fiction, it was great fiction, period.

This book is on the best seller list? How laughable! The story is simplistic and preachy, the characters one dimensional and unsympathetic, and the plot is sloppy and heavy handed. It seems to me the only reason this book was written was to push the authors' viewpoints on the rest of us. Basically what they're saying is, if you're not a Believer you're doomed to Hell for eternity. Give me a bloody break! Ridiculous from start to finish. Don't even waste your money and time on this turgid piece of writing.

The writers, LaHaye and Jenkins, make the mistake of treating the reader as if he were an idiot; the characters are paper-doll-thin and the writing itself doesn't hold together. Duh, is this right wing, Christian fundamentalist literature, or what? The major characteristic by which the authors signify that the antichrist in the book is the antichrist is the fact that he favors disarmament. Give me a break, you gun-toting, holier than thou, so-called Christians. Please don't try to pass this one off as serious fiction.

No one else considers that maybe this Carpathia is the antiChrist?). The motivations and behavior of the characters are sometimes unintentionally hilarious, especially those of this Hattie character who has nothing better to do but continue to call some reporter she met briefly on the airplane!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking and provocative!","review":"To date, I read / listened to Left Behind, Tribulation Force, and Nicolae and have thoroughly enjoyed them. I plan to read / listen to the remaining three books (Soul Harvest, Apollyon, and Assassins) in the near future. The experience has inspired me to finish reading the gospels according to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Thereupon, I will attempt to read Revelation. Why do I want to read Revelation? Well, in the event that I am not raptured, I want to know exaclty what will happen to me (and what I need to do to be saved before my death). However, I plan to be raptured. Why do I make such a claim? Well, because I have accepted Jesus Christ as my lord and savior and truly know that he died for my sins and rose three days later. I try daily live according to His teachings.I recommend that you read Left Behind. It is insightful and truly based on a Christian theme. I truly believe that your life will be changed. It has changed mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Best","review":"I have to say this book is one of the best Christian based nolels I have read in a very long time. This book has everything. Even a little romance. I'm not really sure what the end times will be like. But this is a great fiction book and to anyone who have not read the other two Tribulation Force and Nicole you really should check them out. I am counting the days till the next one come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read first three book - excellent and thought provoking!","review":"I started reading the first three books on a Thursday and couldn't put them down untill I had all three read. Then I was disappointed that I finished so fast and would have to wait till August for Soul Harvest. I am a constant reader of all topics and types of books, but very few have kept me so engrossed and fasinated. They are now being shared and read by my sisters (6), so there is at least seven I know who love them.Also, today, I picked up Soul Harvest. Thank you for not waiting till August. Also, to the person who wanted to know if a picture is going to be made, the jacket cover revealed that the first two novels are in the process of being made into a movie -- no other details.Anyway, my review -- great read -- should be on everyones list as a Must Read Chronicle (7 books total). Even if you don't agree, it will make you stop and think about things in a different light. To the Authors --- Thank You!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has changed my life , It might can yours","review":"I loved this book because it has given me a bigger out look on life.I also has made me change the waythe way I feel about god.My favorite character was rayford. he was going through a hard time were he did not believe in god and his wife was begging hem to go to church with the family.then one night he comes home one night to were his wife and children are gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay subtext?","review":"Tim and Jerry can't write... or can they? These books are a hoot, and has anyone else noticed the hinted-at-but-never-consumated attraction between Buck and Rayford? After all, two guys trying to get right with Jesus can't come right out and hold hands! Perhaps the clumsy prose is only a clever disguise for some of the most delicious gay subtext this side of Dr. Pretorius. Christian fiction? Tim and Jerry may be grandmaster pranksters equal to Andy Kaufman himself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth is, no matter what your religion","review":"I am a firm Christian, so I have no problem with the message in this series. I do have a big problem with the quality. The first book isn't too bad, but it quickly goes downhill from there. The authors' dwindling effort and obvious absence of fresh ideas becomes insulting by the fourth book. For religous people like myself, this is an insult, and for non-religous people who are perhaps looking for God, this strikes me as the quickest way to kill that thirst for God. all these books are going to do is remind them of why they don't like religion. these books are NOT representative of my faith. A book like We All Fall Down tackles the same subject with intellegence, wit, and true drama. It puts Left Behind to shame. it's a real shame that these books are so popular, because the Christian faith is so much more intellegent and spiritual than these books even TRY to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can't Make Corned Beef from Cardboard","review":"The writing in the book is good which is why I gave it the respect of skimming the whole thing long after I would have normally dropped it. Religious allegory, parable or symbolism just does not translate to reality. The story of Abraham taking Isaac up to kill him because God tells him to is not a book about obedience to God but an insane man who believes he is supposed to kill his child. The story about Jesus healing someone because they managed to touch his robe turns into an obsessive fan willing to do anything to touch their idol. You cannot write a credible story about Adam and Eve and their son's magically appearing wives. This story likewise just does not translate to reality. The story is immediately distorted by the preposterous flow of events that in no way resemble what would happen in the real world. For whatever meanings different Christians draw from this the world over -- it still does not play out as a credible CNN live report novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT READ.","review":"THIS BOOK PRESENTS A SCRIPTURAL TOPIC WITHOUT IT BEING PREACHY.

The characters are weak, the continuity wobbles and the biblical references are sketchy. The authors assume a huge leap of faith, and then, simply repeat the message. I wonder if this message could not be conveyed more effectively in a pampflet or perhaps serialized in a tabloid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Behind: Not a Very Good Book","review":"This book was poorly written, and the plot development was below average at best. The authors are extremely repetitive, and they present a very unbelievable Antichrist. I found it very hard to identify with the characters, and I thought the entire book was unrealistic. I would not recommend this book to anyone but a diehard fundamentalist Christian that can look past the bad writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gaggingly blatant propaganda","review":"If I could give this book a minus star, I would, but since one star means \\"I hate it,\\" that rating seems appropriate. The series had been recommended highly to me and I was looking forward to reading it. In the first couple of pages, I could see that it was blatant propaganda, interspersed with a little bit of plot. I made it through half the the book before I hurled it across the room in disgust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Behind Video Review","review":"Length:: 2:06 MinsWhat if? Nobody knows exactly how the future events of end-times prophecy will unfold.

Those who remain have been \\"Left Behind.\\"I hope you enjoy the video"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad theology","review":"This book is poorly written and presents really bad theology. The writers have no concept of Apocalyptic literature and its role in the early Christian church. They also fail to share that the word \\"rapture\\" never even appears in the Biblical text and the very concept of the rapture has only been around for about 150 years. There is nothing Biblical about this book and it's a sad commentary on the Christian faith that they have been so successful in selling this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanna be left behind","review":"Is this what moronic evangelical Christians are reading? The Heaven's Gate cult made more sense. What absurd nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre-millenialist propaganda","review":"First of all, this book was horribly written. The narrative voice reminded me of someone who'd taken a formula writing class. Secondly, the view of the \\"end times\\" represented therein is a view of dispensationalist pre-millenialism which surfaced at the end of the 19th century; the theologians of that time found it heretical. Not only does dispensationalism take an extremely dogmatic approach to Biblical prophecy, but it also tends to reflect a Western Imperialist mindset. The Bible was a Middle-Eastern text, and Middle-Eastern Christians do not agree with dispensationalism. Especially since it tends to support the fascist state of Israel and the Zionist conquest which dispossesed millions of Palestinians and was responsible for great massacres. Ask a Palestinian Christian what s/he thinks about \\"Left Behind\\" and you'll probably receive an earful. This book's view supports an oppressive philosophy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive religious tract","review":"This review process fores me to provide a rating, the lowest of which is one star. This book deserves a minus rating. Shame on the publishing industry, from author to publisher to bookseller, for not stating outright that this is a Born-again-Christian, Jews-for-Jesus tract, masquerading as science fiction, with a plot line that's obvious very early on, one-dimensional characters, naive writing and so much preaching. I should have informed myself more thoroughly before ordering the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgive me","review":"Until this book was published, I never realized just how un-Christian I was in my belief that the Prince of Peace really wanted to bring peace to the world.

My religious training assured me that I could not go to God for help because I was bad and he really had some strong punishment in mind for me. When I discovered this all to be a lie, I discovered a source of love that could heal any pain. The authors and fans of this book are insuring that many children will feel as I did. Great work guys and girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, I did not no writing this poorly was legal","review":"I have always enjoyed reading about society recovering from apocalyptic disaster. So, I thought mix in the Bible's book of Revelations and modern fiction and you would have a winning formula, right? Wrong! These are some of the most poorly written pages I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Everything about the book is flat. The settings: flat. The characters: flat. Nothing is brought to life in any way. Everything written here feels very contrived. I could go on for days about how terrible this book was but I would end up getting a cramp in my wrists from typing so much. If you have any dignity, or actually care about what you put into your head, avoid this book, and its 11 or so sequels, like the Bubonic Plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing!","review":"I haven't actually read this book, nor do I plan to do so, but I hope Ann from South Dakota can spare some time to tell us all how her husband manages to read any books without turning pages.

The 12 books, if made into a trilogy of three slightly-longer books, would have been tighter and a much better read. I'm afraid that weak writing and a story that was S-T-R-E-T-C-H-E-D into 12 volumes so obviously on purpose to sell books hurts our witness and makes it harder for other Christian fiction to enter the mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Hour","review":"This was in the discard pile at the library. I can see why. Bad writing. Bad story. Shallow characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible book","review":"Okay, friends, this is not a fictional rendition of \\"what the Bible says.\\" It's an attempt to promulgate Dispensational Premillenerianism, which is 150-year old opinion about what will happen at the end of the world. It's cobbled together by a selective reading of various passages of Scripture, taken out of context and imaginatively interpreted. And that's the key- if you take the Bible literally, as God's Word, why would you buy into an opinion that is nothing but interpretation?Plus, the writing's really, really lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating ideas written in dumbed-down language","review":"The authors have good intentions (and an agenda), but from the first page it's painfully obvious that they have no idea how to create suspense or compelling characters or how to write memorable dialogue. We're constantly told how intelligent and charismatic the main characters are, but we'll just have to take the authors' word for it because they don't know how to make language be anything but banal. I can't imagine who is buying this book and actually enjoying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Only Preaches to the Converted.","review":"This is not simple fiction, folks. It is a preaching tool for Christians to scare people into following them and their religion. Since talk of Hell doesn't seem to bother anyone anymore, propagandists LaHaye and Jenkins have used \\"The Rapture\\" as a contemporary way of scaring people into \\"falling in line.\\" After all, who would possibly want to be denied the lavishness of heaven by being \\"left behind?\\" The authors do not wish readers to think of this as mere fiction, but as a warning for a future that they are convinced is coming.Make no mistake. This is not intended as simple science-fiction, or a light Sunday afternoon read. The intent is to convince you that if you do not follow the path that Christians follow, you will be \\"Left Behind.\\" It's arrogant, pushy, and should be seen for what it is: A blatant, recruiting tool for Christianity using fiction and fear as their main weapon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I had a hard time finishing this first book of the series. It was good, but the writing didn't flow very well. I read the second book out of curiosity and COULD NOT put it down! I have just finished the sixth book and I can't wait for the seventh! The books just kept getting better. The series really makes you stop and think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting!","review":"At first I wasnt sure I'd like the book and didnt plan on reading the series, but I'm on book 2 now! Sure some of it is a tad corny (love story part) but everything else actually gives you something to really think about. It's easy to read and understand and seems to read pretty quicky for such a big book. I'd recommend it if you don't like complicated action packed books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Behind will take your imagination away","review":"I am never that much of a reader. I have to admit that I picked up the book just for a school project for my English class. Oh great, another book to read. I open up the page and it is actually so hard to put down. I mean that has never happened to me before. And since i have heard of when Jesus and God will return for his people, the book makes the reality of what will happen come to such reality. If you are a christian and if you are not, you should still read this book because it is very real and very well created. Wonderful work by Tim Lahaye and Jerry B. Jenkins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story about the last days of mankind","review":"This book tells about the last days of mankind; specifically about the rapture when genuine Christians are taken out of this world to be with Christ. The tribulation period begins, as the Bible refers to it. \\"Left Behind\\" shows us that it's no fun to be left behind, and tells this biblical principles in a story of the main characters. The tension keeps on going, from page to page and it's a highly interesting read. It's time to consider a few things in your life. Another book that is highly recommended as it deals very realistically with the nearing end of humanity and the threat of supernukes in the Far East, is the powerful megathriller \\"The Consultant\\" by Alec Donzi."},{"rating":"2","title":"The left behind series","review":"I found the entire Left behind series of books to be a warm suspensful way to bring forth a new message of spiritualism, in a very easy to absorbe story line.I found it to be easily understood, and to visualize the goings on. The story unfolds, with each section being given a seperate vein, that all ties together as you keep reading. The story tellers have done a wonderful job weaving the bible into a terrific followable way that people can relate to. I throughly enjoyed reading the first six; and couldn't wait for the newest one, The Mark. It's interesting that the writers keep you in suspence until near the end of a particular novel where they let you in on the potential newest book to come out. Much like a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"The plot was great, though I do not like the parts about buck in love with chloe like its some soap opera"},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary Hell","review":"After slogging through all 12 books of this series, I feel compelled to write this short review, if for no other reason that saving a few souls from illiteracy hell.

If you want the truth, then keep right on walking. I have studied Bible prophecy for the past 40 years, and though I do lean toward a belief in a \\"catching away\\" of believers (rapture) and a seven year tribulation on earth, this book is about 10 percent truth and 90 percent total balderdash. There is no reason to get so wrapped up in something that will not happen the way the authors describe. What we as Christian believers are to do is to live our lives loving the Lord and our fellow man and leave the rest to Him.

I cannot think of anything good to say about this \\"novel\\" other than it does, at some point, end. But that is not necessarily true, considering there are over ten books of this insipid drivel. The characters are 2-dimensional. The main character's name is Rayford Steele for the love of God! I enjoy post-apocalyptic stories, and I thought an interpretaion of Revelations sould not be bad. I was wrong. The plot is very contrived and predictable. Not to mention the \\"hidden\\" agenda of the authors to prosetylize and convert you. All in all, there is nothing good about this novel.

The most important, I believe, is that it distorts Christianity into a sham fundamentalist caricature of the Good News of Jesus Christ. The language of prayer and redemption is so far removed from the teachings of Christ: to be saved or \\"born again,\\" according to this book, is a \\"transaction\\" with God. Transaction!

Parts of the books would be laugh out loud funny if they weren't so frightening.But the truly fascinating part is the number of people (tens of millions) who actually find this hate-mongering trash to be inspirational.

This movie, to me, is one of the best horror flicks of all time. Very scary, indeed!! Definitely gets 4 stars!!!Of course Tom Hanks, (the cute jogger in the woods) steals the show. The only thing is, the poor girl (Elizabeth Kemp)didn't get a chance to go out on a date with him, especially after she got up the nerve to get his attention during a jog in the woods.

It sets up a simple plot (psycho killer murders brides-to-be), tosses in a few stock characters, and lets loose with the standard genre conventions (people wandering off by themselves, the 'dead' killer rising up for another round, etc.). The film's key strength is Tom Rolfing's genuinely chilling portrayal of the mute, unhinged maniac. Unfortunately, you have to put up with a lot of lame padding to make it to his key scenes (many of which rip off John Carpenter's \\"Halloween,\\" but at least do it well).Other than that, fans of pop culture will enjoy picking out several actors who appeared in this movie before achieving 'real fame': Paul Gleason (\\"The Breakfast Club,\\" \\"Die Hard\\") as a standard-issue cop; James Rebhorn (\\"The Game,\\" \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\") as an adulterous college professor, and yes, Tom Hanks as a cocky psychology student."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad, it's good.","review":"The classic tale of a bride, a spree killer, and a would-be suitor named \\"Marvin\\".A movie that captures like no other the year 1980, featuring (in a small role) the post-\\"Bosom Buddies\\" Tom Hanks, hairstyles caught in the nether world between \\"feathered\\" and \\"permed\\", jogging, 1st-Person-Halloween-style camerawork and a prominent Moog soundtrack.Loads o' fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad but true","review":"I saw this movie back on cable in the 80's when it came out, infact it was Halloween.

I had told my girlfriend about the movie and even though she doesn't like this kind of movie she watched it anyway. She wasn't scared or creeped out in any way infact we were both extremely bored with it (the only good thing about it was the fish tank scene). This movie was better in my youth simply because I didn't know any better, that and the fact that my babysitter was so freaked out.

I read the entire book hoping the author's wonderful writing style would be found, but alas it was not to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to His Standards","review":"As a long time Hillerman fan, this book was not up to his standards.

I hope Hillerman goes back to his stories of life in the southwest and Navajo culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillerman is on auto pilot","review":"I love Tony Hillerman. I have read every book he has written including all his Chee/Leaphorn books, his children's book, his coffee table book, his memoir, his non-fiction books, etc. I even liked \\"Finding Moon\\". Having said this, his last several Chee/Leaphorn books are delivering a diminishing return of enjoyment. \\"The Sinister Pig\\" is an acceptable novel but without question the worst Chee/Leaphorn book to date. The books feel particularly strained in how Hillerman tries to bring all of the series characters (Chee, Leaphorn and Bernie) together in unlikely and implausible ways despite their natural separation by age, jobs and hundreds of miles. What I most enjoy about Hillerman are his steady pacing, sense of the environment and interweaving of Navajo and western culture. All of this is present in this novel. What is missing is carefully plotting and crisp dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Hillerman getting lazy, tired or sick?","review":"I've read all of Hillerman's books, and this one is a major disappointment. It reads like a very rough first draft, a plot sketch. If you pay attention to the bewildering number of characters, the plot plods resolutely forward, no surprises -- and none of the intricate twists that Hillerman has dazzled us with in previous books. The characters are thinly developed (so-o-o-o little tension between major love interests) and seldom manage to rise above pot-boiler level. Unlike his other books that take place on the reservation, there is no interesting information about native Americans, their history, culture, etc. About the only thing this book CAN claim to do is keep you turning the pages. You keep believing that surely the real Tony Hillerman will appear to delight you. Alas, he's asleep at the wheel. It's a shame to see such a talent settle for so little.I am one disappointed fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring disappointment","review":"I agree with many other of the negative reviews, I found Sinister Pig to be a boring disappointment. The Jim Chee character has always had romance problems and I always thought they were poorly written about; however, I could speed read through and ignore those portions and still greatly enjoy the book because of its strengths, the various tribal cultural, religious and mythological connections to a crime mystery, and descriptions of the Four Corners high desert landscape. Those strong aspects were missing from this book. If he must include romantic relationships in his books, Mr. Hillerman should join up with a successful romance novelist. If you're a Hillerman fan, skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointed!","review":"I am a big fan of all mystery and crime novels, so naturally I went out to get this book. I was sadly disappointed, and almost regret my purchase. There wasn't the usual umph I feel from his novels. I do have one spark of good that came out of this.

I would read that one again over this anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillerman passes his expiration date","review":"What a disappointment! My dad and I share a love for Mr. Hillerman's novels, and I eagerly look forward to the chance to share the books as gifts for Father's Day, birthday, or Christmas. Hillerman's been going downhill for the last few books but this one is without a doubt the worst in the series. The somewhat promising premise is wasted with a connect-the-dots plot with nothing at stake and shallow, one-dimensional portrayals of the beloved main characters. The book hadn't even been proof-read, for heaven's sake. If Tony Hillerman actually wrote this book, it's time to hang it up and enjoy his retirement. As for me, I'll never tire of revisiting his great novels of the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Hillerman's best, but still solid and entertaining.","review":"Tony Hillerman is such an accomplished writer, it's understandable that some reviewers are somewhat disappointed by this effort. Hillerman does an excellent job of presenting details of American Indian culture without resorting to the preachy tone some \\"politically correct\\" authors would use, and these details are missed in this novel. This novel also seems to lack some of the plot twists of some of Hillerman's earlier works-it winds up reading more like a straightforward crime story than the mysteries Hillerman has created in the past. These criticisms aside, I enjoyed the novel. It's a quicker read than some of Hillerman's earlier works, yet it still throws in a couple of twists. The characters Hillerman has created are interesting, and it's enjoyable to read another novel involving them. In short, the novel has its faults, but on balance I enjoyed it, and I look forward to reading Hillerman's new novel soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst in the series.","review":"An interesting plot but all of Hillerman's strengths, careful delineation of place and characters is absent. Any characters from any author could fill the roles. Is someone writing for Hillerman now? I won't pay money for any further novels by this author until his writing improves.A shame because his early novels are among my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"I normally enjoy Mr. Hillerman's works, and have a collection I like to return to over and over. This one, sadly, went straight into the box to go to the used book store. The editing was so horrible as to be a joke. It makes one wonder if his writing has always been this bad, and some UberEditor has been working magic for all these years, or if he was just under a huge rush to meet contractual obligations and couldn't be bothered to actually write a decent book.It is also disappointing in that the story could have been exceptional, given a bit of care. This is an important issue to all the tribes, but should be just as important as a history lesson to all Americans as an indicator of just how corrupt the American government was in the past, and remains today.Next time, I will take a little trip to the library before I automatically add the next Hillerman novel to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sinister Pig","review":"Juvenile dialog. In one scene a line is attributed to a character not even in the scene. Found that my daughter can write a better and more descriptive story that what I paid $... for. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillerman's mailing it in","review":"Disappointing. Hillerman tries to include the whole gang -- not just Joe, Jim and Bernie, but Cowboy Dashee and Professor Bourbonette -- as well as stock baddies from Washington, a psychopathic hit man and allusions to the oil/gas royalty scandal. But he loses interest in too many of his red herrings, and the story limps along. Still, Hillerman fans will buy it, and read it. But for the third time running (\\"Wailing Wind,\\" \\"Hunting Badger\\") he's really not making the effort. He should have stopped with \\"Fallen Man,\\" one of his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not worth paying for hardcover","review":"As appealing as Jim Chee is, as sweet and naive as his Border Patrol almost girlfriend may be, this is a bad plot. The villans are too obvious and tiresome.I have real trouble with the ex-CIA pilot turned hero; the crowd would boo this one in a movie. It's just too way-out-there.Maybe Mr. Hillerman has nothing left to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fall from Grace","review":"I have read most of Mr. Hillerman's Chee/Leaphorn books and enjoyed all of them, even the early ones that lacked the depth of his later works, but this book left me cold. Every character of worth Hillerman created had to have spot in this book, and many didn't fit well. This was too contrived to hold interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should stick to writing about the Southwest","review":"This is not his best work. Hillerman writes beautifully about the Southwest, but knows nothing at all about Washington, DC. The parts of this book that deal with New Mexico are up to his usual high standards - although as another reviewer points out, one character's transfer into the Border Patrol is less than realistic.However, Hillerman's Washington section and characters are straight out of a comic book. Part of the charm of his other novels has been the realism of the setting and the complexity of his characters. The DC-related people would be comfortable in any number of shallow thrillers. They sharply lower the quality of this book.Hillerman should stick to writing about areas he knows. This could have been a fascinating book dealing with the looting of Native American trust accounts if he had limited his scope."},{"rating":"1","title":"A genuwine pig","review":"I first read Mr. Hillerman in 1973 or so. I enjoyed his wonderful blend of Navajo atmosphere and crime.He has been straying. As he gets off the rez, his books lose their impetus. This book is a great example. Very little to do with Navajo interaction with the larger culture. A lot to do with a pretty silly plot. At many points in the book, I found myself re-reading it, trying to figure out how X happened, as it seems to have been edited very slackly as well.Can't recommend this book, unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Hillerman mystery ever?","review":"Characters you don't care about, exposition instead of action, Leaphorn and Chee MIA for much of the story...this one has it all.

Now, suddenly, we have kindergarten plotting, cartoon characters, and, unbelievably, clunky, almost amateurish writing. Even the best of them produce a turkey one in a while, and I guess this is Hillerman's. Let's hope he's back on form next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"is hillerman losing it ?","review":"i wouldn't bother with this one. it is a crashing bore. hillerman has been on a slide the past few years. he has reached bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who actually wrote The Sinister Pin?!","review":"I have been a faithful and avid follower of Mr. Hellerman's books not so much for the mystery as for the interest in lore and traditions, beliefs, syntax of the the various indian tribes of the American Southwest. An opportunity to actually be invited into the indian everyday world nicely intertwined with the fluff of the mystery. Anticipating each new story, the only mystery to me here is...who wrote this pale facsimile...surely not Mr. Hellerman. Or if he is infact the creator, he missed badly on this one. I felt a similar shadow of doubt with Skelton Man and can only hope Mr. Hellerman's next offering will be back on track! A Hillerman mystery without the indian stuff\\" generously mixed in,is well, just a pulp mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thin Pig","review":"I think the author needed to flesh out his bank account, and so Hillerman fans will be disappointed at this novelette. All the depth of knowledge and depth of plot one cherishes in the other Chee/Leaphorn adventures is missing.A quick pleasant read, with a predictable plot, but don't expect more than that. The reader does learn a tad about Chee's vapid relationship to women, but even that is thinly treated, and it plays out foreseeably. This is not a Hillerman novel I will re-read. Glad I found it at the library, it will not be put on my own shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not up to Mr. Hillerman's par.","review":"I was disappointed with this latest of Mr. Hillerman's books. I have read all of his books, fact and fiction. But this is too far roaming and so far from his normal stories.I am sure that he will return to his excellent way of portraying Chee and the others in murders around Shiprock. At least I hope so. I have always been a fan and will stick with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Summer Read!","review":"Another winner by Mr. Hillerman! The plot is not nearly as complex as Wailing Wind, and perhaps has some unlikely events, but all in all, I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. The aspects of Washington politics are rather chilling, and maybe all too true."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hyper-speed read with new direction","review":"After reading Sinister Pig, you might think the plot too improbable, however, I enjoyed the change of direction. At least once in awhile. The setting still takes place in the deserts of the Southwest, however Navajo lore is not the focus. A new villian appears in the form of a Washington, D.C. powerbroker. The villian is somewhat simplistic but one of his henchmen is not and that makes up for it. It was a very fast read and I found myself satisfied at the end. Hillerman is Hillerman! And he is still damn good at what he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"hillerman's worse","review":"The plot in this was so far fetched and unrealistic as to be appalling. No where near his usual standards. To understand the characters you have to have read other books in the seris. This is not a stand alone book. Mr. Hillerman must have needed the money to write and publish a novel so inept."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I am a devoted Hillerman fan and have read (and sometimes re-read) all of his books. I anxiously awaited publication of Sinister Pig to feed my Hillerman Jones.I don't know who wrote this book, but it wasn't Hillerman. It was poorly plotted, with weak character definition and bad dialog.What's a fan to do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the reservation","review":"This is one of Tony Hillerman's weakest mysteries, but it's worth reading for a plot twist that will make it interesting for long-term Hillerman fans.I suggest, as others have, that you first read several of the earlier books in the series to get to know Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, the Navajo detectives who surely deserve a place in the hall of fame for fictional detectives. You won't be able to appreciate fully this book without being familiar with the back story.Contrary to Hillerman's usual practice, most of the action in this book takes place off the Navajo reservation, way down in the New Mexico bootheel near the Mexican border. Hillerman's usual weaving of Indian culture into his mysteries is mostly absent. Hillerman also preaches in this novel, a bit unusual for him. He argues against the US war on drugs as futile and harmful and he exposes the theft of billions of dollars from Indian tribes by fraud in the payment of royalties on oil and gas revenues.Smallchief"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Hillerman Lost It ?","review":"What a disappointment. I wait for each new story that Tony Hillerman writes, hoping it will be as good as his last. Hillerman's first books were fantastic but the last several, Wailing Wind and Sinister Pig in particular, have not been up to what we expect. Sinister Pig was not good at all. It didn't even read like Hillerman. I hope he hasn't \\"lost it\\" as a writer. I am hoping that someone else is writing these books and he is only putting his name on the cover. If you are interested in a writer who is getting better instead of going downhill, who writers the same kind of stories as Hillerman, try Margaret Coel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seller, quick shipping.","review":"This book came quickly and was in the condition stated. Having spent some time with the Navajo people, it is refreshing to read a work that gets it right about our Native American friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"The best I can say is the audio book kept me awake on a long drive. The book barely resembles the early Hillerman ones I remember, and is sort of a mix of generic Crichton-Grisham political/crime suspense with a little romance and a little New Mexico flavor thrown in for old-times sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable at Times, Inconsistent at Others","review":"My overall impression was that this book could have been written from the script of a made-for-TV movie. Maybe visually--with rugged scenery and good looking actors--this story could have been a way to spend a couple of hours on a rainy night, but as a book worth reading it comes up lacking. In particular, the villains are second-rate and only do villainous things when it suits the author's purposes. Then, the number of proper nouns used per page is probably second only to the Bible, owing to the naming of many extraneous characters and places.This book is okay for reading on a long train ride or a stay in the hospital, but it is not one you'd recommend or long remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a pig","review":"This book comes nowhere near the quality of most of Hillerman's work. It fails to generate interest or suspense and the relationship between Chee and Manuelito is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad falling off","review":"Reading Tony Hillerman's latest, I was at first thrilled by the congregation of old friends - Jim, Joe, Bernie, Cowboy et al - and a return to the delightfully atmospheric Four Corners. Then not too many pages further, my elation was undermined by a pathetically weak plot, a non-dimensional villan and female victim, and a rush to the totally predictable and maudlin denouemont. Let's hope that Tony finds a second wind; these characters and northern New Mexico are too good to waste on a comic book story."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS BOOK","review":"Terrific.

It is detached, relatively objective considering the authors' bias in favor of the subject, doesn't hype or hard-sell and, on the whole, would be a valuable addition to any investor's bookshelf. If you're a relative beginner, your shelf will also need to include a dictionary of financial terms - the authors assume you already know the vocabulary. And who is the Graham cited in the title? He is Benjamin Graham, who all but invented security analysis. With coauthor David Dodd, he produced the book Security Analysis in 1934. Later, Graham wrote The Intelligent Investor. Both books are investment classics and have been revised and re-issued. This one may endure, as well, based on its thorough exposition on how to value a company and its instructive profiles of value investing heavyweights. Our recommendation: strong buy, long term hold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Try","review":"Not a bad stab at the basics, but the debt owed to others is immense. One third of the book consists of excerpts from Warren Buffett's Essays, disorganized, and better read in the collection THE ESSAYS OF WARREN BUFFETT: LESSONS FOR CORPORATE AMERICA (a full compilation by topic, well organized and rave reviewed). The hats off to some other top investors too, whose profiles are shallow and would be better to read them directly too. The rest is a skeleton outline, better delivered in several other books on the masters like Buffett and teacher Ben Graham (neither of whom, incidentally, even believe there is such a thing as the title of this book suggests there is--value investing is a redundancy they say, though the authors of this book don't grasp that basic point)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turkey and Where is the Beef?","review":"There is simply not enough value in this book to justify using it. I'm sorry but words like Alta Vista and Cisco just should not appear anywhere in a value investing book. Period and discussion over. At least not up to the present. Maybe in the future but I doubt it. Also there is way too much verbage to describe much of nothing. The modern budding value investor would be better served by other book including Security Analysis by Graham. A lot of detail is missing here and much of the analysis leaves one wondering if the authors know what value investing really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vibrant and lively","review":"Guitarist Izzo is vibrant and lively and this provides newly remastered tracks from his previous albums plus three new ones.

It's all taken right out of Mapplethorpe, Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. In fact, a couple of the shots are such obvious copies of Weber's work that Weber ought to be suing this guy (if he cared to stoop). Even if you aren't bothered by lack of originality and are just looking for a bit of a turn-on, you won't find much in that department either.

The section on nutrition is quite outside the box, but completely disproven by modern studies. The book is also fairly short and full of inapproapriate pictures.All this would be tolerable, were it not for the finished copy. It reads as if written by a dyslexic monkey. It's choc full of typos, and even where these aren't present the text is often unclear.

This is an easy, light read with enjoyable characters. LaFoy pens two more in this series about the heroine's (Caroline) sisters, Simone and Fiona. I actually read those before I read this one, and although it's been a while, I remember enjoying those as well. I plan to go back and reread them now that I've read this one, and look forward to it.

At the time, it was unusual to see her in a comedy after viewing her in tough crime or sex-type movies for awhile. (I didn't see this film until 10 years after it had been released.) She's a decent comedienne, like her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin) has turned out to be, too.The comedy is more chuckles than guffaws. For parents wondering about the film: there is the usual too-liberal \\"values\\" espoused here, such as sex on the first date is \\"cool,\\" and a few other things involving a cute teen daughter.

After watching this movie one can only come to the conclusion that good Comedic Acting is an Alien Concept to Ms. Basinger. This movie is redeemed soley by the performance of Jon Lovitch who has excellent taste in cars and is the only funny guy in this entire movie.

I can't wait until they come out with a full length album.Track 1: Paper House-This track is the best on the disc, this was the song they relesed as the actually single. It has great instrumentals and equally great voacls with awesome lyrics backing it up.Track 2: Fall From The Sky-This track is really good, it gives off the sound and leaves me with the impression that these guys could be big, if they got out there and made themselves known. When i say Big i mean Sum 41 and Blink 182 Big.Track 3: Sera Tonin-This and Paper House are two of my favourite songs around. I have this song playing almost non stop in my room 24/7. I love the guitar riff at the start of the song and it just gets better and better.Anyways if you like good rock maybe classifyed as Emo then you will love this cd.

The author not only talks about the shift that is \\"coming soon,\\" she gives you an experience of it here and now. Her style of writing is unique, to say the least, and is not easy reading, but I found by not trying to understand the words intellectually, I was able to allow the words to penetrate to a deeper level. At that point something in the brain shifted and a whole new multidimensional reading experience opened up. It's kind of like those 3-D pictures that are totally impenetrable in 2-D, but if you relax the focus in a particular way, a whole new three-dimensional experience opens up. I would suggest reading the introduction first.

Lucky me! This is one of the most beautiful music collections I have ever heard. I don't say this lightly. I'm a musician. I grew up listening to jazz and playing classical music in the school band. I've been playing since I was 8 and I am so happy to finally see such a perfect mix of jazz and classical music. Keiko has an astounding sense of placement and beauty. Her accents are without question in perfect placement for stunningly beautiful music experiences. Her style is so hauntingly beautiful that it draws you in and you must keep listening to her cuts over and over, just for the experience! Keiko's music draws me into ever-increasing emotional venues. It's like experiencing a multi-faceted play with characters that bring out many different feelings. Can't wait to hear more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best so far","review":"I own all 12 CDs by Keiko and her video. Overall, this is the best CD in my opinion. Some of her best music is here. Importantly, there is not a single cut that disappoints. I suppose that if you bought only 1 CD by her, then get this one. However, I recommend buying at least 4 CDs. This one, Dream Walk, The Keiko Matsui Collection, and her Live album. This will give you a general sampling. Beware, if you like her music the way I do, you will want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Smooth Jazz","review":"I'm an on-again-off-again jazz fan. I actually bought this CD as inspiration for a Japanese Exchange Student who want to investigate jazz piano. Sorry, she can listen to it but I'm keeping this one. Matsui san has captured what I will call both the soul of Japan and Jazz in her music. It brings to mind small caberets in the out of the way sectors of Tokyo that I visited many years ago. Her use of phrasing makes unique use of what painters call \\"white space\\" she knows how to blend sound and its absence into a dynamic whole. The selections also call to mind shrines and sacred places in Japan where I've encountered the Japanese portion of my own occidental spirit. She's really good.

The pages are crowded with images, and if your child has specific names for some of the items (like plane, instead of airplane) it is a little bit difficult to teach the letter associations.Also, the two-page spreads usually feature more than one letter, intermixed. This is distracting. I'd rather have paid more money for a larger book that differentiates the letters more.Usually these books feature a bold pop up at the page fold. This book uses a variety of lift the flap and pop-up techniques. Because of this, the alphabet book is less durable than others in the line.

I have two of these coffee makers (same model) and the latch broke on each of them within a year or so of purchase. But I like the coffee makers so much that I bought a couple of large adjustable dog collars and use them to keep the filter door closed (if you get black it's not so noticeable).

Not to mention the profanity, which was a real disappointment, and made the author look juvenile. At the fourth or fifth expostulation of \\"Jesus!\\" I got fed up. And that was only 50 pages in. It's a very amusing idea, but I'm not convinced enough that it'll sustain a 350-page book that I want to read the next 300 pages of this.

It was catchy for about the first 50 pages with fun facts and his deliberate, and often time awkward, attempts to impress his friend with his newly acquired knowledge.From then on, the selected facts and his \\"epiphanies\\" grew less and less interesting and a growing frequency of his infertility, or his concern of maybe he was infertile, emerges. In the end, his wife did conceive and bear his child, he skimmed through the entire Britannica in about a year, he did not become the smartest person, he thought the experience is worthwhile (perhaps because he was able to write a book about the whole saga and profit from it). There you have it, the big spoiler of the finale.Bottom line: Not recommended unless you are very bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I have to agree with the other readers who found this book too \\"smarmy\\".

Also his need to impress his father.I must say, ever single page is loaded with facts and bits of trivia.

The book starts out good, but quickly becomes more of a diary of the author than any real discourse on knowledge. It because boring and monotonousness to read and it felt like the author was simply trying to summarize parts of an encyclopedia as a replacement for actually sharing his journey.Overall, it's not a worthwhile read, and I don't think I came out of it feel like I'd gained or learned anything aside from the author's personal family dynamic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know what you're buying","review":"This is not a book of trivia.

The main point of reading the EB cover to cover took a backseat to the fertility issues (which should have stayed behind closed doors, or as the focus of an episode of The View or a Lifetime movie of the week).

I've been an AJ Jacobs fan since his halycon days at EW and enjoy his work at Esquire now. He is really, really funny. The book is unique and I love the idea of his quest. He is honest, self-deprecating, and oh wait, I already said honest. It is remarkable how honest. He voices his most petty thoughts and it is refreshing to see. The facts we learn are indeed interesting (if a bit much at times)and his adventures (particularly his day as a 6th grader and adventure on Millionaire) are hilarious. I did find it a bit too long winded at times, but maybe because I read most it of it in a 3 sittings and didn't take time to enjoy the book over several days?! What sticks with me the most?

It's no accident that half of his idiotic, annoying and smarmy anecdotes consist of friends and family members telling him how idiotic, annoying and smarmy he is. By the time I was at G I wanted to put a bullet through both my head and Jacobs', and I wasn't feeling too particular about in which order."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful gift for any avid reader!","review":"I am a voracious reader. Although I have three young children and am a part-time lawyer, I read several books a week. My mother was so excited when she was able to find a book I hadn't read (or even heard of) - The Know-It-All. It is funny and insightful. AJ is a likeable guy and his wife has the patience of a saint. However, I wanted to call up AJ's dad and tell him to hug and compliment his son (although after reading his latest book, dear dad does apparently help out in bumping up the amazon ratings).There is much more to this book than the EB topics although those did provide dinner discussion material for quite some time. FIND this book and read it; you really won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and fun to read","review":"The author has an easy, self-depreciating writing style that makes for a most enjoyable read. Reading the Brittanica is neither easy nor light but Jacobs did enjoy the whole experience, all the same, as is evident from his writings.It's a fun read for a lazy afternoon when you have nothing else to do. You might actually learn something (like what a-ak actually is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarity","review":"Any book that makes me laugh out loud is a keeper. This one was great. Jacobs decides to read the Encyclopaedia Britanica from start to finish. He then writes a book about the experience as a series of chapters based on each letter. Jacobs lets us in on some of the more funny and interesting facts in Britanica while he also struggles to figure out what his quest means. Is he becoming smarter? Is he wasting his time? How does it change the way he sees the world and his relationships with others? the best part is that Jacobs seems like the kind of guy you want to know and hang out with so reading his book is like reading a letter from an old friend. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a younger Woody Allen","review":"Jacobs' tone gets whiny from time to time, but his neuroses and the constant asides into his and his wife's attempts to have a child make it a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jacobs reads like a good stand-up comic...","review":"I bought this book for a friend who used to read encycolpedias from cover-to-cover as a child. I read a bit of the introduction and first chapter in the bookstore, and was immediately won over by Jacobs' humor. I was also looking his \\"The Year of Living Biblically\\" at the same time. Found myself chuckling out loud in the bookstore -- that's always a good sign of a thoroghly enjoyable book. Haven't read either one entirely, but I'll be borrowing back the copy I gave to my friend as soon as she finishes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a fun read!","review":"I really enjoyed this funny book about one man reading the entire Encyclopaedia Brittanica in about a year.

And I am looking forward to continuing to follow Jacobs' career!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Instant Classic!","review":"Having read quite a bit of Jacobs' work in Esquire, I had pretty high expectations for this book. Yet I was still thoroughly impressed. This guy is hilarious!The book takes you for a wild ride through the Encyclopaedia Britannica, arming you with just enough odd and entertaining facts to make you dangerous at parties. However, coupled with Jacobs' witty humor is a touching story of personal triumph that truly inspires.I encourage everyone out there to read this book. It will keep you laughing long after you put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distracting Spelling Errors","review":"Distracting Spelling ErrorsI found the spelling errors extremely distracting. The subject matter demands accuracy along with humor. I was shocked when I read the first few errors, but angry after several more popped up. The editors cut corners but I still paid full price. Mr. Jacobs I think you are an interesting person but you got let down when you sent this off to be printed. It only took me seconds to verify my spelling for this review in a word processor. Your people should have done the same. You should demand a public apology from your editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Has Great Potential But Putters Out","review":"I feel like this author tries too hard to be witty, self-deprecating, and funny when it's not natural.

It's hard for me to get through this book, which is unusual for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snarky drivel.","review":"The word humble should not appear anywhere near the title of this book. It is as self-indulgent, pretentious and smarmy as you might expect coming from the editor of a magazine that embodies all of these same dubious qualities.

Save your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Self-Conscious","review":"This gimmick didn't work. A. J. Jacobs VERY loosely ties a series of largely unrelated, self-conscious anecdotes to encyclopedia entries and calls it a book.

Too bad he didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"this too shall pass","review":"hello all, i enjoyed reading his books.

Unfortunately, the real focus of this book was the author's life and his quest, not the facts he was learning. When he wrote about the various obscure items that he came across in the encyclopedia his observations were amusing and interesting. However, in his personal life, he comes off as whiny and neurotic. He has an inferiority complex so big that he just can't resist spouting his mouth off at inappropriate times in a useless attempt to prove to everyone how \\"smart\\" he is. If you have a Kindle, sample this book first and from that, decide if you are okay with the author's tone. I could tell from the sample that he was whiny but because I didn't realize that so much of the book was about him rather than about all the fascinating things in the encyclopedia, I made the mistake of buying it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"So akwardly funny","review":"Thank you AJ for expressing what I have never been able to articulate...the Roman Empire like decline of my very expensive education."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't read any more of this","review":"I made it to the end of letter F. This is a rambling book about an uninteresting person doing something ridiculous. I agree that the premise of reading the Brittanica front to back sounds like an interesting idea for a book, but it should have been obvious after a couple of letters that a novel would fail to be interesting in execution. This could make for good bathroom reading and I may skim the rest of it, but it is tedious and boring to go page by page. I'd rather read the encyclopedia myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as \\"The Year of Living Biblically\\"","review":"I picked up this book after reading his other book \\"The Year of Living Biblically.\\" I found that book to be funny and surprisingly insightful.

I didn't even finish reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it.","review":"I wasn't sure how this book would be, as I'm not one to read the Encyclopedia Brittanica, but A. J. Jacobs has me laughing out loud. I think I've read so many parts to my husband at the breakfast table, that he's almost got the whole book down. It's written with great wit and comical insights. My brother told me about it, and I'm so glad I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Well... Good title and interesting idea. That said...I have not read Jacobs since \\"The Year of Living Biblically\\" about 4 years ago. I liked that one much better. Maybe he got better (TYoLB was later than this book) or maybe my tastes have just changed.This one had some things in it that were humorous but it was mostly just one annoying story about his life after another. Listening to his list of First World problems and complaints was not funny, it was sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"My humbler quest to be a little smarter","review":"I heard about this book on the radio and thought it was interesting. The book met all my expectations. Every entry in this mini encyclopaedia is funny and the insights provided are witty. I empathise with many of his fears and tragically the one thing from the book that will stay with me forever is the fetish Rene Descartes had for cross eyed women. You really have to appreciate the gargantuan quest he took up and how he made it easier for you to do it by writing this book. For starters, this one costs lesser than the Encyclopaedia Brittanica and gives you the best parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining - mix of personal stories and random factoids","review":"I'm enjoying this book so far, and I'm only to \\"E.\\" It's a fun read, and I've already learned some trivia that I've felt compelled to share with others. More than anything, it's a story of a man coming to the realization, as most honors students do, that he's not the smartest man in the world and what that means in terms of his purpose in life. It certainly gets you thinking. I grew up in a nerdy family with grocery store Funk & Wagnalls encyclopedias for bathroom reading, so I can totally relate to this guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Knowledgeable","review":"This is the most enjoyable book I have read in a long time. Mr. Jacobs' quest to become the smartest person in the world doesn't come out quite as he wanted, but he does learn enough about knowledge to know that he will never become the smartest person. I bought this book as an episodic read, one that I could put down and pick and without having to recall what has happened previously in the book. While that worked for about a day, I quickly became attached to Mr. Jacobs sense of humor and his ability to find the most trivial of facts from the Encyclopedia Britannica. Which philospher had a fetish for cross-eyed women? What insect, after sex, bites the head off the insect that just impregnated it? These questions and others you never knew you had are answered in this thoroughly entertaining book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gig Ever","review":"I wish I was there.

As philosophy goes, he is probably the most readable of all. This volume is a collection of fairly short essays covering limited remits and can easily be bitten off and digested by the lay reader. It includes some important insights, but is not as education-dense as his magisterial History of Western Philosophy. It is interesting to consider that he wrote at a time when the profession of atheism was still technically illegal under UK law.Russell is not merely philosophising but committing advocacy - of scepticism and of rationalism. Of particular interest are his sceptical principles, which he advocates that all men adopt, and his consideration of Bentham's consequentialism, all delivered with the customary wit. The man was a national and global treasure and probably the first professional humanist and chief national atheist, a position now occupied by Richard Dawkins.Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"True, the sound quality isn't the best, but it certainly isn't bad given the age of the tapes the songs were taken from.

The Sixth Doctor, who was never as annoying and unlovable on TV as some consider him to be, lives up to his bad reputation in this book. Peri and Turlough are also poorly characterized. The worst aspect of the book, though, is the depiction of Chris, the character who represents the reader. One of the most important things in writing a plot-your-own story is to make the reader-character agree with readers' own perceptions of themselves. I would certainly never say \\"Wowee!\\" as Chris does early in the book.

The characters are believable to an extent, but Rhoda and her family was completely unrealistic. A black man good friends with a wealthy Italian in the 1960's? Yeah right. I don't care if they were middle class blacks or not. And Annette as far as a friend to Rhoda was absolutely ridiculous. They had nothing in common. The entire storyline was corny."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hated It!","review":"This book was awful.I don't know if it was the continuous sexual abuse, Annette endured that got to me, or if it was, Mary Monroe's poor writing style.My criticism is with how, Mary failed to give her characters depth and emotions. It was all just detached, surface reading considering she never took her readers into the character's minds. I realize this was Mary's first novel, and she acknowledged being a self-taught writer. So maybe that explains it, but either way, I hated it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"totally dissapointed","review":"This book was good if you want to get depressed. It didnt seem to have any conclusion at all. I'm still waiting for the point of it. I'm an avid reader, especially of black authors and I must say I was very dissapointed in this. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unrealistic....","review":"This book was SLOOOOOW and unnecessarily long. The author repeated herself, made goofs in the storyline, created characters with no depth or real emotion, and she is in dire need of a thesaurus. I don't think I will ever be able to hear the work \\"incredulous\\" again without thinking of this book. In addition, as someone who listened to the audio book I was tremendously disappointed with the performer (I guess that's what they are called) who stumbled on words and made no attempt to hide her swallowing and smoking sounds as she spoke. It was often gross to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Purpose","review":"The book is too slow and drags out the sexual abuse for far too long. Annette was defeated from the beginning and she never achieved any victory at least from what I can tell as far as chapter 25. I am really not sure if I will be able to complete this book and I wouldn't pass it on to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Read","review":"It took me along time to finally get through this one. It was very slow at the beginning, and ended up being alittle bit too predictable. Annette made me think she really enjoyed the relationship between her and Mr. Boatwright, and her mother was alittle bit too naive. Rhoda and her whole family were unrealistic, and the whole story seemed not to have a point. I thought it would be better than what it turned out to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DEFINITE PAGE-TURNER","review":"I read this entire book in 1 day!!! Monroe explained every charater in detail and the story had so many turns. Annette lived the typical life of an overweight child growing up in the 50s, which made the novel more interesting. And of course the end was left off with a cliffhanger where you have to read the sequel, which is exactly what i have done and you should too."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE!!!!","review":"You Go Ms. Monroe!!! I have been known to predict where a story is going; Not so with \\"God don't like ugly\\" It starts out typical and then flips the switch on you. What a great ride! \\"God STILL don't like ugly\\" can't arrive fast enough!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I see why","review":"I was extremly bored reading this book, although it recounts a tale of extreme hardship of young overweight Annette, who suffers repeated sexual abuse the characters are more interesting than the very predictable melodrama."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gift of self-love","review":"The gift of self love was lost on young Annette. Unfortunately this extreme lack of self love and worth was noted by Mr. Boatwright. This book left my with my mouth open and my eyes teary. The life of Annette so related closely to my own that I could not help but become angered at the adults and her for being sooo blind. How can a child learn to trust when the ones who she is supposed look up to for protection are the very ones who are inflicting her emotionally and physically with so much pain. And Rhoda, God Bless as crazy as she was. There was only so much that she would take. This book takes you through an emotional journey that makes you wonder. \\"What would you do?\\" Hats off to the author for writing such an prolific novel on a very interesting friendship."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book","review":"After reading some of the other reviews about this book I decided to try it out. I really wanted to like it. The book is written in a child's voice, but the subject matter is very adult. I just don't find this kind of reading enjoyable. I know that stuff like this happens in real life; but I like to read fiction to take me away from the gruesomeness of the world, and its abuses."},{"rating":"2","title":"How sad....","review":"Bad things happen to good people. I can attest to that. This was an excellent read. I hope Ms. Monroe allows Annette to find some peace and happiness in God Don't Play."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't want to put this one down","review":"Meet Annette, she is the example of a young girl in America being victimized by a family member or a trusted friend. Sometimes they tell, sometimes they don't. They endure years of abuse and we wonder why they are so messed up. Annette has an encounter with Mr Boatwright, a trusted boarder in her home. She is a good girl, so she obeys her mother when she tells her to do what Mr Boatwright tells her. Unfortunately, literally. As she gets older and her friendship with the beautiful Rhoda blossoms, things change. She and Rhoda share a secret that holds them together then, destroy a friendship.There are other interesting characters in this book, that all play a part in ANnette's life, from Scary Mary to PeeWee to Viola. THis is a must read, I am sure you will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope this gifted author writes many, many books!","review":"I loved this wonderful book! Ms. Monroe is truly a gifted, blessed writer. The characters are rich and well developed. While I was reading I felt like I was watching a wonderful, complex movie. I look forward to her next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a wordy book.","review":"I found this book to be very wordy and truly unbelievable. How can she depict people to be so naive at this time. What was on her mind? The character, Annette had this protective attitude towards her mother and everyone else but herself. The book was too descriptive and boring at times. Rhoda turned out to be the story not Annette. The theme was interesting but the way it was written was not. I couldn't wait get through with the book. It did not grab me and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"great condition","review":"Received item in a few days from ordering. The book was in very good condition for a \\"used\\" book and it was a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievable!","review":"this was an incredible read. i could not put the book down. i had to keep reading to find out how this poor girl made it through the horrific trials she had to endure. she made amazing choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"God don't like ugly is horrible!!!","review":"I have read a lot of books on various subjects, rape, murder& love, just to name a few. I feel that Ms. Monroe has a lot of potential as a writer but her characters should have been much better developed. It seemed as if none of them got any closure. I felt very frustrated at the last page, like where is the last four chapters??? I was left wondering about Rhonda, Annette, Annette's mother ect... I hope there is a sequel to make up for this feeling of being in the middle of watching a movie and the tape goes POP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"page turning","review":"When I read this book I fell out of my world and got into to another. I stop thinking about my problems and began to understand life through this book. It showed me that things are still the same just different people. I enjoyed reading this book and I hope to find more like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think God liked this book.","review":"Maybe this book was better than I thought because I actually rooted AGAINST the character. I mean, it got THAT out of me, at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"At first I began to read the book and started to think this is too depressing, but it never lost my interest and I could not put the book down. It kept me wanting more and more. It was really knowlegable on how African Americans really suffered in those days. I could really relate to the book for times when growing up just like Annette I felt awkward about myself, grew up without a father, struggled with my mother being the only person to turn to, and almost being sexually assaulted. It's a really interesting book that I encouraged many others to read. I am currently reading the second edition and I can't put that one down either. Good Job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"life goes on, and on, and on","review":"having been sexually molested as a child, reading about the atrocities visited on annette brought me to anguished tears throughout the book. i could truly feel for her plight and CAN feel for the plight of those thousands of innocents (girls & boys) who are going through this horrific nightmare on a regular basis. ms. monroe makes it no less palatable because she puts it in novel form. for those of us who \\"don't want to read about it\\" don't, but DON'T turn your back(s) on the fact that it DOES happen, and IS happening, quite possibly to a little girl (or boy) you see and perhaps KNOW personally. annette survived the trauma with good sense. most of us do. it's the ones who CAN'T live with it that we hear about on the news. the thousands of us who deal with it and \\"go on\\" you'll never know. this book is worth reading if only to open the eyes of some who think it can't happen to them or theirs. believe me, it can."},{"rating":"2","title":"PRETTY GOOD!!!","review":"THIS BOOK WAS REALLY GOOD! I HATED THAT ANNETTE HAD TO GO THROUGH SO MUCH AS A CHILD, BUT SOMETIMES THE THINGS THAT DO NOT KILL YOU MAKE YOU STRONGER. THE FRIENDSHIP THAT SHE HAS WITH RHODA PROBABLY WAS WHAT SAVED HER LIFE, BECUASE SHE HAD A SHOULDER TO LEAN ON. THIS BOOK IS REALLY WORTH READING BECAUSE IT KIND OF GIVES YOU ENCOURAGEMENT TO STAND THROUGH YOUR TRAILS. IT'S WORTH THE READ!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS YEAR'S \\"COLOR PURPLE\\"","review":"The title and the cover of this book caught my attention. I started reading the book in the store and finished it in one sitting the same day. It is a remarkable story about a remarkable young black woman, women of all races and ages will be able to identify with. There was a lot of humor which softened the blows of \\"sexual abuse\\". The characters were so well developed they practically jumped off the pages! Everything was so vivid I could easily see this as a major movie. The main character, Annette Goode, never let me down maintaining her dignity throughout her ordeal. This is a haunting look at a sensitive subject. Mary Monroe's writing style is fresh and captivating. Hopefully, we will hear from her again SOON. This is one book I will recommend to all my friends. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Once you get over some of the \\"shocking\\" parts the book is a good read. Deals with being strong, self esteem, goals, secrets, find love within self, and growing up. We get to see Annette as a young person, and flower to adulthood. You will cry with her, scream at her, and want to hug her. The book was really good. Plan to read the second book ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to read this one!!!!!!","review":"I ran across this book in the book store and the cover and title caught my attention. After reading the synopsis I had to purchase this book. Once I starting reading it I could not put it down. The characters were so real it was like I was there with Annette, Mr. Boatright (Mr. Boatright was off the hook, just plain crazy), Rhonda really seem like a good friend to Annette, however girl friend had some serious problems and Scary Mary I think that name fit her character perfect. I enjoyed this book from beginning to the end. I look forward to the reissue of \\"The Upper Room\\" by May Monroe"},{"rating":"1","title":"A So-So Book","review":"With some reviews typed in CAPS and others with an abundance of !!!!s, I expected an extraordinary tale. The beginning of the book held my interest, but as it went on my mind started to wander until I could not wait to reach the end of this book. I even googled for spoilers to get it over with.As the saying goes, \\"To each his [her] own.\\" This one just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"i enjoyed reading this book. i think its so sad how people can be so naive about people just because they are quote un-quote so called church going folks. i thought the author hit a very touchy subject that a lot of people are afraid to talk about. whats so sad about this story is that so many children suffer from sexual abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"This is a good story in which the plot and events move fast. It is a long book, but I do reccommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Ought to be required reading in schools\\"","review":"I started reading GOD DON'T LIKE UGLY on a Monday night, read past midnight. The next night, after everyone had gone to sleep, I'd run to the book to see if Annette was in danger. She had become a dear friend by Chapter 1; had to see her through. By Thursday I couldn't wait for evening...so I stayed in my room during the day, finished the book, and sighed a big one for sweet Annette. What a story teller Ms. Monroe is! She deserves the Pulitzer Prize. The powerful voice/messages of GOD DON'T LIKE UGLY reminded me of TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING!","review":"I could not put this book down once I started reading it. The characters are so well-drawn they seemed to leap off the pages. My reading group is reading it now and so far everyone is as blown away as I was. I highly recommend this one and I look foward to anything new by this author! What a gem of a writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"soooo good!","review":"This book was excellent. It is fiction but I got the feeling it's event were real. I have even read part 2--Go Still Don't Like Ugly. That was good as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow, but what an ending!","review":"This was a very good book and highly recommnend it to all! Maybe there was too much detail, but a was totally surprised. Also glad that the heroin was a plus size woman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Doubt the Best","review":"\\"God Don't Like Ugly\\" follows the relationship of two young girls through the turbulent times of the 1960's and 70's.After having to bear a family secret on her own, for years, a young girl finally has a friend to confide in. The girls have very little in common yet they forge a friendship over time. Taking qualities from each other; together they overcome such obstacles as broken homes, child abuse, and prejudices. Still while facing these issues, they continue to proceed through their adolescence/lives; while delighting in each other's company & relying on their friendship.Spanning over the period of two decades; this page turner is sad and frustrating. The constant tenion created by Mary Monroe made me feel helpless and angry. While I felt unsatisfied with the ending; the plot twists and turns almost made up for my dissatisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly was this book","review":"I was truly disappointed in the is book. While a quick and easy read - the book lack the depth in describing some of the more important relationships.... I waited for the main character to truly come of age... and she did not... I know many women and many who have been assaulted and abused, they had more strength of character then the girl in this book and I find that this author has missed her mark by a mile. Research and character development should be this authors next move before writing again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"Normally, when I find a literary treasure, I put it away in order to read it again at a later date. This book was placed on my list of books that I will never read again. I found it depressing, unrealistic and the trials of the heroine, downright unneccessary. I could not relate to the main character and did not want to. This was one of the few times that I could recall reading a book that I truly did not enjoy. I kept reading and waiting for the author to redeem herself and help me discover something that I liked about the book in the process. It never happened, so this book goes on my \\"never again\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine in the office","review":"I purchased this for my office. It works fine in that capacity. I haven't had any problems with spilling; maybe I'm just a bit more patient. The biggest problem I see is the warming plate. It keeps the coffee very hot- too hot! It will over cook what's left in the pot. Otherwise it's fine for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Initially, I liked this coffee maker well enough. The reuseable filter is a plus, and the coffee tastes good. But two characteristics make this one a loser:1. The coffee gets way too hot if it sits on the warmer longer than 20 minutes; and more importantly,2. The removable lever that allows the pause and serve feature to work is unreliable. It occasionally gets stuck and blocks the opening so that when brewing a new pot, all the water collects and stays in the basket (until you manually fix the lever). The thing easily pops off, and drives me CRAZY.I would not buy another DeLonghi coffeemaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not perfect, but I liked it","review":"\\"If the grind of the beans is too fine, the water backs up in the filter after the brew should be completed.\\" Yes, but I bet you can figure out how to solve this problem!I also agree that the carafe design allows too much spillage, but I figured out how to solve that the first time I used it. Just pour slower.As for the comment that the pause & stop lever is unreliable, I don't know. I have no trouble waiting the 3 minutes it takes to finish.The important feature is this: The coffee made with this and the Capresso conical burr grinder I use tastes great. Really great. The temperature is just right. No knobs, buttons, dials to figure out. Put in the beans, put in the water, hit switch. Very '50's, very effective.It would be nice if it shut off after an hour or so, but I can live with that too, for $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes great coffee, if you can get to the basket.","review":"Initially, I loved this coffee maker, it was so easy to use. After a few months of using it, I find the swing-open unit, that holds the grinds basket, gets stuck after you close it. It's nearly impossible to open it again. After I spent several minutes struggling with it, my husband said, \\"Oh, I thought it was just me.\\"The coffee pours too fast out of the pot, something that took several times to get use to.It makes great coffee, but I would not buy this maker again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hot","review":"I would not recommend buying this coffee maker. Getting the water into the reservoir is a clumsy feat at best. But worse, when pouring the last third of the hot coffee out of the pot, the lid falls open allowing the steam to scald your knuckles. I wish I could have gotten another Krups 4-cup but they've stopped making them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER!!!!!!!","review":"I purchased this coffee maker with birthday money and am extremely disappointed. The average coffee temperature is 160 degrees. This coffee maker ranged from 100-110 degrees, thus lacking the flavor, irregardlessof premium, freshly ground coffee. I contacted both the store where I purchased and the manufacturer and they had the nerve to tell me that's what you get for paying $20.00 for a coffee maker. I have usedMr.Coffee, coffee makers in the past with success, but this was on sale and I THOUGHT the Delonghi brand was a higher class since it is made by Cuisinart.OBVIOUSLY I WAS WRONG! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does not take up alot of space and came with a insulated carafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee if you can get the basket back in to make it","review":"This coffee maker is a frustrating piece of high priced junk. It has a basket that is to be removed to dump your filter, but god help you if you do. It is nearly impossible to get the basket back IN to the coffeemaker. You'll be trying for 24 and then give up in disgust.

On one hand it does seem useful to color anatomy to really anchor in one's mind the muscle and bone locations, connections, uses, movements and sensitivities. On the other hand though is the problem with clarity. The pictures to color in are not large enough to clarify detail. If you must purchase this book, be sure to buy 24-36 different colors in your pencil set. The book suggests 10, but that's not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"um where do i color?","review":"first off i thought this was going to be an interactive coloring book. my bad....it was not what i expected there are hardly any pictures that you can color in. im sad. thank goodness that it was not expensive or i would be mad!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok not what i was hoping for","review":"ok well i got the book and was excited then i looked inside. i was not happy at all u can hardly see the text u really cant color because u cant tell anything apart it is very confusing. its not worth the money i wouldnt tell anyone to buy this product i am a RN student, i got this just to refresh my memory and i was lost"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coloring Book","review":"The book is well aranged but did not work for me at all.

Seeing something visual and coloring it is best when learning something physical like anatomy and physiology. This books makes you learn A and P faster because it makes you avoid learning it passively, which I think is a longer process.I think this book helped me when I took my first course in college A and P. I like the organization of the book, it's not all over the place. The price is really good compared to a lot of other science books.I also agree with a previous reviewer to also get \\"Anatomy and Physiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations\\" Volume 1 and 2 by Leonardi if you are taking A and P in college. The questions in these two study guides also helped me a lot with test preparation. \\"The Anatomy Coloring Book\\" by Kapit gets my vote of five stars because of the value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not reccomend","review":"I don't suggest buying this book. It was very detailed but the pictures were too small. It did not help me at all. I suggest flash cards, or if your looking for a coloring book, I would suggest one with larger pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY detailed -- need sharp colored pencils or ultra-fine markers","review":"The pictures in this book are VERY detailed. From the photos, I didn't understand just how detailed and tiny some of the anatomical parts would be. I think this would be an excellent study tool for someone in a seriously anatomy-reliant major (pre-med, nursing, PT, chiropractic, etc.), but be aware that you're not going to be able to color this with your good ol' Crayola jumbo pack with built-in sharpener. You'll need ultra-fine point markers (as shown in the cover illustration -- should have been a tip off, but I missed it!) or colored pencils and a sharpener at the ready.I gave the volume four stars because it is just what it says it is. There are a TON of detailed illustrations with labels for you to learn as you color. Great for kinesthetic learners. However, for a mere \\"basic coding\\" student, such as myself, or anyone else taking Anat & Phys on more of an introductory level, this book is FAR more detail than you'll want or need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for musculature, bones, and vessels, but lacks innervation","review":"I'm currently taking Human Anatomy at Johns Hopkins Medical School, and this coloring book is a great study aid for processing the large amounts of information in an anatomy course. The book is pretty thorough on most subjects, but it is severely lacking in muscle and viscera innervation. The section on somatic and autonomic systems is a wonderful summary (and made sense out of my professor's lecture!) and has the major plexuses, but the book kinda fails when it comes to regional innervation - a major drawback when studying tightly packed areas like the pelvis and abdomen. Would have gotten a 5 star, but innervation is important to know and very tricky... maybe the authors can add some in a 4th edition?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I found the book to be wonderful in helping me with my biology class.

The detail in the plates is nowhere near big enough to color anything but large sections (e.g. major muscles or large bones), even with a well sharpened pencil, and it is nearly impossible to tell where the coloring boundaries are. The coloring notes (denoted CN) at the head of most pages are worthless. The detail that the book strives to convey is completely lost. The quality of the drawings is very lacking as well--there are issues with depth and perspective on almost every page that make it difficult to tell what you are looking at. There are more effective ways of learning anatomy than this gimmicky text.

I'm listening to a college-level CD course on anatomy and physiology and supplement it by looking at on-line images and videos. I was sometimes struggling to find images that were clearly labeled and to understand how the parts work together. This coloring book includes very precise visual information on both anatomy and physiology down to the cellular level. As I color, I can SEE exactly which each part is and how the parts work together. As I find the text in the coloring book too condensed to be useful, I also use Barron's \\"E-Z Anatomy and Physiology,\\" which has very easy-to-understand text. I can look things up in it easily. Using the two books together is working very well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! Doesn't teach you anything! Confusing!","review":"What will this honestly teach you?

Just a few pages in and I noticed that some of the words are different than what I'm being taught, so I've added in what I need to know...not a big deal. I recommend buying and using this book!Update: Several weeks into anatomy and I'm still loving this coloring book. What an inexpensive, useful tool! I bought the Prang colored pencils, 12 pk. and love the way they color but am having to borrow my kids' Crayola crayons and use my fine tip markers because sometimes I just need more than 12 colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful to ANYONE with healthcare professions in mind","review":"I bought this under the advice of nursing students before me. I love this book, it is highly informative and has helped me memorized the anatomy of the body. Though I'll probably not need to learn the whole book, the parts that I've used has helped. I bought the physiology counterpart as well. You may think $13.99 is steep for a coloring book, but with how many pages it has it is worth it. The book is not just a coloring book, it offers information on the body parts as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT!","review":"This is exactly what my daughter was wanting for her Nursing studies....she was sooooo happy & surprised when it showed up in her mailbox!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So cool","review":"Got this book for my anatomy class in High School and it was awesome.

The two stars are for the illustrations, which are incredibly detailed and well executed. The microscopic scale of the entire layout on the other hand is absolutely ridiculous for an art book. Even with the steadiest hand and perfect vision it would be hard to color in the individual segments or find the corresponding label for it. The fond used for the labels and other identification is badly chosen (I guess the \\"handwriting\\" style, or close to it, is to look friendly and less like a textbook, but it is actually very hard to read), and also miniscule.In short, this book needs to be re-published at a much larger scale in order to live up to its promises. I found it entirely useless and returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands the test of time","review":"I have this book, some where. I may have to buy a new one since my copy is 43 years old and have found it valuable enough to drag it through almost that many moves. Beatrice Trum Hunter was/is way ahead of her time.

I decided to track down some older Tiamat and got the astral sleep and I must say I was very very disappointed. I love heavy music of all kinds but this is just a sloppy, misguided mess. It's like they wrote the songs as they were playing them. They have no direction or guidance. The only song I can stand is lady temptress, the rest feels like someone is yelling at me for no reason and I just want them to shut up, luckily I can make them by hitting the stop button. This is just a very very bad annoying cd that will get very old in about 20 minutes. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic C units obsolete","review":"Recently had unit freeze up.

In talking to Raymarine Tech Support they said the C70 and other classic C units are obsolete. The unit does support the tracking mode but the features a not well thought out - for example the vessel name does not show up on most displays. Software has not been updated for several years. There are better AIS and chart plotters out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philly Soul","review":"Hall & Oates are the most successful duo of all time on the charts. This is in large part due to their 80's output which has some good songs like \\"I Can't Go For That\\" & \\"One On One\\", but has alot of cheesy stuff like \\"Maneater\\", \\"Method Of Modern Love\\" and others. Their 70's music is a different story. They released some of the best blue-eyed soul music ever recorded and this self-titled album is a great example. Most people are familiar with the big hit \\"Sara Smile\\", which is a great song, but the album has alot to offer in addition to that. \\"Out Of Me, Out Of You\\", \\"Gino (The Manager)\\", \\"Camellia\\" and \\"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\\" all have a definite Philly Soul sound and they easily could have been recorded by any of the Philadelphia International artists. The duo started to get a more poppier sound after this release, but this one is a real burner and worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesh bird feeder","review":"After I bought this bird feeder I immediately filled it up with seed and hung it outside.

The production is great, the musicianship is refreshingly vital, and the songwriting is excellent. Even the EP \\"Love n Death\\" is exceptional, which is unusual considering that most EPs never reach the level of the main album. There are many sound samples laced throughout the album adding an epic grandeur to the overall feel. The lead and rhythm guitars shine on this CD, so if you like melodic/intricate guitar with variation in tempo, this is the CD for you.

This cd is extremely atmospheric, especially the now well known song \\"Freezing Moon\\". It is a very dark work of old school black metal.The few negatives I can think of for this album is slight repetativness, though for most its not an annoyance. The vocals of course are a huge debate, as Mayhem's vocalist dead died by his own hand before this album was recorded and so another voice was brought in. At times the vocals are very dark and evil, such as on freezing moon, while at others pitiful and almost humerous.I recommend this album for any fan of black metal who wants to delve into the genre's past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient and evil","review":"I just love Cursed in Eternity, the drums are superior, the riffs are sick, and the vocals are echoing from the abyss. That shift to the blast beat always leaves me with an evil grin on my face.But the album is great. The groundbreaking albums of any genre should always be mandatory listening for anyone who isn't deaf."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word to describe it is just CRAZY","review":"I'm not into metal and especially the stuff like this, but you've gotta know that any Scandanavian metal band is going to be totally crazy and totally into it,which is what these guys were. When i first heard this band's story it blew my mind, not to mention their lyrics and the way they are live. Even if i don't care for the style I've gotta say that this band is the real deal and for a band to actually scare me says something....They had all the markings for a true black metal band and I'm gonna say Kudos to this band for being real. By the CD if you're into Slayer or Venom cause I'm sure that these guys are gonna shock you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mayhem of rancid puke","review":"The vocals are awful; really dumb high pitched growls, the recording is equally as bad, and the guitars are not good at all. The only thing is fast drumming--which does not make a good band. I highly recommend that if you see this album in stores take it and burn it. Also if you think about buying this, do yourself a favor and check into a Mental Institution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks.","review":"This album is laughable. I have no idea why people have rendered Mayhem a classic black metal band. The instrumentals were, while not horrible, nothing to rave about. And the vocals sounded like some stoned and drunken bum making fun of the whole black metal scene while kicking a can down an alleyway. Probably the worst vocals in the history of black metal.Also, in regards to Vorthog's comment: I'm a fan of Dimmu Borgir and Emperor (more so Emperor than Dimmu Borgir, but thats not the point). But on the other hand I'm also a fan of Darkthrone...and Xasthur, Mutiilation, ect. Darkthrone is definitely not a key-board oriented black metal band, and neither are the others mentioned but I still think they have some great CD's. The reason I dont like Mayhem isnt because they dont have key-boards, it's simply because they suck.Do not get this album. You'll be wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't get into blackmetal...","review":"Im sorry but i just cannot get into this dull genre known as blackmetal... All these bands to me sound terrible \\"mayhem\\" , \\"emperor\\" , \\"burzum\\" , \\"god-dethrone\\" , \\"dark funeral\\" , \\"dark throned\\" and i've given all those guys a chance and i got nothing out of doing it. Basically, blackmetal all sounds the same...Satanic lirycs are not scary nor is dressing up in all black leather, because it makes you look like a retard. Anyways, mayhem's \\"de mysteriis dom sathanas\\" has like all of the other blackmetal bands a very BAD PRODUCTION and same idiotic satanic lirycs and its boring. I do hope all you guys that love blackmetal have fun with satan in hell and let him poke his fork in you a-holes!

Even emperor blows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly overrated","review":"Supposedly this is Mayhem's best album. At least that's what one guy told me. Anyway, I really like the singer's weird voice. It sounds very evil. Most of the music is incredibly amateurish. It sounds like it took incredibly little skill to have created. The music lacks much complexity. The drums are about 85% blast beats. I gave it greater than 1 star because I really like the singer and a few seconds here and there sound good. I also really like the cover art and the images of the band members in the sleeve."},{"rating":"1","title":"A band with promise turned into Norsecore tripe...","review":"I find it hilarious that most people worship this as some kind of cult black metal release, but it really just sounds like a cod-Satanic homosexual opera. This is just more proof that without Dead, Mayhem was NOTHING. The production is much too clean for \\"The True Mayhem,\\" and Attila's vocals are truly horrible compared to his earlier work with you-know-who. This album is a good pick for goth kids, humanitarian metalheads, and trend-lovers everywhere. If you love the generic Norsecore/Sweetish black metal scenes, pick this up, as this is the definitive album of the \\"stupid black metal\\" genre, not the sincere one."},{"rating":"2","title":"De Misteriis Dom Sathanas","review":"The greatest black metal album ever!It is creepy and violent from the opener funeral fog 'til the closing song that gives the name to the album.

Once again Hellhammer handles the drums, but here the keyword is not complexity, but brutality, and he totally demolishes the drumset. Euronymous' guitar-work with strange contorted haunting solo's lives up to his own dogma, that black metal should be both brutal and beautiful at the same time. Attila Csihar from the hungarian cult-band Tormentor recites Dead's the malicious lyrics in his own inimitable operatic way of growling. Only for the truly black at heart, this make Deicide sound like Stryper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"de mysteriis dom sathanas one hell of cd!","review":"Any one in to black metal! Well love this cd uttila and euronymous are killer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic black metal album","review":"This is Mayhem's second LP after Deathcrush. It feastures Atilla on Vocals, which is kind of hard to get used to because his voice is not traditional black metal like Marduk or Kult ov Azazel.

All the songs are the best MayheM has ever done, and Attila's (Tormentor/Plasma Pool) vocals are completely godlike...no one could have sung the album better & with more emotion, regardless of what people may think. I would go on, but then this review would end up being huge. Buy this CD...that's all I can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS where the attitude comes from.","review":"There are just simply not any bands that are like this one, they have members who killed themselves, one another, and random people. Only one oringal member is alive and he is in prison for murder and church arson. The music is fantastic with blazing guitar and vocals straight out of the pit it seems, this band is rewarding for anyone into Black Metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very heavy metal but powerful and alive","review":"In the midst of death, this album is a scream for life in death's clothing. Rebelling against the successful but staid and somewhat fearful Norwegian society of their time, Mayhem lashed out with heavy metal embracing the aesthetic of hell. Like a sulfurous treacle riffs are ugly, gnarled and often nearly toneless in an operatic mimesis of the damned. Vocals from Tormentor's Attilla throttle and choke and gurgle in the service of a melody embedded in their distorted roar. The fury of Euronymous as a guitar player was his strumming technique, which here like a humingbird wing streams chords into a continuous sound. If you like metal, or loud music with classical pretentious and roots in the streetfighting mentality of the paranoid, this album is an excellent listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Like Translyanan Hunger","review":"..Which Is Sad Seeing As This Album Is Givcen Tremendous Over Credit When Sadly It Is Alright (Nothing Comes Close To \\"A Blaze In The Northern Sky\\" & \\"In The Nightside Eclipse\\".It Has It Moments Though And I Think WithA Different Vocalist This Could Have Been MUCH Better.

It wasn't like part 1, or even 2, but it was still decent, while the 1991 'finale' deliver us from evil takes us into a very similar direction as the cheap yet scary 'HALLOWEEN: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS' Director's cut...but that one at least has pace. I actually thought they were both decent, especially part 3, the transfer on part 3 was pretty good, fullscreen, but it looked sharper then the VHS, yet part 4, not so much...it looked the same as a VHS except less speckling and no backround film sound (like old vhs's have)I liked the fact that it was realy cheap and it's 2 movies for 1 low price, part 3 was about mary lou like part 2, except this one takes a dark humor route, part 4 had some semi suspense in it but was pretty cheap. Overall quality isn't that spectacular, but admit it, neither were these sequels..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the first film but not the second","review":"I watched this today & I saw both back to back. Here's my opinions on both movies:Prom Night 3:This was bad, but it was bad in a good campy way. This was an over the top parody of horror films in general as well as the second film in specific (which is a great movie you need to watch). The acting was actually pretty decent & while I'll admit I didn't laugh that much, it was still entertaining to watch. This is something that's great to watch during a horror movie marathon or on Halloween.Prom Night 4:Drink heavily during this film. It might make it worth watching. I got so bored watching this movie that I started to fall asleep. There just wasn't enough to this to really make it interesting to me.In the end I'd recommend this for a rental but I'd really recommend against purchasing this unless you've seen the films & know that you like them.

Not in the realm of philosophy. Aquinas leaves every modern philosopher in the dust. The best kept secret of modern times. Read this book and see for yourself. Aquinas is a balm for the mind.Kreeft makes Aquinas accessible to the layman (like me). Kreeft's footnotes are very helpful. I am in awe of Aquinas' intelligence. I can only describe Thomas' teaching as rigorous common sense. Very rigorous, intellectually challenging, but very worthwhile. Read a section or two a day.For Catholics, Thomas is the premier theological Doctor of the Church. Count that as a recommendation.We are to love God with all our heart and mind.

I recommend it highly if you have any liking for two wheel transportation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, but where is the Kawasaki Z1A or B?","review":"A wonderful book that documents the history of changes in the motorcycle world. A quick glance shows unfortunately the most glaring omission. There is no mention of the Kawasaki Z1A or B which was the most revolutionary machine of its time. In terms of engine design it was copied by many, inparticular Suzuki. The DOHC layout of the 903cc engine was the standard on which a whole generation of bikes was based. The styling was also a departure from anything that had been seen before. If you need space dump the MV its a non-entity. I have only ever seen 2 on the road in Europe and neither was a 750.

The mystery centers around Joseph Antonelli, an Oregonian attorney who finds himself drawn into the murder of two circuit court judges that appear to be related.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great....don't know what the other reviewers were reading!!!!","review":"I am currently in the middle of the book and let me tell you it's a struggle. I think Buffa can write; the problem is that he wants to tell you EVERY detail of every character, past, present and future! This slows the book down to a crawl and you end up with 30% to 40% of the book being irrelevant. The characters are interesting but when you read 10 pages that should have been a paragraph and 20 pages at a clip that add nothing to the story, it kills the book. If the editor of the book would have done his job and shrunk the book to 250- 300 pages of story instead of 480 pages of minutia this would be a best seller 4 stars!!!!! As for the other reviews, I don't know what book they were reading!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! Bad writing ahead...","review":"I was in the mood for a light bit of suspense fiction... nothing brilliant, but a good airport read. Seeing all the positive reviews this book had gotten, I figured I'd give it a try. WOW... what a mistake! Buffa spends the first 70 pages setting up back-story. The writing is so bad that it's actually funny at times. I read passages aloud to my friends to show them just how bad it was. Now, maybe it evolved into something remarkable in the second half, because I only made it halfway through before deciding that life is too short to spend on something this bad. But I'll tell you this.. although I don't think Grisham is a \\"great\\" writer, per se, at least he knows how to keep things moving along and his dialogue (isn't bad).

Forget the plot, and the story, but enjoy the ride. That's what it's all about. This was a really inventive and slick piece of work. Heck, Julien's other (& lesser) music video work like \\"Blue Jean\\" with David Bowie got more attention, and I wonder why.Well worth watching but as someone puts it below, it really should be letterboxed and on DVD. Video just doesn't do the scale of the vision much justice at all. Or perhaps we will see a re-release someday in the theatres. But that's wishful thinking..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely love it!","review":"I just can't understand the poor reviews and ratings for this movie but I guess its box office performance is this most accurate rating of all. I love this movie for its 80's attempt at portraying 50's West London. As I am originally from West London I found this a great nostalgia trip. The two leading characters are not very well played but Patsy Kemsit looks as wonderful as ever. The musical numbers are great - especially the Ray Davies piece and the Selling Out routine. Julian Temples' background in video is obvious throughout the movie and makes for some very original and striking images. Lastly the small parts played by Alan Freeman and Lionel Blair are just wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been titled","review":"Obviously, Piper loves Jonathan Edwards. The book started out well enough, but the second half seemed an idolization of Edwards. My thinking is that we have much better role models in Christ and the apostles, and to put such an emphasis on the work of Edwards is disconcerting.Edwards himself was in awe of the unfathomable work of God work during the Great Awakening, and probably would have attributed much less of its effects to himself than Piper does.As is evident in the title, Piper is beating his \\"supremacy\\" drum again, so if you're not really enthusiastic about Calvinist theology, you might find this book to be a bit difficult to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nexiq USB Link","review":"The Nexiq USB Link is working great. it is allowing us to communicate with vehicles that were once out of our reach.

But, hey, Lead Belly played 12-string guitar, you say? Darn right, and he played it better on \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\\" (Smithsonian Folkways), for example.The recording quality here is pretty good. There's some noise, but it's better than you might expect of recordings from this era. It's the performance that suffers.

The full sized guns fit in a diagnonal configuration. The accompanying coated cable keeps the secured case in place. Useful applications with the cable include securing your case to a night stand, under the car seat or even in your closet. 2 keys are supplied with the case.Not only would this serve as a great storage safe for pistols but is helpful with traveling and a soft deterrent is desired to secure certain items.For the price and the wide applications, I recommend considering this type of case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great safe for the price.","review":"Great safe for the price. Lets face it no safe is break in proof. Criminals will always find a way. Most thefts from an auto are smash and grab of items left in plain view.

If they want more then they will steal the whole car and have all the time in the world to crack a safe.This was easy to install.

I liked the story although it wasn't 100% original (sort of a mix of several other pre-existing sci-fi stories. It is a long movie but the suspense of the conclusion keeps the viewer interested.

The problem w/ this movie is not in its premise, but in the execution thereof. As killer kid movies go, PLAGUE is unpardonably slow, dull, and non-terrifying.

Which is a good thing. This is a good heart-warming movie for the whole family. Some viewers may not be able to relate to the theme of a young man's Bar Mitzvah, but this is only the vehicle used to carry the story, and it makes for good comedy. I loved the scene where the young man is looking into the mirror, trying to reassure himself by repeating \\"Today I am a man. Today I am a man\\", and then brushing his teeth with a Sponge Bob tooth brush. Not exactly great theater, but great fun and lots of moments that make you laugh and smile.This is how life is.

Nearly every film he's ever made is worth seeing if only to enjoy his acrobatic madness.The plot for Mr. Nice Guy would fill a postage stamp, but who watches these for plot? They're always just a thinly veiled excuse for some brilliant action sequences. And this movie is full of them. They're not exceptionally creative by Chan's standards, but they're still lovingly executed and a joy to behold. I just wish there was one last fight instead of the dumptruck ending, though it is kind of cool to watch stuff getting crushed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course the plot is stupid","review":"The plot should be stupid. I think the common misconception about Jackie Chan is that he wanted his films to have engaging plots and failed. Ummm, Jackie Chan is as much a comedian as he is a martial artist. In fact, if you want martial arts without the comedy you'd be better off with Jet Li or *cringe* Jean Claude Van Damme. Ouch, okay now that I've shaken that one off, Jackie Chan is one of the great Kings of B-Moviedom. The most famous are the horror Kings (Bruce Campbell, John Carpenter), but the archetypal Hong Kong action flick of yesteryear was hideously low budget (still is) and the choices are limited. Does one make a high action film with no plot, or a no action film with all plot. These are the two main choices in most of Asia. But I think Jackie has found the best option: Make a funny action movie with a deliberately weak plot and laughably cheesy acting. And voila. A unique and value-budgeted movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The action in this movie is DA BOMB!","review":"I loved the action in this movie and it is very funny. The cameo by Samo Hung is the best part. Jackie really does some nice stunts and is a funny character in this one.

The action is some of the best he's done in years with set-pieces that are sublime, including the fight on the horse-drawn carriage and the construction sight. What stops it from being a masterpiece? The performances. Jackie gives his usual solid performance, but seems to be surrounded by wooden and ham acting galore. Sadly some of the lines are unintentionally funny and detract from what is otherwise a top-notch Chan film.If you're reading this Jackie, please remake this film with different actors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie rules....this movie, however, is awful.","review":"Jackie Chan is one of the most talented people working in entertainment today, and probably the greatest action star ever. Mr. Nice Guy however, is a horrible movie. Combine a cheesy and absurd script with 90% brain-dead actors and you get Mr. Nice Guy. The only thing that saves this is a few cool stunts and fights, although there is nothing here that would make any of his Hong Kong films look outclassed in the least. Also notable is a humorous cameo with the director, Samo Hung, who is also Jackie's lifetime friend. If you want to see some of Jackie's great work, check out Police Story, Drunken Master 2, Project A or Armor Of God 2 (AKA Operation Condor). Unless your a serious Jackie fan, don't bother with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus Christ they kidnapped Kenny","review":"Jackie's Girlfriend is Kidnapped ONE MORE TIME, and he rescues her ONE MORE TIME.

For one thing, the acting is actually not horrible and is much better than his previous films. There's also no dubbing and everything is in crystal clear English. Sure, the plot's a no-no and the use of slow motion effect prevents fans from appreciating Jackie Chan's fast moves, but the fight choreography in this film is, once again, great. There's plenty of action and good humor in Mr. Nice Guy and not too many people in this film act like idiots. It provides more than enough action to satiate Jackie Chan fans. This film is certainly better than some of his other American theatrical releases such as Operation Condor, Supercop, and Rumble in the Bronx. But it doesn't reach the level of First Strike and Who Am I?."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"Of all the Jackie Chan movies I have seen, this is the worst.

I have yet to find a subject not extremely well covered. My wife and I are preparing for long-term cruising, including a circumnavigation. Calder's books, especially this one, have been great resources for learning how to install and maintain nearly every major (and minor) system.

But, again, many, many boats are propelled by sterndrives. Other than a small photo, he ignores them. How a book on mechanical systems can ignore mechanical systems is a small oversight, I guess.Winterizing? Forget it. With no mention of gas engines, he can't begin to touch on proper winterizing.I sent my book back.

This one's a slight departure from \\"Chase the Sun\\" (in my opinion, hands down their best album), but the initial shockwave of ska-driven sound is there in spades. Vocal stylist Matt Morginsky does a bit more of the rap thing on this one, but it's a real nice mix. Most of the songs on the album tell very good stories, especially \\"Jury Duty\\" (my personal favorite), and DC Talk's Toby McKeehan even makes an appearance (on \\"What It Comes To\\"). Producer Neill King does a great job manipulating the Supertone sound as well. A great effort by the Supes as a whole; the only reason I give this one four stars is because it falls just short of the greatness that is \\"Chase the Sun\\". But it's close!

Even if you are into secular music, Loud and Clear will bring a smile to your face."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet","review":"A couple of months ago when I obtained a sampler of this CD, i was blown away. Of course there is always the fear that they put the best songs on the demo so that you are enticed into buying it...not the case. This is the best Supertones yet by far. Turning to a slightly harder more rap influenced style than they were back in the beginning but still true to their style, Loud and Clear provides you with all that you could crave out of an album. Song 5 Return to Revolution i think its called is my favorite song by far.

The group has abandoned all by the thinnest of ska influence (like most \\"ska\\" bands that survived the genre's loss of mainstream popularity) and their lyrics, once so intelligent, have become merely repetitious (i.e. Does it not make anyone else cringe to here the phrase \\"Pandora's Box\\" repeated almost twenty times within a few minutes time?) It seems to me that while No Doubt moved towards straight alt. rock, and Less Than Jake moved towards straight punk, OC Supertones are looking for something more ambitious: campfire singalong songs. This CD may appeal to a younger generation (think middle school) but for those of us who were skanking to the Supertones at their height, it is a major let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Guess It's Ok....","review":"I know alot of people really like the Supertones. People who like the same kinds of music I enjoy. So I was persuaded to purchase this cd. But I don't really like it.

OR bothering to get anything more this studio puts out, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I haven't received this product -- which I ordered the first of November. I've tried twice to contact the sellers to no avail. This is supposed to be a Christmas present for someone who's been unemployed since February. Thanks a lot. Respond to me and I'll take this review down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!!","review":"I've been a fan of Charmed for about 5 years now, I managed to catch most of the early episodes on TNT and for the last 2 years have been waiting for this disk set. It's wonderful to be able to see the few early episodes that I missed on television and to be able to watch the shows without commercials. Watching the first season I'm realizing how much I miss Prue. Now I'm waiting for Season 2. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"So excited it finally made it!!!","review":"I finally got the chance to start watching Charmed about 2 years ago when I finally got cable...and from the first time I saw it I absolutely loved it! I was really surprised that of all the shows that had already been released to DVD, that Charmed wasn't one of them seeing as how it's already in its 7th season...but now that it's gonna be out, I'm so excited. I really loved the first season...I really do miss seeing Shannen's character (Prue) in the newer seasons...so when I get to see the first three seasons on TNT, I really take advantage of it...But now that they're out, I'll get to see it anytime I want! You have to admit, the girls are great...and then they guys that they get on the show are soooooo hot! I love Brian Krause...he's been one of my faves since the beginning of the show...and plus, I'll get to see the Andy episodes...was so sad to see him go after the first season..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chiming in on \\"Charmed\\"","review":"After reading a lot of the reviews for this set and hearing bad things (grainy picture, bad sound, no extras), I was hesitant to buy it. Well, I bit the bullet and made the purchase anyway.As someone who is very picky about her DVDs and quality, I'd have to say I found very little to complain about. The picture was fine (I always remember thinking the first season seemed a little \\"off\\" in picture quality), had no problems with the sound and I love the cases (makes it a lot easier to transport if you only wanted to take one disc with you somewhere). Some reviewers complained about these cases. Actually, I think they're better than the cases you get with many other sets, such as Angel and Buffy, because you don't have the worry of the teeth breaking off and the disc not staying in place ... especially if you have butterfingers (like me!).I'm very happy this show came out on DVD and I look forward to buying the other seasons upon release!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the show but...","review":"The episodes are all scrambled and some repeat like episode 2 is episode one and episode 2 is 6. Please Amazon fix this its my favorite show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - It's been a long wait","review":"I have been waiting for the Charmed series to come out for a very long time. I'm so happy it's finally here. It's an excellent show - one of my favorites. Get this, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmed First Season","review":"I love the three sisters and their \\"charming\\" ways of dealing with trouble in the form of deamons. If you are like me and have a really super active imagination then you will actually analyze this show in more than one way and really learn a lot of really helpful life lessons from it. This show really helps me see the world and myself in a different way. Yes, a friend of mine did tell me that I am way too deep in my about this show, considering it's only suppose to be entertaintment, but hey - we are all different and we learn and act differently to same things. Bottomline is - I LOVE THIS SHOW. I wish it would continue for more seasons than just the eight it has so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"charmed!!","review":"i love charmed!!!!!!!!!! it's my favourite programme in the world!!! i love all the magic and all the wiccan stuff!! it's so cool!! i wish i was in charmed!!!!!!!!!!! my favourite is piper!!!!!! i'm a huge charmed fan!!!!!!!!!!! i live in the uk and charmed has not yet been realised!!!!!!:-( i love charmed totally!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"As you can tell from the title of my review, I was a little disappointed by this DVD. Of course I'm not disappointed with the show, but more so the features, or lack of features on the discs.There are absolutely NO special features and not even subtitles!!!It seems like someone just threw the episodes together really quick and put them up on sale!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seacon One","review":"Well this was the first of the charmed season sadly it was the most boring of them all. Prue which was the boss was over done as a character. No big sister is really like that bossy and bitchy. Phoebe was great as always full of spirit, the only one that kept things interesting. piper, which was the middle sister, she my second favorite. She was very sweet and her power was probably the coolest."},{"rating":"1","title":"What! No Extras?","review":"Very disappointed that I waited this long to get what I already had, the basic episode. I had taped most of the episodes off of the TNT network. I don't understand why they didn't have any extras. They have 7 years of episodes, its hard to believe they can't come up with anything extra. This is one of my favorite shows but I will not buy the next season unless they come down in price or add some extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't hate whats different","review":"i readsome comments and some people hate this show because its different from Buffy, Ghost Whisperer, Angel, Listen! If i hated a show or a song just because its different, Id never watch a show on T.V. ever again, face it shows are done differently nowadays cartoons are even stupider then usual some shows arent even serious or even have an actual ending and music doesnt make me want to dance anymore"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is The Best Show Ever!","review":"I loved the 1st season of charmed. I'm a HUGE charmed fan. My favorite episodes out of the first season are: Wedding From Hell, Wicca Envy, The Wendigo, Which Prue Is It Anyway, and Deja Vu All Over Again. Out of all of those, my #1 favorite is probably \\"Wicca Envy\\" because Prue finally finds out that her boss Rex Buckland and his assistant Hannah Webber are warlocks. This was the best episode out of the whole first season!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What took so long","review":"I love this series and can't understand how every series under the sun has already been released and it took this long to get Charmed.

I have been waiting for this dvd for YEARS, BUT... First, the picture quality is poor by dvd standards. Usually the sharper dvd picture jumps out at you but the compression for this dvd is a POOR choice. It gives a picture about as good as brodcast TV. Second... there is no second, there is nothing else, no features, no comentaries, not even a scene selection. In conclusion, a GREAT show but one of the POOREST dvd presentations I've seen to date - what a SHAME."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have been waiting for this news since 1999","review":"I have been a fan of Charmed since I read its first book called 'The power of three', and after reading that book I was so interested that I started watching the program, and since then I have seen this program religiously...never missing an episode. I know for sure, that when it comes out on DVD, I will probably be the first in line to get it...trust me, if you like buffy and angel, u will love this....this is soooo much better than those two....but the key to the whole program is that you have to be fair to it, you have to watch a couple of episodes coz only then you will understand their lives, and how the three girls live it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love The Show but are these the Complete Uncut Episodes?","review":"Charmed is a really good show! Having no extra features in the DVD's is really disappoing though especially not having the pilot where Phoebe was not Alyssa Milano but another actor.I started watching this show last year in TNT reruns and I'm wondering if the episodes in this set are unedited or are they the edited TV episodes, I'm wondering because usually when you buy a TV DVD and you had seen the edited TV reuns you see that they cut out things for more commercials and wehn you see the uncut episodes on DVD you are like pretty amazed but the episodes of Charmed in the DVD's don't look any different than the TNT reruns and I haven't noticed anything that appeared to not be shown on TNT so are these episodes uncut just like the original WB airings or are they edited? Or does TNT show the episdes uncut?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The complete first season DVD set","review":"I totally loved it. I can't wait until the next and all seasons come out in DVD. If anyone knows when that will be, please let me know. I can honestly say I have not enjoyed any show quite as much as Charmed! I can and do watch it every day (reruns) and every new show on Sunday and/or Tuesday. Can't seem to get enough. The DVD's are clear and easy to watch and very enjoyable and will last for years to come to show my grandchildren."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello...EXTRAS?","review":"I was very happy to learn that Charmed was being released on dvd-finally!! When I opened the package, I was very disappointed to learn there were no extras. I wondered if Paramount understands what owning a dvd boxed set, like this one, means to the fans. Interviews from the staff and actors gives us useful information about the show and episodes we always wanted or needed to know. It seeemed as if Paramount just rushed the product out with the expectation that it would fail. I hope they make this up to us during the next releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you give this show 5 stars???","review":"I picked up a copy of this because I was told \\"If you like buffy you'll like charmed\\". Well that is definitly NOT the case. The CGI effects are terrible, the plots are predictable and the acting is hideous! I'm just half-way through the DVDs, after this I'm going to sell the box set and never turn back again. Honestly, what do you people see in charmed? I can't find one aspect I like about it. Also the DVD quality itself is bad. I tried watching it on 3 different TVs, definitly not worthy of DVD quality status.If your a Josh Whedon fan than do yourself a favor and passby charmed. Josh good have done a better job writing this show when he was 12."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Season DVD set is real Charming.","review":"I really liked seeing the first season of Charmed on DVD but I agree with a lot of people. They should have put in some sort of extras in on the DVD. I'm hoping eventually they'll put extras in the DVD box sets in the future.

My vhs tapes are worn out.:D"},{"rating":"2","title":"YIPPEE!!! FINALLY CHARMED ON DVD","review":"I am so exited for this to come out. Part of the reason why it's taken so long for this to come out, partly is getting permission from the artists for the music that was used on the episodes, also Shannon (PRUE) wasn't giving them permission to use her image on the dvd cover. Also, something about a contract where they wouldn't be able to release it until 2005? I know that TNT had syndication rights to charmed...not sure if that is something that had to do with it.Well, whatever the reason...it's coming finallly!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmed on DVD.....ABOUT TIME!!!!!!","review":"I can't believe that Charmed will finally be out on DVD!

Its taken a while, but it is well worth the wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I used to be a huge fan of Charmed, but after the 3rd season I felt the stories got overly silly and lost the darkness and seriousness that the first season had.The 1st season of Charmed was awesome and it's about time they brought out the dvd for it! Though there don't appear to be any special features on the dvd, I would buy it just so I don't have to watch my very worn out tapes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been \\"Charmed\\" by this show since it aired....","review":"This show is incredible. I really like it alot when Shannon D (Prue) was on it, but I have throughly enjoyed Paige's character. They all seem to play off of each other and act well together. In all, there's no amount of money that I wouldn't pay to get this. It's an awesome shoe and worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show--Disappointing DVD Set","review":"Like many other reviewers, I was EXTREMELY disappointed when I realized there are no extras on this set of DVDs. None. Nada. Nil. Not even scene selection or subtitles. What a waste of money. I've already recorded the show using my digital video recorder many times over as they've aired the re-runs. If I had known there were no extras, there is no way I would have purchased this set of DVDs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome show eventhough it was Shannon's last season..","review":"Great show and chemistry with all the actors.

IT IS ABOUT TIME! and i started watching the show when it aired on channel 2.. so i didn't technically get to watch the first episodes.

I pre-ordered it and got it on Tuesday, Feb 8, 2005. I just finished the first season yesterday (my wife and I watched 12 episodes all day). I never saw the first few season of the show and was excited to catch up. My only question is WHEN IS SEASON 2 GOING TO BE RELEASED? This is a great show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"As much as I am excited about finally having Charmed on DVD, I was sorely disappointed about the lack of extras. There is literally nothing but the episodes- not the unaired pilot, commentaries, interviews, behind the scenes footage, or even a picture gallery. I can watch these episodes twice a day on TNT. And if I really want them without the commercials, I'll TIVO it. I didn't need to spend nearly $40 for this. It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"my number one show","review":"i watched charmed since the first espsode its about three sisters who discovers they share a supernaturel bond as witches when they moved back into their childhood home and they must used their powers to to vanquish demons and protcted mankind"},{"rating":"2","title":"gotta love charmed","review":"As much as I love the first season I would love to have the second season.

I was faithful watching the show up until Prue died then it was only off and on that I have watched it. I have finally got back into it since they no longer show the ones with Prue.

It doesn't have any extras or even subtitles, and the codification is not exactly the best. However, if you are a fan of Charmed, I suggest you buy it because it has all the season 1 episodes.

For too long the Cecchetti 'method' was in the hands of people who were preserving it like a piece of old wedding cake, and like a piece of old wedding cake it was stale and crumbling, and being taught by people who wouldn't know Cecchetti if he came up to them on 14th Street. I'm sure you've all met the type: \\"I teach the 'true' Cecchetti method!\\" said, breathlessly, as though it was a form a Holy Communion, which, at it's best, it should be.Everyone involved is to be congratulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Immortality Passion\\" is a classic","review":"NEMESIS DIVINA sounds like the members of Satyricon broke intoa whole bunch of cars and manipulated their horns to honk atrandom. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of theamazing \\"Immortality Passion\\" which is a beautiful,epic song."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Hole","review":"You cannot listen this album without coming to the conclusion that Satyricon were metal zombies. These guys lived, breathed, ate and drank the soul of ferocious metal. They still do it now with thier more recent albums but this album hands down has the time stamp. Satyricon are blazing and refreshing black metal with an almost unhuman mechanistic approach. This album is a hell of an experience. This album is pure black metal and one of the daddy's of all attempts coin the phrase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal Music","review":"I only say 4 stars being a perfectionist and saving 5 for the absolute elite, but these guys are up there. Highlights are 'The Dawn of a New Age', 'Mother North' and 'Nemesis Divina', but all the songs are addicting. If you like all Immortal, Borknagar and Emperor you'll be into this. This CD is just one of the most solid 'Norwegian Black Metal' records out there, and if you don't have it and are into the scene you'll like it from beginning to end. My favorite part of the CD is probably the vocals, where something about the classic BM style slurred together and often sounding rushed, as if the singer didn't speak very good english (although thats probably not true and half the songs are in Norwegian), lends something unique to the CD, as if they were picky with tones on the whole production except the vocals, not to say they come out bad, the opposite, just raw. Buy the CD if you can, it's one of the best from one of the greatest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satyricon produces nothing but the darkest noises of Hell.","review":"What can I say other than Heavenly? Hehe, quite oxymoronical eh? Serisouly speaking, this cd is one of the best Black Metal cd's put out by any band. The mixture of dark sounds and devilish vocals compilment eachother so well. This cd goes with anything whether it be from studying, to sleeping, to partying, to cruising to your next Hellish escapade. Truley aweinspiring work from Satyricon as usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"an essential for black metal fans","review":"One of their best to round off their first three classic albums. Killer riffs on the whole ablum great melodic guitar work. Mother north is one of my favorite black metal songs. A more developed black metal sound on this album with out going overboard with the production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satyricon's Masterpiece!","review":"\\"Nemesis Divina\\" is truly a black metal masterpiece, possessing all the essential qualities of the that particular genre. However, Satyricon draws significantly from grim medieval musical themes, which Satyr is capable of implementing quite effectively. The most brilliant track is \\"Mother North\\", an epic & monumental piece that gracefully moves between technical blast beat ferocity & spellbinding interludes of enchanting evil. The remaining compositions solidify Satyricon's position as one of the most lethal black metal organizations on the market and displays the band's noteworthy maturation from their previous output, \\"The Shadowthrone\\". This album is self-produced, by Satyr of course, and is of the highest quality. The booklet is a 20 page glossy colour collection of grim lyrics & photos of the coprse painted, axe wielding warriors behind this phenomenal concoction. By the way, Kveldulv is also Nocturno Culto of Dark Throne. Buy it, for who shall be able to stand?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brillant","review":"When this beast of a LP roars up on its legs to devour everything and everyone, you know you are in for some exceptional black metal. \\"The Conquering/Dawn of a New Age\\" contains minor folk touches interlaced with barbwire, razor sharp riffing, Satyr's hate-filled, evocative rasps, and Frost's controlled-chaos drumming. Racing like an infernal train almost derailing but assured of its destination, \\"Nemesis . . .\\" is haunting, grim, eldritch, beautiful, terrifying, violent, epic, spiritual, and angry. The songs are individualistic yet make up a global scope in the album's totality. With help from Darkthrone's bassist, Satyricon have crafted one hellish ride worthy of your collection. \\"Mother North\\" is a favorite for most of the listening audience . . . not surprising. If I didn't like Emperor so much, Satyricon would rule my Book of Shadows of black metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"plangent country-blues laments for a sunday afternoon!","review":"you may know papa m from their live from a shark cage album and other such moody creations, but this new ep released on mogwai's album in the uk and seanote in the usa is a marvellous thing.

The author writes in way that actually seems as if she is truly trying to help you, not talk down to you. After reading several books on parenting, I have found that many of the authors DO talk down to the reader; Naomi Drew does NOT. It is one of the most helpful books I've read on parenting. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 is that while I'm sure they might be helpful to some, a couple of her ideas seem far-fetched.

You will undoubtedly say to yourself, \\"I know that scenario. I've been in it and this is what I can do to handle it more effectively and peacefully next time\\". The book also provides a wonderful context for peaceful parenting. Ms. Drew discusses the impact of raising caring and compassionate children who have learned peaceful approaches to problem solving not only to peace in our homes, but in our communities, our country and our world. Peace is a goal we all need to embrace. This book clearly demonstrates that achieving peace in the world can truly begin at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read for Parents","review":"This book is an aboslute gem!

Within a year, the coffee maker started leaking on my counter. The taste of the coffee was never great and kept getting worse and worse. It got slower and louder when it made coffee.

It is a good looking coffee maker and has a lot of features for the money. I was a sucker thinking it could not break again. I will never buy another Mr Coffee anything.

It was a great coffee maker for 3 years and then suddenly stopped working properly.

Two strikes you're out!","review":"Ok, as of this writting, this will be our second try at this Coffee Maker and the second time it has proven itself to be a piece of junk! We purchased our original one a couple of years ago and thought it was great! Lot's of extras and a nice look for our kitchen decor. After about 8 months the unit wouldn't turn off on it's own and we simply used it as a coffee maker hot plate and unplugged it when not in use (since the burner would not turn off). We cleaned it as often as the manual suggested and in the manner suggested, it still failed and stopped working altogether. Ok, we figured we just got a bad unit but liked the look and features and figured we would give it another try. We purchased a second unit. Sure enough, even with proper care, about nine months later we were facing the EXACT same problems with the burner not shutting off. Finally, this morning, it died.

This coffeepot is the pits--it takes over an hour to brew, loses around 4 cups of water due to all of the steam, and oftentimes simply shuts itself off during the brew cycle. It also has quite a bit of a leaking problem. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total P.O.S.!!!! What NOT to buy","review":"I've had mine for about a year and it started leaking from the bottom right after the warranty expired. I've put up with it since, but it keeps leaking more and more, AND, now it has started to take longer and longer to complete a brew. It takes about an hour now, and it puffs out great clouds of steam that makes my kitchen windows fog up. Time for the trash, and I'll make a special point NOT to by another Mr Coffee product of any kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave out after a year","review":"The warming plate \\"lost steam\\" after a year and failed to keep coffee warm.

DON'T BY THIS THING!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best coffee maker I've had so far","review":"I got this coffee maker for my birthday three years ago. i just threw it out yesterday because it stopped making the perfect cup of coffee, and the paint on the burner plate started peeling off. Up until about 6 months ago I could leave the coffee on for the full 2 hours and the coffee still tasted fresh. Now the coffee tastes burnt after 45 minutes, with the burner-plate dial on the lowest position(I think the dial might not work anymore). It's easy to use, easy to clean. My only complaint about the clean cycle is that I have to run another full pot of water through to get the vinegar taste out- you should probably spend the extra bucks to get the Mr.Coffee cleaner. This definitely makes better coffee than proctor-silex or other cheaper brands, but not as good as say cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled!!!!","review":"This machine is the same as other Mr. Coffee 12 Cup coffee makers, but with a different trim package (1/2 stainless vs all stainless).

It just plain didn't work, and only after 15 months, one tenth the time; seems to me that I should have been able to expect to have the same Quality of that first old machine in the new one.

Evidently steam gets into the electronics - you would think they would take that into account when making a coffeemaker. It did start working again after it sat & dried out for a week, but it only works if you remove basket & open lid immediately after brewing. Now it won't process all the water through, so I followed instructions for cleaning & guess what?... electronics steamed up and quit working again. All in all - a worthless piece of xxxx!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks and wears very fast.","review":"This looked sleek, which is why my husband paid too much for it.

But after having it for barely a year, I'm very disappointed with how it's holding up. A critical spring part of the filter basket broke (they were kind enough to send a replacement), I can't remove the carafe during brewing, it seems to leak at times, and the finish on the heating element has already burned away revealing ugly bare metal.

A one year warranty, so it is off to buy a replacement.If one were conspiracy minded one would have thought the clock was not only tracking daily time, but also counting down warranty balance....Now the big question?

Due to my total carelessness, I lost them recently. I thought at least I can replace them by ordering a new set. I was wrong. The item I received today was a big disappointment. First, the color wasn't rose gold. It was rather plain yellow gold. Second, it felt so much lighter than the same pen/pencil I used to have. There was no nice heavy feel to it. Then I realize the 'USA' engraving was missing on top. I flipped the box to find 'Made in China'. I was so disgusted I didn't want the set any more. I called Cross to ask if they have anything made in USA. The lady said no... Now all Cross pens are made in China. I'm so saddened that I can never get replace my pens.

However my little 6-month's arms get stuck in the space between the seat and the chair legs. I'm actually worried that when she is bigger it will be hard for her arm to get unstuck and even get hurt.

It uses mostly old, formal and awkard forms of conversation, unusual gerundial verb modes (like it's been translated from english!) and a constant choice of using suffixes that distort words making them seem difficult. Overall, it unrealistically pushes the language away from its latin base instead of using that base as common ground for a reader of a different language.I must say however that I have not read other similar courses out there so I could not make a fair comparison.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I sent it back to Amazon for a refund after 2 days.

I noticed since the dawn of easy DVD, that there are many, many horrible film companies that should be imprisoned for pawning such bad crap on the world. The film quality looks like Joe Shmoe filmed it with a camcorder. The special effects are much, much less than special, and I've seen better acting at my 6 years old's school plays. This movie was a real turd and anyone who was even remotely involved should hide out in the desert in shame for at least a decade.

Since I'm an incorrigibly impatient reader, that says something about this novel. This is not just lucid, gorgeous writing: this is a testimony to the sheer depth of details the author plunges into to flesh out his characters, of his keen sense observation, of evoking the essence of a land and its people.

It is a simple story - told masterfully. The flowing style involves two simultaneous narratives (what happens in the lives of the two main characters) - with each narrative being suspenseful in itself. You'll just have to read it to judge for yourself.The author also seems to have done his research on the gangetic dolphin, the Sunderbans and other pieces that the story revolves around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"I found this book fascinating. I felt transported into a world I knew nothing about. The depictions of people made them seem real and each very different. Except for some peripheral government goons, there were no obvious \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys,\\" just humans with different perspectives, desires, and upbringings. I listened to it in audiobook form and the actor was outstanding. I was impressed with both the literate style of writing and the depth of the research, which interwove real historical events and modern day science with two or three love stories, if that's the right term for them. Like Indian movies as compared to American ones, the sexual attraction and \\"action\\" is much more subdued and understated. I found that refreshing. I don't like the crudity you find in almost every modern detective/police novel.

After I had read the first in the series (KLEOPATRA), I didn't hope for much. I was pleasantly surprised. Even though it seems as if a lot of events were crammed into PHARAOH's modest size (perhaps Essex should have included more history and less far-fetched bunk in the inferior KLEOPATRA????), it works. Kleopatra's relationships are beautifully crafted and I will admit that I fell for Antony as well! I wish that Essex would have paid more attention to Kleopatra's role as a mother as well, because when the children do pop up, it seems a bit random. Also, I was angry that Kleopatra's loyal servant Iras was turned into a cross-dressing eunuch-- I found that a bit hard to believe. Although I still- and probably always will- favor Margaret George's incomparable MEMOIRS OF CLEOPATRA, Karen Essex's PHARAOH was powerful, moving, and fluid in its own right.

It is a movie that opens with a steamy remembrance scene that let us know how much the main character loved his late wife, and goes on to reveal that she isn't quite dead. Hmmm...X rated for for the explicit sex scenes, there is a fair amount of vampire action in Night Shade, which I had to wait a long time to see.

I fully expect that they will enjoy it greatly.The massive complaint I unfortunately have to include is that the description states that the theater ships with the Kidcraft Princess and Knight puppets, and these were not in fact included with the theater.

Unfortunately, unless you're always going to plug it into the wall while viewing, save your money. I've watched a total of 6 movies using the battery and during the last one the screen went dead after an hour.

It has moving parts so of course its going to skip if you drop it or hit it, just like any CD Discman will do as well.I returned mine because it didn't play DVD-RAM formats which are common in newer set-top DVD-recorders. Also, this unit does not have fast forward and rewind functions. It skips through to the next chapter which is fine for a rented DVD but when you are recording long TV shows or home videos, you aren't going to sit there and program chapter markers every 10 minutes. Thus, when watching TV shows, you have to watch it all in one sitting and can't fast forward or rewind or even shut off the unit without having to start all over again. That's not cool if you're watching a 3 hour long DVD.If you're only going to be watching rented DVD's, I highly recommend it. If you need FF/REW or DVD-RAM compatibility, then skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but stop working","review":"I bought this player from Costco about six months ago to be used for long trips.I have recently used the the DVD for 1 week straight and it no longer works.

It does what it claims, I think. It protects my skin from the sun and helps even and brighten my skin tone. I didn't think that it helped much with clarity of tone until I ran out for a few days. My sensitive skin became more splotchy and irritated. After about two days of resumed use, my skin looked much better. I'm sure there are better products out there that do even more for your skin, but this is at an affordable price point and is easy to find. I never feel like I need to worry about running through the product too fast, so I extend its use to my neck, chest and hands sometimes.My biggest gripe is the package. The applicator doesn't reach the bottom so I spend the last 4-5 days opening the bottle and trying to use my fingers to get all the product out.

Then, little red bumps started to pop up around my chin.The bumps went from looking like small pimples to drying out completely. I thought that my skin was just dry or that the bumps were the result of a food allergy and used more of the moisturizer. They would not go away for months. When I stopped putting lotion on the bumps completely, they disappeared within a few days. I never thought that I had sensitive skin--I can use face masks and rarely break out--until this product.

I also own Clouds which is the album previous this, and they have sure taken a turn for the best. Clouds was basically Death-Metal with some cool melodies, but Wildhoney has gone very ambient, almost Pink Floyd-ish in some parts. this suits the lead singer down to the ground, as when he lets go of that rough gravelly death voice, he has a beautiful melancholic soft voice, with a cool accent. Especially the final track 'Pocket-Size Sun' with its soft melodies and chiming bells, it's shows a death-metal band growing apart from the rest of the crowded style.Nice to hear something different!It's just a pity 'A Deeper Kind of Slumber' couldn't have been this good."},{"rating":"1","title":"who the hell is this ? 1.5 stars","review":"This certainly does not resemble the same band that released The Astral Sleep, The Summerian Cry and Clouds. This sure isnt groundbreaking or a landmark release like many have hailed it and it sure isnt metal. Why people insist on saying this is Floyd mixed with death metal is beyond me - this new version of Tiamat is not even close to sounding like Pink Floyd and it sounds nothing like death metal. To say they sound like Pink Floyd is surely a joke, I dont hear ANYTHING like Floyd's Echoes or A Saucerful of Secrets.What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but don't forget to turn it off","review":"This thermometer works well, it reads fairly quickly, and it has given me no reason to question it's accuracy.But for whatever reason, in a world of electronic devices with momentary on switches and time-out features, this one has a single-throw lever switch. On is on, and off is off, with no embedded idle-detect program in between.To compound this it's fairly easy to turn it on accidentally, however, in its defense, the first battery is still going strong, despite my having inadvertently left it powered-on in a drawer for days on end.I should also note that it came with an extra battery, so at this time the power arrangement is a non-issue for me... it's just a little different than many things of this nature.Addendum: It's now 4 1/2 years later, I use this all the time, I've had to buy batteries for it once.

I have two key complaints about this product.First, the company doesn't offer any reasonable upgrade options. I purchased version 7 almost exactly five months ago and the only option available to upgrade to version 8 is to purchase the product again at full price.Second, the product is not compatible with the copy protection used with the Hoyle 2004 games. Farstone says they're working on a fix, which will be available using Live Update. Of course, the version I have doesn't support Live Update - I'll need to upgrade to version 8 to get this feature (see paragraph above).On the plus side, this product does work with SimCity 3000, Crazy Taxi, Warcraft BNE, and older Hoyle games.

I'll look for an alternative product instead of purchasing version 8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Product - Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I bought this product last year when it first came out. Like the software advertises, I want to run my games without having to swap my CDs back and forth. Well, guess what? None of my games worked with this product. I can understand that they may not support the newer games, but older games that I owned also doesn't work with it (Ghost Recon, Dunegon Siege, and countless others). I checked their support site and pretty much every game I entered it came back with \\"Not tested!\\". I sent an e-mail last year and the support group replied back saying \\"they will have an update in a few weeks\\". Well, guess not, six months later and no update is in sight. I finally gave up and threw the disk in the garbage can.Basically, the product does not work as adverties (don't work with a LOT of games), support is horrible, and good luck thinking that this software will keep up with the latest games."},{"rating":"1","title":"GameDrive 8 by FarStone","review":"Since I travel quite a lot, I purchased GameDrive8 to avoid the burden and risk of carrying a dozen+ CDs.

There is no product support for GameDrive: all of my 14 emails were answered by the same form response. What a joke! Please save yourself the frustration and $35, and try Alcohol 52%.

The songs are fun to listen to and you remember them from the show (as all the instrumentals are played at one point or another.)

Took me a while to find a case for it since it would not fit the Stihl or Husky cases. I even tried the large boxy cases. I ended up getting a soft Echo case for it. There is some weirdness in the manual about using 2 different sized files for sharpening the chain but other than that it's not much different from other saws. It has a little plate that can be used to divert hot air to the carb for cold weather use. Though this is a large powerfull saw it is light and manageble.

After years of using Craftsman/Poulan & Mccullough, I am finally satisfied with my chainsaw. I get so excited when I find a job to do that I often volunteer to cut fallen trees for strangers. I would suggest that you check with your local Home Depot rental sales before buying a new saw. They retail for around $700 but Home Depot sales them after about 2 yrs of rentals for $200 or less. I recently purchased a Stihl Chromized Tip chain & it improves the cutting & lasts longer than reg chains. The price is hefty but worth every cent. Cuts even faster & lasts much longer without dulling. Go ahead & buy this saw....you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible binding","review":"When I received this book, the binding was broken and it looked like it was printed from a printer with poor quality paper.

By presenting poetry that is child-friendly (a child can understand), learn about the rules and make-up of various poetic forms such as the sonnet, villanelle, pantoum, and sestina. I ordered this book to help me with my writing by providing me with examples of poetic forms so I can challenge myself to try writing poetry in new forms. We really can learn a lot from children's books, and this book is so much more fun to read than a formal book of adult poetry that might present the same poetic forms."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design could have been better","review":"Great price, does the job but it could have been better. You have to hard mount it to a doorway, not what I had expected. Also, the threads screw in the same direction which makes tightening a pain.

Great picture, great sound, not too big, not too small. Overall a great product, and since I bought it from the amazon.com store, it arrived in a very short period of time and I have no fear of replacement if that becomes necessary. I do suggest that you buy a set of good airplane headphones and an extra battery.ATTENTION: Six months after writing this glowing review, the thing died on me. Skips, hangs up, voice does not coordinate with picture, battery gets so hot on long plane trips it burns your lap. Change the 5 stars to one half star.

However, a company like Audiovox should stand behind the products that they put out in the market place. Shame on Amazon for continuing to support this dirty little company."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA: Bad screen, and other features not as expected.","review":"Arrived defective -- bad screen. Audio quality also poor, very tinny: the speakers are not nearly as large as they appear. Volume had to be adjusted frequently during a movie, as did brightness. Vertical viewing range was very limited, had to re-tilt the display if I sat back in my chair.Note that with the battery pack attached, the unit is about twice the thickness of the one in the photograph. Any features beyond stop/pause/play require the remote, and the infared receiver is in an awkward location on the front of the unit.

For the first couple of months it worked just fine. However, in the last month, I have had nothing but problems with it. At this point, it will not successfully load any DVD's; stops playing and shuts off automatically with the error \\"unknown\\" disc. My biggest complaint is with Audiovox's customer service policy. Because the 90 day warranty is up, they want another $93.75 just to fix the obviously defective product. And the worst of it is how it comes on the heals of just paying $165.00 only 4 months prior! I would definitely think twice about buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree....do NOT purchase this unit!","review":"I don't think I'll buy any more Audiovox products at all.

I will wait and see how this claim works out before slamming Audiovox as a company. However, I would not buy the Model D1500A regardless of how low the price goes.

Not...considering that the majority of liberal people are secular progressives.It's strange how such a traditionalist can be a left winger. He's a great person and philanthropist and does a great job of explaining the humanistic virtues that permeate his views. A good read!! I'm not a religious person and, like others who reviewed this book, never felt like he was preaching. Much of what he says is based on family values and traditional americanism. Too bad he's not a Republican, he could probably do a great deal for conservative politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book I order","review":"As you can see above, I order a signed leather copy of the book. I got a regular hardback, not leather, not signed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carter... and the truth... well there's an oxymoron","review":"If anyone is looking to Jimmy Carter for guidance, they will be sorely disappointed. This is just more of the same from the same old Jimmy Carter. For 40 years he's been telling us that America is going to hell in a handbasket... and it just gets old. So negative, and yet he come's across like some caring grandfather. Truly, if ever there was a cup half empty guy, this is it. Stay clear, you'll just end up wanting to kick your dog. No good can come from sharing Jimmy's chronic despondency."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all Americans","review":"President Carter's insightful look at the direction in which our country is headed provides an outstanding review of the history of current events and where the direction of our government is likely to take us. This is the first of his books which I have read and won't be the last. A quick read, it is a must read for all Americans who love our country."},{"rating":"2","title":"christmas gift","review":"I just finished this book, it is a great read! It is for Christians, non Christians, Republicans and Democrats alike. I am sure God is looking down on this man with great love and appriciation. He is truely a good man and a gifted writer. This will be first on my list for christmas gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crisis?","review":"As ever, Jimmy Carter attempts to lecture on morality. I thought he better start worrying about his own. When it comes to this, perhaps he should be the last man to turn to for guidance, judging by his not so exemplary performance over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely Observations","review":"Thoughts of a deeply religious man, who was a former Naval Officer and who also bore the burdens of our nation's highest office. Simple truths, well spoken.UPDATE:More than a full year after reading President Carter's book, it becomes evident amidst today's political climate and America's social and economic down-turn, that had we listened more to the words of President Carter instead of his detractors, our nation would still be providing the strong position of world leadership that we once enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you need to start a fire...","review":"If you were trapped in a cave and need some paper to start a fire then buy this book. More of the same... Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Leader For Our Times","review":"This is the best non-fiction I have read in some time. Former President Carter has written a book that succinctly and clearly describes the dangerous path our current political leaders have taken. I carried it everywhere so at any spare moment, I could read even a few pages.His book reflects his belief (and my own) that the values and attributes of a \\"superpower\\" should include demonstrated \\"commitment to truth, justice, peace, freedom, humility, human rights, generosity, and the upholding of other moral values.\\" While I do not share President Carter's religious beliefs, I do agree with his concerns for the environment, the poor, the entwining of church and state, foreign policy and the arms buildup, to name a few.I highly recommend this book to readers who are not afraid of learning the facts about the severe decline of America's actions at home and in the international community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy dose of religion and political bias.","review":"I like Jimmy and have been impressed with his involvement in domestic and international events. This is the first book of his I tried to read. Endangered Values isn't much of a book, 202 pages in 17 chapters of double-spaced large font with plenty of white space interspersed throughout. If you can get over the heavy dose of religion sprinkled throughout the book, and the shady partisan statistics and studies cited within, he addresses a wide variety of issues. Sort of like trying to solve all the puzzles of the world in 60 or so regular pages. The biggest turnoff for me was the religion. Maybe my own fault considering the title and what I should've expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endangered left-wing values","review":"President Carter begins his book with commendable and non-controversial values such as honesty, love of neighbor and belief in God. Thus, at first, the book appears to be a defense of older values against secular modernity.However, President Carter quickly shifts gears into a critique of political and religious conservatives. It becomes clear that the people attacking his values are today's political and religious conservatives. The villains are Republican Evangelicals, Catholics and Jews.It turns out that the values President Carter is defending are largely the values of the modern left-wing elites -- abortion rights, homosexual rights, environmental rights and international law. Thus, President Carter is not actually defending traditional values against modernity. Instead, he is defending modernity against traditional values."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morality as a foundation","review":"President Carter writes that we as people need to be moral in all of our actions, even in politics. He understands, of course, that not everyone is that way and he describes why we need to come back to a starting point that is just and fair in the way we deal with eachother as human beings. We can be ruthless with eachother, and these words can have a sort of naivette about them, but then I have to remember that he was the President and to get that that position, one would have to be also adept at navigating thru the dark side of the political game as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid titles with \\"Virtues\\", Values\\", or \\"Morals\\" in them.","review":"Avoid this like you'd avoid the books of Bill Bennett. They touch popular themes, but not in a way that makes constructive use of your time. You need a process to decide why should you behave a particular way and a book preaching \\"shoulds\\" doesn't help you deal with the simple daily problems of living.Better you should set aside new age mumbo jumbo that speaks without foundation and, instead, read the Penguin edition of Montaigne's selected \\"Essays\\" or Seneca's \\"Letters from a Stoic.\\" That's the beginning of a legitimate classical education about living life wisely and well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A muddled message","review":"I'll admit I haven't yet finished this book. I find it rather diffiult work. Almost an act of faith in itself that by the end there will be revelation.I'm not a religious person. Although Jimmy doesn't constantly bring up religion on every page, it does feel as though he does. Hammering home Christianity, evangelism, fundamentalism and so on gets a little tiring for me. If America has a moral crisis, it's more likely to be caused by religion than solved by it. I don't need to believe in 'God' or 'our Saviour Jesus Christ' to have morals and morality. His heart is true but his message will probably only preach to the converted.On the book itself, it's poor value. Poorly made, thin, doubled spaced type and a reasonably large typeface. I wonder what the wordcount is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, there he goes again...","review":"Jimmy \\"stagflation, malaise, Olympic boycott, Iran hostage crisis\\" is at it again with his pious, higher-than-thou moral indignation. Carter has the rhetoric and demeanor of SNL's church lady as he scolds the present admistration and others for its alleged moral wrongs. Combined with his disgraceful politicizing of Coretta Scott King's funeral this book exemplifies his true malicious character. Not event the revisionist historians can rewrite one fact - Jimmy Carter was one of the worst President's ever whose name is synonomous with \\"Loser\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"stop the malaise I want to get off","review":"One more dishonest book by the United States worst ex-president. The howlers in this book would take a book to list. Jimmy takes credit for the wave of democratization thats taken place across the globe because of his administrations commitment to human rights. What a hoot!He found the Kims of North Korea leaders he could deal with. Today they still are in power, killing any Christians they can get their hands on. Soviet records revealed how lil Jimmy asked them for help in 1980 and 1984 in order to aid the democrats election chances. We focus now on PUNISHMENT!! , not rehabilitation. Yeah and the crime rate is now a fraction of what it was when he was president. Please read The Real Jimmy Carter, it is irrefutable, unlike the dishonest ramblings in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The American President","review":"This is fabulous source material for anyone interested in the great players of the cultural divide in America. Could there have been a Reagan Revolution without a Carter? Whether you are liberal, conservative, or independent you will find Carter's opinions provocative and informing. His beliefs and perspectives go to the heart of the matter in terms of understanding the essential modus operandi between right and left.Almost everyone after enough study of Carter will find things to love and things to hate. This book presents a fabulous opportunity to look inside the life of an old man struggling with his demons and insisting (indirectly) that his presidency in the end was a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carter's Assumption is off base.","review":"Former President Jimmy Carter bases this entire book on the mistaken assumption that he (or anyone else) has a worldview that is neutral. He thinks that everyday activity and the Christian faith can be neatly separated. He even attempts to incorrectly attribute this perspective to the founding fathers. Carter criticises many modern politicians and voters for allowing their religious beliefs to influence their approach to every decision they face. However, he never faces the fact that his view that religious beliefs are not the foundation of every act he undertakes is a religious position in itself. He is assuming that the secular worldview is the \\"right\\" perspective and anyone whose religious beliefs form the core of every action is \\"wrong\\". If you believe the myth of neutrality, you'll like this book. Otherwise, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimmy Carter screws up ......again!","review":"For years I have been hearing from my parents and others how Jimmy Carter screwed up during his devasting term (1 term thank God) as President of the USA. And I think that we never really recovered from Carter-nomics. Clintononomics sunk us even deeper. So Herbert Hoover can rest in his grave that at least two presidents did a worse job than him.Carter totally misses the point in this new book and real christians will not buy into the hype. Wasn't Jimmy Swaggert fron Georgia too?"},{"rating":"2","title":"He is in a whole different league than I thought","review":"I have been a populist conservative for some time. A religious one as well. Jimmy Carter has always been up there as the \\"worst\\" president in modern history - according to the conservative talking head mantra. I was just a little boy while he was president - and quite frankly all I remember is the Iran Hostage Crisis - and the decision not to go to the Moscow Olympic Games.Most recently, I have been horrified by the turn the \\"conservatives\\" have taken our country. Mr. Carter in this short book - hits every nail on the head - and then some. This is EXACTLY what is wrong with this country.Mr. Carter - you are truly the best \\"ex-President\\" this country has ever had. It will be men like you who bring us back to our senses. This should be REQUIRED reading for every American - especially those of the fundamentalist cloth."},{"rating":"2","title":"an important book","review":"There's a lot of great ideas here -- it's nice to read a book from a man who has a true humanitarian conscience. This book really opened my eyes to a lot of things I wasn't aware of, and while those on the conservative side of the spectrum might disagree with some of Carter's viewpoints, he is careful to note that many problems in today's politic landscape are the fault of both Democrats and Republicans. You might not agree with all of his opinions but there is a lot of good, sound logic here that is hard to argue with. Carter provides a critical look at some major issues happening in our world today without the undertone of resentment that so often colors political commentary. This is not a perfect book, but it is an important one. I recommend it to liberals and especially to conservatives -- it's always valuable to get a reasonable perspective from someone whose opinions differ from yours, and Carter speaks with a clear and direct voice that is even-tempered but strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive take on a subect that can be elaqueated","review":"As a moderate in this country, I have always felt uneasy with the current adminstration agenda. President Carter, who I feel is very genuine in this book, has detailed what is deeply wrong with the right wing of the Republican party. They have seemed to have \\"highjacked\\" patriotism to a level I have not seen in this country. The notion of \\"Either you're with us or against us\\" proves that fundamentalists have no direct business in government. The reason I gave the book 4 stars, is because Carter did not explain in great detail how we can peacefully combat the likes of the Dobsons, Robertsons, and the Farwells. Furthermore, this book was very uplifting, and once again proves to me that Christians are a group of people who help the poor, nonvoilent peace loving personas, something the Bush adminstration has forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man of Integrity","review":"Whether you agree with him or not, it's refreshing to read from a politician who is a thoroughly decent human being. In 2001, Jimmy Carter was the only former president to sit at George W Bush's inauguration (other than his father, of course). As a prominent Democrat supporting Bush's \\"Compassionate Conservatism,\\" he was well-placed to be the favorite of the White House and conservative community. When Bush turned on his professed values, Jimmy Carter was one of the few who had the guts to break with him, and this book is part of that public break. This came out well before Bush's popularity dropped, and other conservative Christian leaders didn't dare criticize the torture and violation of human rights. You can disagree with a lot of his points, but the book is an inspiring example of a Man of Integrity stating his mind. He takes on the conventional conservative wisdom about issues like abortion in a convincing manner. Definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree with everyone who said","review":"they will rate this book 5 stars just because the \\"ringers\\" hate it. Saw President Carter on Jon Stewart and it made me order the book right away. Go Jimmy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recomended","review":"I highly recomend this book for all who are insterested in the future of the United States. It should be required reading for all middle class wage earners who yoted for Repubicans without understanding their agenda or long range goals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise From the Liberal Peanut Gallery","review":"Carter was a politically-correct loser. No one wants to hear his religious moralizing, fundamentalist or no. We didn't want him then, we sure don't want him now. The best thing that happened to Jimmy Carter was Ronald Reagan. Carter needs to be quiet and go back to raising peanuts, a job he can handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The integrity and \\"carisma\\" of Mr. Carter with our times.","review":"I wrote \\"carisma\\" in spanish because I think it means much more than in English.

His statements are evidently real and we all should be listening.Make sure you read this book, it could be helpful too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Read","review":"This book was a great read. Very informative, full of truths. Every American should read this book. Way to go Jimmy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to expectations","review":"I had high hopes for this book but unfortunently it didn't live up to expectations.The first negative came in the forward when he mentioned that he was strong on defense when President. Having been in the Navy during that I time I can definently state that he wasn't strong on defense. As I read farther into the book while he gave lip service to the idea that both the liberals and conservatives had problems, in the end the book became a critique against the conservative veiwpoint.I was also disappointed that although he mentioned in many places what he believed, when he detailed his actions, I would wonder why he didn't take a stand.All in all this is Morals Lite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Carter","review":"Another diatribe by good 'ol Jimmy. I guess he figures he didn't screw up America enough with his Presidency. He has alot of nerve criticizing others. We are still dealing with Iran thanks to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bush please read this book...","review":"...And whatever the peanut recommends, do the opposite. We have a beautiful economy, the envy of every industrialized nation. If you want that to change listen to Carter. Whether he was unlucky, naive, or completely unqualified and incompetent for this office (combination of all four, heavy on the last two) Carter was a complete disaster as president. His only hope now is to criticize every sitting president to draw fire away from his dismal record. The U.S. cannot afford another Carter or his self-righteous advice. Jimmy, stick to building houses; its what you're good at.Politics aside, for a good laugh scroll up this page a little. As of this review they are grouping this book with Bill Clinton's My Life. I love seeing true irony of any sort. America's Moral Crisis being sold along with Bill Clinton's My Life definitely fits the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reply to T.F. Miller","review":"I agree with you that Carter was an ineffectual president. It would be more proper to say that he was histories worst president---the worst president in American history. And it's easy to see why Bernard Goldberg included Jimmy Carter (#6) as one of the top 100 people screwing up America.I am a christian and believe in the fundamentals that Carter tries to imply in this book, but Carter appears to be somewhat talking about values and looking the other way as members of his party act in ways that have nothing to do with values.I do agree that there is a moral problem in this country but Carter seems to skim over the real problems here. And considering how Pres. Bush won the 2004 election by such a wide margin (3 1/2 million votes) winning both the popular vote and the electoral college vote and nearly 2/3 of the states in the union, it appears that more Americans are tuned in to the Bush-morals than the other side.One more thing: Real christians spell God with a capital G."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"Here is all you need to know about this book. Imagine an aging Old School Liberal Modernist Baptist former President thinking that the classy way to rip the sitting president is to shroud it in the garb of a concerned Sunday School Teacher who between Mondays and Saturdays criss-crosses the globe looking for people to help come to terms with a outdated understanding of human rights. Yeah, that's this book.I can't help but wonder, though, whatever happened to that unwritten policy that former presidents do not comment on or detract from the work and direction of the current president? Carter apparently thinks that doing so as a concerned Christian makes it okay. I think that just makes it even less classy.I do have to give Mr. Carter some credit, though. If his reporting of the current administrations actions and attitudes is at all accurate, the U.S. has a long uphill battle to gain any respect from most of the rest of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS FREE ISN'T IT?? SHAME ON YOU JIM clean up your own house FIRST","review":"Jimmy Carter was and will always remain the worst President in the history of our USA. Weak and in no way Christian.

Perhaps the Democrats have these two in mind for 2008."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimmy Carter's Liberal Agenda","review":"Another desperate attempt at taking shots at the current administration. His efforts in helping the needy are admirable, but he is so far removed from running a country. He can not truly grasp the challenges our leaders face in today's world full of terrorism and uncertainty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuous, Empty Rhetoric","review":"I'm a Republican, which is why I received this as a joke Christmas present from my Democrat brother in law. I decided to give it a shot, if for nothing other than sharpening my critiques of democrat positions. I found this book to be surprisingly empty on substance. Carter spouts unsupported easily refuted liberal canards, while managing to avoid taking a serious side on any major issue. I imagine this will satisfy the average democrat looking for someone else to espouse what they feel without the nuisance any real facts to support the average knee jerk positions in the book. It's a great book for fans of Carter. Had it been written by an unknown, it is doubtful it would have even been published. It is that empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching From The Ego","review":"A failed President continues his lifelong campaign of post hoc image building. It was precisely this President's obession with his internal sense of \\"morality\\" that illustrated just how dangerous intellectual detachment can be in high office. His ill timed pronouncement on the Olympics, his short sighted view of Iran and the Shah and other blunders were the catalysts for much of the turmoil in the modern world today. Such performance in a President disqualifies him from pronouncements on today's political morality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst president ever.

I wasn't about to pay the fifteen dollars to read what Preacher Jimmy has to say about America's foreign policy. Now that the Democrats have taken over Congress I'm sure we'll all have to get out the barf bags because we'll be seeing a lot of Jimmy. It's not enough that he whored for the Nobel prize for years, but his actions during the Reagan administration were dispicable at best and treasonous at worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read this book, if you are a Republican or Fundamentalist.","review":"There are at least two types of people that will attack what Carter has written; those who are fundamentalists and want our country to become a theocracy, and rabid Republicans who attack anything democratic. Before you get in a hoot, I'm neither Republican or Democrat.I praise this book for pointing out how morally corrupt this administration is and how close we are to becoming a theocracy. Witch burnings, inquisitions, and torture are in our future unless there is a regime change. Two of these events have already made the news and Carter points out that we have had two people boiled alive.The main criticisms I have with this book:- It presents some of the causes and problems with our current administration but offers no solutions. Maybe it is just meant to raise awareness.- He fails to acknowledge that fundamentalism flourishes under organized religion and fails to cast a critical eye towards it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reenvisioning the heart of America","review":"Goes right to the heart of what is wrong with American and Fundamental politics, their lost vision, their Bible without Jesus outlook.

In point of fact giving kudos to President George Bush I, for many of the moderate positions that our current President eschews. President Carter points out the dangerous in fact wildly provocative positions of the current administration. He illustrates the rise of fundamentalism and its impact on world stability. It was a timely insightful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have KNOWN Better...","review":"Based on the Pub Weekly review, I thought I might enjoy the topic - I agree with that premise.

Who can forget \\"Sleepy Shores\\" and its wonderful piano solo, or \\"In the Limelight\\", so uplifting. This is instrumental music from the 50's and 60's that was written for TV commercials and sitcoms. Once you listen to it, you become attached to it and you never want to let go.

I loved the music of the school educational movies, and I never knew there would be some other nuts who would love it enough to put it together on disc. My kids love it too. My wife, alas, doesn't get it, but puts up with it out of love of family. Great for breaking tension when it's time to clean the house.

Its over 16 minutes long but it holds your attention and never gets boring. very good stuff"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"This, Iced Earth's third release, sounds more like Slayer than Iron Maiden... mainly because of the struggles the band was going through at the time. What came out of that mess though is one of the most angry sounding albums I've heard. Matt Barlow, one of the best singers in Heavy Metal history, makes his debut on this album, and he is the perfect fit. The title song is probably my favorite here... but other classics like \\"Last December\\", and \\"Dante's Inferno\\" are amazing also. Almost every reviewer here has mentioned the amazing \\"Dante's Inferno\\" and I can't say anything about it that hasn't already been said. Basically, it has to be heard to be beleived! This album is so good, it's almost hard to believe that Iced Earth's best days are still ahead of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant....Slayer who?","review":"Iced Earth is one of only two bands that recieves constant 5 star reviews from me. (The other being Metallica). This is a true metal masterpiece. This blows away anything in Slayer's entire catalogue, yet they aren't famous. \\"Burnt Offerings\\" is one of the best metal songs ever written, and \\"Dante's Inferno\\" could be THE best. \\"Diary\\" is a very cools song and so is \\"Creator Failure\\". If you like metal and have not heard Iced Earth, you are not the metalhead that you claim to be, simple as that."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great metal.","review":"Ok, this is my first Iced Earth album.To start, I do disagree with some previous reviewer who said this was thrash metal. Nope, not even close. This is metal. i do agree that the BEST metal song I have heard yet is Dante's Inferno, althougth long. The singing on the first track did catch me off guard, but still rocked. I would like to know what metal most of these people listen too. They say it is not great and they have heard better. What, Judas Priest, ha? Even Metallica's Ride the Lightening isn't better, but still damn good. All I say is I have listened to every kind of metal from death to Nordic and this is a standout album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Iced Earth at their best","review":"First off Iced Earth is probably the greatest thrash metal band ever. I'm a huge Iced Earth fan and I know good Iced Earth when I hear it. This is probably one of Iced Earth's weakist albums. \\"Burnt Offerings\\" is an excellent song that is original. \\"Last December\\" has some excellent vocals. Then 3-6 are just horrible. \\"Pierced Spirit\\" is a very emotional and sad song that I felt was done very well. Then there is good ol' \\"Dante's Inferno\\". An epic masterpiece, it's never boring. The bottom line is if you are a new Iced Earth fan the check out \\"SWTWC\\" \\"The Dark Saga\\" or \\"Alive in Athens\\". This album has some must have songs for Iced Earth fans, but I recommend you check out a few other IE albums first."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"Let me give you a brief summary on this album,it rules.Jon Schaffer knows how to make great albums and Matt Barlow rules at singing.Every song is great,but the stand out songs are Burnt Offerings,Last December,and Dante's Inferno.If you're a true headbanger and you don't have this album get it,and if you're a POSER or you listen to Metallica,you should not own this,this album is only for true headbangers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready for a scorching ride","review":"Once again these guys create a masterpiece,This time with a new singer Enter Matt Barlow. This guy can sing with a passion that will blow you away. As always Jon tears it up with killer riffs. Some of my favorite Iced Earth songs came from this release. Burnt Offerings, Last December, Brainwashed, and Dantes Inferno. Perhaps a bit darker than other releases, it still has the distintive sound that makes them the best. Take my word if you are a fan of true metal, this is the band to listen to, and this is a great album to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"&#65533;Iced Earth&#65533;?

It's different for a Tiesto mix cd. This is due to the fact that it was his first release on a North American label; hence it was geared to our market. This is probably the most \\"unique\\" Tiesto cd there is, and that can be good or bad. If you heard it without knowing who was mixing, you may not think it was Tiesto. That being said, it is overall a very good mix. In typical Tiesto fashion, he starts out slow, lets the music peak towards the end and ends on a high note with Sparkles. Probably not a \\"must have\\" except for fans and collectors, but a decent fun mix, though now a little dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I've never heard of DJ Tiesto until one day i was browsing through amazon and decided to purchase this album based on the incredible reviews. All i can muster out of my mouth after hearing this album is WOW.Track one is my favorite track, and is possibly the most rivoting piece of trance i have ever heard, the effects Tiesto makes of an outer space journey was a perfect intro to an amazing track overlayed with opera followed by an amazing build-up into an extremely powerful climax.. i almost sh!t my pants. The rest of the album is also very very good, but im not going to go into details, buy it and experience it for yourself.I now own a nice collection of Tiesto cd's all because i was so entranced by this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"our cosmic temple never closes its doors","review":"Tiesto's Summerbreeze is warm and refreshing. A captivating release, featuring some hot female vocals. They take the listener on an emotional rollercoaster through our galaxy. Sometimes a cosmic cathedral, sometimes the Blue river. Sometimes a computer factory, and finally the discotheque to the stars. Definitely one of Mr.Tiesto's greatest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm confused...","review":"After hearing Tiesto hailed as \\"one of the best trance djs out there\\" by several different people, reading the rave reviews here on Amazon, and looking at the sticker on the album that compares him to Paul Oakenfold, I was convinced: this album would be amazing. But as soon as I popped into my cd player, I was in for a big disappointment. All the tracks leading up to the best track are completely unmemerable. (That would be track 10, the Delerium \\"In Search of Sunrise\\" remix, which is why I gave this album 2 stars). I am a huge electronica fan, and so is my brother, who also heard this record playing and remarked how completely bland it is. Not bad, but bland. I would definitely say dwnld a few of these tracks before you waste your money. The electronica genre is filled with potholes like these, save your money for something original and different. ... ...I am at a complete loss as to how some people can find this worthy of 5 stars..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiesto is a Trance god.","review":"I had heard of Tiesto until this past August when I got to see him play live in Amsterdam at the quarterly Wildlife party at Melk Weg ( Milky Way ) I had bought his Magik : Live in Amsterdam only a couple of days before that and found out it was recorded at the same club at the last Wildlife party. The cd was incredible but not as awe inspiring as watching him take a capacity crown and lead them through a journey into trance. The entire place moved and I'm not talking about just the dancefloor, he is a great technical dj and has mastered the art of the buildup better than anyone I have seen. If you like good Trance then you can't go wrong with DJ Tiesto, I recomend trying to find the Magik series if you can. I only saw it in Amsterdam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its an $18 club photo of Tiesto.......Thats about it.","review":"Kinda technoish, not Tiesto at all.

The selected psalms are accompanied by extensive notes, explaining the Latin in terms of the Hebrew from which they were translated. For example, one aspect of Hebrew verb forms(completed vs. uncompleted actions) explains how the Latin translation can be either present or past tense. There is also a brief introduction describing the early history of the Latin Psalter text. The major disappointment of this book is its size; one wishes the author had annotated the entire Psalter, not just a few dozen psalms. In his introduction, LaDoceur alludes to just such a future project, but apparently it is yet to be realized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased History","review":"This book is badly flawed because of the author's rabid Germanophobia,which practically drips off of neary every page.Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This One Will Grow On You","review":"Great CD With Fantastic Guitar Playing !

The question of when the millennium ends is not one of opinion, it is what it is. There is no year zero. Zero is an instant, namely the origin of the time axis. Let's graduate this axis in years. The interval between zero and 1, is called year 1. The interval between zero and -1, is called year -1. I repeat: there is no year zero. If the instant zero is the birth of Christ, year 1 is year 1 AD, year-1 is year 1 BC. And, of course, the second millennium after Christ ends on December 31, 2000. That's all there is to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Millennnium: Just a Thousand Years","review":"As the year 2000 approached us, millennial worries proved quite the cash crop for pop culture. Although Gould goes into a lot of detail, providing more than most of us ever cared to know about the millennium, his book is a valuable and very necessary addition to an aspect of our culture that generally seems to promote fear in its beholders.

To me this compilation seems like somebody just slapped Aleister Crowley's name on it in order to make some money.

She growled a little bit but that was it. After every paw I would give her some turkey. She has not bothered them at all, she acts like they aren't even there. It has been 10 days and all 18 of them are still on. I put them on her front and back paws so there wouldn't be any chance of scratching. She is a small boned cat, about 7 1/2-8 lbs, and I ordered the small. They fit, but they didn't go all the way on, so I ordered medium to try after these fall off.

I think they have been on my cat for a good 6 weeks now. At least. She still scratches at my rugs, and she has ruined the corners of them, regardless of the caps. Which really makes me mad. I basically wasted my money. I wanted an alternative to declawing, this is not it.I still can't get the damn things off, so I am just clipping her nails through the caps, until the caps finally grow off.

Filmed in a lot of darkness with jerky camera work and annoying fadeouts, the movie tries hard for suspense but ultimately fails miserably. An ecoterrorist group breaks into a facility to release test animals; they are aided by the security guard who is dating the big shot's daughter. They find no animals but when their computer geek opens all the doors, they release a secret genetic experiment---a girl who injects her victims with a poisonous toxin that liquefies their innards and is contagious as well. Seems like the father of the heroine has been trying to cure this girl for ten years---we never know what he's curing her of or who she is. Needless to say, the girl gets out and eats up most of the cast. Edward Furlong, whose career has pretty much gone down hill since his TERMINATOR days is the security guard and he is as bad as the rest of the unknowns cast.

Lee gets fair treatment. He was a man of sound character and ethical principles. He had a strong belief in God's guiding providence.William T. Sherman, for the most part was treated objectively and fairly. Sherman was no where the 'devil' that those in the South made him out to be. It was his conviction that the only way to end the War was to make every one feel it's terrible consequences. To that end he waged 'Total War' in the south. He was right.All in all this is a good production. I have recommended it and loaned my copy to several friends.

The story is about the stuggle of Ulric Von Bek against the Nazi's. Elric plays a significant part here, but this is only partially his story. The story moves slower than most of Moorcock's works. While some people find this a fault, to me it adds more versimultitude than his previous books. Ulric and Elric are interesting in their similarities and differences. Ulric while sharing Elric's albinoism and brooding nature, is still the production of a more civilized era. If you are looking for a simple retread of the previous Elric books, don't look here, but if you want a novel that takes the Multiverse and expands on it you will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Stunning","review":"Moorcock has done it again! This book is captivating to say the least. Moorcock's imagery and vivid descriptions add a life to this novel, I have never seen before. This book is simply stunning. The social and religious satire, set a cynical mood, that seems to carry on through the book. Adding to it's unparalleled brilliance. If you have ever enjoyed a Moorcock novel, you must read this book! I can't say enough about this excelent work! Thank you Michael! From the bottom of my strange and delighted soul, thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Elric movie!","review":"Reading this, I thought what a great first Elric movie it would make. It starts in recognizeable history, then moves into weird fantasy worlds, then back into the real world. I know Mr Moorcock is famous for refusing to let Elric be filmed until the 'right' maker comes along, but this would really work great and maybe he could get Brad Pitt back to play him (rumor was Pitt was interested in doing Elric a few years back). Pitt would now make a great Elric of Melnibone! Think of Pitt when you read this and you'll see what I mean! With all the other movies coming out, surely it's time we got our Elric movie now! Please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moorcock does it again","review":"Yet again, Michael Moorcock has given us a great tale of adventure to keep us up until the wee hours of morning reading. I give this book four stars rather than five because the book gets a little too multiversially philosophical at times. This gets a little old--Plus, as always, Moorcock is a little too dualistic in his view of the struggle between good and evil-- Probably, though, that is just because I have read so many of his books and heard most of it before. At any rate, this book is a great addition to the Elric sage--certainly a far cry better than the \\"Revenge of the Rose.\\" I also liked how we were given a more intimate glimpse of Elric from a first-person narrative standpoint. Overall, a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Reader","review":"The Dreamthief's daughter is a sort of parallel Elric story of sorts. However, it is based around Von Bek. This time, Count Ulrich Von Bek of nazi Germany.Von Bek has a sword called Ravenbrand, which, in another life, is Elric's Stormbringer. The nazis are aware of its power, and the resistance brings it to Von Bek's attention, beginning a conflict between Von Bek and his nazi relative, with appearances by Elric and other versions and parts of the Eternal Champion saga.Another battle for the multiverse begins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant development","review":"I was amazed by this book. Somehow Mr Moorcock has managed to create another Elric book which comes close to having the power of what is indisputably the best of the series, Stormbringer. Unlike the previous reviewer, I found it fresh and exciting and a deepening and broadening of the Elric mythos. While the 'underground' sequences are slower than the rest of the book, I felt that this was deliberate, recreating the kind of 'classic' effect you find in writers like E.R.Eddison or even the great Professor Tolkien who is Mr Moorcock's only equal. Other reviewers have described the plot very thoroughly and anything I added would be a spoiler. But I would recommend this novel one hundred percent. Not only has Mr Moorcock lost none of his old magic, he has added to and made deeper what has gone before. Highly recommended to new and old Moorcock fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Moorcock Fan: Mike's Abysmal Worst EVER","review":"Nevermind patron demons of Law and Chaos, this book clearly proves that Michael Moorcock's muse has abandoned him completely, transmuting our yarn spinner into a sermonizer. How many more Elric stories must we endure in which he's whisked away to another dimension? (At least this time we haven't been slapped with the usual automatic amnesia for the albino at the finish.) All in all, this book is the Wizard of Oz hung with multiverse musings. And war is bad musings.If Elric is Moorcock's best character, vonBek has become his worst. A navel-gazer of the first division with a propensity for inaction, vonBek narrates most of the story to the reader's detriment.Boring, boring, boring.If you want to maintain your respect and affection for Moorcock, just pretend this one was never written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major bad: sent plus size, not pettit","review":"pretty much sums it up.

It is an extremely cheesy style of metal, that I only gave a second star to because of the quality vocals. Nearly all of the songs are written in the same key, and all use the same chords. There is no variation in speed whatsoever. Every song sounds the same. When I first listened to the album, I didn't even realize that the first song was over, and it turns out that I had already listened to the first 4 tracks. The only positives are that the lead singer is very good, and that the lyrics are tolerable. Don't waste your time though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This cd was utter and bitter disappointment. According to most of the other reviews, this cd is supposedly haunting,dark,melodic, and beautiful. The singer sounds like she's singing broadway tunes and the music is anything but dark.

I am a fan of goth/rock/prog music, and I don't understand the appreciation for this album. Every band in or affecting the goth scene cannot be compared to this. Lacuna Coil...heads above the Gathering, sonically and lyrically. Evanescence..there is no comparison to this piece of badly-mixed offal. This CD disappointed me in so many respects that I almost tossed it after one listen. There are so many things wrong with this album that it is actually hard to describe without charts..and that is no exaggeration.The only saving grace on the entire CD is the resonating Anneke van Giersbergen. Sadly, her bandmates play so poorly that it drowns any wonder you might feel at her lilting, haunting voice. Is she as good as Amy Lee? Absolutely not. But when compared to the other members of her band, she stands alone on a stage of pretentious songwriting, poorly mixed music, and coma-inducing arrangements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I have a '83 Suzuki DT5.

I don't know...","review":"Much as I've tried to like him, I don't \\"get\\" devin townsend - I don't understand why he's so popular. I suspect it's just because he deviates slightly from the norm in extreme metal, a genre in which any departure from the rigid formulas laid down decades ago is normally attacked viciously, but he has the ego, personality and will to back his ideosyncracy up, so instead of being labeled a \\"sell out\\", \\"not true to the scene\\" or whatever, he's hailed as a prophet. Not to say this guy doesn't mean business: he is, after all, a genuine manic depressive, one of that rare breed of musicians like Ian Curtis or Kurt Cobain who are genuinely not right in the head, and thereby make music, and the world, a lot more interesting. I have to say I really like Happy Camper, on account of it sounding really really sincerely cheesed off, and Skin Me awakens some kind of primal headbanging instinct, but otherwise it just sounds badly written and over produced to me. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"For its time- Inventive!","review":"Les Baxter is and was a versitile arranger. This recording is very, VERY good, with a lot of latin and Hawain influenced beats. I believe this was recorded in the early or late 1960's... maybe early seventies, and the big band horn arrangements support this. It is a fun record it you understand the time this was created for! Another reviewer mention that they heard sound bits from this record on a Thievery Coorporation recording. This original record was made for the Martini crowd (smile), not the trip hop gen X cohort. Get yourself in an old-fashioned party mode and put this record on in the backround. It will create a festive mood and if your mind drifts of into its subtle complexities, let go to it and have a good time! It is a collectors piece too.

The angles were distracting, and keyboard navigation was variable. How can you fight something when the camera view is from behind your head?? It is really incomprehensible who would have thought that anything but a quick switch to first person in a fight mode would be the only way to present these scenes.

We are very fortunate that this band has come to save us from the simple minded D-tuned trash that come to be so hip. (D tuning is a way to tune a guitar when you don't really play very good.)

Nevermore always play a few nice solo's, usually at least 1 in each song and they create some great riffs. With songs like What Tomorrow Knows, Garden of Gray, Hurting Words, and Godmoney i don't really see how others can discard this as 1 of their worst cd's.

The spec claims that they have a frequency response of 20 Hz to 20 kHz. I sincerely doubt it. I would guesstimate that the high end goes up to about 12 kHz and that's about it.

Unlike other (recent) novels on Spider-Man this one drew on the wealth of background information on the character from his many comic series - without going over board or assuming the reader is aware of every aspect of the Spider-Man mythology.I also like the fact that this book does not have Venom - this super villian seems to have had a lot of exposure in other books (and that is not to say I don't like the character). But the gathering of the Six has a lot of plots to follow which kept my attention through out the entire book.Too bad the publisher could not tell me when Parts 2 and 3 will be available.

Well, I finally decided to try the iPod Nano recently. I was delighted to find the sound amazingly clear, the capacity for so many songs on such a small instrument staggering (I have the 4GB)and the task of transferring songs very easy! Only one complaint; you don't receive detailed instructions with the purchase and there are important instructions missing from the help site on iTunes and in the instruction manual (found available on the Apple website).I've already transferred almost 400 songs to the iPod.

It's so much more convenient than the big pod but holds plenty, and it's way better than the shuffle because it has a display. I LOVE it!I'm sorry Apple saw fit to make a 3rd gen nano (with video - which I DON'T want). They no longer sell this treasure. Why?As far as iTunes being hard? I've never heard that.

After spending my $150.00 on the Nano, taking excellent care of it and not overusing it at all, barely touching the thing, the scroll wheel fizzled out and the software quit. I took it to an Aplle store where they wanted to charge me $100.00 to \\"fix\\" it. After a brief argument, they ended up just giving me a new (probably refurbished) one which has lasted under 6 months. How is it possible that it can charge overnight and then it only plays for 20 minutes? What's worse is that I couldn't get my ITunes to sync with the new 'pod.

The shuffle feature is great because it's like listening to the radio except there are no commercials and you are guarenteed to love every selection! The only problem I have encounted is that the text is small so you may need glasses to pick specfic artists or categories! It holds approx. 500 songs, less depending on their length or if you have a lot of photos.

I tore through my house when i got back, and even cleaned my room, something I hadn't done in a long time. You could not imagine the relief i felt when my friend found it yesterday at her house.The point is, it's cute, music is great, everyone loves color. But its small. This is not really accepted until the box arrives and you take it out of its box. BE CAREFUL! Your Ipod Nano is like a baby. Babies are cute too, but you wouldn't leave them around just anywhere.

This software glitch has not yet been addressed by Apple.After 3 weeks, my unit became locked in the HOLD position, meaning that none of the buttons work and the ipod becomes a paperweight. This seems to be a common problem, but no fix has come out, other than to return the item.

It does all the same things including playing music and slide shows. There of course are a few problems. For one the ipod scratches like no other. If you barley even touch you will see a mark on the body. Just a minor touch to the screen makes a mark that is easily visible. Another problem wiht the ipod is that it cracks in half easily. My friend sat down with it in his pocket and it cracked in half rigth down the middle. All in all I have to say that I just don't like this ipod. I do know that you can buy a case for it but it costs almost 30 dollers to buy a case that isn't that good. I would highly recomend buying the new ipod that can play videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"IPOD 8Gig","review":"Easy to use.

Can be recharged easily, but battery life much better than previous models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice...but the price?","review":"This thing holds 2 GB of data. This equals about 250 songs. \\"What only 250? There are way better mp3 players with way more memory!\\" Let's face it. Who listens to 250 songs a day, even a week? If you want to hear new stuff, how long does it take to add and delete songs? I have over 4,000 songs on my computer, and this thing works just fine. I don't think anyone needs more than 2 GB of data. Yeah, changing songs every day can be a hassle, but there's no need to go any higher. The only thing that I see as a problem is the price. You could buy the 20GB Photo for only a hundred more dollars. The math for the prices is not linear. The 20GB should cost 10 times that of the Nano since its hard drive is 10 times bigger, or better yet the Nano should cost a tenth of the 20GB, making it about $30. Just a thought, Apple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small/convenient","review":"My 2 GB iPod is great,once I learned how to use it.

I bought a black nano and don't want to use a different color case. Overall, it is nice. Only negative part is that as soon as you touch the nano, shades of your fingerprints gets traced to the nano and if you try to erase the traces with the cloth, the surface gets messy.

You bump the click wheel the wrong way and end up cranking up the volume when you just wanted to skip to the next song. Several times the next song would come on and be too loud (despite using the automatic volume normalizing feature in iTunes), I would hit the click wheel and get stuck on the main menu page. So I'd have to take my headphones out, wait for the menu to disappear, only then would I be able to turn the volume back down. They really should have a \\"jogging mode\\" that just isolates the click wheel to have four \\"regions\\" that you just have to touch for changing songs and adjusting volume, much like the Shuffle has...which is what I'm buying instead.The battery life was pretty dismal too, but that has already been discussed in other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"im not a kid but oh my goodness.....apple could do so much better","review":"this is a cool mp3 player, so darn small, but it broke in half when i accidently dropped it!! it scraches so easily too. but wow, breaking in half! make a tougher ipod next time, apple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Nice!","review":"I really wanted this iPod for Christmas and I was extremely happy when I saw it.

There is only a few minor dislikes about it :1. The back of the iPod nano gets fingerprints on it very easily, so hopefully there will be cases soon.2.When you play brick, the click wheel does not move that well.Those are the only things that would cause a small problem, but they are easy to overcome.

You see, pink, especially hot pink, is by far my favorite color. I figured that they can't be that bad and now that I own it and I've used it I see exactly why people are drawn to the iPod, it's easy to use once you adjust to the wheel.

Until the second day. It was scratched so badly you would think some cat had a fever. If you have to have one, get a sleeve for it first. Don't open the box until you get a sleeve! Then be sure you use the softest cloth possible to put it in its sleeve. Then never, ever take it out of its sleeve. In a sleeve, it may not look as cool as the product you bought but it won't have any scratches on it. Well at least not as many. At least then you'll be able to see the screen.

I guess it knocked against something, but I can't pinpoint an occasion where it would have.I can't get a refund or repairs with the LCD damage (despite it only being 3 months old), and while it still plays, I can't see if I'm on the menu or the songs - so it drives me crazy.It was really fun while I had it though, despite getting scratched a lot.

That's right, it's more miniature than the iPod mini, and the display is color! It's clear that these two superior elements are the reasons why Apple decided to do away with the original iPod mini line; however many consumers are upset that the iPod nano's storage capacity is smaller than what the iPod mini used to be. At 2GB and 4GB, though, the capacities are higher than the current iPod shuffle line and the pricing falls right in line in between shuffles and regular color iPods.I made mistake buying to small iPod Nano 4GB, I wish it was bigger like 30GB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for music lovers","review":"I bought this for my fiancee who has never previously owned any iPod or MP3 player.

She loves it and, like tens of thousands of others, is becoming addicted to it. She doesn't want it to be a video player or a phone but rather just to play music and NPR downloads so it is jsut about perfect for her needs. So far, the only drawback is that we're having difficulty finding a car-radio attachment that works well since she doesn't have a cassette player in her car and needs to use one of the cigarrette lighter plug-ins.

Instead the screen turns black with a white Apple logo displayed for approximately 5-6 seconds, then the screen goes off completely for a moment, then reboots to the black screen with the Apple logo for a few seconds then displays the main menu. Sometimes the root folder of the mp3 file that didn't work is removed from the directory tree.I haven't found anything online about this glitch--as far as a firmware update or if this problem is widespread.

I remember the \\"IBM-Big Brother\\" SuperBowl ad way back when. Turns out Apple is Big Brother. Incompatibilities among its own products. Doesn't play nice with other hardware and software. Locks customers into proprietary formats. Fixes prices (ever see an iPod discounted?). Can't wait for the Feds to investigate - one of these days. I wish I'd bought two Zens -- there's a great product. Don't waste your $$ on a proprietary system like iPod, no matter how \\"hip\\" it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe if I could use it, my rating would be higher","review":"This is a beautiful product. But, if you're like me and have next to no computer savvy, be wary: iTunes 7 can be excruciatingly slow. I put in a CD more than a day ago to import to iTunes, and it is still not done. I have no idea what to do. The iPod, which I named Lulu, was plugged into my computer for the first time yesterday, and ever since has been sporting the \\"do not disconnect\\" screen.

The seller said they could still send it out but I said please just cancel the order. I did not receive a response stating that the order was canceled so I sent another email to the seller saying \\"Please verify that the order has been canceled.

Within those three months, the nano has locked up on me 4 times with no explanation (this has also happened to two other people I know). As I'm scrolling through the songs, the nano will simply stop responding and there is nothing left to do but wait a day for the battery to completely drain. It becomes very frustrating at the gym! SO do yourself a favor and go buy a \\"no-name\\" brand for less money. I will be going back to my old 2 gig \\"no-name\\" brand that has worked flawlessly within the past 3 years.

The battery life is great. My only gripe about this model is that when you first power it on and select a song or pod cast, it frequently locks up. This requires a hard reset of the nano. I suspect this is a firmware bug.

I started off putting on my 2pac collection and the sound quality is great, just not on the ipod headphones. Yes, you may have heard it before, they are crappy quality and they hurt your ears. I am currently using them though, and in a few days my sony headphones will arrive. Well back to the actual ipod, the picture feature is good, I can view all my pics but of course its small so I guess for pics get a bigger screen player. The shuffle feature is great and is practically stutter free. I don't know if its me or what but seems as if my ipod screen is crooked, but I don't really care I guess but this and the phones bring it down a star. The click wheel took me a day or two to get used to but now its comfortable. The playlist feature is kind of tricky though.

It is solid, and has an nice interface. My problems with it are as follows - it has less features then nearly every other mp3 player on the market, and you can not change the battery with out having apple do it for you (it costs as much as the nano to have it replaced). Batteries only last a few years, so this item is really a consumable. If you dont care about the many features that most other players (of nearly the same size) have (radio, voic recording, etc..) and you dont care that it has a limited life then get it. The build quality, and interface are nice.Pros: well built, and nice interfaceCons lacks features, limited life"},{"rating":"2","title":"everyone says why this one?","review":"Well, I know this iPod is the same price as the smaller iPod video. There are many reasons I bought this one. 1- I wanted the small size, to have in my pocket while working. 2- I was trading in a 6Gb mini, I didn't want less space. 3- I prefer 2nd generation computer stuff, so I'll wait until the next release for the video iPod.I love this iPod. It's fantastic. The size is perfect for 1000+ songs , a couple of audiobooks, some language lessons and a bunch of podcasts. I have yet to outlast the battery on any average day. The controls, though smaller, are just as easy to use. The screen and colors are fantastic. I even stuck a photo of the cats on to show off. The size and weight is fantastic. I like the black color, though I have also bought an iSkin case to protect it while working. The playback and volume is flawless.

Outlook Contacts can be synced, but not calendars.

Its very durable and protects your entire ipod and you can't even see it. It takes a little patience to put it on but is worth the effort. If you are planning on purchasing a nano its a must!The only thing that irritated me about it was that it doesn't come with a users manual. You need to read it on line or print it out (its 58pgs long). Their customer service people were not very helpful and sort of rude.

RL strikes a fine balance between club type songs and romantic ballads. i myself being more partial to ballads, thoughly enjoyed them. the more upbeat songs where also finely executed. the guest appearances on the album did not overshadow RL, only enhanced his smooth delivery. giving thanks to his lord and saviour on the final track called \\"thank you\\" showed his spiritual side. overall, a wonderful first solo outing from RL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me more!","review":"Man I have been waiting for something from this cat since NEXT'S \\"Butta Luv\\".

Track 5, \\"Good Man\\", kinda reminds you of \\"These are the Times\\" by Dru Hill. It doesn't come close to the greatness of that song though. Tracks 8 and 12 had potential, just not executed. Listening to this CD was like watching the Trailblazers play basketball. A lot of potential and hype but just erratic.

I was never a priest but went to Catholic School and became friends with many priests, even close friends with several. The priests in the novel are nothing like those I knew. Neither were the nuns I knew anything like those in the book. What gives? Could there really be people like that with commitment enough to become priests or nuns? I suppose so.

At times you will be screaming at how much of a jerk Bryce is and also you will be saying \\"Yea, she is crazy\\" when reading Bryce's side. When the perspective switches it can be bad because you hear the same thing and the exact same story. It can also be bad because you forget that you switched to a different perspective because the story is told in the first person, you will hear about the same event and will say to yourself, \\"Hey, this sounds familiar\\". But the good is that the story shows what both characters think and not in the more traditional way of it being in third person-omniscient. Overall I give this book a 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexplicably amazing","review":"This book is so extraordinary, the voice and perspectives of Julia and Bryce are unique and a perfect fit for the book.

I need to find that movie.It also taught me A lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BEST BOOK EVER!","review":"\\"Flipped\\" is the best book ever , it is a book about two different peoples point of views . There is a young boy, Bryce, and a young girl Juliana . If you read this book I know that you will love it .Especially if you like stories about people's feelings for each other that change constantly. So hurry up and buy this book before there are no more on the shelves!

Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to literature, maybe not that bad","review":"I believed this book [stunk] beyond all belief. This book isn't really a story, it's a series of events told from two different points of view. After a while, you get kinda bored with reading the same story but told differenty. This book is sorta like those books that are written to teach a lesson. And I'd rather read a good Harry Potter book anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flipped","review":"I never got to decide because it never got to my home. It was too late for me to use as a gift, so I did cancel the order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I think that this book was a really good book. I really liked how each chapter was a different point of view from each person. I thought that was a really good technique for writing books. I also think that the book taught you a really good lesson to. I think that the lesson was to never judge a person by what they look like on the outside and to get to know them before you start to judge them. I think this is a really good lesson to be learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book With A Great Lesson","review":"I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to purchase a gift for a child between the ages of 9 and 15. I love the way the chapters alternate between the two characters and gives the reader the other persons point of view. It is easy reading, the story flows and the message is repeated. It is also a great book for adults who may need to be reminded of the simple things in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for any age!","review":"I picked up this book as a fluke--I had seen it many times in the library, bookstore, and in magazines. I picked it up one day though because there was nothing else available to me.I am so happy I did pick it up! The book is highly entertaining--especilly for those of us who may be in our late teens or early 20's. Being of that age, we can appreciate the subtle humor that the younger crowd may not catch. We still can remember the days of young school crushes, and we're a little older to see the wisdom and grand scheme of the book.I highly recommend \\"Flipped\\". You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why you should read the book \\"Flipped\\"","review":"The setting of \\"Flipped\\" takes place in a modern day era. The theme is communication and friendship. A young boy named Bryce and a girl named Juli are both the protaganist and the antagonist because they each switch roles throughout the story. Flipped is about a girl and a boy who don't get along so well. Bryce Loski doesn't like Juli one single bit; she is a total pain. Juli thinks Bryce is just perfect! When you read the book, you will discover the pros and cons of their relationship. It is told in first person narrative by both characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flipped","review":"Flipped is a great book about how a middle class boy moves into a new neighborhood. When he moves in, a girl from next door comes and annoys him. A couple months latter, a new boy moves in next to him. He acts the same way that the girl did when he moved in. This is a wonderful book about how a boy finds out how other people feel about him. I think that everyone should read this book so that they can find out how other people feel about them. If I could rate this book I would give it a 4.There could be some changes that would keep people in tune to what they say about judging other people from how they act or look. Over all, the author did an awesome job on the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flipped","review":"It's always easy to see the outside of someone, especially if its someone you're head over heels for. Not knowing who they are, but just realizing their brilliant blue eyes, or maybe their wavy blonde hair, it's getting past all of that is the hard part. Does their personality really fit there appearance? Who are they really?Reading this book changes your perspective on certain things. I defiantly recommend Flipped to anyone who likes a suspenseful, \\"kiddy\\" romance books. How the author worded it made you have to think about what she just said. If Flipped had a sequel, I would defiantly read it! I caution you though this book is hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually, it's four and a half, but I couldn't get that","review":"Flipped, by Wendelin Van Draanen, is a really good book. It was a comedy type deal about these two kids who have lived in the same neighborhood since they were seven. Juli Baker absolutely adores Bryce Loski. But he doesn't adore her back. Until...eighth grade comes along. That's when they flipped. He started to like her, and she thought he was a jerk. Does Juli redevelop her crush? Does Bryce think it over and shudder with repulsion? Or...does Juli decide that she might give Bryce a chance-again? I flipped for this book. Will you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a perfect book!","review":"honestly, i chose to buy this book cuz it had a really cute chick on the tite page and it was a love story. once u start 2 read it, u'll get hooked like i did! its well-written, funny, cute, and you can relate to this book weather you're a female or male because it writes it from both of their points of view. i bought this book at the TIS book fair... but i should've bought it here or @ the book store for a lot cheaper price. o well! buy this book if you like cute love stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great story, but sprinkled with vulgarities","review":"Juli and Bryce, neighbors since the second grade, become entangled in a a true-to-life struggle of changing emotions that are all too familiar to adolescents. In a seesaw switch of chapters, each told by one of the characters, we are privy to two distinct points of view. Unique family styles and interactions are contrasted. Flipped should be one of the best new novels for our middle schoolers, but with the many instances of vulgar language and interjections using the name of God, I find it unacceptable as a model for our children who suffer negative consequences for using the same language. We must demand more for our children if we are going to expect more from them. In searching for a similiar book with clean language, you would do well ordering All the Way Home by Patricia Giff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not To Flipped Over Flipped","review":"The charactrs didnt act realistic. They acted as if they where these big balls of emotion. The only thing I liked was that they told both sides of the story; Julianna's side/Bryce's side."},{"rating":"2","title":"weekend read","review":"This was a good break from all the technical books iv been reading recently, it is very much a teen book but that doesn't mean you wont enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work For Me","review":"The first time I borrowed this book, I never finished it Same as second. Third, I read it, didn't like it. Bryce is a jerk. Whatever that girl's name is (lets call her J for now), she's annoying. But what really got to me was the end. What makes Bryce planting a tree maee everything okay. Yeah it' important to her but just because Bryce plants ONE tree. Not TWO, ONE. Seriously? Nope, didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"It was a great book lots of sad times and exciting times and weird times but an amazing book loved!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flipped","review":"When I bought Flipped I expected a love story about to poeple who at first liked each other as friends but then changed their relationship to like/love. Boy, borders really screwed their summary up. I hadnt known it was a humorous novel. I must say it was boring....very boring. Byrce didnt know if he liked Juli or not. He didnt know if he wanted her around or not. And when Juli would write her chapter she changed how Bryce reacted from what Bryce had written. (Ex. Bryce: When she found the eggs were not broken i just yelled \\" We're......Juli: When I saw the eggs were not broken he just looked down at the floor...\\" ) It got VERY Annoying"},{"rating":"1","title":"flipped my life to deth","review":"I liked the book because of all the running away that Bryce does at the begining and that Bryce got 2 girls at the booster's luncheon. I also liked the flipped part because it makes Bryce look like a loser. I dis- like it because Juli liked him and then it flipped. Also I didn't like that the grandfather talks to the girl more than his own grandson. However, they end up getting closer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but way too predictable","review":"Thsi book in my opinion was the same thing over and over. It was flirting than i knew they would turn out to like each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternating protagonist/antagonist narrating","review":"Ever since they were eight years old and the Loski's move in across the street from the Bakers, Juli Baker has been swooning over Bryce Loski. He does everything he can to avoid her, until suddenly in eighth grade, just as she's getting over her crush on him, he flips for her. The two narrate alternating chapters, and thus switch back and forth from the role of protagonist to antagonist, which is part of what I really enjoyed about the book and part of what I thought my daughter would like after devouring Lisa Yee's Millicent Min, Emily Ebers and Stanford Wong books, where three characters talk about the same summer from differing viewpoints. I picked up this audiobook after enjoying four of Van Draanen's Sammy Keyes books. The publisher says it's for ages 10-14, but it didn't hold my 10-year-old's interest the way that Sammy Keyes and the Millicent Min books did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Cute Book!","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book! It is such a cute and original story! It's SLIGHTLY confusing switching from person to person in the next chapters and repeating the same events from their perspective, but nonetheless, it is a really, really good book. I would recommend it to absolutely anyone. :]"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute page turner!","review":"I could not put this book down. It might be because I'm a girl who loves stories that relate to me, but I found that this book was incredibly interesting. It's original, and I love how each protagonist (Juli/Bryce) tell their own side of the story. I chose to read this book because at my school we have to read a monthly novel, then take a test on it. I usually NEVER read anything. I know, I know, that's not wise, but I could not put this book down! I'll probably read it a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books I've Read In A Long Time","review":"I loved this novel. It didn't follow the usual plot line of boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy and girl fight, boy and girl make up and live happily ever after. Flipped follows the relationship patterns of thirteen-year olds more realistically. While the cat-fights didn't exactly match normal eight grade life, the rest was believable. The ending matched the rest of the book perfectly, and I felt like this story was going on right down the street from me. Van Draanen did a wonderful job with her narrations, bringing to light how boys and girls can percieve the exact same conversation differently. This book is wonderful, and if you see it in the bookstore, don't hesitate to pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two eighth graders with totaly diferent perspectives","review":"When Bryce moved in she flipped when he saw Juli he ran, this is how the tale on perspectives begins. Juli loves her family, is interested in trees and has a backyard of chickens, plus can not wait for her first kiss from Bryce. Bryce can't stand her and hides when she comes to him all till the eigth grade when the minds flip.This is a spectacular piece which will make you want to keep on going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flipped by: Wendelin Van Draanen","review":"When Bryce moves into a new neighborhood he meets a little girl who wants to help him move in. Then she tries to help in the house but her shoes are all muddy. Bryce can tell from day one that she will always be on his tail. Julianne lives in a neighborhood that has no little kids to play with and her brothers are more interested in their own music than playing soccer ball with their little sister. When she finds out that there is a boy moving in next-door she can't wait to meet him. Six years later they are still friends, but that soon changes when she starts bringing over farm fresh eggs and Bryce is caught throwing them away.I would most definitely recommend this book to you. It is funny and you won't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was 'ok'","review":"I really liked this book in the begining. It was catchy and interesting. The only thing though, is that I felt that it was incomplete. I felt as though it needed just one more chapter. It was a good book, and I would still recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The place to start...","review":"It is quite true that this book is not sufficiently comprehensive to give you a thorough & in depth knowledge of TEE; it never claims to do that. As someone who has purchased many, if not most, of the available TEE books, I would recommend Andre Denault's new edition as by far the most comprehensive.What Chris Gallagher's book does far better than any other is to take someone with no prior knowledge or familiarity with TEE, & give him/her what they need to get started. It is by far the best at taking what could otherwise become an intimidating & daunting task, making it quickly seem attainable, & making it fun along the way.I never take the time to write reviews, but I hope you find this helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"A great collection of new songs and traditional! The Lord's Prayer is sung with bone chilling perfection as only John Berry can do. I loved the male trio arrangement of \\"We Three Kings\\", and the title song, \\"My Heart is Bethlehem\\" is beautifully written and performed. Even the photo cover is creative and attractive. Great gift item as his voice has universal taste. Simple a great CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album... but this reissue sounds terrible!","review":"Love the album, but the sound of this 1996 Scamp Records release is very poor. EQ is messed with to the point where the timing seems wrong, details get lost due to a lack of focus. It just doesn't \\"groove\\" at all. A friend who's also into audio agreed with me that this CD is an assult on the ears and just not \\"musical\\" sounding at all.I picked up the Licorice Soul release on vinyl from 2004 and it sounds MUCH, MUCH better. It sounds so different and so much more enjoyable than this CD it's hard to believe. There is also a brand new (2009) remaster out on CD that might sound better, but I haven't heard it. If you need a CD, I would try that reissue and leave this one alone.EDIT:I see this review is coming up for both reissues of Astro-Sounds. If you're looking at the 2009 26F Records release, you may be on the right track. If you're looking at the 1996 Scamp Records release, don't do it!... lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"The slimmy underbelly of the music biz.","review":"As for the ORIGINAL recording artist, Jerry Cole, * * * * *A true masterpiece for its time, perhaps better known as \\"The Animated Egg\\". This release however is a complete, total RIP-OFF of the above mentioned LP title with overly phazy, flangy additives. Sadly, without the knowledge and consent of Jerry Cole, it was re-titled and re-packaged as if it were something completly unrelated. For those of you who want the real deal, it can be found on the Sundazed label (reissued on CD with a double amount of bonus material) The Animated Egg - \\"Guitar Freakout\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pair this with the \\"Barbarella\\" soundtrack for a real treat!","review":"This is a really great album I stumbled across on download a few years ago, before this edition was released.

It always rolls right back in, which means I it's unuseable. When a product is this cheap, it's almost not worth returning, but I so resent buying something that never worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Knife but left a few things to be desired.","review":"I bought this knife as a survival knife in the woods. Being GI like I expected it to more or less function similar to the actual M-9. The Knife's is coated with a material to make it less shiny which is easy to scrape off during use. When I received this knife the blade was not as sharp as I would of liked. After about a 1/2 hour against a electronic sharpener this is now a very sharp knife. The scabbard does work after sharpening but may damage the knife if you attempt to cut too big of a wire. Overall I am happy with my purchase, but would of expected the finish to not scrape away so easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"Good product especially for the price. Item WAS sharp. Wire cuttter hole was very tight, but once I worked it through several times it worked great. very happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid selection from a great set of performances","review":"This is a great live Reggae album from the 20th Anniversary shows at Reggae on the River. There is something here for all Reggae fans- some roots, some dancehall, and some funk. I found a few of the tracks somewhat boring (see Marcia Griffiths, David Lindley, and Oliver 'Tuku' Mtukudzi), but the rest of the album rocks! My personal favorite is the opening track from Anthony B (Raid the Barn), which makes me move every time I play it. The sound quality on these recordings is impressive and crisp, yet still manages to capture the energy coming off of the crowd- which if you have never been to this event, is incredible. Get this CD. Listen to it a couple of times. Then start saving you money for next year's tickets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Original Hip Hop Fusion LP to Emerge in 10 Years","review":"What can't I say about this release? With all the drab releases that major labels thrust at us each year in the realm of hip hop, maybe 1 catches the ear each year. Well hey, this year it's 2 - Common's Like Water for Chocolate and now Hydroponic's Routine Insanity. This is a release that will stay in your CD changer for a long time to come. Take one part hip hop, one part jazz, one part Sweetback, one part Spooky, and an infinity of originality, and you'll catch what I'm trying to say. This release demands attention from people who know anything about music. Don't get caught sleeping on this. You'll be looking back wondering what those Hydroponic kids were doing back in 2000..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best!","review":"YAAAAAWN! I had high hopes for this movie because I am a Ricci fan. But if it wasn't for her being in the film I would have turned it off. VERY boring! Christina, your next film? Be evil! Your good at it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And really, 2 out of 5 ain't bad","review":"Seeing this in the $7.50 rack at Wal-Mart, this movie is about what you'd expect. The idea itself is pretty interesting and the movie starts out with a little punch but then it settles into a sort of choppy mediocrity. It never really gets scary and it never completely makes sense. At least not to me. (Though, to be honest, I've never been accused of being the brightest bulb in the bunch.) Still, the actors are all competent and Christina Ricci, if you're a fan (And you should be.), is always worth watching. (And I'm assuming you're a fan of horror movies. Otherwise you wouldn't be reading this.) So all in all, not \\"The Exorcist\\" but better than shooting yourself in the foot.(And just as a side note, the picture? On the DVD? Where Christina Ricci is standing in the church staring at the camera? Never happens. And I just really really hate it when they do that.)Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad...Really...","review":"I enjoyed this film probably more than most. I'm a big fan of Christina Ricci, and she did not disappoint. Without blabbing away the plot, this is quite original for a psychological suspense film, and the religious overtones add a bit of \\"mystery play\\" to the proceedings. The handsome Ioan Gruffudd is around a little to provide a bit of potential romantic interest, but it's Stephen Dillane who really keeps things centered. He's very fine. The surprise ending was clever, and, overall, \\"The Gathering\\" is worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gathering","review":"While going to the town of Ashby Wake, the drifter Cassie is hit by a car driven by Marion Kirkman and loses her memory. Marion invites Cassie to stay in her huge old house with her family, while recovering from the trauma. Cassie becomes very close to Michael, the young son of Marion's husband Simon Kirkman. He is researching a recently discovered buried church from the First Century, with images of the crucifixion of Jesus and many anonymous persons watching it. Cassie starts having visions and premonitions with some locals, and decides to investigate the weird and nasty mechanic Frederick Michael Argyle. Her findings about who she is and the mystery relative to the locals and the town surprises her. This movie has a really nice and intriguing story, mystery, suspense, some religious revelations, a little bit of horror. Worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant thriller!","review":"Occasionally I will buy a movie sight unseen, based on reviews. The Gathering is one of those films, and I loved every moment of it. This is a chillingly atmospheric film with a slow build-up to a startling conclusion, much like Sixth Sense. What is sad is that I never heard of this movie before I stumbled across it on Amazon.com. Fans of this genre should not miss The Gathering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"Loved this movie. This is the first time in a while that I was not able to guess the ending right off the bat. Christina Ricci sure has grown up. Grown up in all the right places. She reminds me a lot of Summer Glau from The Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, but too short!","review":"I know this is an EP, and is supposed to be short, but when a band writes excellent music like this...It's like a cocaine addict being given half a line to sniff.

In Memory finds the band continuing to develop their post-thrash, sort of doomy, sort of gothic, sort of power metal, but always dark style, which to this day remains almost impossible to categorize. The four studio tracks - Optimist or Pessimist, Matricide, Sorrowed Man, and the title track - are as good as anything you'd find onPolitics of Ecstasyor the band's debut, but the real highlight is the unexpected inclusion of a cover medley of Bauhaus's Silent Hedges and Double Dare. I love when bands come up with cover songs that showcase their versatility and range, and this is one of the best.These stop-gap EPs often tend to get overlooked, but In Memory remains an important chapter in the Nevermore legacy, and one that all Nevermore fans should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful as always","review":"This has some Christmas songs and a couple of others as well.

I honestly think the pictures I print look better than the same pictures from the photo shop.CDs too look excellent.

My guess is Epson puts a chip in these things that's activated when you first plug the thing in. It keeps track of the days elapsed. When the printer gets past the warranty period, it activates another chip that clogs the print heads. This requires you to use up three or four cartridges of GENUINE EPSON ink at $25 a crack so they get you for another $100 bucks before you give up in frustration and ditch the piece of Chinese made junk in the American landfill.I'm sick of being ripped off like this.

Fortunately, the latter part of the book dealing with the return home was more captivating. There are many, many more worthwhile works of fiction on the Vietnam War. I would not recommend this one.

Even though there was a story line, it seemed disguised by the language and the way it was written. The story line was very simple; go to Vietnam, talk about sex, listen about sex, have sex, watch your friends die, killing, talk about it, come home and have sex, and finally marry. I kept thinking the story would get interesting but it never did. Perhaps it could be enjoyed by a man, but \\"I just didn't get it\\".In addition to the foul language and repeated denigration of women, it was read by a man that used a mostly monotone manner. I guess boring would be sufficient to call it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase because you can't get the NEVO","review":"Hi Folks,The big problem is that Viewsonic calls this a Home Wireless solution.

Viewsonic and Nevo says that (Nevo even has some sites showing it) but NEITHER ONE of them gives you or sell you the IR adaptor anymore. So forget it. You can't use it as a Nevo Remote Control.

Perhaps the best indication of the type of music here is the list of name-checks in the liner notes: Tom Jones, Ray Conniff, Paul Mauriat, Herb Alpert, Les Baxter, John Steed & Emma Peel, Russ Meyer -- you can form a mental picture of what this music sounds like. It's light, frothy, and wonderful. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it's only 34 minutes long; I wish it'd been combined with the other volume on a single disc, but oh well.

I couldn't get out of bed for a while because I was plagued by visions of what Chuzzwhut did to the theater performers, innocent theater performers. Or at least they were until he got hold of them.Why would Barbie create something like this for the holidays? I innocently thought this DVD was an adaptation of the Christmas Carol, the beloved Charles Dickens story. But I couldn't have been more misled. In this telling, a sadistic and evil \`Barbie Doll' named Eden forces an entire theater company to practice on Christmas day. My God, my God, what have we become? And what her cat, Chuzzlewhiz, does to them makes that horrific \`100 Days of Sodom' film look like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

We got the Barbie DVD as soon as it was available, and my daughter has watched it nearly every day since then. It's definitely a delightful, entertaining, and fun movie for kids, but I appreciate most of all how the message is so meaningful. The Barbie version truly captures the essence of the Dickens story and the Beauty of the Holiday.

I rate this one star, the bottom of the ladder, among the Nelly and the other garbage made for the radio and MTV.p.s.

Still, he will sell millions of albums because kids will just buy whatever is on MTV.

Where's the hardcore don't ... with me kind of style I loved so much? Wherever it is it's not on this album. This CD isn't completely horrible I do like \\"Put It On Me\\" & \\"I Cry\\" because he shows some emotion, but they sound more like R&B than Rap.

Totally worth it if you enjoy simple, but powerful and moving stories. Not too artsy or cheesy but really pulls at your heartstrings- even the most macho of guys will shed a tear.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly moving","review":"While not a big Farley Mowat fan (OK, I think he's an insufferable, preachy blowhard 9 times out of 10), I was familiar with The Snow Walker's director, Charles Martin Smith, in Never Cry Wolf, and found out about this movie as an instructive survival story.The story, cast, direction and production values are all outstanding. I found the film particularly moving as someone very important to me looks very much like Annabella Piugattuk, and acts to a great extent like Kanaalaq, and I could easily see this woman doing what Kanaalaq does near the end of the trek.This film deserved wider exposure, and is a credit to Canadian film making (albeit with an excellent American director), high praise from me since I am no booster of the usually mediocre output of \\"Canadian Culture\\". Hopefully, Canadian Barry Pepper will continue to build on his excellent performances, most recently in True Grit, and that Annabella Piugattuk can build further on her success here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Snow Walker","review":"What a pleasure to watch a movie without constant foul language! We enjoyed the artic scenery and story line but a little disappointed with the ending. All in all a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The path to discovery","review":"I love it when I stumble upon films like this one, where the beauty of the story resounds throughout. A classic story of clashing cultures and ideas, where mere survival forces the two to cast them aside and work together. Granted it's the bush pilot who has the most to gain in doing so, namely his life.Nature plays a key role in this story, where, as always, it's power isn't fully appreciated nor understood by the bush pilot. That nearly costs him his life, and it's only after he comes to understand this aided by an ailing Eskimo that he nearly refused to help, that he begins down the path of discovery.What he discovers, and the way he discovers it, gives this film a lot of endearing moments, and adds to the depth of the story.Well worth a viewing or two.Note: Tired not give out too many spoilers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but Deep","review":"This is really a wonderful film.

It was a great film. It was filmed in a 2.35 : 1 aspect ratio. Unfortuately the dvd is cropped down to 1.85 : 1, thus cutting of a lot of the picture. Its too bad because the film utilizes the very widescreen extremely well to show off the vast Canadian landscape of the North and the recropping chops off 1/3rd of the picture. The film's true aspect ratio can be seen though only in short segments in a documentary included on the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foul language offensive","review":"Yes, it was a good story. But was all the foul language necessary to telling the story? I would be ashamed and embarassed to share this movie with any of my friends. Why do movie makers think such language enhances a film?

Sad, sad...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid adventure flick","review":"The Bottom Line:A well-made film about an arrogant bush pilot and a sick Inuit woman stranded in the Canadian wilderness, The Snow Walker doesn't do anything notably or exceptionally well but it moves quickly and never insults the audience's intelligence; if you're the type of person--as I am--who likes stories about survival, you could do a lot worse than The Snow Walker.3/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Snow Walker","review":"This is a very good adventure movie which we truely enjoyed about northern Canada.

Beautiful scenery, characters, and a portrayal of the differences between our so-called \\"advanced\\" society and that of indigenous tribes is highlighted in a poignant way.This movie is about a young, immature, and typcial cocky American pilot who becomes stranded with a young, spiritually aware Intuit woman. They develop a friendship and a non-sexual love that is transforming as they both survive the harsh elements in the wilderness. It is a beautifully done, and thought-provoking film that haunts one for days after seeing it.It is appropriate for all ages. There are some graphic hunting scenes, but this is realistic of the wilderness survival lifestyle the characters were leading; however, these may be difficult for young children to see.I wish that more films were made like this!****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Film","review":"I get spooked by 'wildernes survival' films.This movie blew my socks off.It's not icky,and the focus on humanity and relationships rocks the film.Fabulous performances by both lead actors!You will be a better person for watching this film (and you'll feel great and be able to sleep at night!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is all you need","review":"I know that the new Collected Poems has recently arrived, and it is a massive tome. But you don't really need it. Most of what Lowell wrote after \\"For the Union Dead\\" isn't that great. And in the Selected you get a great selection from what is effectively Lowell's first book, Lord Weary's Castle--which is a pretty strong book. There is also a generous selection from Life Studies and For the Union Dead (though I've bought the book that contains both complete collections). Lowell was a pretty important poet, but really, the Collected just goes overboard. This is all you really need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Lowell was a transgressive artist???","review":"OK, the foreword almost made me throw away the book right there. Its first sentence reads \`Robert Lowell was a transgressive artist.'This sounds like a parody of a 1980ies English lit major thesis - mercifully you can skip the foreword as it doesn't add anything at all. It's short though so skipping is easily done.The selection itself is generous and one gets a good idea of Lowell's breadth of writing styles. As another reviewer has noted this edition is probably all you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Success At Last","review":"I had a real run of bad luck on Pressure Cookers for awhile. The first 3 from other companies were dead within less than a month. I had about given up, but so love the way pressure cooker meals come out, I decided to give another company a try and ordered the Cuisinart. I use it all the time and I am thrilled to say it hasn't died on me yet. The other pressure cookers had many set up buttons where the Cuisinart has only three. Perhaps that's why the others didn't last. Too many set up options which could cause the cooker to malfunction.

I love the look, how easy it is to clean and how user-friendly it is. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is smaller than it looks. You are not supposed to fill it more than 2/3rds of the capacity so its size is deceiving - it fools you into thinking it's pretty large when it isn't. Having said that, I am not sure there are many others that are bigger than this one? I definitely recommend it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most important info not in mfr's description","review":"Cuisinart conveniently doesn't reveal that the 'High Pressure' setting is only 10 PSI.

Can you say 'substandard?' How frustrating to have to call Cuisinart to learn this pot's PSI. The point of a pressure cooker is FAST, FAST, FAST. A 3# chuck roast takes 99 minutes in this cooker....would take 35 minutes in the standard 15 PSI cooker. What a let down...if Cuisinart listed the PSI, many cooks wouldn't buy this one because of the lower PSI. There are many websites that will teach you about how to safely use pressure cookers.

And ironically, the stainless steel on the Tatung really has a non-stick quality to it because it is so heavy and well-made. Most importantly I love the way it cooks. I am a whole-grain fanatic and love to cook grains in my pressure cooker--especially brown rice--because it takes only minutes.

It automatically starts the countdown only once it has acheived the specified pressure. And when the timer is up, it automatically switches to \\"keep warm\\" and begins the natural process for releasing pressure. To perform a quick pressure release, simply turn the valve on top to quick release.

I have had repeated issues where I followed the specific time settings in their manual for beans, rice, etc. and they were FAR from cooked. Then what do you do... you have to wait another 20-30 minutes to get it back up to pressure to try to get it to cook another 10 minutes!? Its more of a time waster than a time saver.

Thank goodness for the GREAT Amazon return policy-eh!!We bought an Instant Pot for $20 more and what a DIFFERENCE!! Heavier by one pound - slightly more capacity - superior controls and user manual - absolutely beautiful and well built with a polished stainless steel pot that has a three ply bottom like a top quality pot or frying pan has which results in an even cooking surface!!

The person did not know much about the unit and seemed to just be reading from a script.

There is nothing you can do to convince the unit to work after it goes into stupid mode. I highly recommend looking for another brand. To be fair, when it works I really like it.

Our first dish was top round steak. This pressure cooker made a somewhat tough cut of meat fork tender. The recommended cooking times are estimates so you need to experiment with different cuts and thickness of meats. Cooks vegetables awesome. The only meat that we've found that does not taste well in this cooker is when we tried to pressure cook BBQ Pork Ribs; just doesn't compare to he real thing. We would give this a 5 star if it were larger, and came in an oval cooker as well. We have not experienced any of the problems that we read in some reviews.

This model is amazing. I love that you can brown your meat in this unit.I made a pot roast the first time. Totally frozen when I browed it, browned onions seasoned it with some spices and threw in a cup of water and a cup of brown gravy. Set the timer for 90 minutes. timer went off and the unit immediately went to warm. I opened it up after a few minutes and was amazed how tender and juicy it turned out. Since then I've made corn beef/cabbage and spare ribs. Both turned out wonderful. i'm excited to continue to find new meals to try in this handsome machine.Cuisinart has a new best friend.

This cooker has done a nice job on everything we've thrown at it.

It just didn't seem realistic to me, which was a shame since the book as a whole IS realistic.In the author's defense, however, it seems that it is much easier to write a good book than to end a book well.

My dog who is clinically deaf ran from the room wimpering and brought back David Hasselhoffs hit CD \\"Party On The Beach\\" which I do recomend. Oscar should stick to hitting his opponents because he isn't hitting any high notes on this one. On a scale from 1-10 i rate this a knife across the throat.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say, \\"Sucks\\"?","review":"When I first heard this guy sing I thought, \\"Wow, money really CAN buy anything!\\" It is painfully obvious that Oscar's voice is completely doctored and that advances in sound recording technology were required to clean up his pathetic attempt at singing. He sounds like a pre-pubescent girl who desperately wishes she could sing. Hell, I guess if I had a ton of money, I too could pay the best in the business to make me sound as crappy as Oscar does. Give it up homes, and stop boxing too. You're on your way downhill... Quit spending your money on your fantasies or you'll be broke before you know it.

Well, he may as well try acting or singing, because as was proved when he lost to Tito, he is afraid to get in the ring with certain fighters, and as was proved with Mosley, there are certain fighters he refers to as \\"Daddy\\" inside the ring. Maybe after his superfight with the other guy from Califa, Fernando Vargas, they can sing a duet together...\\"to all the times, Tito has embarrassed us before....and even still, our female fans still adore...we're glad you came along, because without you, no one you pay to see us, ect. ect."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful voice!","review":"a boxer who sing, no doubt, oscar proved that! his single, \\"Run to me\\", a cover version of the famous trio, Bee Gees, is definitely the right choice he made, this single beat Christina's \\"come on over(all i want is you)\\" from the biilboard chart and became no 1! i think he will be another ricky in the music industry in the most recent time, they both some same things, one is definitely the look! but music is what the voice that matter, right? anyway, being first appearence in music scene, we should give him a chance to prove that other then fighting, oscar can really sing! bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OSCAR THE BOXER PLEASES WITH VOCALS!!!!!!!!","review":"All I have to say is this guy can sing!!!!

But overall the Cd is decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oscar sure is handsome!","review":"Wow... I saw him on tv (in Spanish) for commercials, and I was like who is that?? and my little brother tells me he is a boxer. Wow a cute latino boxer.

But after listening to his debut album a few times, I am convinced that he has put his heart and mind into this album and his effort is truly commendable. While he may not have the greatest voice (who does anyway?), most of his songs are lovely. I particularly like the 4th song \\"Tu Me Completas\\". Although I do not fully understand Spanish, this upbeat song is just fantastic. His Spanish \\"Ven A Mi\\" sounds even sweeter than the English version.

I don't expect consistancy under these conditions and expect more diverse opinions and facts relating to the matter at hand. Each essay covered certain part of the long conflict that engulfed the British Isles between 1638-1660.The book comes well armed with maps, illstrations and I thought it was quite readable. Anyone who read this book should have a decent background reading on the English Civil War prior since you will be reading an essay which don't give you much introduction space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dessert disasters for me........","review":"I unfortunately didn't look at reviews before I bought and used this cookbook. I've tried several recipes and they were disasters. I had been looking for a homemade marshmallow recipe that didn't use so much corn syrup and I was intrigued by the recipe in this book that called for a tablespoon. What a mess! It took a day of soaking my mixer bowl to clean out the goop. Now, as I read these reviews, I had the same results with biscotti and a few of the icing recipes didn't set up for me either.

Shackleton is a compelling figure, but this is not an exercise in hero worship. Shackleton is presented with all his faults and flaws.

Extremely enjoyable even if you know the outcome of Endurance's voyage."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable","review":"I could not finish this book. The subject is fascinating but method of piecing together bits of newspaper articles, diaries and other accounts makes for cumbersome reading. This is a graduate text book, not a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Your Knowledge","review":"This is a fabulous addition to the Endurance myth. In the last several years Shackleton has gone through a bit of a revival with a big movie and release of several books. This biography of the man himself is a must read for anybody looking to get at the reasons for why a man would trek out into the dark, lonely, uncharted waters of the Antarctic. Perhaps the vougue comes to us as we look around to find our own uncharted lands and discover we have very little of it left. This is a life that literally could not be led in todays world of Global Positioning and Gortex. It brings to mind the question of the next great frontiers, the mind, space or underseas adventure all could be next. To match Shackleton one would have to build the rocket ship themselves out of duct tape and soda cans and somehow save his crew from aliens in the meantime. All the while Shackleton never really lets on that the true mission is to become a hero at any cost. Truly inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most thorough biography","review":"This is one of the finest biographies I have ever read. It utilizes correspondance of people familiar with Shackleton, family memebers. The diaries of members of his expeditions.

Extensive background information on Shackleton helps the reader to understand how his mind worked and what motivated him. Extremely fascinating is the explanation of the politics of the time in England. The only drawback to this book is the sometimes awkward writing style. Huntsford repeatedly inserts minute facts into the middle of sentences, disrupting the flow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Leader of Men for All Time","review":"This is a page-turner of the first order. I came to Huntford after reading Alfred North Lansing's Endurance, which whetted my appetite for more Shackleton. Huntford has done that, and much more. Shackleton emerges as a complex figure, alienated in civilization, a unique leader of men in the most brutal conditions imaginable. His cynicism and sarcasm about English Antarctic explorers is telling. His distaste for Scott and admiration for Amundsen only adds spice to a story that is rich from the beginning. Although the book runs nearly 700 pages, it's difficult to put down because the story is so good and Huntford is such a deft story-teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"This is a movie that I was introduced to when I was young.

Many people fail to realize the tremendous price the then Army Air Corp paid over Germany during WWII. Your chances of dying aboard a bomber was 6 times as great as being on the ground as an infantryman. Only submarines were more dangerous. This is why during my years in the Air Force later we tended to be a bit more cautious. The public would never accept such casualties today.

He was the tail-gunner.As close as we were, Uncle Bill never answered me when I asked him about his War experiences. He was tail gunner.MEMPHIS BELLE, the movie, tells me WHY he did not share his experience with me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good old fashioned war movie","review":"My uncle was fortunate enough to have known several of the members of the real Memphis Belle and he told me stories about the air raids of WW2. This is a very fictionalized account of the last battle that the Belle and her crew engaged in but it is a fairly accurate look at what it was really like. The action scenes are based on real events of the various raids over Germany and, while the characters are fictionalized, the overall movie is pretty much on target. You will not like all the characters because they are portrayed as humans, not as heroes, but you will sympathize with them and, in the end, be glad they all come home. Not my favorite B-17 movie (that would be \\"12 o'clock High\\") but a good one and part of my collection. Get it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia and knowledge of the 8th Air Force","review":"A sympathetic and family friendly look at B-17 flying in early to mid WWII European theater.

When I played it on my blu ray player (I frequently playback dvd's on my blu ray) the only format it would play in is the square screen or non-widescreen format. The image was also quite grainy. I suppose I will have to wait for this movie to be available in widescreen blu ray before I will be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Corny Movie","review":"I found this movie to be full of cliches and concocted action.

Instead it is a fictional creation of immature undisciplined adolescents in a plane. This really is not a war movie, but rather is a teenage horror movie where the teenagers are in a plane threatened by German Monsters rather than in a haunted house threatened by Frankenstein Monsters.NOT WORTH EVEN $0.01.....deserves NO stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Memphis Bell","review":"I watched this movie and thought about my father who served in the Korean War. I don't have a problem with the accuracy of events in this movie but I do think the portrayal of the airmen in the scene in which they were attacked by fighters was inaccurate. Basically because they looked like a bunch of whinny wimps. From my father's account (and others from the first Iraq war) of his experience I don't believe people act like that while in combat. They want to survive, and when one wants to survive they don't break down like a sissy mothers boy.

It is definately one of my favorites. The only reason I robbed it of its fifth star is that it has one shortcoming, which is that it lacked good special effects for the aerial combat scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money...........","review":"...........and buy \\"Twelve O'Clock High\\"! While it was nice to see the status of many of the surviving Fortresses, the film's credibility was far too suspect to recommend it. I mean Wyler's own documentary of the Belle's last mission (actually a bit of a \\"Milk Run\\") is both more relevant - and, despite its blatantly clear emphasis on war time propoganda, far more accurate. I suspect that many bomber crew members winced quite a bit when Modine decides to repeat the bomb run - and in so doing run the risk of incurring still more casualties -so as to avoid bombing a nearby school!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Blows It Again","review":"I chuckled when I read a few reviews that described this movie as \\"accurate\\". About the ONLY thing accurate about it is that they depicted the bombers as B-17F's which is the model of the Memphis Belle. There were a few good flying scenes and some memorable scenes of the inside of a B-17; otherwise, the story has been altered by Hollywood for its own purposes. They didn't use the real names of any of the Belle's crew (unforgivable IMO), and not even the Belle's nose art was correct (it was dolled up considerably from the real thing). Anyone interested in the REAL Memphis Belle should see William Wyler's outstanding documentary, or read Belle pilot Bob Morgan's excellent book, \\"The Man Who Flew The Memphis Belle\\". Then you would understand why I dislike this movie so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talking about action, this movie is great!","review":"This movie was great! It had a tremendous story and enough action to keep you on the edge of the edge of your seat. This is interesting, here's a new way to use this movie. Watch this movie, build a model of the B-17 then go to an airshow and a airplane museum. There are list of airshows and airplane museums on the search engines. This movie contains a great amount of historical information and by using the above formula, you and your kids can learn about aviation, history and everything involved in model building.C.

I've watched it at least ten times, and still enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of our greatest generation","review":"What can you say about an icon? Memphis Belle was the first B17 to complete all 25 missions with her crew. Her last mission, was nearly her last, but she came through and eventually went on tour in the U.S. to sell War Bonds, along with her crew. Reasonably accurate with great photography and air combat, this is a must see movie about our Greatest Generation and how young boys became men in the air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie.","review":"I love this flick. A lot. If you're into good stories, good drama and a good ending... All tied up with some near historical bits in there too? I think you'll enjoy this like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhilarating action","review":"With Memphis Belle you join a B17 crew on a mission deep into Germany territory. There is a strong cast lineup, but they are somewhat restricted by an average and stereotyped script. Bearing that in mind this is still a good movie with some real breath taking action which rammed home the grim reality the war in the air was far from won for the Allies in 1943. My favourite scenes are the German fighter attacks and the bombing run under a relentless FLAK defence. This is certainly a must for any WW2 movie or aviation buff but I feel anyone will enjoy watching this movie. Definitely recommended viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven Suspense, Slap-Dash Finish","review":"What opens with a compelling premise - a mysterious lodger who arrives in the midst of a wave of serial killings - is encumbered by a plethora of spelling, punctuation and formatting errors as well as inconsistency in the dialects of its characters. Perhaps because I'm an avid fan of mysteries and suspense novels, my expectations were high that a few delicious twists might save the plot before it came to a close. Although it's my understanding that the Kindle version was prepped by volunteers for electronic publication, it's sad that their enthusiasm for the text wasn't reflected in more judicious proofreading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy","review":"This is a very creepy and suspensful book.

I would recommend this book to people who enjoy Jack the Ripper novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great suspense book","review":"I selected this book because it made the list of 100 suspense books to read. I was glad to see it was even one of Amazon's free reads! Because the author wrote this long ago, I felt the language added to the suspense of this England based story. Great, developed characters and the book moved along quite well. It was interesting to read such a good book written a long time ago and it added some charm to a story about a couple who rent a room to a killer and they even suspect but they need his rent money!

Ms. Lowndes displays a beautiful sense of timing and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Back","review":"My husband picked up this book and brought it home to me over a month ago. I hadnt even opened it until two days ago. We have loved Anne Rice for years but lately her books have just not been up to her previous works. They had failed,in my opinion, to fully bring the characters to light and the rich discriptive quality of her previous works was lacking. Well, she is back and she has brought the whole gang from the vampire chronicles, the mayfair witches and the talamasca back to the surface. She has done an incredible job of intertwining the plots together and this is truly one of her best books in years. I read it in one sitting. I could not put this book down. For all of you out there that have missed her, you need to order this book now."},{"rating":"2","title":"How fast can I read it?","review":"I read the book in 24 hours, what can I say. I have wanted a book to combine the Mayfair's w/ the vampire cronichles for so long. The book enchanted me into ignoring my friends and family. But all her books do, the writing was once again poetic, the ending a surprise. I have to admit though that I wasn't too fond of the ending. Part of me wanted it to be so tragic, but yet another part was happy to see it end well. (if you have read it you'll know what I mean, if not I don't want to ruin the surprise) I am glad to see that it def is not the end. I can't wait to see what happens next if there is indeed a war raged. Overall it was worth it, it didn't have me sucked in as some of her others, but certainly enough to make wish I was there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting back to basics","review":"Anne has returned to her roots of supernatural story telling. Her 23 previous vampire books (Vittrilo & Pandora) were a let down for me because the main characters were supernatural for about 20 pages between the two books. This one is different. Blending Voodoo with the world of vampires allows the entire story to focus on supernatural characters. From the first chapter we know that the characters do not live in our world of logic and security but in their own world of passion, death and the unknown having more power then anything. I applaud Anne for returning to the story which focuses on the supernatural and not a story about a person where, oh yeah, one of the characters is a vampire...Thank you Anne."},{"rating":"2","title":"New adventures of old literary friends","review":"As a long time Anne Rice fan, I was thrilled to rejoin the continuing adventures of David Talbot, Louis, Lestat, and yes, even Claudia.Rice's ability to get into the heads of these characters is always amazing; she creates worlds in her stories that are so descriptive, believable and tantalizing.Merrick is a return to the old days of Anne Rice, and longtime fans of the Vampire Chronicles should be pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bloody Waste","review":"I loved the early Vampire and Mayfair witches series, but I think Anne Rice has lost the formula somehow - or rather that she is too formulaic and pumps out books too quickly. Merrick dragged on and on for me. Maybe it's just that the characters are so predictable at this point and the ins and outs so contrived, that I've become bored with her later novels. I only hope she returns to the terrific storytelling she used to captivate us in the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"A painful experience.","review":"Its obvious from this novel that Rice has run out of decent vampire related ideas. This dull and rather shallow book is a difficult read at best. Very little reason is given for the reader to even bother turning the page. When you put it down you will have a hard time picking it back up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to vote \\"no stars\\" but it wasn't an option.","review":"This is it. The last Rice book I'll ever read. I still enjoy her earlier works; \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is a classic and I consider it to be her best. But I couldn't even get through \\"Merrick.\\" Rice's prose is becoming too flowery even for her. I mean, really, folks; how many times does she have to halt her narrative to remind us how beautiful Louis is? She meanders off the subject so often that I'm surprised she even remembers her own plots.I have skipped over maybe half the novel already, just skimming the interesting parts. I'm glad I checked this out from the library instead of actually paying for this piece of garbage. Someone needs to tell Rice that she is getting senile. At least, that's the way \\"Merrick\\" reads.And it looks as though it carries on to the younger generation. Her son's novel, \\"A Density of Souls,\\" is exactly the same way. I couldn't finish that one either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring","review":"This one is a million milles away from Interview with the Vampire or Lestat the Vampire. Slow, boring... Anne keeps making again and again the same book, with the same structure, with the same characters (well and who wont, they have made her all what she is), with the same talentless use of adjetives (beautiful, wonderful, fantastic, marvellous...) a thousand times in the same page.I love Anne Rice. At least the earlier books. But every new book she releases is even worse than the earlier.Skip it if you are looking for a good horror novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point?","review":"This is certainly not one of Anne's better chronicles. The plot for this novel is not strong. Perhaps it was an excuse to introduce Merrick a with who became a vampire.In this novel David Talbot seeks Merrick, who is a powerful witch to resurrect Claudia in order to ease Louis' heart and conscience. When resurrected, Claudia takes her revenge by stabbing Louis in her spite.Heartbroken, Louis tried to kill himself by letting himself out into the light. But his attempt was not successful as he was rescued by the other vampires. In the course of the story, Louis gives Merrick the Dark Gift making her a vampire too.This is a merry story but not quite on par with Anne's other chronicles. Read this only if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there was a the choice of no stars...","review":"For the first time, I'm ashamed to be reading an Anne Rice book.She filled me up with the fantastic tales of Interveiw, Lestat and The Queen, didn't read the Body Theif or Memnoch, she kept me looking and searching with Pandora, Viterrio and than low and behold Armand!Than this... I even bought it in hardcover, stared at it began to read it, put it on the shelf. Six months later I crawled away from the cess pit of card board cut outs.If Rice had wanted to write why didn't she just publish it on-line? IT would have saved me [money]...(I live in Australia)and I could have turned from it.At least her new one, Blood and Gold is decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was sad","review":"Anne Rice does her best to make a tale which drains the very personality out of her beloved vampires Lestat, Louis, and David. She has this silly witch Merrick who puts charms on everyone to fall madly in lovw with her, taking away the romance and mystery out of Louis and Lestat's relationship. Arelationship die hard fans have loved since Interview and which helped make her famous. It seems like Anne Rice is constantly trying to reform her male character's from the love they have for each other by providing them with women which are frankly boring, women like Merrick, Dora, and Sybelle. It's almost like she sees love between two male characters an inferior love that needs to be fixed with providing them with a woman, this is sad, it makes her characters Louis and Lestat sadly trite, and comercial. And worse it's a very negative message to gay readers that same sex love is inferior to love between a male and a female, Anne has drained the romance out of the chronicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"honestly","review":"i've never been able to get past the first couple chapters of this book, which is not something i normally do with an Anne rice book. i came to this site to read the other reviews to determine why i have so many problems getting into this book, i skipped to and i had no problems reading Blood and gold marius's story.. i have Blackwood farm and Blood canticle to finish. i'll give it another chance.. thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"There is not a lot to see here. This is a crossover with the witch bunch of books, and the Talamasca also features. David Talbot and friend Merrick recount some adventures in the past with supernatural entities, and yet another vamp, this time Louis, tries the sun bathing but gets rescued.David Talbot tells the Talamasca, after Merrick has succeeding in becoming a vampire that declaring war on the vampires because of this would end very badly for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talky and Disappointing","review":"After all my anticipation, this book just left me flat. Too much talk and recollection, very little actual action. The main plot engine - the recall of Claudia's ghost - turned out to be an anti-climax, and it was never resolved as to whether it was \\"real\\" or not. The other major plot turn happened \\"off-stage\\" and was explained only briefly by the two participants. This book read to me as though Rice simply published her first draft - even containing misspellings. According to the A&E Biography show, Rice refuses to be edited. IMHO, she is doing herself a disservice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I've heard alot about Anne Rice and how rich and descriptive her writings are. This is the first book I've read of hers. I was truly disappointed in the character development and the depth of writing. I was not captivated. I was not mesmerized. I only finished it because I paid for it and I thought it would get better. I couldn't bear to read about how creamy Merrick's skin was or how green her eyes were one more time. Everything was so shallow and contrived. This work has not motivated me to buy another book written by her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"no meat to the bite","review":"Like the rest of her most recent books, 'Merrick' fails to really tell a story that is worthy of the status of a novel. Missing are the complexities of plot and history that made her earlier works like 'Interview with the Vampire' and 'The Witching Hour' so compelling. Although she is the master of description and able to create vivid mood, she fails to illuminate. 'Merrick' doesn't stand on its own...it's merely an appendix. This is not a novel, but a chapter of one. It leaves the reader frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Witch Who Got Away","review":"I have to agree with some of the readers. I've read her books but lately, Ms. Rice has been churning some formulaic books. Sensuality tinged with the supernatural and the unknown, sure...but she devotes paragraphs of how Merrick drinks rum. Huh?Merrick and David - who cares?!?!Also, her history does not even compare to the Witching Hour. Hers seem more contrived and forced. While WH, was layered and textured and draws upon your imagination.Then, she has to change the flawed Louis, one of the more human characters she has. Maybe she needs to change the Vampire Chronicles to Vampire Comicbooks...All she needs are costumes for her supernatural beings"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really love Anne Rice's new novel \\"Merrick.\\"","review":"I have read about 1 chapter & a half of the book & so far it is wonderful. It is most intriguing that she has both the Vampire world & the lives of the Mayfairs world intertwined into one novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Ann Rice's Worst books","review":"This book was actually worse than Memnoch or Body Thief(which I hated both). Although not the worst book of hers that I have had the misfortune of reading and yes at one time she was one of my favorite authors. My advise avoid this book. It was so badly done that I never want to read another one of her books again. Read the first three books in the series and Pandora. They are actually worth it. The rest are not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was awful","review":"Perhaps die-hard Anne Rice fans are more likely to enjoy this. For the casual reader, albeit one who has read and enjoyed early Anne Rice, this book was something to be endured, rather than enjoyed. The only characterisation I can recall was of Merrick herself, who seemed to be a Mary Sue. The plot was unengaging and the dialogue clunky and stilted. Read 'Interview' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Judy Collins of the Goth Set","review":"Why is every person in Anne Rice books so unbelievably beautiful, smart and fabulously wealthy?Why can't there be a story of an ugly, poor person who gets the \\"Dark Gift\\" and spends the book in a rage at being stuck for eternity trying to fit in with the Vampire in crowd?It could be a nice departure for Anne, considering the formulaic dreck she's turning out these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay Fiction has taken over the vampire chronicles","review":"I have enjoyed MOST of the vampire chronicles, and I reiterate MOST because I just can't get into another gay vampire narrative like Merrick. I miss the former high adventure in the first three vampire books. I don't want to read about sensitive immortals verbosely rambling on about homosexual fantasies, psuedo history, and psuedo fine art. Merrick is pure pulp fiction that is rooted in a cheesy Harloquin romance style. If you like adventure and adrenaline in your books, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was less than enthused....","review":"When I got Merrick I was under the impression that it dealt with the Mayfair family more directly. I didn't read Merrick right away, instead I re-read The Witching Hour, Lasher, and Taltos so I'd be ready for what I thought was installment #4 of the Mayfair Witches.What a letdown!!! Merrick has very little to do with the Mayfair family and more to do with the Vampire stories. It re-hashes all the old Vampire woes and introduces this distant cousin of the original Mayfairs.I hope Anne Rice does another installment of the Mayfair Witches soon! I am ready for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waagghh!~^o^~ How could Anne DO this to me?! :(","review":"For YEARS & YEARS I've waited for her to make Louis & Lestat a couple & now she's crushed the rock of hope & squeezed out all the delicious juice of a developing relationship by tossing in some bimbonic cookie!Merrick makes Louis fall for her so he'll make her a Vampire & when he realizes what she's done he wants her more & Lestat ends up givin the couple his blessings in the end! ::tears book in 2:: ARG!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks!","review":"I love the VC but this book sucks, it's boring, Merrick is a crap character, David is so dull! he wasn't that interesting before and he's not now. The so-called love relationship between Merrick and Louis is so unbelievable it's like Anne added it at the last minute for the heck of it. The dialouge sucked, real people do not talk like that(someone here gave a great example of what I'm talking about). The only good part in the book was Claudia's ghost and some Lestat parts, Louis was always a good character and was the most interesting in the book. If Anne Rice plans on writing more VC I hope she leaves out that boring drunken Merrick. I'm getting my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"Although the book itself was entertaining it wasn't even close to being near the pinnicale of what Anne Rice is capable of writing at. With this book we find Loius once again as a main character along with Merrick and our old friend from The Talmasia. This book never quite able to capture the intimacy or \\"Human\\" aspect of the characters as Anne Rice's previous stories have. It is just another book that a great writer as written well below her capablity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lestat redux","review":"Glimpses into the mind and craft of Anne Rice, \\"Merrick\\" is a book for those of us who love her stylish writing. Lushly written and a compelling read, \\"Merrick\\" is recommended for fans. The author's obsession with her art and the world it creates becomes clearer with each book she writes. That being said, her obsession is enthralling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another book to add to my Collection!!","review":"I have read all of the Vampire Chronocles and loved every one of them, but when I started to read this book I had some problems with really wanting to read it. About the third or fourth chapter is when it really caught my attention and then it was glued to my head!! I loved this book and I will continue to read all of Anne Rice's books!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing Undertones","review":"This book is not only poorly written and a travesty to Louis fans, but it is also deeply disturbing.Anne spends a great deal of time trying to justify and explain the sexual exploitation and molestation of a minor.Child sexuality and sexual abuse have been recurring themes in a number of her books, but it really comes to the fore in Merrick.The theme is highly unsettling since she seems to want people to believe that sex with minors is normal and acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Vampires. Voodoo and Witchery...","review":"I would like to recommend this book to everyone who would like to take a break from the Vampire \\"Scene\\" and move onto something different. Yes, you will hear about the vampires in this book...Louis, Lestat oooh my Favorite Armand, but you will note that Rice has kept \\"as well she should\\" her character in tact at all times. Voodoo...Yes. Did I get lost and have to reread a part Yes, but isn't that common...? I would like to see Rice write more on Merrick or her ancestors. This is a definite Must Read Book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.","review":"Merrick Mayfair is a lovely, intriguing character, very much in Anne Rice's style. Yes, the book does have much less of her (and our) old favourite vampires in comparison to the other books in the Vampire Chronicles, but it was just about time for a change in Lestat's little coven anyway, and Anne Rice's introduction of a new character (Merrick) is absolutely perfect. Merrick's voodooienne background makes her all the more alluring and interesting as a character and she does show a deepness in character and strongness in will. Louis's guilt and pain over his lost love is also absolved. Yay! I can't wait for another book. Hurrrrrrrry Anne!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Done.","review":"What an amazing book. The last few books were good but didn't live up to that standard I expected from Anne Rice, but this one completely blew me away. It was was a wonderful addition to the Chronicles with interesting turns and twists and a extremly cool ending. I must say this is a must read for all Anne's fans. Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new beginning???","review":"This novel was truly one of Rice's best. I could hardly bear to put it down. It finally gives you a more in-depth look at David Talbot, who has appeared in smaller roles in several of Rice's other books. Rice also introduces a mesmerizing new addition to the world of the Vampire Chronicles, the beautiful, sly, and seductive Merrick Mayfair. Will we see more of this intriguing character in the future? I can only hope so. Fascinating new characters, old favorites, and Rice's unmistakeable style and attention to sensual detail make this one of the best books I've read this year. Pick up a copy; you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Merrick is not her best, but it is full of emotion","review":"I read this book in about two weeks (mostly due to other school work), and I really did enjoy it. Of course, the main reason it engaged me so was that Louis was there. Louis is my favorite character, and I was so excited that Anne brought him into the spotlight again. I think that the ending is somewhat weak, and I can't tell you why because I don't want to spoil it for you. This weakness, however, didn't stop me from weeping uncontrollably through the last few chapters. Pick this one up. . .you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay, but...","review":"I found myself not liking Merrick very much (which is too bad, because the book IS named after her). I just thought Merrick was too conniving. I did not really the ending, it was too strange. I can't really say much about it without giving it away, but to me it did not seem realistic. I did not like how Louis was portrayed, either. He seemed too...lame, for lack of a better word. This book certainly doesn't rate with the earlier books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good book","review":"Anne's writting in this book is so detailed and great that I couldn't put it down! The storyline is so unique and I love how it ties the Mayfair Witches into the Vampire Chronicles. In fact, I was reading over 100 pages of it daily, so I finished it in a fair amount of time.Told from the veiw of vampire David Talbot, the entire book seems to be nothing but a series of conversations, but I like the way it is set up to the way Anne set up the Interveiw with the Vampire conversation. Other characters include Merrick (of course) Armand, Lestat, and even Claudia has a breif role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Merrick is tedious because it is so predictable. Gee, let's try to guess what will happen to Merrick by the end of the book. . . I had it figured out by the time I had finished the first few pages. Also, her vampires are inconsistant beings. She takes people who under normal circumstances would hopefully have some compunction about harming others and, once they become vampires, turns them into serial killers. They seem to have no real problem with this. They are all young and never seem to want to mature. They all want to live forever never really thinking that there might be anything beyond this physical world. They are shallow, spoiled, pretty murderers. They can never seem to get beyond this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Anne Rice Book So far","review":"I am usually a fan of Anne's vampire series. But this book was the worst. This book lacked the originality of the others. Not to mention, I didn't care about the characters in this book. Usually, Anne draws you into the storyline through them. If your new to Anne, blow this book off and read the early books."},{"rating":"1","title":"No depth","review":"Fans of the Vampire Chronicles who are expecting to read about Lestat & Louis will be disappointed. There's too little of the beloved Louis and Lestat only turns up at the end of the story. The main part of the book is about Merrick, whom is likely the worst Anne Rice character to-date. Known for her beautiful prose, Anne Rice elaborated on Merrick's external features but the character obviously lacks the depths and dimensions that have made Rice's earlier characters - namely Lestat, Louis, Claudia and Armand lovable and adored by so many fans. I can see that Rice wants to bring new members into the 'Coven of the Articulate' but if doing so is the result of 'Merrick', then perhaps, returning to explore, nurture and develop her old characters would be a much better option. Fans have been dying for a chronicle from Lestat to tell more of his beloved Louis, Claudia and of his other encounters and adventures... Let's hope that's coming next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed with this latest by Anne Rice. I found myself just wanting to get through it so I could move on to something more interesting. I hope future books in this series will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The straw that broke the camel's back","review":"I am a huge fan of the first three books of the Vampire Chronicals who has up to this point read everything penned by Anne Rice. However, after about 40 pages of this book, I have finally given up on her and her incredibly annoying writing style.I suffered through the other tales of the Mayfair Witches, though only because I was curious about Lasher and by the end of \\"Taltos\\" I swore off reading anything except Vampire stories. I was hoping beyond hope that this infusion of the Vampires into the world of the Witches would somehow improve the characters and mute her excessive use of detail; forgetting that with the exception of \\"The Vampire Armand\\", her new Vampire Chronicles (\\"Pandora\\" & \\"Vitorio\\") have been disappointments as well.My suggestion: avoid the witches, read \\"Interview...\\", \\"Lestat\\", and \\"Queen of the Damned\\", then STOP. Reread as necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old, Same Old","review":"I was sadly diappointed with this latest effort by Rice. I wanted to like it, but with a precious few exceptions, this novel was so much like Rice's other recent ones I felt like I had spent my money on it foolishly. Maybe her son could have done it better?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tantalizing!","review":"I am a really big Anne Rice fan. I've read all her vampire novels. Merrick, I have to admit, is not her greatest work by far. (Don't worry, the following isn't a \\"spoiler\\") The story begins with David Talbot asking Merrick to raise the ghost of Claudia for Louis. The book drags. Merrick eventually raises the ghost of Claudia...250 pages later. For that length of the story, David is telling Louis about the life of Merrick (Which is painfully boring). I won't tell you what happens after the 250 pages as I will spoil for you the only good part of the book. But I will tell you that what does happen is more than enough to redeem the novel. The book went from a 1 to about an 8 or a 9. So, to sum up my review, I recommend this book, if for nothing else but the last 100 or so pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was okay","review":"When are you going to get rid of that whinning Louis???? I love that David has soul, and I love that David got made and I love how he's just into everybody business, and I loved that you finally woke up that Lazy Lestat, He needs a new book give him something to do! Write it, Anne Write it!! Oh yeah, and Merrick was, well Merrick was a black girl, Yeah!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst Anne Rice book","review":"I am a huge fan of Anne Rice and have enjoyed her tales over the years of the Mayfair witches and the vampire chronicles. But Merrick doesn't even come close to these other novels. It lacks depth, an interesting story line, and character and location development. It is billed as bringing together the Mayfair witches and Lestat, which is completely untrue. The story has little to do with her others and with previous characters.Furthermore, there is nothing interesting about the story line. The goal is to bring back the ghost of a dead vampire child. That is the entire premise. Who cares. It is completely boring and dull. There are other a few characters and they aren't very developed other than their history.Anne Rice can do so much better. This is an complete disappointment. Don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The final blow.","review":"Back in highschool, I warshipped Anne Rice. Like thousands of fanfic writers, teen girls, & Japanese women, I wanted Lestat & Louis to be togeather. That was dashed. Equally bad, everyone's acting OOC (out of character)One of the things that got me into the Chronicals in the first place was how similar Lestat was to Aoike Yasuko's 1970s-2003 hero Eroica (come to think of it, the character descriptions of Lestat & Louis MATCH those of Dorian; Earl of Gloria & Klaus Eberbach....)I was equalliy dissapointed with the books she released AFTER this, though somehow I managed to force my way through Memnock & the 2ed half of Armand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another future classic.","review":"I love Anne Rice and this book was just another reason to admire her writing. This book follows suite in the high standards she has set with her other novels. It really is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diversity In New Orleans","review":"Merrick is my first attempt at a Rice novel. There will be more. The author employs a classic style with many similarities to Henry James. Most impressive are the characters, extraordinery monsters portrayed as sympathetic personalities with similar needs as you or I.Merrick, herself, is rich in ambiguity that leaves the reader guessing about her intentions. My only concern was some redundant dialog. When David is trying to convince someone of a point, he tends to be repetitive of his arguements. Since he is the narrator, the repetition comes in words and thoughts. This is a minor concern that is offset by wonderful settings, language and tension.I look forward to Merrick's impact on the her companions. A female perspective among the undead can only improve an already popular series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was also disappointed in this latest book. I'd skipped over her last few novels. I was very surprised that in passages referring to \\"Matthew\\", Merrick's stepfather, the name \\"Michael\\" was used twice. Did I miss something? Is there a Michael or was this a misprint? Surprised to see this kind of mistake in an author of Ms. Rice's caliber."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good book!","review":"I can't believe how many people are bashing Anne Rice and this novel. I found it extremely entertaining. A fast paced, enjoyable read. A great way of entwining the Vampire/Witch world. Also, Lestat is back! I would definately recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"I've read all of Anne Rice's novels and loved them all, but where did this one come from? I felt Merrick lacked originality and it seemed Rice just whipped up some character to obtain her yearly paycheck. Also, the attempt to tie Merrick to the Mayfair family was pathetic and pretty much pointless other than making some sort of connection between vampire and witch.On the other hand, I was pleased that we were brought back with Louis and Lestat, but neither character seemed in form. Louis to me was completely out of character and I almost stopped reading the book due to this. I realize characters change over time but this was a completely different person (especially in the end of the novel).In all, I was pleased to see the story pick back up with my favorite duo but I felt this was one of Rice's most poorly orchestrated novels to date. I will admit the book keeps you reading for more, but I ended up only attaining a great feeling of dissapointment when I finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"Anne Rice seems to write books so out of characters from her previous VC books. The characters seem so unlike themselves. I don't understand why Ms. Rice changes her characters to suit her writing even when she is contridicting what she wrote in her previous VC books which were bestsellers. The book dosen't even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"not again...","review":"not bad but when is the Anne Rice going to write a book that isn't exactly the same story as the rest?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HECK!?","review":"I have to admit that I am a huge Anne Rice fan. I also have to admit that I was severely dissapointed with this book of hers. I was so shocked at how bad this book was! Especially compared to her previous books--specifically the Vampire Chronicles. It seems to me, looking at these other reviews, that the only people who liked it were people who havent read her previous books or just have no taste. Honestly, I found myself not paying attention as I was reading and zoning out as the pages just turned themselves. People, don't waste your time or money on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A true embarrassment","review":"In literary studies, characters are often referred to as being either flat (remaining the same throughout the novel) or dynamic (changing emotionally/spiritually as the novel progresses). As later additions to the vampire novels demonstrate (\\"Merrick\\" included), Anne Rice's vampire characters have for years been flat, flat, flat. Unless she plans to let them change and grow, she should stop writing about them. It's such a shame that she's constrained her characters - they had, and still have, fantastic potential. As far as the actual text is concerned, does no one take a blue pen to her work?? It's depressing when an author hacks off her own work, and it's even worse when she inaccurately hacks off her own work. Where is her editor? Well, at least we have two classics - \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" and \\"The Vampire Lestat.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a huge Rice fan and I was really disappointed by this book. There were plenty of interesting elements in this story, but she didn't seem to bring them together. Possibly the frequent references to other books and storylines?The character of Merrick is an interesting addition to her lineup but I don't feel she capitalized on it.It is still worth reading if you are a Rice fan, but not by much."},{"rating":"1","title":"First there was ANNE RICE ... then... there was anne rice","review":"Let's seperate Anne Rice into two people...The first writes books like Queen of the Damned and The Witching Hour. The second writes books like Vittorio and Merrick.The Rice I fell in love with wrote about characters with character. About love, violence, lust, anger, and soul. This new Rice obviously didn't read any of her former works and simply must supply 100,000 words to her publisher by the end of the quarter.Merrick is, in a word, boring. Remember in school when YOU had to write an essay and used \\"filler\\" words? \\"The flowers were red. Bright red. So red, the color red was not sufficient to describe them\\" Now picture an entire book like that. \\"New Orleans with streets so vibrant the word vibrant isn't vibrant enough to capture it\\".

Mostly the person.

THIS IS A MUST FOR ALL RICE FANS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampires and Witch Summit Meeting","review":"Anne Rice continues two of her serialized sagas, the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches, in this new novel, easily one of her most accessible efforts and a fast, rip-roaring fun read. Vampire/body thief and one time paranormal investigator for the centuries old group, the Talamasca, David Talbot returns to tell the story of Merrick, a beautiful Creole witch from her childhood to full, ripe young womanhood. The Vampire Lestat and the debonair Louis also return in a rapidly paced yarn that will have you turning the pages faster than you want to. A couple of times Rice had me wondering if this wasn't really a true story, and the plot twists are surprising and satisfying. It ends too soon, but not without promise of yet another installment to come. Anne Rice is a prolific writer who rewards loyal readers every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"I hated this book. I am a fan of Rice's Mayfair Witches series and enjoyed the early works in the Vampire Chronicles, but Rice's later works are long drawn-out snores. The only one of Rice's books that was more likely to induce catatonia was The Violin. I also didn't see the point of having Merrick related to the Mayfairs since the only thing they have in common is being witches. Using dreams of Oncle Julien as a plot device was a cheat and the story would have been better if the Mayfairs had been left out of it altogether. As for Louis and his melodrama, by the middle of the book, I was more than willing to help him commit suicide if for no other reason than I was tired of his incessent whining.As for my recommendation: if you enjoy tedious whining from someone who chose to live forever, are a masochist, or are an insomniac needing a sleep remedy, then this is the book for you. I, on the other hand, would rather slit my own wrist than read another book by Rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING WITCH!!!!!","review":"I really wish that this book was more interesting. Don't get me wrong, the beginning was interesting and the ending was a surprising twist, but the middle was completely BORING!!! I think that the change of pace was unbearable. Once Rice cued in on Merrick Mayfair's life, I actually skipped ahead to the end. I didn't miss anything (I forced myself to read the parts I skipped over). All I learned was that David Talbot was one pedophile of an old man! Merrick Mayfair's life was one of the most boring I've read. I would use another word for it, but \\"boring\\" is the best fit. If Rice would only keep the flow of the book constant and not drag out Merrick's life, I would give it a better rating. I have one question to put to everyone: what happened to the old Anne Rice? Her old books were much, much better. If you're thinking of reading her book for the first time, I suggest her early books up to Memnoch the Devil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun reading!","review":"I enjoyed reading this work by Anne Rice. I have read every book by Anne Rice (and own all but Interview with a Vampire in first edition) and found this to be at the top of the list. I enjoyed how the two story lines get blurred between the Mayfair Witches and the Vampire Cronicles but I would like to have seen more with the actual Mayfair family involvement-maybe she's holding out for a future book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Louis fans will cry","review":"Those who love Louis for his flaws will cry. As with Memnoch the Devil and The Vampire Armand, the characters have the same name and the same looks but not the same soul. I didn't know these vampires. They were strangers to me. Anne did a complete 180-degree turn around on several key facets of Louis' personality. It was heartbreaking. The poor Beautiful One. New readers may like it, but those of us who loved Louis from the beginning weep.Also, this story should be told by Louis, not David. So much wasn't described because David wasn't there to witness it. He only heard about it after the fact. Therefore, much of the really important stuff happens \\"off-screen\\" and the reader misses out.If you are a fan of the romantic, sensual vampire, maybe it is time to move to Poppy C. Brite or T.Isilwath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's hope Anne will do better than this ...","review":"I've been a fan of Anne Rice for almost a decade and the vampire chronicles from IWTV to MtD have been a treasured jewel. I was thrilled to hear about Merrick as it promised a return of our beloved Louis. And I believe like many fans out there, I have been waiting for some bizzare adventures of Louis and Lestat...and those ever-enduring romantic undertone. Disappointingly, Merrick reads like a normal (a word I've before this, refused to use on my fav. author) novel - Indiana Jones-like adventure, and worse, a too-unlike-Rice love triangle that seems all superficial! What happens to the Rice we love? Where are the mysteries, the love-hate, the struggles, the bitterness and sweetness .. I miss the misery, the haunting and those burning sensations I used to get when reading a vampire chronicle. Anne, please listen to your fans and oh, ... the editing of the book was terrible, if there was even one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, it stinks.","review":"I loved the witch series first and the Vampire Chronicles second.

Two stars for decoration."},{"rating":"1","title":"continuing downhill","review":"I have abandoned this latest of Anne Rice's bad books, and will now feel no urge ever to read her again. Why? Because the Anne Rice who wrote so powerfully in Interview, Lestat, Queen and Witching Hour is long gone. Instead, she makes so much money for her publishers that they're afraid to tell her \\"this isn't good enough.\\" In fact, I've read that she refuses to allow her writing to be edited. It shows. Now we get tired books like Pandora, Armand and Vittorio, and unreadable books like Violin and Merrick. She's become unbearably self-indulgent. Her writing has grown lazy and precious: too much telling rather than showing, too many one-sentence paragraphs, too much telegraphing of emotion (in both senses of the word), too much self-conscious conversation unlike anyone human (or even \\"formerly human\\") ever spoke--in other words, as another review remarks, entirely too much filler. Save your money and re-read the earlier books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent -- moving, funny, very real.","review":"I read Go And Come Back and was excited to discover Abelove's second novel. It is surprising what a departure this book takes from her first in terms of setting and subject; but like her first book, Saying It Out Loud is a wonderful read. It shifts back and forth between current and past memories, despair and hope, pain and humour. I found myself smiling through my tears at many points in this book. Although the plot, a mother dying of cancer, is decidedly dark, the story manages to be sweet and funny and tender and sad without being maudlin. Saying It Out Loud definitely has a lasting impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This is such a surprising and wonderful book. It's about Mindy's search for solid ground while her mother is dying. I cried and I laughed, but more than that, I marveled.

I was stunned when I read about Mindy, combing her mother's hair in the hospital while worrying about jiggling her mother's brain tumor. I was delighted by the report by Mindy's friend's younger brother about \\"The Three Told Sloth.\\" There are dozens of perfect moments like these woven through SAYING IT OUT LOUD.

I would recommend not reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic, different story of death & family interactions.","review":"Mindy's mother has been diagnosed with a brain tumor,andsuddenly Mindy finds her world changed. Alienated from her fatherand separated from her mother, Mindy's supposed to be thinking ofcollege applications - but can't accept her mother's illness and demise. A realistic, different story of death affecting family interactions."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmm","review":"smells awesome - hope the rope goes all the way through the bar - won't know until it's been used though, will i?! it's a gift"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Everytime I read an article from this book, I am amazed that I am reading a translation (from French). How can a translation of a 150 year old text be more clear, and make more sense, than contemporary attempts in the mother tongue of English?This man has one modern rival for clarity of economic common sense, and that is Murray Rothbard. It is a shame that Bastiats career was cut so short.If you want a grounding in the fundementals of economics, and the pressure and accompanying fallacies of social pressure towards government, look no further than to the works of this man. All of his works are well worth the asking price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointment","review":"I don't know if Twins has just started making a new cut of their hats or if it's just Giants caps. I had previously ordered a Nationals hat at XL which fit like a dream. I figure it's the same company; same sizes. I order a XL in a Giants and it's huge. I then returned the XL, ordered a Large and...it's very tight. Overall, I am very unhappy about this product.I'd reccomend trying on this hat in person at a store and not ordering it on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book offer a completely different perspective","review":"Most of us having been reading the \\"metaphysical\\" books for the last twenty years and it is all basicly the same. I found \\"Tracking Freedom\\" refreshingly different. It took reading the book several times and suspending my own usual way of thinking to start to digest what Ken Eagle Feather is trying to get across. I love the book. I will undoubtly read it again and again. Ken Eagle Feather's style of writing makes reading the book a pleasure; like two friends having a conversation. A book to be savored."},{"rating":"2","title":"good prep for CCNA","review":"Of all the CCNA books that I've read, CCNA press and Sybex included, this was probably the easiest, and most conversational in nature.That being said, I wouldn't rely on any one source for your prep. In fact, I'd probably read one of the previously mentioned books after this one, just to make sure that you haven't missed anything. But it won't put you to sleep, especially like the CCNA press books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"You can learn allot from this book. Personally, I like the CD that comes with it. I have a 2 year old and I can take her to the park, or let her play outside and study at the same time. I also purchased 2 other books but this one seems to hit all the areas that I have been studying at college. I really recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising Plain and Simple","review":"I'm not going to flat out accuse Boson and McGraw Hill of lying but it's pretty darn close. They clearly advertise 20 simulated lab exercises and the lads do indeed come with the book but there's a catch. When its time to do the lab in chapter 16 (5th lab) you have to pay more money to Boson. Yep, when it's time to get in to the real meat and potatoes of router configuration you have to pay extra money. Where I come from we call that the bait and switch. The one and only reason I chose this book was because it came with a virtual lab. Now, I find out that I have has to sift through inaccurate information and typos only to find out that the one thing that made it worth while is a con job. This book is a sub par teaching tool at best. If I had it to do over I would probably go with Sybex and then buy some used routers online. This is the worst training tool I have ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"some error but is a good CCNA book","review":"I bought this book and read through, pass CCNA. some errors on Cisco IOS command, but concepts are good and precise. you need other sources too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well thought out study guide","review":"I purchased this book with the hopes that I would not only learn to pass the test but learn to configure routers as well.The book is well written each subject area is thought out and as lab exists in each chapter that can be completed with Boson's NetSIM LE. I upgraded to the full version and it was well worth it.The test engine used in the book is the industry standard and the questions are well written.Overall, this is one of the best certification books that I have used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not excellent","review":"If ure just breaking in the networking field then i would suggest u to purchase this book. Everything is written in easy to understand language and book covers a networking basics. Like other books related to networking this book contains few serious errors as well but if u read the material carefully, u will spot them ;) and if u will spot the mistakes, u know that u understand the material ;)All in all, this book boosted my efficiency at work sooo much, so i give to it 4 pings out of 5:!.!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not The Best....","review":"Old Man's Child is among the best Scandanavian band that any American is likely to find. Among the others are Dimmu Borgir, Celtic Frost, and Fairytale Abuse. The Pagan Prosperity is one of OMC's weaker albums, though. If you want true melodic black metal, check out thier \\"Born of the Flickering\\" album. As far as comparison, the best tracks on Pagan Prosperity (\\"Soul Posessed\\" and \\"My Demonic Figures\\") do not measure up to even the weakest tracks on Born of the Flickering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black metal?","review":"This is not black metal.this is 'all cd long the same speed' metal with some keyboards and,i admit,a black metal voice.Besides,Galder is a very arrogant man.Only 2 times listening is enough. Okay, there are 2 or 3 interesting songs.But it all sounds so much the same!!Good metal album, BAD BLACK metal album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely earrings!","review":"I purchased these earrings to go with a necklace my wife received from her mother at Christmas (eight months prior). My wife says these are lovely earrings and are the perfect length for lever-backs. The rose quartz stones match her necklace even though they came from very different places at different times.Edited on 5/12/11:My wife still loves these earrings. However, she wanted me to note that one of the leverbacks doesn't stay closed all the way anymore. The earrings stay in her ears, but she wonders how secure they are now. She loves them and will be disappointed if she loses one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay if you're a kid I guess","review":"A little more zany than I expected. I think the idea for the movie was a good one, but they went a bit over the top with it and in my eyes made what could have been a good movie ended up being just plain stupid. I can see kids liking it, but adults beware. Not even Anne Archer and Brian Dennehy could save this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun...just fun to watch","review":"This is a really creative idea--to make a period piece following the classic Lovecraft tale using the same film style that was present when the story was written. Just a brilliant move. I really like that this was made by members of the HP Lovecraft Historical Society as well. If you are a Lovecraft fan, and would like to see a film stylized to fit 1930's style of silent picture, get it. The art-deco Cthulu statue is a nice touch as well."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],O={key:0},M={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(D,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-0062db8c"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/68.md","filePath":"guide/68.md"}'),W={name:"guide/68.md"},P=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
