It also has the song American Woman from the Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me soundtrack and from the rerelease of his previous album to this called simply 5. Those are the two of the reasons to get this thing. But there are many more reasons and many more great songs off of this. My favorites besides the previously mentioned somgs are Are You Gonna Go My Way, Fly Away, Rock 'N' Roll Is Dead, It Ain't Over Till It's Over, Mr. Cab Driver, Always On The Run, I Belong To You, and of course Lenny's first hit Let Love Rule.

So somewhere on the way to the bank, Kravitz lost his music. To make story short - most of the old stuff here is good and the new is bad, especially the horrible cover version to the \\"GUESS WHO\\"'s \\"American woman\\". The problem of the good stuff is, that it seems like it does'nt belong here - it was taken out of great discs and does'nt do anymore. Sorry to tell you - i have the disc but don't listen to it.

They have played it to death on radio, and it became one of his biggest hits...why? When you have \\"Black Velveteen\\"?Other songs that did not make it on here from his album \\"5\\" are better than his renditions of the tired \\"American Woman\\", and his Top 20 hit \\"Fly Away\\" is good, but again tires too.Only one standout song on this compilation lives up to any classic rock abiltiy and that is \\"It Ain't Over Till Its Over\\" which has a Marvin Gaye/Al Green quality written all over it.Otherwise this CD is pretty much a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low on cash Lenny?","review":"Let Love Rule is one of the BEST albums of all time.

It started when I wanted to tab 'Always On The Run' because it featured Guns N Roses' Slash on it. But while I borrow the album from my older brother, I also taped it. After I tabbed 'Always...' I heard the album in full and I was blown away! However, only from ARE YOU GONNA GO MY WAY? to ALWAYS ON THE RUN, with the exception of STAND BY MY WOMAN, are the highlights for me. Anything else is pure weak with a capital WE. I'd recommend this for anyone interested in Lenny."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent eclectic choice of songs","review":"This album shows Lenny's diversity.

Lenny just brings a new dimension to both rock and soul that isn't common in either genre. This greatest hits cd definitely has some of his greatest songs (\\"Again\\", \\"It Ain't Over 'Til Its Over\\", \\"Can't Get You Off Of My Mind\\", \\"American Woman\\"and \\"I Belong To You)\\". I have a feeling that some of his older stuff might be better than some of the stuff on this cd, but that's a good thing considering I think all of these songs are great. This will only motivate me to research more of his music. He's coming out with a new cd in about a week and I might check that out...good job, Lenny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun album","review":"A great collection of songs that work well together. This is my first Lenny Kravitz CD, so it gave me a very good introduction to of his style of music. It's an interesting mixture. One minute I feel the anger in \\"Mr. Cab Driver\\" and then the energy of \\"Black Velveteen\\". This CD offers a whole range of styles, which is what makes it a fun album to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compilation","review":"It is almost his best, and I say almost because there R two songs I think don't fit into this compilation: Mr. Cab Driver and Black Velveteen. Both of them R different from the other songs's leading style, the first is plain blues and the second is among Lennys weakest efforts IMO. Where the hell is Circus or I build this garden 4 us? Still a great, but not perfect compilation from one of the greatest one-man-bands of all time. Highly recommended 4 Kravitz fans and rock/funk/blues fans also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Compilation","review":"Let me start by saying this album is worth the money even without the CD. The picture album of Kravitz inside the front cover of the case is priceless. It is yet another example of an artist who takes himself way to seriously, and is good unintentional comic relief for the rest of the album. As for the actual music on the CD, when it is what Kravitz does best, centered around guitar, it is excellent, \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\" and \\"Fly Away\\" make up about three fourths of the album, and prove very entertaining. The rest of the album is a little soulful for me. Fans of R&B might enjoy them, but for me they were a little to far off of his great guitar-work to make the album. Nonetheless, the excellent guitar ballads make this album well worth the price, and put it high on my recommendation list."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Lenny Kravitz Greatest Hits\\" The Best Place To Start!","review":"I mostly listen to new age music but even though its my favorite type of music I still like to listen to rock and roll. Lenny Kravitz is my favorite rock musician along with my other favorite Michael Jackson. Their music is very different. Lenny's music is much louder than Michael's where he plays softer music with more of a dance beat.The first song I heard from Lenny Kravitz was \\"American Woman\\" which was originally sung by the group \\"The Guess Who\\". I heard it on my compilation CD \\"Now That's What I Call Music Vol. 3\\" and thats also an album you might want to try.Anyway, I'll mention a few of my favorites: Fly Away, Again, Can't get you off my mind and I belong to you[ which I heard from Now 4. But all in all every song is great.If you already own the greatest hits you might want to try 5 which is in my opinion Lenny Kravitz's second best album.I recommend this album to everyone who loves rock and roll!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Infectious Hour of Hits","review":"This is a good sample from Kravitz' five albums. Like the Guess Who (\\"American Woman\\"), Kravitz is one of those artists that Greatest Hits albums were designed for. If you're like me, you find some of his albums (like I did with the Guess Who) a hit and miss affair. And with this release we get the hits (and a new song, \\"Again\\"). So here's your chance to relive some of the songs that might not get played as much as \\"Fly Away\\" or \\"It Ain't Over\\": stuff like \\"Believe\\" or \\"Always On The Run\\" and \\"Heaven Help\\". Sure, you'll find something missing. I'll trade you \\"Rock and Roll Is Dead\\" for \\"Fields of Joy\\". But that's a minor complaint. Sorry, no liner notes here, but you do get a lot of photos of Kravitz from throughout the years. This is a solid 62 minutes of Rock-Pop-Funk-Soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant","review":"This CD would have to be one of the best investments that i have made as far as music goes. Lenny Kravitz, unfortunately is so under-rated, that he doesn't get the acalades in which he most deserves. He has written most of his material, and is talented enough to play the majority of the instruments, aswell as provide the vocals. The CD starts with the Rock classic 'Are you gonna go my way', and is followed by other brilliant tracks such as 'Rock and roll is dead', 'Always on the run', 'Fly Away', along with the 70's feel of 'It ain't over til its over'. The CD also features the song which infact could be named as his anthem 'Let Love Rule'. It has been said that it is hard to fit Lenny into any specific genre of music, however i disagree with this - his music belongs in the category of all time classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"again","review":"I love this new song from LENNY.

It seemed strange to me when I'd heard that Lenny Kravitz had a greatest hits CD; it seems like he's always been around (since my junior high days at least, and I'm three years out of college), but it didn't seem like he really had much out there until I listened to the CD and heard \\"It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over,\\" \\"Let Love Rule,\\" and even the less-heard \\"Cab Driver\\" and realized that he's been pretty prolific.The album is a good mix of funk and classic rock, with some pretty good ballads thrown in--kind of like Jimmy Hendrix, Al Green, and the Beatles had a baby together. I recommend it for anyone who came of age during the mid to late 90s especially. I hope Kravitz sticks around awhile longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CD BY THE MAN HIMSELF","review":"I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED LENNY KRAVITZ ALL OF HIS SONGS ARE GOOD HE COULD SING HE COULD WRITE SONGS AND HE COULD PLAY GUITAR HE IS TALENTED I WENT TO SEE HIM IN CONCERT AT THE BLOSSOM MUSIC CENTER HIS CONCERT WAS AWESOME KEEP UP THE WORK MR LENNY KRAVITZ YOU GO LENNY KRAVITZ YOU ARE ONE OF MY FAVORITE SINGERS I HAVE 2 OF YOUR CD'S YOUR GREATEST HITS CD AND YOUR RECENT CD LENNY LENNY KRAVITZ IS ON NOW 1 NOW 3 NOW 4 NOW 6 NOW 9 NOW 10"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, if you're into repetition","review":"Personally, I don't own this album and would never condone actually shelling out the cash for an album as simple as this, but if you like standard modern pop/rock, this is one of the better choices out there. His earlier stuff is clearly where his strengths lie, and until Kravitz gets out of this string of stuff that has absolutely failed (his cover of American Woman is abyssmal, and while Fly Away rocks, a lot of the other songs off that album were repetitive and dull, not to mention the horribly bland Again which really makes you wonder why it is on any album at all), I suggest biding your time with those earlier albums, if any of his stuff at all. His songs really don't develop much beyond the standard verse/chorus blah of pop, and his guitar prowess (which I do question) is certainly not a focal point of this album in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Lenny Kravitz!!!!!!!!!","review":"For an upbeat party or a relaxing evening with your lover this is the number one CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks anyway, but don't we already own all these tunes.","review":"One review above reads 'L.K. does it again!' whatever.

The activity panel is OK and works fine when it is detached from the steering wheel. However, when the cruiser is in the ride-on position, the activity panel is not fixed on the steering wheel. Instead it swirls every which way, making it very difficult for a child to sit on the cruiser and keep his balance. At some point my son's hand slipped from the side of the activity panel and he would have fallen down had I not stood right next to him. He got scared and started crying for me to take him off the cruiser.I bought this toy after talking to a store employee, but I whished I had checked the reviews on the web site before I made the purchase.

We couldn't get him out because his knee wouldn't fit back through. We managed to get his pants rolled up, and we used a lot of baby oil. Still he was stuck. By this time my son was screaming, terrified and in pain. Just as my husband was about to break the handle off, I closed my eyes and yanked as hard as I could and my son was freed. However, he has many dark bruises all around his knee from getting caught and us trying to gently pry him out.

My daughter received this for her 1st birthday. It looked so neat. She tries to play with it but it's so awkward she just gives up.

It is a very easy and short book to read, therefore any student would like it that much more. Personally, I feel like this book would be very appropriate in today's society because it deals with a real life issue--war.I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soldier's Heart","review":"Soldiers Heart by Gary Paulsen is about a boy named Charley who goes to war trying to be a man.

He makes this decision because his mother is trying to support the family by herself since the father has passed away, and working on there farm isn't making enough money to support the family.

Towards the end he realizes war is very gruesomeI think the main theme in the book is don't do something your going to regret. And war is more grossed than you think.What I like in this book are the different things to war. Today we shoot at each other in war but we don't stand in the middle of a field and let people shoot right at us. Back then we had muskets. Now we have machine guns.

He describes war so realistically that it feels like you are there. This a must if you are a Paulsen fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Soldier's Heart","review":"A Soldier's Heart book is definitely man vs. man, and sometimes-even man vs. himself. It affected my reality toward life. This novel taught me to never love violence and war. I thought this is a suspenseful story because Charlie (main character) really liked the fact that he was treated like a King with girls waving hankies. That was all about to change.I thought the author's purpose for writing this novel was to teach a moral lesson about people with a \`soldier's heart.' Some history about the battlefields were involved in the plot, but still with great background description.Though I loved the book, I wasn't attached to any of the characters. The characters all used confusing words that w \`slang.' To emphasize, the vocabulary is just too juvenile, and therefore this book was published for an audience less than twelve."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST CIVIL WAR FICTION BOOKS I HAVE READ!","review":"Soldier's Heart is an engrossing tale of the Civil War as seen through the eyes of the young hero of the book. Charley is a fifteen year old boy who longs for the excitement of the war and so he lies about his age and enlists in the Union Army. He is not prepared for the horror he experiences or with the reality of war. The author does a good job of letting the reader see and feel what the character experiences as he goes from situation to situation I think this book would be a good one to use in class when studying the Civil War. It really brings home the realism of the Civil War. Mr. Paulsen's details are wonderful, even the slang words of the time are included without being overdone. I was surprised to find also that this story was based on the life of a real Union soldier. I highly reccomend this book, especially to middle school students and to teachers who teach about the Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soldiers Heart is worth a read","review":"I liked this story very much. I thought it was a good flowing book and easy to follow. The character was easy to realate to as he struggled to deal with war. I would recommend this book to teens.

There was going to be a shooting war.\\" The book Soldiers Heart is an exciting novel by Gary Paulsen.Charley is a 16-year-old that does not want to miss the great adventure at war. He acts 18 and joins Fort Snelling. Charley thinks the war will be fun and exciting. In the first battle when Charley almost gets shot, he realizes the war is dangerous, but he can not turn back now. Charley goes on many adventures and loses many friends. Charley learns that war is not an adventure but a horrible thing to be part of. Young children can learn about the civil war by reading this book. This book is not really for girls. Girls may not like all the violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"soldiers Herat","review":"The Soldiers Heart was a very interesting novel.I liked this book because it gave many facts about the Civil War and how it felt to fight in the battles. This book is a very good novel to read if you like touching stories. One of my dislikes about this novel is that it didnt give very much detail. I would have loved to hear more about the relationships between the soldiers in the camp and between the generals.The best part in the book was when Charley, the main charactor, road the train for the first time and met his first colored woman. When he first met her she thanked him for fighting for her freedom and gave him a gift.This book took place in Minnissota and all around the United States. The charactores are Charley, the main charactor, Swenson, Charley's friend,the Generals, the colored woman, and Charley's mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"touches the very nature of the human conditon","review":"If there is formula for writing a great novel, Ralph Cotton has knows the recipe.

Very good work in the orchestra, too. Warning: the quality of the recording is below the standard, as a label in the box honestly warns, and it is mono, not stereo, but anyway it's worth to cope with that given the quality of the interpretation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come closer to Maria Callas","review":"This CD is a master piece of Maria Callas' performance. Together with Stefano, they created a milestone that their followers are difficult to overpass. Listen to this live, you feel you were back in 1955. The atmosphere it produced is fresh and new to the later generations. But because the record technique as mono, not stereo, if you feel untolerable for the mono, it will cut your expectation little bit. But generally, if you are really a fans of Maria Callas, you will definately like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one and only!","review":"This Traviata is superbly sung, well interpreted and perfectly conducted! A keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable","review":"I know I differ from a lot of opera buffs, but sound quality is important to me. With so many good digital recordings out there, why would anyone buy this one? I agree with the statement that it sounds as if it was recorded with a hand-held microphone. As for Callas' singing in the last act, I cannot comment on it because after listening to about two and a half acts I pressed the eject button. I simply could not stand the tinny sound any more.There are a lot of great singers around today. Let's stop fawning over the ones who had the misfortune of singing before good audio recording equipment was avaiable. I'm sick of the cultural snobbism that tends to put down today's singers and exalt those of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Callas, Incredible voice, very poor recording","review":"I was excited to hear this version of La Traviata, just to hear Callas's voice. ( I am new to opera ). She has one incredible voice, but I've heard better sound on 3 stooges re-runs.The sound is muffled, there is constant talking, coughing and hacking of people in the background. The singers sound as though they forget they are singing into microphones at times, bad dropouts.I was/am spoiled with the Sutherland, Pavarotti (London recording). I still maintain this recording is much better. Not only is the audio far superior (yes, I know it was recorded about 20 years later), there seems to be some wonderful chemistry between Sutherland and Pavarotti that shines through.All and all, I am glad I heard the recording, I just wish I borrowed it from the library and saved the $$$$$. Buy the Suth/Pav recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound!","review":"RCA have a lot of nerve to release this. It sounds like listening to opera with the popcorn machine on full blast. I can't hear Callas. I don't know what you people heard, but it's not Callas. I know that Callas cracks a lot, but here, she's not cracking, it just sounds like she's cracking. The worst sound quality I've ever heard...period. Stay away from this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST TRAVIATA","review":"This was one of Callas's signature rolls. I have many recordings of Callas performing Traviata ('51,'52,'53,'55,'56,'58 Lisbon, '58 Covent Garden), but this is the best. The sound quality is a problem -- but not THAT big a problem. It's not in the realm of historical document; it's a recording that can easily be enjoyed just for pleasure. (The '51 Mexico is a BAD recording.) The '55 has it over on the others for several reasons: 1) Callas was in her best voice -- the first few years after her weight loss; so she has the distinct Callas sound, and at its strongest. 2) Her attack on the role is fierce and hair-raising in its passion and depth of feeling. Listen to her saying goodbye to Alfredo. Then compare that moment to anyone else's recording. No one, with the exception of Alagna's wife (her name escapes me) comes CLOSE. The Lisbon recording has better sound but slightly weaker passion, and this La Scala recording also has the advantage of de Stefano as Alfredo. Do not miss this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DELICIOUS Violetta!","review":"Amazon's ESSENTIAL recording truly is essential! This is the GREATEST Traviata ever. Callas is in supreme form and sings the hell out of Violetta! Buy it and be enchanted by timeless beauty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of La Traviata and Maria Callas","review":"Even though this recording is not stereophonic, you can still enjoy the marvelous voice of Maria Callas. You don't have to see her performance to understand how artistic she was. With her voice she was not actually singing, but she was acting as well. Not many singers could portrait Violetta's character like Maria Callas portraits in this particular recording. I would definitely recommend everyone who is interested in operas or not interested at all. La Traviata in general is a very light opera, so you do not have to be an opera buff to like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LEGEND","review":"Milano, La Scala, 1955, december the 7th.(Luchino Visconti, Lila de Nobili) charming di Stefano, and la Callas recreating a role every minute, especially in the second act.

The sound is good, the three principals are in top form. I don't understand all the bickering. I'm happy I got this lovely recording.

I have all the great Traviatas from Ponselle to Gheorghiu and still this remains the definite set. Here Giulini, Visconti and Callas created a magical masterpiece.

People are comparing Hogwood to Gardiner frequently here and to my senses, there is no comparison, because Gardiner's Eroica is simply tasteless and way out of bounds. The tempo of the first movement is so fast it barely makes sense at all. Many times parts which should be in the background are firmly in the foreground and it sounds bizarre, but I'm not sure that's the mixing or the orchestra (not that it really matters). Hogwood's is every bit as energetic and intense but Hogwood's sense of phrasing, timing, choice of tempo, orchestral balance, hell everything - is impeccable. Hogwood's Eroica from '83 or so is one of the greatest in recording history (if not the greatest) - this is just an experiment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Callas not meant to sing Lucia","review":"Callas cannot sing Lucia adequately.

This wand might be good for light cleaning, but, if you are buying this to reach high places with high pressure, look for another product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This extension wand is a MUST-HAVE!","review":"Once I purchased my pressure washer, I loved it! It's amazing how much dirt can accumulate! I washed the drive-way, sidewalks, deck, back patio, you name it. After a few jobs, I realized I was getting kinks in my lower back. I decided to purchase the extension wand. WOW! What a huge difference. Pressure washing was so much easier with the extension. I found I was able to get the jobs done FASTER with no back pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for heights!","review":"I ordered the extension kit because we have a very high-pitched roof on one of our garages that the regular wand wouldn't reach. It worked very well once I got the extension inserted into the hose handle. It wouldn't go in with just the normal push and twist; I had to actually bang it on the ground and then twist. (That's why I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5). I'm just going to leave it in since I can now go back and forth between shorter and longer extensions. This was exactly what I needed for the pressure washer to be used for different applications around our property. I didn't have a problem holding it because of the weight as some other reviews stated. Because of some of those objections I almost didn't buy the extension kit, but knew I needed it and am glad I went ahead and purchased.

The only way I could power wash it before was by using my extension ladder that is a pain in the ### to get out and raise. I found with the wand extension and step ladder I was able reach high enough to clean that side of the house. It is definately worth getting this if you have a high spot you need to reach. The unit is sturdy enough but it is slightly harder to control the spray than if your using the wand by itself. The unit doesn't come with instructions and at first I couldn't figure out how it mounted. I didn't realize the wand is in 2 pieces. You push down on the nozzle end and rotate it a quarter turn to separate it from the handle end. The one end of the extension is pressed and turned to lock in the handle end. The nozzle end is pressed and turned to lock in the extension end. One problem is when you want to go from low pressure to high or high to low you have to bring the unit down to make the change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arduous and inconvenient","review":"Yes, this product will allow reach into difficult areas;however,removing and installing induvidual segments is difficult. In fact, even if careful, it's easy to strip the cheap plastic threads which join the segments together. Furthermore,I found removing and installing the product from the body of the gun an absolute chore! There are other inconveniences not as frustrating - particularly when used with that cheaply made but expensive, poorly designed adjustable head brush, but you probably get the idea. Bottom line - if access is difficult, it's worth it; BUT if you intend to change the segments, attachments (especially the brush), or the extension itself often, expect an agravating, frustrating experience. And if you intend to use it often, forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pressure washer problem","review":"I purchased this product several months before I intended to use it.

I bought this on tape immediately after seeing it on Head Bangers Ball. I still have the tape, all these years later. I still play it with great frequency. It still whips on most \\"metal\\" I hear. Many bands sound silly 15 - 20 years after. E-Z-O sounds awesome.If you are looking to find a very rare gem from the 80's that is worth every penny, get this one. When my tape does wear out I will definitely nab it on disk (I seem to have a magic tape, most of my 80's tapes died).

Gene Simmons discovered this band and produced this album, and he knew what he was doing. Louder than Loudness (some of the members joined that band after EZO split), this cd is still mid-80s-metal-radio friendly (indeed, the friends they made along the way include British metalheads Grim Reaper).Pick hits: House of 1000 Pleasures, Flashback Heart Attack, Here it Comes, Kiss of Fire.Look beyond the makeup and you'll be thrashing until your head falls off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waited soooo long for this new album","review":"I heard a few cuts from Sympathique on a listener supported radio station in Philly a few years ago, loved the music and purchased the album. Then I waited and waited for a new album to be offered, and finally it was. I purchased it a few days ago and listen to it constantly. China Forbes wonderful vocals in any language are engaging and the diverse musical styles that they employ are delightfully infectious.My only regret is that I have not yet seen them live. I understand that they rarely tour and seldem if ever get to Philadelphia.

Everything else is good, like their first cd. This second one is a lot mellower, a little more sophisticated, but still has the wonderful latin rythms we know and love. Worth your while to check out if Sympathique was something you really liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hang on Little Tomato","review":"I love this group and this CD does not disappoint. A unique mix of selections enhanced, as always, by the outstanding musical talent of the group."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Little Tomato Will Need to Hang On","review":"You have to admire a group's self assurance that comes from a successful 1st album and rigorous touring schedule. Confidence alone, however, does not a winning vocal album make. Gone are the adventurous dynamically orchestrated tracks of Sympathique. In their place are peculiarly similar sad love songs, all sung in the style of Claudine Longet. What happened in the years since Sympathique? Did all the songwriters contributing to this work have the same lost love experiences? What happened to the excitement and creativity that gave us Sympathique? Cutting the band loose to write tunes was a great gesture, but in response to the lyrical question, \\"Do you miss me, my darling,\\" indeed we do. There's much to miss in this well intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying album. As for me, who purchased as gifts scores of Sympathique, I will indeed \\"hang on...\\" for hopefully a return to the real creative tracks of Sympathique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geez.....What a waste!","review":"After hearing about how good this CD was, I decided to add it to my mates extensive collection.

I am so happy to sing their praises. A fluke united their talent & 'the rest is history'. This album highlights the talents of all the band members, as well as several guests. Several songs are in different languages. Each member of this 'orchestra' is talented beyond belief. Their music is classical jazz/samba/blues ....fill in the blank. This is my feel good, clean the house, enjoy the day, cook an amazing meal track. It is so beautiful & uplifting. It stays in my CD & has also been a gift to several of my special friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky but Nice","review":"So...I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Hang on Little Tomato, as I had heard an excerpt from another album on Public Radio, the one where China sings Que Sera with carnival music in the background. That piqued my interest. I did listen to the samples before I ordered it, but couldn't really tell much. I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. I am a classical music fan and have spent many years singing choral music in a number of languages so the songs sung in French and Italian to a Latin rhythm were intriguing. I also liked their \\"big band\\" styling. There was only one song on the album that I didn't like, and considering that they wrote most of the music, that's a pretty significant average for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting","review":"I love how multicultural Pink Martini is!

Somehow the band members continue to find and write diverse musical gems. Here, \\"Let's Never Stop Falling in Love\\" and \\"Lilly\\" are quite addictive. Yes, \\"Lilly\\" echoes exactly the rhythm and repetitiveness of \\"Donde estas Yolanda?\\" from _Sympathique_, but with China Forbes's light, sly touch, it's a rhythm and melody that can bear repetition. Visitors to my house never fail to ooh and aah over the music when I play Pink Martini; they, too, are stunned by the group's range, talent, and cohesion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sympathique Rehashed--Nothing Innovative!","review":"My gf and I eagerly listened to Hang On Little Tomato, but both of us came away disappointed. Sympathique was a masterpiece, a rich vibrant sound with amazing vocals. It was a whole new world of music.Having seen Pink Martini in concert and experiencing China's fabulous voice, both of us were really looking forward to hearing PM raise the bar once more.Unfortuately, in this aspect, the album severely disappoints. The majoritity of the melodies are slight variations of Sympathique with new vocals. The style of the music was exactly the same--but felt worse. Hang On Little Tomato feels like an album that just imitated the great Sympathique. It wasn't innovative, it wasn't fresh, and it's not stellar music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hang On Little Tomato of my Heart!","review":"I discovered Pink Martini listening to Margaritaville Radio on Sirius XM. I am in love with this ensemble, I have checked out their other albums, how fresh and unexpected! I love songs in other languages, they just sound so beautiful, and the emotion in China's voice delivers the message whether or not I understand the words. You don't need to understand the words to enjoy PM's music, you just need to understand your heart. It will tell you, with the assistance of Pink Martini.

The age targeted activites are great, especially for the little ones. The categories of activities are helpful in determining what activites will be appropriate with goals the client is working on. I appreciate that there are mutliple activites for each target area. This allows me to work through a spectrum of approaches to the same issue.

Even if you have some gray hair on your head, and used to listen to Judas Priest too loudly as you cruised campus [well, especially if you loved Judas Priest], you'll like this album. Three songs stand out:Cut 6, Love's Tragedy Asunder, will have you \\"playing the steering wheel\\" unless you no longer have a pulse.Cut 7, Wicked Witch, is not just a beautifully arranged song. It is also funny and clever as hell. Who else would have thought to write a completely sympathetic song about one of moviedom's most vile characters? Know what? She WAS sympathetic!Cut 9, Down Where I Am, is the best of the bunch, with wonderful D&W; schizophrenia as acoustic leads inexorably to heavy metal.Well done, guys. This album is a romp. I can not wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak - boring, not up to Iced Earth standards","review":"This is only for HARDCORE fans of Blind Guardian and/or Iced Earth. If you have every iced earth CD (as I do), then this will come across as very boring, bland, material. Jon, please return to your day job and re-enlist Barlow. This Hansi Kursch guy cannot sing either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but missing something","review":"Demons & Wizards' concept sounds great: Blind Guardian's and Kursch and Iced Earth's Schaffer writing & playing together sounds like it could be the greatest amalgam in heavy metal , right? Unfortunately the concept falls short once more. The album has good songs, but every song sounds too much like one band or the other, it never sounds like a real symbiosis among two of the greatest metal bands. But don't get me wrong, the album is pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary. If you are a fan of Iced Earth, Blind Guardian or both, go for it! You will like it, but don't expect to anything outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring cd...","review":"Very dissapointing album for true Iced Earth and Blind Buardian fans!!!

All the kids love it; I'm told that one seven-year-old asks for it for his bedtime reading at least once a week. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used a lot","review":"This was a very helpful companion to our month long stay in Portugal, especially in the beginning. We were Portuguese neophytes. I especially liked Steve's suggestion to jump right in, not be shy and try using the language at every opportunity. Luckily, the Portuguese were very gentle teachers and worked to understand us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some serious errors","review":"I got this book to offer to a non-portuguese speaking person, and I'm glad I took a look at it first. I don't know from where the translators are, but there are pretty serious errors in that book. For instance, belly button is umbigo and not tecla da barriga. Cookie is bolacha and not bolaicha. The verb to be, in portuguese, is ser and not s��r, among others. One that I found is not even a word in portuguese! Something indispensable is imprescind��vel, no impres��ndivel.The structure of the book is quite accessible, is the poor translation that ruins it. Maybe the editor should be more aware."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for Portugal","review":"This book was incredibly helpful given that Portugese is so much more difficult from other languages I'm familiar with. He covers a lot in this book so you're likely to find most of what you need for your travels. I only gave it 4 stars because I would have liked a little more pronunciation help (really complicated in Portugese) but it's an indispensable and invaluable tool. Also, the way it's arranged can be a little confusing. A word or phrase you want may not be in the section you think and you have to search quite a bit for it but, really, a relatively minor thing. I carried this book with me everywhere on my trip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another useless book for travel in Portugal","review":"This book is designed for Brazilian Portuguese but even with that in mind my fiancee who is Portuguese noticed many mistakes in this book and called it useless and said to return it. Save yourself money and look under European Portuguese if you are traveling to Portugal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lou at his wasted best","review":"This is classic live Lou Reed.

We didn't use it as a game. You can place the different frosting and sprinkle combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make different varieties. Each would take a turn 'ordering' types of donuts and the others would 'make' them. Yes, the frosting won't stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works great on a plate for pretend play! Box is flimsy but we just keep all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue. Would buy this again. Great for kids with imaginations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun!","review":"This is such a fun product. My 2 and 4 year olds like to pretend they are serving doughnuts to mommy and daddy.I really like all of the Learning Resources Smart Snacks great play food with an educational twist.

She is always making us donuts in her kitchen. She bakes them in the oven and has a blast. I wouldn't say that it is a matching game like the description states. I mean what are they matching?? But she likes it none the less. The only pitfall of the toy is that when they pieces get separated, you feel like you are picking up donuts all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"my son loves this","review":"My son first saw these doughnuts at his school, he played with them so much, i decided to buy them for home. He plays with them as much at home. He just thinks it so neat to be able to take of the frostings and put them on different doughnuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb playing by Levin and Gardner!","review":"Levin is a wonder, with technique and improvisational skills to dazzle those who have become used to stodgy performances of these wonderful works on modern instruments. The speed of some of the movements is breathtaking, but it always sounds right. (I wonder whether they are being played as Beethoven marked them -- often rejected as \\"too fast.\\") Gardner, of course, is precisely the right conductor and partner in this recreation of what this music probably sounded like when first played. Spectacular!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER FAILED NOVELTY ITEM","review":"This recording and Gardiner's complete Mozart concerti with Bilson are failed experiments. In the laughable Mozart recordings he even makes matters worse by insisting that the piano be \\"just another instrument\\" in the orchestra. So we have a \\"copy\\" of a primitive fortepiano recorded at a considerable distance. Can this be how Mozart expected to make his name and fame, playing a toy piano way off in the background? It sounds like someone plucking rubber bands. Later fortepianos (e.g. the Grafs from the 1820's) began to develop some tone and volume. But even they cannot hold their own against a full orchestra.A more interesting experiment than this recording is Levin's recording of a chamber version of Beethoven's 4th with a handful of accompanying instruments. It's no substitute for the real thing, but at least it works on its own terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when you're done writing","review":"The sound you hear as you read this review is me snoring as I once again attempt to read this book.I find it to be a snoozoid...but there is some context that would be valuable.If your sales position is working with a handful of key accounts you should buy this book. Assuming you can read through it and not fall asleep it will likely be of value to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kid's Review","review":"I got this video from the Kelley Library and after i finished watching it i gave the movie 5 stars. 5 stars because of the wonderful special effects and the actor selection. Rick Moranis and Stuart Pankin did a wonderful job. So did Eve Gordon and Robin Bartlett."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good - A GREAT Family Movie","review":"I personally thought this was the best of the \\"Honey, I Shrunk...\\" movies. It was very clean, non-violent and a great message about the relationship between kids and their parents. A fun movie for kids and their parents to watch together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST of the SHRUNK SERIES!","review":"I was prepared to find this movie corny and maybe even a bit on the boring side. Boy, was I in for a surprise! This movie had me laughing all the way through! It was cute, it was entertaining, it was amusing, it had a great message at the end, and NO, it was not in the least bit BORING! My five year old daughter was even intrigued by it; unfortunately, it was on past her bed-time! I'm thinking of buying it, though, because it would make a fun addition to our movie collection! This is a great family movie for all ages. My opinion? Watch it, and I bet you'll end up laughing and being pleasantly surprised by it yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Golf made easy at last!!!","review":"A great product which lives up to the advertising.

As miss Turner ages she seems to only get better. The sultry growl in her voice, and the shear power of her voice alone sends chills up and down my spine. With this release comes Tina live from Europe during her tv special Happy Birthday Tina. With none of the huge, flashy, eye popping effects of her stage shows, you simply get Miss Turner doing what she realy does best SING. Featuring live tracks from her latest release 24/7 it once again shows that Tina is amazing live. The songs seem to take on all new life with out all the studio perfections. You just get the stripped down rock, funk, dance and soul that only Tina can deliver. This is a must have for any Tina fan. With the two video's included and the studio release of 24/7 this will make a nice addition to your music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The HOTTEST Rock & Roll Chick EVER. The QUEEN.","review":"I just love these CD's. The bonus CD is my favorite. I just watched Tina and Beyonce on the 2008 Grammy Awards and at 68 she looks great. She still has the moves AND the legs. This CD at time makes you just melt, and next she can rock your socks off. You will LOVE this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"I have been rarely listening to this album since i bought it. The songs makes you bore especially after the sixth track. The live performances are amazing and they are one of the two reasons to buy the album. The other reason is the existence of the beautiful hit single \\"When The Heartache Is Over\\".I wish the album would include more hits like this song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second-grade class loved it!","review":"I read this to my class. They loved it. It is filled with humor and elicited many laughs from my students. They also reread the book on their own which always makes a teacher smile. I will put this book on my list to read every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid imagery, language, expression","review":"If you want to feel less alone in the real world of honest feelings, if you want to get in touch with true feelings, if you want to understand your emotions and explore your guilt and really dig deeper than sentiment--Carol Diggery Shields is the poet for you. Her voice is more original and her psychological depth deeper than most contemporary poets. She makes you feel less alone with your inner life. There is no sentimental frosting here. This is accessible and original poetry with a crafty use of language, a flowing free verse. I've spent my life reading poetry, and I find this poet thoroughly satisfying. Spend an evening or a morning or both with her LUNCH MONEY AND OTHER POEMS ABOUT SCHOOL and you will be moved and amazed at the original angles she takes on truth and human feelings and relationships. This is a poet of psychological, philosphical realization--a thinker who really probes the inner life with grace of expression."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference","review":"I got this book as someone who had used UNIX before, but this was many years ago, and I had forgotten a lot. This book is great for picking up the functionalities of various UNIX tools - the explanations are clear and concise. It also works very well as a quick reference. The bulk of the book is devoted to bringing you up from a potentially zero-experience user to someone who can work with ease with editors, shells, and more. Simple examples are included throughout. The back of the book has a 250-page command reference section for quickly looking up how to use a particular command. You could read the whole book and progressively work with UNIX as a self-taught course, or just reference the sections you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have several of Mark Sobell's Unix based books and this one is as good as the others which are all excellent. You don't nessecarily need all of them but they are truly tailored to the platform and are a quick way to get to what's important when a new platform presents itself.If you want to know the underlying MAC, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent intro and reference.","review":"This is a solid introduction and reference book for folks who are GUI-literate but not UNIX folks. (I learned UNIX back around 1982 and have desperately tried to ignore it since.) Much more useful than a general UNIX or Linux book, because it includes the specific aspects of OS X that you need to know about: where things are put, what special utilities are available, how the file system is laid out, OS X system management, etc.The only significant complaint I have is that the book devotes a LOT of space to vim, emacs, and other pure-text editors. The terminal is fine when you need it, but why would you edit text in a non-GUI environment? If you are a serious programmer, you'll want to work in an IDE (integrated development environment) with syntax coloring, hints, debug, etc. These chapters seem like a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN!!!!!","review":"We got this game for Christmas and with all the other toys, we didn't get it opened for about a week but after we figured it out we can't stop playing it!! The cards do get messy on the board, I too wish they would redesign that aspect. As far as educational, not real high, but it does make you think fast, pay attention. Just a really fun game to play with a group of adults or as a family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"too much fun","review":"MY DAUGHTER AND HER FRIENDS LOVE THIS GAME.YOU HAVE TO BE QUICK TO REACT BUT IT'S LOADS OF FUN.P.S.

It's worth buying for the contemporary cartoon of Byron posing as a ghost alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Concert Album features Grunsky's Greatest Hits","review":"This is a classic Jack Grunsky album (there is also a video available of this recording with Jack appearing with his band and daughter Cosima). \\"Carnival Parade\\" will have all kids and parents up and dancing. In fact, we used this song as a theme for my daughter's sixth birthday party. There is a newer, more sophisticated version of the children's classic \\"The More We Get Together\\", and perhaps one of the most beautiful songs ever written for children or adults alike entitled, \\"Siyanibingelela\\", all about how diffent cultures say \\"hello\\". The arrangements are incredible, with Grunsky playing countless instruments. \\"Children of the Morning\\" is hauntingly beautiful with Jack featured on the \\"berimbau\\", a type of musical bow. There is a strong world music feeling to this album, and other Jack Grunsky recordings. A parent can feel proud choosing this recording for young ears, and not simply opting for more commercial fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. The autobiography of a true American Hero. From being Ace of Aces in WWI, surviving on a life raft in WWII, racing cars, running an airline. What an amazing story. Some of his political views are rather dated (and even objectionable), but the story of his life is truly amazing and inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rickenbacker Biography","review":"This book was rated as in Good condition. \\"Not so much\\" The binding was tattered and it had a library 92R on the front which makes it look like it was stolen from the library. There is dark blue streaks swiped across the entire outside pages and a lot of the first pages are striped to show that it is no longer wanted by the library. I cannot keep this book as it looks like I picked it up out of discard bin and yet I paid over $20.00 incl. shipping. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Musical Direction - Terrible Voices","review":"The Italian pronounciation is absolutely terrible. The orchesta, under the direction of John Eliot Gardiner is very good, but the voices are completely unadeguate for an Italian baroque opera.

There was just tons of senseless smash-and-bash. Sometimes I forget why they suddenly start fighting. The character development was typical and very uninspired. I don't even really remember the storyline and I've watched the whole series. Don't get me wrong, though, this anime wasn't even supposed to be one of those crazy souped up fighting super hero anime. Avoid it unless you think you'll be interested by flashy character designs, typical characters, lots of manly yet meaningless bashing.

However, this mass was completely forgotten for half a millenium, and recently discovered. Pomerium recorded this CD for the first time in history. Beautiful, relaxation. In Japan, when released, this CD was one of the best sold CD among 'all the classical CDs'! Nevertheless, I prefer Kirkman's to this Pomerium's. This is because Pomerium's is made in America, which was not discovered when this mass was composed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too sturdy","review":"I received the Koala Baby bodysuits as shower gifts, and loved the little designs on the front. However, after washing them only three times, and normal use, the snaps came off the one bodysuit. The fabric didn't rip, rather, the prongs that attach the snap to the fabric just broke off. For the many times that a bodysuit will be worn, these just didn't hold up. Although extremely cute, they're not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"very old style of humor no longer funny today","review":"This book is more about how to write Bob Hope style of jokes or the uncreative humor of the 1940's or so.

My only stipulation is that this should be your second or third book. Why?...because after reading 10 stand up books that is what I would recommend. Steve Roye has the absolute best book on writing stand up. This book ranked 3rd after his. I got info and his book from the \\"killer stand up \\" link at top portion of page (laughnow.biz).

Sometimes the author would give an exercise, and I would have a hard type to come with something. While the book Comic Toolbox didn't have that many tools of comic writing, it was more encouraging and taught some valuable and technical stuff how to turn things around to make them hilarious, so the exercises were more fun to do, and produced better results. This book is the second book on comedy I've read so far, I'm sure I'll get back to it but for now I need something more basic because at times it was too overwhelming, or maybe I should just take up calculus."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll love it!... if you're 67","review":"The reason there are no good books on comedy is because it is an inherently impossible field to \\"break down\\" and \\"explain.\\" These guys do an okay job of relaying the history of comedy, but they do nothing to actually explain anything.Besides that fundamental flaw, these guys are simply too old and the book reads like my grandfather's \\"1001 Polish Jokes.\\" This advice would have been pretty helpful is honing your standup routine for Ed Sullivan but in 2007 it just seems pathetic and lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew there was so much to learn about being funny?","review":"This book is an excellent resource for any public speaker.

I feel this was an ambitious task for a 35 minute video. If the video focused on only one of these areas, I think the viewer would have received a more comprehensive and less fragmented perception about this state. I also came away feeling that if I visited any of the areas shown, I'd have to stay the night at a pueblo or outdoors since there wasn't a hint of a contemporary hotel or motel in sight. This video is more historical than actually helpful to tourists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are they now?","review":"This books was a major disappointment. The ideas seem pretty solid, but the book no longer matches the code that is available online. The downloads are a mess. The book says to install slither using the instructions in the download, but there are no instructions in the download. Two users posted requests over a year ago for these instructions and the requests were totally ignored. In fact not much has happened over the past year. It really seems as if the authors have moved on. Slither seems to be dead.On another note - this book is very academic. For example, there is a couple of pages of discussion about the different theorectical ways to design databases. But my needs are so simple, that I already knew I was going to use MySQL, so I just did not care about this discussion. Unfortunately there are lots of discussions like that in this book.

The show is beautifully shot in hi def with a 16x9 frame, and looks fantastic in broadcast. Even in standard def, there's no reason the 16x9 image on these discs shouldn't fill my 16x9 screen... instead, the picture is windowboxed--small with a thick black border.

What's especially important is that it is not narrowly centered on forest or silvicultural topics alone.

Hitachi also makes wonderful table saws that are very reasonably priced.And I would certainly encourage people to spend the extra dollars because it will save you a lot of time in the long run once you learn how to use it.

Some people might find certain things too frightening to believe however historically accurate an account might be, and Poe has been charged with a number of hoaxes which presented literature in a magazine that had pretenses of reporting on actual events. My normal method of study is with a concordance, so that I can see how an author uses particular terms, and I would have no idea where to look to see if Poe ever used the word \\"horsefeathers.\\" Nevertheless, in the field of thought which is most interesting to me, best summarized as ways of being deadly, Poe is the American intellectual figure who towers above all the rest. Hardly anyone else should even dare to recite a line from an outstanding poem, \\"Ulalume~A Ballad\\" which simply says, \\"Our talk had been serious and sober.\\" Poetic science begins with the ability to find that line in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Poe lovers.","review":"This book is the best choice for people who spend hours reading about Mistery, and of course, if you like the way Edgar Allan Poe writes, it is your choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Print","review":"I bought this book but had to return it; I found the print so small I could not comfortably read it.

Poe's imagination, creativity, and insight flow through these pages in a way rarely achieved by any other author. It is unfortunate that so many associate Poe only with horror and tortured genius.

The only difference is the packaging. The 2012 cd is housed in a digipak case (like the 2009 stereo remasters) while the 1999 cd is in a jewel case. I love the mixes on this album. The guitars and other instruments on \\"Love You To\\" really stand-out now vs the original mix from Revolver. Plus, for the completists, \\"Only a Northern Song\\" is in true stereo. This is the only album that features \\"Only a Northern Song\\" in true stereo (1969 LP Stereo Version is fake stereo, Anthology 2's stereo version is from alternate takes, & the 2009 remaster on Yellow Sub album is true mono as no stereo version exists of the original mix). This digipak is a welcome addition to my stereo remasters black box.Check out the Wikipedia page for more information on the mixes.Thank you for reading!Chris"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad addition to my previous commentary ...","review":"Just took a look at the digital waveforms on this compact disc. What a horror! Every track has been viciously compressed; the peaks are clipped to within a few fractions of a decibel of 100%, squashing all of the dynamic range out of the music in an attempt to make it sound as \\"loud\\" as the latest hits by Ricky Martin and Cher.This is improvement?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Music From Movie","review":"If you are wanting the Beatles songs (them singing) from the movie, this is the product to purchase.

I never really liked the original Yellow Submarine album because of all the filler instrumental tunes. I greatly enjoyed this reissue on CD because it included more songs by the Fab Four. This is one great sounding CD. Everyone involved in it from the musicians to the engineers deserve many kudos. To all those people who say that it is a terrible thing that the surviving Beatles are tampering with their music, hey get over it. On CD it only sounds better and it was already superior music so why not enhance it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent digital remaster of classic Beatles work","review":"After listening to Yellow Submarine, I was amazed at the clarity of tone that was brought to the listeners' ears. The current Beatles collections, although fantastic, can sound a bit muddy at times. This new release of Yellow Submarine literally sounds as if it were recorded in a high end digital studio of today. The surround sound panning that was incorporated by the new mixing team also made this an incredible listening experience. I'm a huge Beatles purist and I definitely don't view this project in a negative light. The new version allows fans to truly marvel how their recordings would have sounded if recorded with today's technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songtrack Companion To The Video","review":"Released simultaneously with the re-released video, this version does not have the George Martin instrumentals but is replaced with other Beatles songs that were on the film soundtrack. This CD times in at about 45 minutes and I fail to see why they still could not put George Martin's music on it. There is enough room. The remastered sound is a bit more full on the songs than on the first set of CD releases. The older songs and the title song in particular are the most improved. This is not an absolutely necessary purchase but I wasn't sorry, either. The question for Apple is, will they remaster other songs (Strawberry Fields, for example)? If so, who will do it? George Martin seems to be out of the loop. Will CD booklets finally be upgraded for other releases?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hear it again for the first time!","review":"30 plus years have passed since these songs first found their way into the hearts of Beatles fans everywhere, but they've never been heard like this before! It took the magic of a remix and remastering to show me just how far ahead of their time the Beatles were. Grab your headphones, crank the bass and listen to the genius that is spread from start to finish. Even if you heard these songs a thousand times before I guarantee you'll hear things you didnt know where there. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, Nowhere Man, Hey Bulldog, Baby Your A Rich Man and It's All Too Much are the stand outs on this CD, but the others are not far behind.. No throw aways here..Yup, a splendid time is guaranteed for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality for that should attract new fans!","review":"Excellent release from Apple/Capital. In this day of compilations and \\"remastered\\" cd's, it's a welcome CD. The Beatles' music holds up against some of the best pop of today. It's great to hear these songs with such clarity. Heard things I'd never heard before, the band sounds alive and the guitars especially sound great. I agree, Apple needs to remaster their whole catalog. A great CD for younger people looking for great pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness.....improved!","review":"The new \\"songtrack\\" to Yellow Submarine is an aural delight!

This simply is not the Yellow Submarine that the Beatles and George Martin intended for release. Yes, the sound is nice, and naturally the songs are Beatles so they are beautiful, but come on! Don't slap all kinds of material together and try to call it something else. It reminds me of the \\"Love Songs\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" lps from the mid seventies.

The Beatles aren't just musicians. They're producers, too. You can't just listen to songs they played on and say, \\"Yeah, that's a Beatle's Album.\\" I don't know if George Martin is dead, but he should dig a grave and roll around in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's gratitude for you.","review":"The three lesser Beatles have turned their benefactor's, adviser's, and musical conscience's soundtrack into another Beatles greatest-hits album. Stop and consider where they might be without George Martin. Oh, and just what we needed: another verse of the God-awful \\"It's All Too Much\\"--it was all too much already.Recommended: the original \\"Yellow Submarine\\" soundtrack and \\"Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist\\" by Jeff Burns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad remix","review":"The new remix of the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" tracks is horrible. For example, on the original \\"Yellow Submarine\\" track, Ringo's vocal is isolated on the left speaker, and the instruments are isolated on the right. But on this new disc, the vocals are on both the left and the right, and most of the instruments are on both speakers, creating an almost mono track.The same goes with \\"All You Need is Love.\\" The brass intro, \\"Marseilles,\\" (the French national anthem) is on the left and the piano chords under it are on the right. Once the song gets going, The Beatles' instrumentation is on the right and the orchestra instruments are on the left. But on this new album, it's really quite different. Once again, the new mix sounds mono.You're better off just to burn a copy of the original mixes of the songs, from various Beatles CDs you might have at home, than to buy this album. It's great music, but the remastering is less than good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far Better Than The Original!","review":"The original Yellow Submarine soundtrack was the worst album of the Beatles career. It forever tarnished their incredible discography. This newly produced soundtrack fully makes up for the original. The original wasn't horrible, (nothing the Beatles did was horrible), it just was average. It is their only average album. This new version is incredible. It is basically a greatest hits for 1966-1968. The Beatles are to good to make a complete greatest hits album without containing just about every song they did. This album does a great job of serving two purposes. It contains all the songs from the movie and does a great job of mixing them. It also acts as a perfect greatest hits for those few years. I think it is worth buying all the Beatles albums, but this one should also be bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listening Is Believing","review":"The remastering here is miraculous: just check out how much was missing from the original \\"Hey Bulldog.\\" This is a beautiful treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still love it, whatever color the sub is","review":"So many of the tracks,still in my head 40 years later.

We all love it, and we all sing along!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remix delivers mixed results","review":"Personally I'm not convinced by the new mixes. It's good to have a longer \\"It's All Too Much\\" but I'd have prefered the original mix and the same is true of all the other songs - the surround sound remixes are great for the cinema and/or video but on a stereo they mostly sound plain odd. Part of this is me being a purist - you CAN'T tamper with George Martin's productions for god's sake! But also, on many of the mixes it sounds like the guts have been ripped out of the songs (especially \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and \\"Baby You're A Rich Man\\") - the originals may be a little 'muddy' but sometimes all that compression adds a kind of fizz to the sound that painstaking hi-fi digital sound can't compete with. I think the songtrack's compilers should have issued 20 bit remasters of the original 60s mixes (there was a mix of the complete \\"Too Much\\" done at the time) because this CD just sounds, well, wrong. 5 stars for the music but just 2 for the CD itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very few improvements","review":"Only three tracks had any improvements. On \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" the waves go back and forth from one speaker to the other. On the original, the waves are mono.On \\"Baby You're a Rich Man,\\" the harmony vocals, \\"How does it feel to be...\\" are louder than on the MMT disc. It's easier to hear them.\\"Hey Bulldog\\" is louder and boomier, more \\"alive\\" sounding than on the first Yellow Submarine disc.Other than that, all the changes are horrible. So, it's hard to say whether you should buy it or not. Probably not."},{"rating":"1","title":"John, where are you when we need you most?","review":"I wish John Lennon was still alive to splash well-deserved vitriol all over the other three for this selfish, sell-out tampering with history. I, for one, WILL NOT BUY A REMASTERED BEATLES ALBUM. The three surviving Beatles are scraping the barrel of poor taste, and I'm not going to compensate for their financial mismanagement and lack of solo success (presumably, Paul is just doing this out of a pure sense of vengeance. He can now tamper with Lennon songs with complete impunity.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"If we ignore the aesthetic and moral attitude that would allow these songs to be remixed and the cheesy practical result, we still have to consider the song selection and arrangement. Here we have juxtaposed \\"All Together Now\\", the most pathetic piece of drivel the Beatles ever released while the Beatles were extant (there is worse on the \\"Anthology\\" collections), and the brilliant and heady \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\". I can't imagine what sort of insensitivity could allow one to immediately follow the other. Something is deeply wrong here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Beatles Hits, of course.....","review":"But this is not the actual, original \\"Yellow Submarine\\" album with the weird cool atmospheric music from the film. For that you have to buy the old soundtrack. Nevertheless, the tracks on this remastered disc are some of the Beatles' greatest ever. A worthy investment if only for that reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant, true stereophonic clarity","review":"the unbelievable sound quality and brilliant clarity of every track struck me immediately and all i can say is that i hope every other beatle album is re-released using this re-mastering technique. i felt as though i was in the studio as the tracks were being originally recorded. p.s...the artwork on the cd itself is the grooviest and most colorful.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid!","review":"It's all too easy to get blown away by this CD purely because it's The Beatles AND it's in state-of-the-art late 90s digital surround sound, BUT (a big but) this is tantamount to colouring in a Laurel and Hardy comedy. The remix initially sounds amazing and many punters will leave it at that and scream \\"It ROCKS!!!\\", but it's not what these records should sound like. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a meticulous high-quality REMASTERING, but REMIXING these tracks is ****ing heresy. They NEED what the original 1960s machinery, desks, effects etc... brought to the musical party. OK, '60s stereo panning was a joke, but these '90s mixes are OFFENSIVE. \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" sounds like it was recorded by having each Beatle overdub their parts one at a time, modern-style, the original sounded like a PAAARTY!!! Avoid! Avoid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but not essential (unless your a Beatlemaniac!)","review":"Being a Beatlemaniac, I really enjoyed hearing these vastly different sounding versions of the songs I know so well. I would have preferred a straight remastering job, but this cd is still quite entertaining. I don't feel these versions should replace the originals, but instead, for the advanced Beatle fan, they should serve as an interesting way to hear these songs in a fresh light. (It's kind of like having special access to the original master tapes - and getting control of the balance nobs on the control panel.) If you're just starting out with the Beatles, I would suggest their proper albums or their red and blue greatest hits cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album.... what next?","review":"Great remix and it makes an especially good sampler.Now there's only one thing left to do: release the long dormant \\"Get Back\\" album (which had, as I remember, finished Beatle versions of \\"Teddy Boy\\", \\"Junk\\" and \\"Save The Last Dance For Me\\"), remastered, with as many cuts from the Get Back sessions as possible. And put \\"Anthology\\" on DVD (expanded, of course, to 50 hours and in DTS sound)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it, sorta...","review":"This CD is the new version of the one constantly struck down as the Mops' worst, known for having only 7 Beatles songs total with only 4 actually new. This re-issue has 15 of their trippiest, remastered and remixed (including the 4 from the original.) Contrary to press releases, the music isn't really all that much trippier, they just sort of cleaned up the songs, and fixed some of the occassions when the mono sound produced an annoying \\"one side only\\" effect. If this sort of thing appeals to you, by all means buy it. Also, if you don't have the original \\"Submarine\\" now is the time to hear \\"Only a Northern Song\\" \\"All Together Now\\" \\"Hey Bulldog\\" and \\"It's All Too Much.\\" Other than that, don't waste your time if you already have the original. EVERYBODY needs to buy the amazing \\"complete\\" video though (I confess, I haven't seen it) enriched by the additions of the removed \\"Hey Bulldog\\" sequence."},{"rating":"2","title":"The better of the two soundtracks!","review":"It's true. You get more music from the BAND iteself. Martin's orchestral work on the original is good, but underwhelming. The remixes and remasters (done in 1998 at Abbey Road) represented here are outstanding. A far better value. \\"Rich Man\\" , \\"It's All Too Much\\", and \\"Nowhere Man\\" are sonic standouts. The music sounds clearer, richer, and renewed. Look -if you're a purist to the point of balking at the music being remixed or remastered, consider this; George Martin did just that in 1987 for most of the band's catalogue to issue it on CD. If you must have the orchestral tracks, then go with the original soundtrack. Most listeners would be better served to buy this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earwax? Tone deafness? Not gullible enough?","review":"Well, it must be one of the above three reasons which prevents me from endorsing this album. I had heard these songs literally thousands of times before I put this new album in the CD player. Call me a heretic, but these versions are somehow WORSE than the originals. I can't put forward a sound engineer's analysis of why this is so; it just is. The other reason is that this ill-conceived and even-worse-sequenced ragbag contains some the Beatles' weakest material - or strong material ripped out of context. Hey, do me the same favour that I'm going to do myself - when the inevitable deluge of remastered Beatles albums hits the shelves over the next few years in order to swell George and Ringo's dissipated fortunes - stick with your originals (preferably on vinyl.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Collection of hits , sadly missing the symphonic works","review":"One attraction of the original yellow submarine soundtrack was the wonderful music of George Martin, the \\"fifth Beatle\\". The other pop songs originally presented, such as 'Yellow Submarine', were not truly hit material. This CD has some nice songs, some powerful music, but is sadly lacking the original drawing feature of the original. To package it this way is deceptive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but Pathetic at the Same Time","review":"Without much doubt this is the crappiest of all the Beatles Albums(which all earned between 3 and 5 stars) basically because as you can see there is absolutely nothing new or original about it, it is like a greatest hits record rather then a full fledged album. Not one original song...kind of pathetic for the greatest band of all time isnt it? The songs are all good though...just nothing new.

But these mixes are awful on standard audio equipment. All the power and majesty of \\"It's All Too Much\\" has been obliterated. You're better off with the original recordings. Let's hope they fix the horror of the soundtrack that's on the DVD, and let's hope the new digital remixes of the entire Beatles' catalog sound more like the \\"Love\\" album than this tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the Beatles!","review":"The Beatles are a GREAT group...I've loved them for a long time.

This was one of the few times that Capitol EMI hit a home run with Beatle reissues and remains one of my all time favorite Beatle CDs.

The way the music sounds on the original recordings is how it was supposed to be heard, and anything different has simply been tampered with.

Harle almost never uses vibrato, plays outlandish cadenzas, and even skips entire phrases he doesn't want to play on some occasions. The expressiveness in his playing is almost non-existant, not to mention some technical problems, too. For example, at the end of the Glazounov concerto, instead of playing low C - middle C - altissimo C quarter notes, Harle starts on a low C and plays a *very* sloppy, uneven scale ascension to the altissimo C. His playing is generally pisspoor and his overall performance subpar. Try listening to interpretations by Eugene Rousseau, Dale Underwood, Donald Sinta, or other saxophonists. Just stay away from John Harle. FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD IN THIS WORLD, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING BY JOHN HARLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddy Sound","review":"Not a well recorded album.

This is a fine presentation of some pieces that are often more demanding on the orchestra than the saxophonist. However, there are some key reasons why I would not recommend this recording to anyone. #1 Balance--the saxophone is quite often drowned out or difficult to hear over the orchestra. #2 When you can hear the saxophone, the excessively live acoustics mask what is a rather brittle and weak tone. #3 Musical cuts, particularly in the Glazounov aren't neccessary or effective. #4 Though John Harle is a skilled saxophonist, this recording comes nowhere near the caliber--both musically and technically--that is demanded of modern concert saxophonists. If you must have a saxophone recording to add to your collection, I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Performances, Great Sound, Wonderful musicians","review":"I have no idea what the other reviewers aretrying to say, but I tell you one thing;considering the fact that the saxophoneis a hard instrument, Mr.Harle and theAcademy of St.Martin, do a wonderful job.The repertory is first rate, new,fresh music for a now often \\"invited\\"friend of the orchestra.

Waite interviewed Germans who were in Canadian and American prisons. Hoping to be released if they cooperated, they gave Waite what he wanted, fanciful tales that made Hitler sound like a absolute lunatic. The whole book is a farce and should be read as such. It's current popularity is due to the fact that it allows people to explain Hitler as a monster who was an anomaly that can never happen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it was only possible to give no stars . . .","review":"this book would be a candidate. Waite's book is one of the reasons that psychohistory remains, undeservedly, on the fringes of the academic community. No, I'm not an academic, so please don't think I'm looking down on Waite's effort from that perspective. But even the most cursory reading of the literature about Hitler makes clear that Waite has taken only the most sensational, and almost totally unreliable, information that he could dredge up, and then molded it into an \\"analysis\\" of Hitler designed to sell books. It is sad to see the selective use of materials to produce a book like this.

Waite should learn to stick to history.","review":"It is not my intention to denigrate the talents of the historian Dr. Waite, but he should have learned a long time ago to leave Psychoanalysis to the Freudians. His book on Adolf Hitler is an attempt to capitalize on the general odium that is the fate of Hitler in the modern world. Mr Waite would have done better to present his subject in the light of new material recently made available by interviews of victims and loyalists to Hitler. Instead the author chose to cast Hitler in the most amateurish fashion imaginable. Fiction , facts and fabulations are all thrown into this pot of Ragout, and all seasoned most profusely with Freudian lingo.

Mandy was very involved with other activities and a drug addiction still occurred. As an educator, I know the importance of parental involvement. Children want to know that their parents are \\"in-tuned\\" to what's going on in their world. They are interested even though they may not seem to be at the time.

It made me wonder if someone else wrote it, or if it was dashed off to meet a publication deadline. Its major weakness was the uni-dimensionality of the two major characters. They did not engage the reader as, for example, Carrie Wiggins and Tyler Wilkes did in Sweet Everlasting. Those two were fully developed characters who exhibited contentment,weaknessness,doubt,arrogance,satisfaction, fearfulness,joy, inner as well as outer strength,and struggles within their social contexts.

Charles Bronson is at his worst here delivering such an emotionless performance. How he ever became a star with this on his record is beyond me. How did these people keep a straight face while filming this waste of talent? The special effects hurt the film very badly, to.

It was a little expensive, but worth it over all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of the end for Spenser...","review":"Bad, bad, bad. Spenser goes pretentious and boring. After an interesting beginning, things (and the length of the book) spin out of control, as Spenser finds Susan again and makes up. Ever since, they've been gag-reflex inducing lovebirds... Still, the worst part of this book is the finale. Spenser becomes Bond, invades an underground base (all the while soul-searching himself endlessly), wraps things up before you know it and very unspectacularly, and goes out again. Pointless and ridiculous - and totally at odds with the attempts at greater profundity. Things were never the same after this... unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A catskill eagle","review":"This is a great book. It is very humorouse and well thought out. I give this book five stars. We could all learn something from reading this book. It gives great examples on how to break out of jail and properly act in wierd situations. I think this is a great book. It starts out slow then get faster paced and keeps you wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This was my second Spencer, and was nearly my last. It was one of the worst books I've ever read. My main problem was with the plot, which made absolutely no sense. The whole book was based around a situation that seemingly had no significance, I still don't understand what was Susan's actual problem. The book also lacked the characteristic Spenser humor, and Hawk was quickly getting tiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Spenser so far!","review":"I am an unabashed Parker/Spenser fan. I've read, no devoured, each and every Spenser novel. With that, I recommend A Catskill Eagle to you with my highest rating. It is action packed and scenery is always changing. It goes beyond the lives and backgrounds of Hawk, Spenser, and Susan to reveal the character of each. Robert Parker will really have work to ever beat this, but all Spenser fans are hoping, he'll put aside those other distractions and try.Mark Felderman, Emmetsburg, Iowa"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I've read about fifteen Spenser novels, enjoyed the series thoroughly, and this is the first one I've found disappointing. The story line is more unbelievable than the rest of the series, and Spenser is out of character when he murders a pimp just to get some working capital and hires on as an assassin to get out of trouble with the feds. Worst of all is the endlessly repetitive descriptions of his angst over Susan's affair (and a lot of similar angst from Susan), which read like something Woody Allen would have churned out. Other reviewers have praised this as showing his sensitive side, but to me it was mostly tiresome psychobabble. On the plus side, his smart mouth is still present, and the jailbreak sequence was right up to snuff. If you're reading the Spenser novels in chronological order you need this as a bridge to later (and better) ones, but otherwise it's expendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, as always","review":"Nothing extra special, but there doesn't need o be. Parker's books are like popcorn. Good, reliable, just what you expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Parker novel so far","review":"I don't understand how anyone could give this story a good review. Too much stuffing and not enough meat. This relationship with Susan is just ridiculous and has really soured my outlook on reading further in the series. Spenser has turned into a sappy, reflective, whimp who needs to be slapped."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beginning of the End","review":"This sprawling, widely improbable yarn is the demarcation point between the lean, muscular early Spenser novels and the later, weaker novels in the series. Spenser and Susan are separated, but when she finds herself in trouble, Spenser rushes to the rescue. At 384 pages, the novel dwarfs earlier entries in the series, but this is not the mark of ambition. It is diffuse and unfocused. Compare it to novels like Mortal Stakes and the flawed, but powerful, Promised Land - it suffers greatly. This novel is saved from one star by my familiarity with the characters and his abiding ability to invoke a fictional milieu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catskill Eagle - AUDIO VERSION read by, Michael Prichard","review":"I read the hard cover version of this book and loved it so much. The best ever of all in the Spenser series in my opinion. I bought the audio version (read by, Michael Prichard),thinking it would be great fun to listen to it. I was very disappointed. The book was read, but with no character, (no emotion). I would love to listen to this one again, if read by Joe Mantegna"},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of the end for the Spenser series","review":"This was the first book in the Spenser that indicated something weird was going to happen. Catskill Eagle signalled the beginning of the end for the Spenser series.

Parker suddenly tried to turn Spenser in James Bond, having him invade hidden underground bases and the like. The book makes no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well this was obvious","review":"I haven't read the book, but based on the reviews, I don't think I will.

I enjoyed it thoroughly.Part of the reason as to why I enjoyed it so much was that the tone of it was real. Now, those of you that have read this book or part of it have probably taken notice of the typographical errors in the book. Personally, I saw this as making the book better in that it it personalized the book a bit more. The first person voice wasn't entirely perfect, as no one's is (unless you're really bland). It gave the book a bit more of a human quality.All in all, I definitely recommend reading this book. It's very worthwhile. Kudos to Mr. Truong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Naisa","review":"A very kinetic story, with solid dialoge and scene structure and as crime dramas go this is up there with some of the best.

One drawback about Gardiner is that all his recordings are super expensive. Ostman would be a better bet. Now Decca has released all 4 Mozart operas (Zauberflote & the 3 Da Ponte operas) in a budget box set, I would get the budget box set from Decca, and then supplement it with one Gardiner, which isno longer competitive because the quality is the same but the price is more than double!!!!!

The SPF is a bonus. I havn't been using it long enough to ascertain whether it is improving the texture of my skin, to be honest, but wanted to share the news about it acting as a primer. Hopefully this will save you some cash vs. purchasing a separate primer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dramatically improved skin texture","review":"This is a great product! My skin was dry and peeling during the dry winter. It was also rough as I have had problems with acne and still have plenty of acne marks. After using this for a few months, my skin is dramatically smoother! Very soft to touch and I have gotten compliments that it is \\"glowing\\". I love the SPF--which is def a must for day cream and can help protect the dark acne marks. Marks are clearing as well. I am also using the Essential C night cream which probably has an added benefit. With daily use, this tube has lasted ~ 4 months-so definitely worth the money! Do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Murad","review":"This company makes cleansers that really make your skin glow and youthful.

If you are considering reading a Koontz novel this is a great one to start with. He will keep you in suspense with his masterful stoty telling. You won't put it down. You will be afraid of the bad place too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Koontz proves that he is the most talented writer out there","review":"I like Dean Koontz mopre than Stephen King. Why? Koontz simply has a better style of writing. Instead of trying to shock, like King does, Koontz has a whimsical, likable, unpretentious style - rarely a curse word. Yet his books are scary. The Bad Place is wonderful, one of the accomplished author's best, a tour-de-force with realistically drawn characters and believable dialogue. And while I was a little dissapointed by the revelation at the end, the climax was unmeasurably exciting. If you've never read a Koontz book before, this is a good one to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Is, Indeed","review":"We were bad. So Koontz put us in this place.This is one of several Koontz entries that reads wonderfully, right up until he gives us the explanation for what the cause of the inexplicable paranormal phenomenon is. He stretched real hard, for this one. On his better days, he may try credibility to the point of teetering, but here he just falls right off the edge. More than one of his books from this period does the same thing.On the plus side, the characters are quite well-developed and generally interesting, as they usually are with Koontz - Thomas Dakota, a Downs Syndrome sufferer, is especially appealing. The book's problem is ultimately just throwing reality out the window and going just a little too far into The Twilight Zone, a habit Koontz has fallen more frequently into in recent offerings.If the author's endings for Lightning, Dragon Tears or From the Corner of His Eye didn't bother you, you'll love this book. If any one of them put you off, this one will, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book was crazy (in a good way though)","review":"I thought that this book was great. not really scary but still good. This was the first book of his that i've ever read so i can't compare it to any of his other books. I recomend it to anyone that likes a good horror/sci-fi/mystery book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I miss the characters!","review":"This book was GREAT. I t was almost being part of the book observing the situation. All of the characters were cool, with their own personality, that made it hard to make anyone the bad guy. It's a non-stop roller coaster ride, then you are wondering how in the world is this going to work out. You laugh, you cry,and then you relate to each character as it unfolds. It was hard to put the book down. The bad place was \\"BAD\\" but the journey to the bad place is what you never forget. I give Frank Pollard props, he did become a hero. Thanks Koontz!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A WILD RIDE!","review":"There are so many positive things to say about \\"The Bad Place\\". It was thoroughly absorbing and suspenseful from beginning to end, never failing to entertain. As usual, Dean Koontz writes about the horrific and bizarre with an eloquent flair. I was really taken in by the character of Bobby. Everybody KNOWS a Bobby...and loves them! Some of the dialogue between Bobby and his wife was hilarious. (I can't remember ever laughing out loud while reading a Koontz novel until now) There is only one reason I didn't give \\"The Bad Place\\" a 5 star rating; I got the feeling that the last quarter of the story was rushed and possibly not as well thought out as the rest of the book. Even so, it was a great read and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad Place is a worse place than I thought","review":"THE BAD PLOACE wasn't exactly my favorite book. But see for yourself. Sorry, fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Idsappointed","review":"I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for a long time and have read most of his books, but I have to say I was so disappointed with The Bad Place. I didn't even finish it and that is not like me. If I start a book I usually try and finish it. Not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Me All Your Diamonds","review":"This was the best and most fast moving book I've ever read.Koontz takes you there.

I've read it five times (just finished the fifth time) and I'm still wanting some red diamonds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant story from Koontz.","review":"Koontz is always a welcome story teller at our house. This audio CD is a godsend for a long daily commute. The story is great Koontz fare. The voices of the readers mesh well with the story and characters. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely one of Dean Koontz' best.","review":"I own all of Dean Koontz' novels except for the latest one & I love them all, but I think this is his best. To write something so well that it actually draws you into the story as a participant takes real talent. I have lost myself in Mr. Koontz' stories on numerous occasions. No offense intended, Mr. Koontz, this is actually a complement, but it takes a mind that is right on the brink of being demented to write such wonderful stories. A reader can participate in your stories & to me, that's the mark of a great novelist. Thank you for so many hours of enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagination gone wild","review":"The Bad Place is the best book ever written by Koontz (in my opinion)...2nd place goes to Intensity.After reading this I was struck by the pure imagination required to come up with the premise.What kind of mind can think of this stuff??!!??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down...","review":"Another GREAT book by Koontz....this one will draw you in quick and not let you go. I did not get much sleep for 2 nights because of this book it is that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way off the mark","review":"We found this book long and hard to get through. There is a lot of graphic and pointless gore the main characters teleport all around but then the book tries to make them normal in most other respects. This was just too much of a stretch for our feeble minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Place - A Worse Read","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this, after hearing so many good things about it by friends who loved the author and the book -- and it was my first (and probably last) Koontz book. The story had the potential to be a good mystery -- solvable, good clues, etc. And I did end up enjoying the main characters. But the sci-fi part was awful - tacky and thin - and compromised what (with a different author) might have had hopes to be an interesting story. I felt as if I had wasted the time that it took to read this one - even though it was a rainy weekend with almost nothing else to compete!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad Book","review":"It pains me to write this about one of my favorite Authors, but this book was just plain bad. The plot dragged, and at points made no sense at all. I found this book painful to read. Unfortunately, I read this right after Relentless, which I also did not care for. Unbelievable characters, especially Candy. Too many undeveloped ideas and plot lines. I think I will take a break from Mr. Koontz for a while, and maybe re-read some of my favorite books that he wrote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche too much?","review":"I used to love Koontz' novels, despite his annoying inability to omit expressing his very narrow-minded views on Veitnam war and communism in every book. Suspence, plot and characters used to be great. But not so with this book. The main characters, a couple of PIs, seem like some comics characters - annoying and unbelievable. The villians are slightly better, but that's not saying much. The plot has been used by Koontz before in his other books. I could not get rid of this deja vu feeling through the whole book.All in all the book is readable, but quite disappointing, considering who the author is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book isn't worth the read. The first half the book really sucks you in - Koontz is an amazing writer, and he develops his characters to the point that you empathize with them and really are involved with the story. The last half the book, however, was a complete let-down. It was utterly predictable, with the only twist being the uber-sexual nature of why the villain became a villain. I was so excited to see what wonders Koontz would work in that last half his book, but actually had to force myself to read it. So again, don't even bother picking this one up unless you like \\"witnessing\\" violent murders of children, rampages of sexual mutants, and have too much time on your hands to boot - it's a great author who's run out of material, and so just threw a ridiculous plot together to flesh out what was (originally) a pretty decent idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but a little too Far Out for Me","review":"I gave this book 4 stars, but the truth is I really didn't enjoy it all that much. It's beautifully written and the plot is clever and holds together well. The problem for me is that I just don't enjoy the supernatural. I had previously read \\"Icebound\\" by Koontz and really liked it (nothing supernatural there). I then picked up \\"The Bad Place\\" assuming it was a mystery/thriller. The first few chapters blew me away - I just couldn't wait to understand what was going on with this strange character Frank: unexplained disappearances superimposed on long-term amnesia, showing up with gobs of money and priceless jewels, etc. But when it became obvious that the explanation was supernatural I just felt so deflated - again, just not my kind of book.For those of you who do enjoy the supernatural then I think this would be a great book. For anyone looking for a suspensful story without the supernatural stuff you might want to try my book, \\"The Other Part Of Me.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"it can't get much worse","review":"After reading this book I can honestly say never ever read it. NEVER, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT...it took me 3 days to read and when I was done I realized I could have done so many other things with my time. Koontz books are just not what they used to be.The characters are non existant, cookie cutter to the extreme in their personalities. The main evil villian and the...little brother are the exception. They both seem to be a little better than the rest of the characters. The plot is outlandish so far into the realm of impossibility you will just die from laughter. The reason the main antagonist does the things he doees is interesting to say the least.So avoid this book at all cost, its not even close to a good Koontz book (which I find rarer and rarer these days) or even a good book in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess","review":"I cannot believe that there are so many favorable reviews of this book. I have enjoyed many Dean Koontz books, but this is one does not fall in that category. There is enough going on in the plot for two or three books, but unfortunately the parts do not add up to a satisfactory whole. Koontz has so many other books to choose from -- don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't read Koontz for years because of this book","review":"I don't have much to say except that before the Bad Place I read all of his books and this made me litterly ill what with biting of heads of mice etc. Its been a long time and I am just now getting to the point where I might be willing to try him again. He is a good writer with interesting unusual plots but this was way to much gore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Place...A Worse Book","review":"This book was just plain bad. It dragged, had huge gaps, and was painful to read. I've read a couple other Koontz novels and they weren't as bad as this, but they too suffered from many problems .The 2 books, Tick tock, and Dragon tears were the exact same story with different characters! And yes, The Bad Place has basically the same story told yet again, and not well. The book actually got readable near the end, but by that point I already disliked it, a lot. The main offenders in this book were the two main characters, Bobby and Julie Dakota. They were simply annoying. The main character in Tick Tock was alot more believeable, but even then he pick up a sidekick (I forgot her name) who gets on your nerves inside of the first few words after she is introduced.

I read through this one in about 3 days and although it held my attention, the characters and the plot were very predictable. He always uses the same type of characters in his stories that are so perfect they couldn't possibly be believable. He also uses the same theme of pyscho related problems in which there is a fear involved that needs a hypnotist to solve. I'm just incredibly bored with his simplistic eighth grade writing and predictable themes. I'm sorry, Mr. Koontz, but neither of the books I read were worth raving about."},{"rating":"2","title":"This had to be one of the most bizarre of his that I've read","review":"This book was twisted.

There is not a mean bone in this movie's body. It loves the people in this town and does not condescend to them one bit.

It has a decent plot, a classic horror subject like ouiji boards, and the element of the unknown. If you loved Friday the thirteenth, you probobly won't enjoy this.

The movie creates some excitment by showing pictures of a large fiery demon only to wait until the end of the movie to find you don't see the demon, it possesses a man who burns people by malling them with his arms.

Try THE EAGLE HAS LANDED, SOLO, COLD HARBOUR, ANGEL OF DEATH and DRINK WITH THE DEVIL.The main problem with this particular, outside of it being too predictable , is simply that too much of the story is put into narrative form.

There are multiple clankers that litter this story. First, the W.W. I German air force was not called the Luftwaffe. Second, I seriously doubt a German baroness would be working in an Allied military hospital in 1917; she would be behind barbed wire in an internment camp. Third, the Finnish Air Force of 1940 was not equipped with the Focke Wulf 190. That aircraft did not appear in combat until considerably later. All of this distracted my attention from the plot, such as it is. I find Higgins's attempts to sanitize those who served the Gestapo and other Nazi units, such as the SS, distasteful and egregious. In short, I did not like this work on several levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flight of the Eagles - Jack Higgins","review":"A fantastic concoction as a plot for this novel by the master novelist.

I felt like the author wrote it over a weekend, between walking the dog and dining with friends. Don't get me wrong, there's something about WWII espionage-type books that pull me in, and I enjoyed sections of this one, but the shallow characters and unbelievable story (why, exactly, were all these generals and assorted bigshots always so eager to allow Harry Kelso into their cirle?) made me feel as though the author never really tried very hard.

A bit too melodramatic. Abit too easy to guess. I also wish Mr. Higgin would come up with something new and exciting: he can do that, he has done so to us readers before. How many letter signed by Hitler himself were there in that war? (The gimmick was exciting in the Eagle has landed, but to use this trick again in Night of the Fox and again in this book was a bit too much.) How many more islands in the Channel would Higgin propup again? The deception-upon-deception up to a point is boring. In The Eagle has landed German team impersonated as Polish soldiers, only to find out Mr. Churchill was also an imposter. In Night of the Fox somebody acted as Rommel and the hero impersonated as SS officer. In \\"Filght\\" - Impersonating again. Please ! Even the Name Kelso was recycled from Night of the Fox.

All the men in this one are tall, brave, noble, taciturn, multi-lingual, etc., which is par for the genre, but they also are made to follow a plotline which is preposterous. Most of the action takes place as a kind of respite from having dinners in famous hotels. When not drinking or eating in these well paneled watering holes, they go out to dispatch an enemy or two, each time picking up another medal as if it were a sort of tip. This goes on in a kind of repeating cycle, until, half way through, Higgins seemed to remember he needs a climax and recycles his Eagle Has Landed bit. The first time he did this schtick, it was good; this time it's just a way to get to the end. Shabby.

Not because it was so engrossing, but I was desparetly hoping that it would get better.Reasons abound for this poor review not the least of which is it's total predictability. The very end is seen comming by page 60 or sooner.The second reason for my discontent is that the two boys lives parallel each others so much that it is as if Mr. Higgins became tired and took a short cut by really only writing about one boy and then cloned the other.Next, why personalize the book by putting himself and his wife in the story?I am sure that Mr. Higgins will not let us down the next go around. He is capable of so much better as we have all seen in the past.

This, the latest in a long line of winners, offers us a small autobiographical peak (truth or not) and is as tightly plotted as any. The great thing about Higgins is that he offers us completely unbelievable plots, then makes us believe them.

Lincoln was a fascinating man, with a sense of humor and a strong will and an honest character who seems to have truly cared for others. None of this comes out in Adler's books. Not even listed as facts in his boring way. I gave the book one star because the artist shouldn't be punished for illustrating the wrong book. But the people in the pictures are barely identifiable.

That being said, several of the facts included in the book are inappropriate for early elementary-aged children. Slave auctions, Civil War, assassination, etc. Granted, these are significant aspects of Abe Lincoln's life, but there is no need to include passages like the one detailing Lincoln's assassination in a book geared towards 4-8 year olds. Additionally, the illustrations leave a lot to be desired. In several of the pictures, Lincoln looks like he's Chinese. You have perhaps the most iconic presidents and you can't even depict him in the correct manner. The assassination pages shows Booth pointing a pistol at the back of Lincoln's head. Seriously?

Now, that is almost forgivable since the film's got the single coolest human being on planet earth - Don Cheadle - as part of its cast. what is completely unforgivable is the fact that they've released the DVD of this already inestimably awful film with zero extras save for a single theatrical trailer - and you know they will RE-release the flick round Christmas time '05 with the cast interviews, behind the scenes footage, making of docs, commentaries, and etc. If you're going to buy / watch the film, at least wait till the special edition comes out, because this double dipping into the pocket of the consumer is heinous."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies Ive ever watched","review":"This is the laziest, half-hearted, take-the-studio's-money-and-run efforts that I have ever seen. The character development has been ignored, the story is shot all to hell by a script that is indicipherable, and I guess that you might be able to blame all of this films faults on the editing because the scenes jump around so much. But is it the editors fault? Or was he/she left with a pile of garbage reels and told to do the impossible and make something viewable out of this?If you think that I am being hard on this film, go ahead and watch it. Tell me what the heck is going on here and you will have my respect. Stupid, Stupid, Stupid. No wonder Hollywood ticket sales trakers wonder why less and less people go to the movies. After paying the admissions price to see this film it is natural to hesitate before seeing another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointment","review":"The film has a lot of good actors on the cast, but that does not really compensate for a poor plot.The whole movie looks like they originally shot 4 hour movie, and then squezed it into two hours. Result is a mess of pieces that just don't add up.It is generally fun for me to watch a creative criminal mind at work. However in this movie criminals have access to apparently unlimited resources, which makes it totally unnecessary for them to be creative. They just operate in a made up world, which is boring. Nothing in this movie makes any sense. The movie is completely unrealistic.In that context Watching REAL stories about REAL criminals on Discovery Channel (\\"Mastermid\\") is by far more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG MOVIE STARS.......... WHO CARES!!!!!","review":"Here's generally a rule of thumb I take in choosing a movie I want to go see......

This certainly holds true with Oceans 12."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of mega-star talent...","review":"Ocean's Eleven is a masterpiece and Ocean's Twelve is a faltering disappointment.Ocean's Twelve has a weak plot, bad writing, poor soft-focus photography, washed out colors, bad editing, weak direction and is a waste of mega-watt talent. It seems that the writers painted themselves into a corner and then decided to simply paint a door on the wall to escape a bad plot by using a non-existent technological solution that lacks imagination and is very disappointing. The film is generally incoherent with numerous time-sequence jumps that are difficult to follow.Ocean's ELEVEN is a keeper, Ocean's Twelve is not a film that you will want to watch again. Just rent the DVD and save some money.I watched \\"eleven\\" (again) and \\"twelve\\", back to back and the contrast between them is like day and night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Sucky Sequel","review":"How about this movie was pretty much to give this entire cast a ritzy vacation? I think they pretty much said to themselves, \\"Let's shoot this movie and take a vacation at the same time so that the studio will pay for it!\\" I found myself REPEATEDLY saying to myself \\"Wow, this movie is pointless\\" or just plain falling asleep! The movie Ocean's 11 was entertaining and had a moving plot and story line. This movie just rambles on about all the characters getting screwed by Benedict until the last 15 minutes when something exciting actually happens. This movie is just a testament to why you should leave good enough ALONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This movie was such a disappointment in so many ways. The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of the great cast. About mid-way through, it felt as though the plot was dragging. They had the potential to do something really good with it, but instead it just got convoluted and down-right hokey. That bit with Tess Ocean playing \\"Julia Roberts\\" was nauseating. If it was meant to be funny, it missed the mark. It almost seemed as if they re-wrote their original script to work in Roberts' real-life pregnancy. We should have seen more of Andy Garcia's character than we did. I agree with the other review that said the audience just gets \\"left out\\" of the action. Don't pay full price to see this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"The first movie was great! i loved it!

Where's the humor of Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac and the Mormon Twins? Locked up for half the movie!The story theme is great: Benedict knows who ripped him off, and the insurance payment isn't enough to soothe his wounded ego; he wants it back from the thieves. Another master thief issues a challenge to the team: steal a Faberge egg before I do, and I'll pay your debt for you. The director and screenwriters lose it from there, though, by separating everyone.Still, the movie has its moments, with Julia Roberts playing Tess playing Julia Roberts, and a witty cameo by Bruce Willis. The ending leaves an opening for Ocean's 13, and let's hope they get a bit better script next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Can I have my 2.5 hours back?","review":"What a disappointment! 11 wasn't Academy Award winning but at least it was entertaining.

Other than to make boatloads of money, I don't see the point of O12 even being made...several characters that were integral in O11 are now reduced to dead weight, the timelines are confusing and seemed to be put together \\"on the fly\\", the \\"plot\\" hardly gets off the ground, and the in-jokes border on being downright annoying.

Well this movie is like that. You are watching a insider joke for over 2 hours. Parts of it are cute, but the film is overlong and goes nowhere. The ending is so predictable it just wasn't as fun for me as the cast. The actors are walking through this mess like Barbie dolls, posing ever so pretty at the camera, then winking at it like they just told a joke. Silly! Just plain silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie made for a paycheck - weak, dumb and silly","review":"When a screen full of big names - many of them good actors - make a sequel this bad, they have to be doing it for the paycheck.

Real bad guys shoot people who rob them, don't they?The sub plot - the world's greatest thief thwarts them because his reputation as the world's greatest thief is damaged.

That's exactly how I felt when I entered \\"Ocean's 12\\" which despite it's awesome soundtrack (which earns it two stars) the film cannot escape it's feeling of: \\"LOOK AT US ALL, WE'RE ALL BEAUTIFULLY RICH MOVIE STARS AND WE LOVE IT AND WE DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THIS MOVIE, BECAUSE WE'RE ALL HAVING SO MUCH FUN BEING BEAUTIFUL AND RICH!!!\\" I honestly forgot the plot several times throughout the movie just hoping that one of the \\"stars\\" would wipe the smug little smirk of their faces...and Zeta-Jones, the queen of smug smirk...don't get me started."},{"rating":"1","title":"All talk, no walk!","review":"Let's cut to the chase.

Problem was, I kept thinking that throughout half the movie, then I turned to the person I was sitting with and said, \\"This movie is boring.\\" She agreed. The movie was boring cause you kept expecting a big trick as was in Oceans 11, but all you get was a plot to fool one guy to win a bet to pay off their debts. You find out that the bet was won at the beginning of the movie, but then they did this massive plot to fool the guy, and you think, \\"huh?\\" As others have stated, wait for it to come up on cable/satellite.

I thought it was fun and very smart. How silly of me to assume a sequel would be the same. I have never fallen asleep in a movie, but I came very close in this one. I don't remember cracking a smile and the story just seemed to drag along.

It was interesting to see the various parts of Europe included in the script. The story was a total failure, however. It was overly long long and confusing. Boring is a good word that comes to mind.

The majority of the cast was on-screen for mere minutes while Damon, Pitt, and Clooney (even Zeta-Jones) ran the show. The plot was so thick with \\"twists\\" and devices that the film quickly became hard to watch and quite boring. The film drags in more than a few places and many of the scenes seem out of place.

We were successfully liberated of $10.Ocean's Eleven carries the distinction of being one of few remakes to easily outshine the original. With tremendous chemistry, a good plot-line and excellent direction Eleven can be watched over and over.With this pedigree, I had high hopes for Twelve. Unfortunately, Twelve falls flat on all accounts. There is no longer a TEAM of con-men, just many individuals who can't even stay together for the whole movie. The story is feeble, and when all the answers are revealed you're left asking \\"Huh?\\" While some people found the Hollywood inside jokes entertaining, I felt they were unnecessary and distracting.Overall, a grave disappointment.

Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Roberts will just wander around Amsterdam until a plot gels somehow.\\"And the deus-ex-machina ending was so bad I couldn't believe the actors and writers ever agreed to it.

Some of the actors looked liked they phoned in their lines and I can't think of a decent thing to say about this horrid waste of celluloid! If you haven't seen it yet, a fairly good brief synopsis of Ocean's 12 is that it's a movie about a bunch of guys hanging out together and pretty much doing nada! The shots of the gang in jail nearly put me to sleep both times I watched it. As for the ending, HUH? It's convoluted, discombobulated and confusing. In other words, It stinks!

This movie is nothing like that. Other than the cast and the word \\"Ocean\\", the two movies have nothing in common.Ocean's Twelve is every bad sequel you ever saw, rolled into one. The basic problem is that there isn't really much of a plot, nothing is ever explained, and it's all just a vague bunch of nonsense. The camera work is annoyingly and gratuitously artsy at entirely inappropriate moments, and the whole thing feels like an overly long TV sitcom.This is a bad screenplay, badly directed and poorly filmed.

The problem here, with 12, is that it suffers from character development drift: characters in 11 that were amusing and interesting, then develop themselves in 12 until they are smarmy, cutesy, boring, and worse. Matt Damon's character becomes even more milquetoast like. Clooney's character becomes even stupider in love with Roberts' character, who becomes even more entitled. It's really maddening. Finally the viewer throws in the towel, as what some body may have called the \\"plot\\" goes on and on and on and on.

Instead they showcase an unknown French actor (is he really French?) who does a dance routine which includes some break dancing, to elude a museum's laser security system. Like that hasn't been done before. I bet Catherine Zeta Jones gave him some pointers from her scene in \\"Entrapment\\".

Lots of talent in the cast, with the exception of Brad Pitt of course, who continues to embarrass himself, and us, with his impersonation of an actor. Having so much recognizable talent on screen is very distracting from the story, which is unfortunate, since there is no story worthy of the name. The script, if one may use such a lofty term to describe it, is simply wretched - some scenes contain dialog that is truly cringe-worthy. The producers of this bloated catastrophe have attempted to cover its sheer vacuousness with lavish production value, lots of dressy location photography in swish European hot spots, and Hollywood \\"in jokes\\" like Julia Roberts doing a bad impression of Julia Roberts - which when you think about it - is all she ever does.

There is also a really preposterous scene with Julia Roberts character playing Julia Roberts...maybe one of the dumbest things I've ever scene in a film. George Clooney and Brad Pitt walk through this movie acting like they're the coolest hippest dudes on planet earth, sorry chaps but the jokes on you, Matt Damon seems cooler than you two arrogant chumps put together.

While it tried to sell itself on fast-paced, flashy excitement, in the beginning - it hit all the wrong notes and went stale quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"Very dissapointing. I thought Ocean 11 was marginl and 12 drops a rung or two on the lader of enjoyment. I thought the film was choppy and too far fetched to even let me escape reality in a theatre.

Not because I had been expecting some kind of cinematic masterpiece, but because I had hoped it would've been a semi-decent sequel. Alas, to my profound dismay I watched a boring, cheaply done, clich��-ridden, disjointed, self-serving spectacle. Self - serving, because of many inside jokes that must be very entertaining for the actors but are barely amusing for the $10-per-ticket paying public. I made a mistake watching this \\"action\\" (there was no action) flick, but you shouldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting to see a witty film involving a well-planned heist. Instead I was totally confused. I kept asking my wife \\"that doesn't make sense\\" or \\"what are they up to\\". I had no idea what half the cast was up to. Why did they put the little guy in the duffle bag? What do they plan on doing with that egg? They could never sell it. The Night Fox wiggling through the lasers was a laugh. I rarely watch a movie for the stars, and they sure weren't a plus in this movie. There were a few nice location shots and not much else. I really enjoyed Ocean's Eleven , but this movie was just a mish-mash of through together scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"An arrogant waste of time","review":"I liked Ocean's Eleven but this movie was just ridiculous. Someone seemed to think that if you get enough big celebrities in one place and try to make it \\"stylish\\" you'll have a good film. Unfortunately, the plot, dialogue, and even the internal logic of the plot is just poorly done. The clever banter isn't clever. The plot is slow and dull. And without giving too much away (although you really should pass on this movie!) there is a plot twist involving the Julia Roberts character that is so ridiculous as to be arrogant. Overall, a terrible film and a terrible waste of everybody's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One small performance","review":"I just bought this for the performance of Vincent Cassel, my imaginary celebrity boyfriend, after seeing him in Brotherhood of the Wolf. This movie was an awful letdown after the charm and breeziness of the first. What happened here? Who cared? Was there even a plot?

The cast looks like they had a great time, but that was it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightning Doesn't Strike Twice","review":"\\"Ocean's Eleven\\" (2001) was great fun and a decided improvement over the Rat Rack's glorified 1960 home movie.

The film is highly engaging and every member of the cast is at their best (even if they don't have much of a part). The plot, however, is a bit muddled and doesn't really make sense until the very end. There are a few funny twists and turns, but Ocean's Twelve just doesn't live up to its predecessor. Though a disappointment as a sequel, I still highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It IS possible to be too eccentric","review":"Picture this, sitting in the front row seat in a theatre at 11:00 pm watching a moving where the first 15 minutes are literally the camera man ferociously shaking. Even though others may not of had the same experience as I did, no one will deny the mediocrity of this film. Here is a message to all movie directors and reviewers: It is possible to be too eccentric. Just like everyone else I found the first movie great, so much that I actually put it on my \\"favorite movies of all time\\" list. The problem with Ocean's 12 does not solely lie in its copious eccentrics, but also with its weak storyline and inadequate ending. I do applaud the makers of this movie for successfully getting all of the main characters back and a few new stars. I can't recommend that anyone buy this DVD, but if you found this movie in a garage sale with a price tag of $2.50, what the hell, take it."},{"rating":"1","title":"use your time to colour code your underwear drawer instead","review":"ocean's 11 was brilliant, which made me expect a similar standard from its sequel. But what I was presented with instead, was an overrated, over long,over dragged, boring film with such an unnecessary number of twists, that it was obvious the writer had placed them in the film assuming he could confuse critics 2 the point where they believed it 2 be a good film. Performances from all actors are not anything extroadinary either(though not bad) and I was shocked at how the big named cast could actually let this film go on for release, after viewing the finished project. Bottom line is- almost evryone I know who watched this sorry excuse for a sequel, fell asleep at some point during their torturous viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Before this movie came out, I was really excited to see it. I loved Ocean's Eleven because it was a cool, slick movie that was really fun to watch. I didn't feel that way about this sequel. I found that it was too hard to follow and didn't flow as easily as the first installment. The plot wasn't great, I didn't see why they had to pay him back in the first place; why didn't they just trick/decieve/evade him just like they did in the first one? There was way too much emphasis on paying Benedict back. In addition, there was no main heist as in the first one, so I found myself scratching my head as to what they were doing and why. The ending was really twisty, as well as total bull, but I'm not gonna spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it. All in all, it lacked a lot of the smoothness that the first one had. The characters seemed very generic, and didn't have the personalities they had in the first movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"should be retitled \\"Zeta-Jones's Twelve\\"","review":"The plot was slightly more serious in this film, and it was dominated by Pitt and Zeta-Jones (mostly Zeta-Jones). The main drawbacks for the sequel are that the heist is not the major focus, the \\"supporting\\" characters did not get the opportunity to play pivotal roles in the heist, and it lacked the lighthearted atmosphere and stylishness of the first film. While Catherine Zeta-Jones is a very lovely woman, I felt that her plot was dull, interesting and terribly predictable, and I despised her character as the foil. The sub-plot (the heist) and the other characters deserved more screen time because that is what made me love the first movie. Can't really say much more about the movie because it was utterly forgettable and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Ok, this movie is really boring. Really it was.

Mr. Benedict has promised the provider of the information to show restraint and give the clan two weeks to repay him with interest to the tune of over $190 million. Without a job that can provide that kind of pay off, the gang must accept the challenge of premier thief Francois Toulour to see who can steal a famous work of art first and claim the title of greatest thief ever.

The smarmy credit at the end that slyly states \\"And introducing Tess as Julia Roberts...\\" is about as sickening as it gets. By the way, Roberts looks like a starved, domestic violence victim, grim and bony.Soderbergh is like a parody of a Hollywood sell-out these days. I wish Brad Pitt would take a long, long break.

Julia Roberts looked horrible as Tess and should have sat this one out. Catherine Zeta-Jones looked gorgeous, but was too mature to play the love interest to Brad Pitt's Rusty character, and it was too hard to believe she'd throw away an entire life of crime-fighting to throw in with the thieves.

But being soaked with actors' love of themselves and disregard for the character they are supposed to embody, it is painful to look at.

The album as a whole is well paced, alternating the grand, the meditative and the purely instumental with intelligence and sensitivity. And the singing is always enthusiastic and downright rapturous!For me, this is also McCreesh's best album because it is not a reconstruction. I have heard several of these discs, and the reconstructions of Mass or vesper services might be interesting to listen to once, or maybe even twice if you have never been ot a genuine Catholic service of this sort. But frankly, liturgies, and liturgical chants are not entertainment, and generally are purely functional rather than entertaining.

Some of the cinematograqphy is really quite good and, speaking as an Alaskan, very typical of the area. It would have been even more interesting from a nostalgia point of view were ther more scenes around Juneau itself. The preconceptions of the time about Alaskans, Russians, playboys, and lone wolf genius scientists are quite amusing. Denver Pyle is the only immediately recognizable actor although two other supporting actors are very good and worked almost constantly during the period.

Good first attempt, but not ready for prime time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gagh it ain't...","review":"This book has it's entertaining moments - mostly, they're confined to the 1st and 2nd chapter, where B'Elanna has to endure the Day of Honor good wishes of her colleagues.What disappoints about this book is how poor the characterisations are - they feel off. Janeway definitely comes across as a bit inept and rather silly, Tom Paris comes in at the start and end (this is pre their relationship days I guess) although B'Elanna is about 60% there in terms of her portrayal. What's missing is the spark, that extra juice that makes Torres such a cool character.The plot is okay only and the Day of Honour feels more like a calender coincidence than a real plot driver or revealing of any true character. B'Elanna's discomfort about Day of Honour is confined to how her previous DOH seem to have been like bad luck days for her.For a better effort at B'Elanna having a bad day, the Voyager Episode 'Juggernaut' works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Klingon Soul? P-lease!","review":"No, this is *not* the character piece on B'Elanna that it claims to be. It's just another plot-driven story of \\"Voyager crew in jeopardy, let's find a way to save them at the last possible second.\\" I would have found it more compelling if Torres's alien acquaintance from the planet (sorry, forgot his name) would have actually--gasp--*died*! But in the world of Star Trek, we can't have that. Oh well--we could have seen B'Elanna's reaction to his death \\"as a warrior\\"... and maybe even some real insight into her Klingon soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Colleen McCullough's books.","review":"I have several of her books and she is a terrific writer. Love reading about Caesar and the times he lived in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start... but worth it!","review":"I had a hard time getting into it at first. I kept on picking it up and putting it down and picking it up again. But I've liked the Masters of Rome series so very much up to this point that I just persevered. Then at about 130 pages or so, the story picked up I couldn't put it down! Filled with political manipulations and intriguing characters, McCullough handles it all with such ease, such familiarity after so many years of writing that I feel she is literally living and breathing these characters and their politics at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Rome in the making","review":"Collen has been again superb bringing back historical heros of the ancient Rome . Caesar, Brutus, Pompeius, Cicero, and Cato are vivid and fresh. Their historical importance is emphasized through everyday actions. They are only humans but you know they are destined to create true history. Despite the fact that the book is thick and heavy, you don't want to put it on the shelf until is completely finished. The entire series (Masters of Rome) is worthy of dilligent reading and I cannot wait to get my hand on the next installment. If you never spent time studying ancient history, don't worry, you will find \\"Caesar\\" so refreshing that you will long for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An oustanding read!","review":"I have read all of the 'Masters of Rome' series and I have to say this is the crown jewel of the series. Ms. McCollough's writing only gets better through each book. If you are a fan of history you will love this book or any other in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid and dynamic","review":"I must day that McCullough's series is a continuing thrill to read. She has made Rome come alive with all its splendor and righteousness (the boni). Pompey the Great is painted in such a way that one understands his goals, while Caesar gets stronger and stronger. Marcus Antony is also seen as a central supporting character here, and Octavius gets his introduction. Egypt comes alive with all her Nile inundation problems, the Ptolemies are explained, Alexandria bustles with life. Can't wait for the next one, and, at the very least, this has whetted my appetite for some serious Latin studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"learn while you read!","review":"I am a fervent reader of historical fiction, and this is definitely a book I praise - it's rare that you get such a thorough and accurate novel on Caesar - and interesting, too! McCullough brings not only Caesar to life, but Magnus Pompeius, Marcus Cato, Marcus Brutus, Calpurnia, Marc Antony, and others. I don't believe there's a part that she missed! Be fascinated, and learn, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Caesar: A Novel (Masters of Rome series)","review":"This series has been a superb read; from The First Man in Rome to this book. I have re-read them all several times, and found new aspects each time. Ms. Mcollough's Caesar character rings true. He was a peerless man who found himself hated andalienated by his contemporaries. Because he had the ability to overwhelm the status quo, the context of his times required that he do so. Had he lived, would the Republic have been restored? SEE: I Claudius by Robert Graves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let the praise fly!","review":"The fifth and latest book in the series is a winner, covering the last years of the Gallic campaign and the civil war through the death of Pompey the Great. McCullough brings the characters and the settings of Republican Rome to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more!!!","review":"It is indeed possible to bite one's fingernails while reading. This book has been my little reward to myself after the kids are in bed, and I find that I am awake turning pages well into the night. Yes, I've studied history, and yes, I know what happens, but McCullough manages to maintain suspense. If there isn't some producer out there looking into the movie rights, there is no intelligence in Hollywood. Can't wait until the next one in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY","review":"I finally have it in hand. Foundit a little drier than the previous \\"Caesars Women\\" and wish that we could have stayed with those fierce Gauls longer.All in all not her best one, but a welcome one and I can't wait until the next one. Pompeys fall and Cleopatra, what more could you want for our fave Roman Dictator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as earlier books in the series.","review":"The first four books in McCullough's series of novels about first century BC Rome were highly enjoyable, but this one disappoints. There is too much summarizing and too little characterization. As someone familiar with the history of the period, I became bored at times by all the background information that was simply narrated rather than being worked into the plot of the novel. The quality of the writing was also inferior to that found in some of Ms. McCullough's earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it weren't for Margaret George....","review":"Laden with historical information and obsessions of one Marcus Antonius's. The only interest that this book held for me was to give further historical insight into the world which Margaret George brought to life in 'The Memoirs of Cleopatra'.I think that the book suffered from over extension.. i.e. there was just too much information about too many people being crammed into an average sized novel. The book could have just as aptly been titled Pompey the Great...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Roman Epic","review":"I started this book not knowing that Colleen McCullough had written others before it. I was a little lost and I even studied Classical history and Latin in college. If you don't know much about this time period I suggest you read a short bio of Caesar's life. It will probably keep you from getting too confused. But remember this no reflection on the fabulous writing, it is in the nature of writing about ancient Rome where it seems every one had the same name.I found this novel very engrossing. It was very long and felt it, but there wasn't a part of the book that I didn't enjoy reading. I will gladly read more in the series. This segment of the story follows Caesar from the death of his daughter and the occupation of Britian to just before his rise to Imperator. The conquest of Gaul is fascinating. Colleen McCullough opens a window into the mind of a genius.Overall a very good read. One I would recommend to anyone who likes studying the ancient world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite fascinating...","review":"By some miracle of odd timing, I was reading Caesar's Commentaries (both Gaul and Bello Civili) just a week or so before I picked up this book.How charming! The Commentaries are fascinating in a dry, measured way. This book made the material alive and beautifully captures the world that was Rome. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money!!!","review":"Bought this thinking that I would learn something about this author.

There are arbitrary tempo choices and fluctuations that seem to make no musical sense, and give little respect to the score. The slow movement, and certain lyrical parts of the first movement are so heavy handed that the momentum simply gets \\"stuck in the mud!\\" It seems as though the musical ideas are intellectually conceived and not felt emotionally, as if to say, \\"let's play this passage really slow, because no one else has played it that way before.\\" In my view, that's boring music making at its worse! No comment on the Bartok (which, contrary to layman's opinions that are based on a recent movie, is a far more difficult work technically), as it isn't strong enough to recommend buying the recording. However, it's a slightly stronger performance than the Rachmaninoff.

There obviously wasn't that much effort put into this track, and that's a shame. Call this a missed opportunity.The remainder of the extras are marginally interesting, but unless you're a die-hard, must-have-everything kind of fan, you can pass on this without fear of missing something great.Instead, take that money and buy \\"Greg the Bunny\\" on DVD.

MacFarlane provides colorful commentaries on each episode (and even provides one as both Brian and Stewie on Road ro Rhode Island which is worth the price of admission alone), and there are other assorted extras as well, including previews of the new Family Guy and American Dad. In the end, whether this is worth purchasing is up to the viewer. If you don't already own the best-selling season sets and are just a casual fan, this is worth picking up, but if you do own each season, there is no point in picking this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda a best of set","review":"Only 5 episodes.

If you like a good story, a little goriness, a lot of suspense and enjoy folklore I would recommend this book and, indeed, all of his books. One or two of his books have taken a while to grab me but by the end of every one I have been sad to reach the end of a really good read.Rickman should not be regarded simply as a horror writer - he crosses genre - crime/suspense/etc - and has a wonderful knack of creating characters full of wry humour and human failings.

The story is cohesive and teases on the paranormal rather than completely turning itself over to the horror genre.WARNING! Phil Rickman is a REAL writer. To enjoy his books you must be capable of paying attention and processing information.

The instant passion between Jake and Rebecca is also tried and true, but please...has anyone ever really undressed partially or wholly to have a secxual encounter in the snow?

Preludes are played beautifully with his usual fluency, but it sounds rahter prosaic. As for sonatas and late works, he completely fails to capture the sense of mystery, etherial beauty and spirit of the music.If you are after Scriabin played with real depth and spiritual force, you must listen to Sofronitsky, Richter and Horowitz.

Let's see, there is the self-involved Jane Loften who is struggling to keep a promise to God that she made in desperation; David Loften, her husband and prolific adulterer; Brynn Lofton, the self-involved daughter...who reverently spews and believes the unsolicited opinions a therapist makes about her family,as if they are words from God. I could go on and on. The only redeeming character is Chester, a wordly rescuer. Well, I have to be honest; I don't know if he is the only redeeming character...I couldn't make it through half the book to find anymore.I feel I am Doing Good, because I spent my money on a paperback and not a hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"the rating is relative to her former books","review":"I put Pamela Morsi in the unreadable category 3 or 4 books ago, after loving her first turn-of-the-20th-century romantic comedies. Imagine my surprise when I gave her contemporary non-romance a try. The read was pleasant, sometimes amusing, never dynamic, got extremely light weight toward the end. But, if you're looking for something to read while you're waiting for the oil to get changed, here's your book. Not deathless prose, but so much better than her most recent efforts. And the ending might have been Morsi's shot at what I'm told is the new trend in the romance genre, toward real life stories that don't rely on the happy ever after perfect couple solution. I will buy and read Finding Wisdom when it comes out. (If you want a self help book, this is not it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"I bought this book back when it first came out, hoping for a well written dissection of the nineties music scene.

A God who lives with an idiot girl and does anyone to find him in a world where the mutations run wild after WWIII.The good: sulky automatic car repair robots, concept, relations between the characters, and moments of beauty among the dystopia.The bad: Zelazny and Dick like talking to each other more than they like talking to us. I generally really enjoy Dick's digressions on religion, but this was a bit more bewildering and harder to read than usual.Still, a must-read for Dick fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what is pictured!","review":"I ordered this because the picture showed the dice cups to be a soft oval shape that I could store easily and they wouldn't hurt my table by all the turning of the cups.

Also one of the dice was missing which I cannot find as they are of a very small size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews first!","review":"I was lazy and didn't read the reviews first. Shame on me! You get what you pay for here. The shakers are small and the dice much smaller than standard dice. The shakers do seem quite fragile as I expected a softer cup, more like a faux leather. I will make this a Secret Santa gift and simply buy 4 regular dice cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Uncreative Gameply","review":"Liar's Dice is a pretty straightforward game. Each player rolls a set of dice, conceals his or her roll from the others, and makes a bid as to outcome of the total roll. Each subsequent bid has to be higher than the previous; or, alternatively, a player can challenge another's bid. If a person's bid is challenged and proven false, he or she loses a die. The goal of the game is to be the last person to lose all your dice.The rules make for a frustrating and unsatisfactory game in which the player doesn't really feel in control of what is happening. If you do the math, counting the dice total and the probability of any particular face appearing, you realize that it's not very hard to figure out whether a person is lying or not. But since each player can only bid up or challenge another's bid, gameplay becomes a fairly mundane and uncreative task of knowing when a person's bid is mathematically unlikely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"poor quality.... the paper labels on the dice cups were falling off when I unpacked it.

First the shakers look like something a 6 year old made in art class. They look more like a clay change holder then a dice shaker. where as the picture look to me like standard 3 inch oval shakers. Then their are dice themselves they are so small that the 6 side is almost completely blacked out with dots. The only cool thing about this game is the giant Dice carrying case thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Drinking Game","review":"We used to play a similiar drinking game in college. The object is to bluff the person to your side about what combination of dice you rolled. If they call you out and they are wrong, they would drink and if you were caught lying then you would drink. This is a cleaned up, family version of that game. The game is fun and exciting and this set is so attractive you can actually leave it out on display. All of the components fit in the large, wooden dice box, which is handy since dice are easy to misplace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fun!","review":"This is a great game!!! So much fun for the whole family. We even had a 7 year old playing, and with just a little help, he did great! New family favorite!!

I looked for it in local stores, but they either didn't carry it or were out of stock, good thing because it was $20 there! It might be worth even $20 though, we played it quite a few times during the holidays!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The classic game is fine, but this particular package is poorly built.","review":"This is the classic game of liars dice. The package includes a die-like box with different sized throwing cups and dice. There is not much too it. The cups cascade to make them easily storable inside the box, but the smallest cup is almost too small. The stickers shown on the outside of the cups peel off almost instantaneously.Overall, the build quality of everything inside the box is low. Initially, the box is a cute addition to a game shelf, but it ends up just taking up a lot of space.If you want this game, just get dice anda few cups. Don't bother with paying for the fancy box."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tale of Two Children","review":"This is a dreadful little book about the downslide of a great artist and the parasite who attached herself to him like a barnacle. Ruth Kligman has never shown even an ounce of talent for anything on her own, and continues to try to live off the carcass of an artist who, by the time she met him, was on the dark side of a distinguished career. What possible motive could there be for a book that portrays the Big Dripper as a big drip? How could she evince so little feeling for the friend she lost in the tragic accident that claimed Pollock's life? What could this possibly do for his legacy but harm it, as it portrays him as a drunken, self-absorbed infant given to weeping fits and artistic impotence? Kligman gives new meaning to the phrase \\"with friends like these\\"--regarding both her dead friend and Pollock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traitorous Art Tart's Account of a Falling Star","review":"Ruth Kligman's account of her \\"love affair\\" is tacky, self-serving and poorly written.

The majority of the book was devoted to trying to convince the reader how important she was/is to the Pollock legend.

It is my fault however; the title should have been my clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the Narcissist Codependant met the Bipolar Alcoholic...","review":"This book should definitely be used as a fine example of relationship pathology.

Communication was awful, no apology, and as of writing this review (two weeks later), the listing STILL has not been corrected.I've been a long-time fan of TwinLab's products, as well as Amazon's customer service. It was quite disappointing how I was given the run-around by both parties and made to feel like I was inconveniencing THEM. Although the product is of good quality (e.g. D-alpha-tocopherol for Vit.E), the communication and whole experience with both Amazon and TwinLab left such a sour taste in my mouth, I can't give more than 2 stars until this listing is \\"fixed\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT ENTER!!","review":"If you enjoy seizures then this movie is right for you. It starts out a little interesting but the plot and entire movie sequence doesn't make sense.

BIG MISTAKE!! The movie was painfully slow and boring --and that was WITH all the nudity! How in the world does a director shoot video of nude beautiful women and totally bore you to death at the same time?!? The only way I can see anyone liking this is if they are stoned out of their mind as they watch all the flouresent neon colors splashed all throughout this film.Don't fall for the \\"glowing\\" marketing hype on this amateurish and dumb dumb film!

The cover looks amazing and I thought it would be a nice movie, but no action, no comedy, no horror, no suspence.....whats left? Well Drama ofcourse and its not like \\"Bad Girls Club\\" drama, just a plot to tie the whole thing together, but I don't like it and am glad I found it online instead of paying for it which I almost did. Perfect example of not judging a book (or movie in this case) by its cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excercise in futility","review":"As another reviewer so succintly stated the opening 2 minutes are a mesmorizing,rollercoster of visual and sonic brain candy. Sadly it's all downhill shortly after that. A relatively strange yet simple plot is led out over roughly 30 minutes. Thereafter the various permutations,digressions and repetition of the theme drag on for what seems like an eternity (2 hours)The pace of the film is excruciatingly slow and the ending is a merciless act that frees the poor viewer to try and collect his or her senses from the oppressive visual pounding that constitutes this film.

When at the begining you live the junkie trip of the main character! The colors, the rythm of the scene... the vision of a soul floating in the air! If you are epileptic... try to avoid the generic!

Soon after, his spirit leaves his body in a hallucinatory odyssey that merges his past, present, and future into a chaotic whole.This riveting third film from French filmmaker Gasper Noe is a must see. If you like movies by David Cronenberg, you will probably like this film. It is shot in a non-linear way (jumping back and forth between past, present, and future). Also much of it is shot above the heads of the actors (because the main character's spirit is floating above them). Or it might be shot behind the main character's head (in past flash-back scenes).the main theme deals with \\"what happens to a person when they die\\", and this film explores those possibilities. Deifinitely mind-expanding to watch. The movie is 2 1/2 hours long, so you have to be patient as the plot plays out slowly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Noe film","review":"Gaspar Noe is one of the best foreign filmmakers of the 21st century.

It is a definite one of a kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't enter the void","review":"Honestly, I couldn't watch this. The Buddhist theme is what attracted me, but the raw, home-movie type video along with a muffled sound track that made hearing the dialog difficult was a huge turn off.

They were OK to follow with a few parts hard to follow. I purchased this from two seperate sellers and the tire carrier doesn't seem to fit correct however it does serve it's purpose. You will have to drill a hole for the tire to go onto the carrier so be ready to buy a good drill bit. Actually, I have used it several times since on other things so it's all good. The latch was very challenging to get figured out because of wacky directions. It seems to fit very snug; to where I have to lift up and kick it in to get it to latch.I am very happy with my product purchase and will be doing more mods later.

Thunder's adventures revolve around his meeting of a foreigner, then his life in a \\"gompa\\" or monastery, after he has been banished there for meeting the foreigner. Also involved is an ancient (real life) prophecy implying that when foreigners invade Tibet, Tibetans will be \\"scattered like ants\\" around the earth. Sadly, that's happening to Tibetans today, prompting my interest in Tibet.Lots of complex ideas are subtly introduced, such as the Buddhist concepts of karma and reincarnation. We even meet a yong \\"Tulku\\"--a child being raised to become a high lama. All in all, the book offers adventure for the kids, and easy access to a vision of Tibet for them and adults, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Would love to be able to say this was great, however, one of the discs does not play.

If your are in sales (as I am) I would pass the book by. There is very little in this book that will help you with one - on - one interaction with a client.

Maybe it is already outdated, I don't know, but it was nearly impossible to follow through the museums. And then if and when I did find the thing he was talking about I didn't care for the flip comments about the artwork. (I know he's trying to be funny, but I would have appreciated some more basic information on things. I found myself trying to read museum cards just to find out how old some of the works were!) Also, it really gave no additional information over what was in the regular Rick Steves travel books but added just one more not particularly helpful book to the luggage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mini-course for \\"the rest of us\\"","review":"Although I am an art enthuiast myself and faithfully insist upon spending days slogging through the Louvre so that I won't \\"miss anything\\", I enjoyed reading Rick's book \\"Mona Winks\\" very much. This is because the book makes art \\"fun\\", even to those who are less than enthuiastic. I agree with the other reviewer that this book is sorta like a \\"Europe's Art Museums for Dummies\\". But Rick's amusing style makes it more than that - it makes the subject downright entertaining! And there is, of course, the picture that we could all relate to entitled \\"Another Victim of the Louvre\\". Wow - don't I know it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect companion to get through museums!","review":"Took this along with me as I toured various museums in Italy and Spain and provided the perfect context to see paintings especially in the vatican museums (sistine chapel too) and at the Prado in Madrid. Would give it 5* but was totally lost in navigating the Prado but realized shortly thereafter that the Prado has since reorganized its collection after the book's publication date. Nevertheless the paintings were all grouped in the same area - just had to cross reference with the museum map. Unless you're an art history buff, this is the way to go when visiting museums. Even my husband, who regularly just looks and walks (quickly) and waits was following along with me. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Far, Far Out-of-Date Self-Guided Tours","review":"This is a fifth edition from 2001 and it is far, far out-of-date. It's just has been repacked.

I expected practical tips and got only a few. What I also got, much to my surprise, was a dumbed down approach to art-now class, look at this part of the statue and think this. This is not insider information. It does help to check practical details-hours, days open, but I found that section mediocre in this book. And with the current economy, it is best to get up date information from the museum website. Many have cut their hours. I have toured most of these museums, and these guys miss some outstanding parts. I grant you that the Louvre is impossible-and if this book helps some people get in the door perhaps it has a function."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than having a tour guide in your pocket!","review":"I used this book on my trip through Europe, and I was amazed at how wonderful it was. In the Vatican, I acted as tour guide for my friends, and then the next day at the Colloseum, all I heard was, \\"What does Rick say about this?\\" Some of the insights on why things were built/painted are especially revealing and unique.

When I wake up in the morning I look at it to make sure it hasn't fallen down yet. It's poorly constructed and what's worse is making it well-constructed would be so simple; all they would need to do is make the top component's rod a little longer so that it goes further into the bottom component. Sometimes when I have the fan running I look over at it and see CDs sliding out of the slots. It looks cool, but that's about it. Don't buy this product unless you are desperate. I've lost faith in Atlantic products and as soon as I'm not a broke highschool student I'll get a wooden rack that doesn't look like the Leaning CD Tower of Pisa."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay","review":"It was hard to put together.

It just did not line up well. The worst part though is that the base is not at all sturdy, one half just loosly sits on the other half and it has little stability; fine if you can anchor it to a wall, but not everyone is able to do that. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good...","review":"Another poster mentioned that this rack resembles the \\"Leaning Tower of Pisa\\" when full... and they are dead-on accurate. I tried to load up 80 CDs, but the stand was leaning so much it could tip over any second. To say the design leaves a lot to be desired is an understatement! Even half-full (as I have things now) the stand tilts dangerously forward. I have a cat and I would wager the stand will not last out the week before it tips over with all the discs on the floor. On the up-side, the stand *was* easy to assemble (taking only 1 minute). Definitely the negatives outweigh the positives on this one, and as such I don't recommend anyone buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"shipping of tower","review":"The tower was fine they sent it in only a plastic bag and the ends had the paint chipped.

I started reading the book, then as it went on, I began skimming, and finally, I put it down. I think I could have liked Griff, but what did he see in her?

The tracks here are quick and funky -- it's like the sonic equivalent of a 3 Musketeers bar: sweet and satisfying, but mostly filled with air. \\"Theme from \`Gutbuster'\\" has a driving quality that just makes you want to boogie -- and this is true for almost all the tracks. \\"Do the Christmas Rush\\" sprinkles in some cheery synths to lighten the mood, but there's really nothing to distinguish the tracks from one another -- no catchy hooks or interesting samples. It's a pity, because their rhythmical abilities belie what this album could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvelous Ring","review":"We should all thank EMI for releasing in audio these sensational performances. This Ring is quite simply the best since Bohm's, with superb singers and a great conductor who really understands what these operas are all about. Hale, Behrens, Wlaschiha are all stupendous, but I have to single out the ravishing, glorious singing of Julia Varady as Sieglinde, for her alone I would buy this cycle (and at a sensational price!). No matter how many Rings you own, you should get this one immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another terrific performance by Wolfgang Swallisch & Co.","review":"Wolfgang Swallisch conducts an absolutely riveting performance of the monumental Wagner tetralogy. The highlight of this set is \\"Gotterdammerung\\"; Hildegaard Behren's Brunnhilde is absolutely electrifying. Although her voice shows some wear by the end, for me,that actually adds to the credibility and authenticity of this recording.Robert Hale's Wotan is also outstanding. The conducting of Wolfgang Swallisch is on a par with Boehm's (Bayreuth, '66) The only caveat that I would add involves the Sieglinde of Julia Vrady. She's an acquired taste, for sure. But overall this is in the top 5 Rings of the modern era."},{"rating":"2","title":"fanat","review":"From the German conductors I love Sawallisch most . It is the surprisingly sensitive, cultured and very original conductor. Among the executors there is no with a uninteresting vote and boring manner of performance. Robert Tear, probably, most remarkable Loge from everyone, whom I heard. Sieglinde, Siegmund and HundingAre worthy of admiration. Brunnhilde - Behrens has, probably, not best soprano in a history of a global opera, but her actor's work in a combination to a very good vote makes unforgettable impression. Siegfried Rene Kollo - unique Siegfried, which image I accept certainly. Hagen is magnificent.Wotan amazes with humanity of an image. This record - one of my most favourite records \\" Der Ring des Nibelungen \\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tepid cycle","review":"I find this a tepid cycle that is neither very well sung nor dramatically involving. The recorded sound is also very ordinary. While Sawallisch is a good Wagnerian, the orchestral playing here cannot be compared with that of Levine's or Karajan's orchestra. The interpretation cannot be said to be inspirational. However, what makes this set not competitive is the many flaws in the casting. Of the many singers, only Varady and Moll give fine performances. Kollo's Siegfried is long past his prime and Behrens's wobbly and effortful Brunnhilde is one of the big liabilities of the set. Schunk's Siegmund is disappointing and Hale's Wotan is far too light-weight. The other cast members are competent but not very special. It's better to look elsewhere for a complete recording of the cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A critical pill","review":"You do not have to read to far in this book to discover the philosophical foundation that runs its course through the veins of this book. If you like the critical school then it is for you, but if you are like me, having to read it for a class, you find yourself rejecting the critical pill which seems to be unable to simply just seek to understand the social phenomena but has the inflect upon the reader anecdotal suggestions in how to address inequalities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition","review":"This book was a wonderful addition to our collection.

Narration by Hunter Ellis was good & not overbearing that explained some features of the animals to make the movie more enjoyable and entertaining instead of only shots of animals. A rare 3D experience that puts the viewer right up close to animals like you were there. Fortunately, viewers are spared actual disturbing killing scenes after chases by lions, leopards and cheetahs and the feasting on killed animals is discreatly and only briefly shown(unlike Planet Earth and some other documentaries).Movie is in 1080i like many documentaries currently shown on TV. However, some scenes were of somewhat lesser quality, particularily distance landscapes & an occassional nearer one. Not up to BBC or IMAX standards in all scenes in picture quality for documentaries. Downgraded rating by one star for picture quality but has great 3D close-ups. A bargain in entertainment for around $20 Blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunter at his Self-Serving Best","review":"I was very eager to purchase this blu-ray, anticipating a 3D safari. One where the animals popped out of the screen, and lots of them. Of course, this is supposed to be a Safari!What I saw was Hunter interacting in staged, blatantly ridiculous interactions with the native folk (many who realize its ridiculous and roll their eyes) while sharing a Coke amongst poverty-stricken individuals who couldn't even afford one. Ok, so where's the Safari??? 20 minutes wasted.When we finally do see animals, it's all about Hunter Ellis, not the numerous species. His 'Wows' as some of them almost nail him. Boring... What's missing is the exciting 3D pop as we almost feel as though we've interacted with the animals...like a Safari!Not to be found here."},{"rating":"2","title":"To many previews","review":"The blue ray took longer than I expected to receive but I wasn't in a hurry so it was ok. The movie was in perfect condition when I received it, the packaging was fine and I had no problems with the seller. The movie has way to many previews!!

Even after that, the questions that ask you to identify the different ports and cable connectors for the computer were still not visible.

I saw it roughly 12 years ago and still can't believe that it ever made it past the first week at the cinema.

He gives the creeps a warning then beats them up a lot, arrests them or just blows them away.He does not stand aroudn striking a poncy pose or takes his hat off after 5 minutes. He clobbers people with a night stick.This film is a wasted license and possibly the worst big budget action film for many years (not counting any Steven Seagal films). If Judge Dredd did exist he would arrest the entire production crew, especially the writers.A waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been ...","review":"The producers of Judge Dredd might have actually had a franchise on their hands had they just toned down the violence. Cutting the rating from its current R down to maybe a PG or PG-13 would have opened the movie up to a much wider, younger, audience who may have been a little more forgiving of its \\"cartoony\\" style and predictable plot. Although it isn't the most intelligent movie I've ever seen, it definitely has its entertaining moments. That said, I still don't think I'd spring twenty dollars to buy it, I think I'd be able to shell out a few bucks to rent it with a clear conscience. All in all, not too bad a movie.

As must would expect, the film lacks much of a plot and is full of irritating dialogue and some very mediocer performances. Of course, people who go to see this film are going to go for the action and special effects.In the latter category, Judge Dread is competant if not amazing. The visuals are fairly good but really nothing that is going to knock your socks off.Unfortunatly, the films main draw, the action sequences, are un-involving and tedious. If you're expecting anything along the lines of a Face Off or Die Hard then you are going to be seriously disapointed.I've heard people say \\"Don't expect Shakespear, just enjoy it as a fun Sci-Fi ride.\\" The sad think is, even if you do ignore the lousy script and acting, this is still a weak film. It's not fun and it's not much of a ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM THE LAW!! (but honestly, why?)","review":"All I can say is this is a very bad movie. It has no plot, no action no humor. However, it has great acting. Just kidding, the acting blows. Stalone really should have re-thought this one. But hey, we all make mistakes. Fortunately, most of our mistakes aren't as bad as Judge Dredd. Don't even waste $.49 on this movie. Honestly, don't even tune into it when it's on cable. And if you do watch it, tie your hands behind your back because you might have the sudden urge to injure yourself for subjecting yourself to the torture of watching a movie that's this bad. I'm serious, it's a waste of your TV.

Ever. (Come on! Cyborg Cannibals! Evil twins! Statue of Liberty!) This is a great movie to watch with a group on friends doing a running commentary.

As another reviewer stated (which I noticed after I bought the DVD), the packaging is not labeled correctly! They lied. The label says \\"ENHANCED FOR 16x9 TELEVISIONS\\",it is not. It's instead the low rez letterboxed 4x3 format. I'm one of the few who actually seem to care about such things, but I have unfortunately bought several movies of this type and have been scammed (\\"The Rocketeer\\" and \\"2010, Odyssey 2\\" and \\"True Lies\\" among others)... and because you have to open the disc and play it to find out, you can get no refund from the store. These people should be forced to either replace the disc with what they advertized or give your money back. But they don't. They get away with lying to you.

This movie is as great as when I first watched it when I was 13 years old. I love it.If you are looking for Matrix or Minority Report or I Robot, this is not for you. If you are a fan on Stallone, if you want to remember what entertained us 20 years ago and enjoy an old school action scifi comedy, you want to get this movie !I love watching old movies no matter how cheese they are just to remind me that it did not take very much to be entertained back in the day.

Maybe thiis is the case for \\"Future Shock\\" and too much information was being given out but all in all science fiction deals with the person's humanity and \\"Dredd\\" forces it down our throats too fast and too sugary....In fact , I feel two stars is gviing this movie too much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of a great idea.","review":"I grew up reading the 2000AD comics which introduced Judge Dredd , and I remember really looking forward to seeing what could be done with the character.The timing of the movie appeared so right Stallone and Schwarzenegger seemed at the peak of their appeal to the movie going audience. Consequently a monosyllabic... law enforcer against a Sci-Fi backdrop couldn't miss, could it ?Unfortunately here it did, in the original comics ( to the best of my recall ) Dredd never removed his helmet, that part could have played by anyone. Instead of paying a ludicrous 'star' salary that money could have been spent on the movie, where it was really needed - am I the only one who cringed at some of the dialog, laughed at the special effects and blinked as some of the sets shook ?This could have been the seed of a great movie franchise, instead a comic strip that enthralled kids throught the 70's was pulped into nothing in an hour and half. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie,Lousy Disc","review":"Get the movie on conventional dvd,save money,and be happy.The movie is great!The blue ray version,however,is a rip-off.No special features other than the trailer,and many of these blue ray versions of 'Dredd' are not region 1 (U.S.A.) compatible...I love the movie,I just wish somebody cared enough to add features like cast and crew audio commentary.When you've made a great movie,you should take some pride in it.Feature length audio commentary is the most important special feature.If you've already seen the movie many times,watching it with audio commentary allows you to see the movie from somebody else's perspective,which makes the movie new again...Sly Stallone's audio commentary for the first Rambo movie is a great example for making something old new again.Watching Rambo while listening to Stallone talking about it was almost like seeing the movie for the first time.You gain a new perspective that you didn't have before."},{"rating":"2","title":"longer cut please","review":"Saw this when it came out in 95-thought it was ahead of It's time,this along with the crow was the beginning of more serious darker comic book characters.The production boasts great looking sets and visuals,one of the first to give a photo realistic inviroment against the usual over designed look of other comic book movies.If you want great action and some cool futuristic violence-this is the one-one of Alan Silvestri's best scores as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watchable Action Movie. Rambo Set In The Future. DID ROB SCHNEIDER HAVE TO BE IN IT?!!!","review":"This action film starring Sylvester \\"Rocky Rambo\\" Stallone is a pretty decent movie which also stars Diane Lane and Armand Assante. I don't know anything about Judge Dredd, other than he's supposedly a comic book character and he never shows his face or whatever. I liked this film, but my issue with it is Rob Schneider. Did he HAVE TO BE in this movie? Seriously, all the guy knows how to do is raunchy comedy ala Adam Sandler. He was okay in \\"Around The World In 80 Days,\\" but that was a Disney movie and everyone knows you can't get raunchy in a Disney film. I recommwend this movie. Good action scenes. Could have been longer, though, with additional character development of Judge Dredd and Judge Hershey and maybe even a romance between both of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good...until the plot kicks in.","review":"The first part (a.k.a. the first 15 minutes) are pretty cool, with Sly as some sort of human version of Robocop. But then the plot kicks in and he loses the flashy armor and weapons and such and it turns quickly into a Total Recall rip-off...except he's got a dopey side-kick. Art direction is nice, but they could do better than the bargain-basement CGI they popped for.

Examples: There is a lot of treatment of two-phase (yup, 90 degrees) power, including at 25 hertz, and of multi-kilovolt series incandescent streetlighting, plus knob and tube wiring. Also, it is stated that the highest radio frequency in use is 30 megahertz, whereas in reality we're up to 1,000 or 2,000 times that just now.

I understand why some electrician training schools might use this book - it is very comprehensive. It would make a good reference for a classroom lesson plan, but not a direct teaching tool.

Then Gran'ma Ben finally tells Thorn the real story of Thorn's life so far, the mysteries of her dreams and she is stunned.

I am also disgusted that Scholastic, which is a name parents trust, would allow this series to be marketed to young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near Perfect!","review":"This volume is less a conclusion to the first trilogy than it is a setup for the second. Fone Bone and Thorn's dreams start to become an increasing factor and indirectly lead to a chilling escape from a pack of rat creatures during a fierce thunderstorm. Also, much of the truth is explained regarding Thorn's past.While this volume does not have the quantity of zany humor found in the first two volumes, it does meet its quota of unforgettable moments. Smiley's dubious rescue of Phoney and Lucius the bartender from another pack of rats, as well as the bet made between Phoney and Lucius soon after are to be forever etched into the memory. Also notable is the introduction of the mastermind behind the ill befalling the valley, the incorporeal Lord of the Locusts.If it were not for some of the details surrounding Thorn's past, which seem a bit overused to me, I would give this 5 stars in an instant.

I tried everything, even replacing the battery in the transmitter and couldn't get the watch to recognize my heart rate or anyone elses. Amazon was great about taking the watch back but what a pain. This is the second x3hr I have ordered that has been defective. The first one was not from Amazon however and the screen froze then the battery died the day after I received it. These watches seem like a bargain for all of the functions they have, but they also seem to be unreliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake","review":"This watch has been a total waste of money. The temperature and altitude features are completely inaccurate and the heart rate monitor only reads part of the time. I would strongly recommend purchasing a different watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black X3HR","review":"The watch is of good quality and does the things it says it will do. When I purchased this item, I was under the impression that it calculated altitude. It actually displays altitude based upon barometric pressure. The user must give the watch a baseline altitude for it to function correctly. Also, somewhat significant weather change can cause your altitude to display incorrectly. Perhaps this is a common way of measuring alititude, I don't know. I suppose for the utmost accuracy you'll need to go with a GPS enabled model. Overall, this watch is still a great product for the price, just be aware of how the product works."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUUNTO watch","review":"Very disappointed.

I then went to a Highgear, more accurate than mu original Suunto. When the face of my Highgear came apart for no reason, I returned it to REI and bought the X3HR.Negative- display items too small and often hard to read; it is strictly a secondary altimeter due to the small atitude display, by backlight quit working after 3 months.Positive- Smaller and less geeky than other altimeter watches"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scholarship integrity restored","review":"One of the most frustrating aspects of modern debate is when certain groups make basic conclusive assumptions and then tautologically \\"support\\" those assumptions with the appearance of scholarship. Generally they follow that up by accusing their critics of being anti-intellectual.Boyd does a very good job of pointing out the logical fallacies of the Burton Mack-JD Crossan arguments, which rely on making initial assumptions contrary to all historical records, discounting every source that the majority of scholars through history have studied in detail, leaning heavily on new \\"sources\\" (Gospels of Thomas and Peter) that appear to support their thesis of Jesus as some sort of counter-culture new age secular philosopher, and then using those assumptions to \\"support\\" their arguments.Well, I am the Wizard of Oz. If you doubt that, I point you to my arguments to that effect, and my statements, which prove it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservative revisionist history","review":"Regrettably, I read this book hoping to gain another perspective in the name of honest inquiry. Alas, I was disappointed. Just as Crossan gives a rather left-slanted interpretation, so does Boyd give a right-leaning one. Please don't be fooled -- that although, like Crossan, Boyd presents a well-written book, he also fails to offer anything up rather than assumption. Perhaps Boyd's thinking is skewed by his born-again fundamentalism. Perhaps, like many literalists, he allows his own strict conservative views to intervene with his own brand of logic.In his defense, Boyd should at least be read for the \\"conservative slant\\" if nothing else. He does a good job at presenting his audience with a fine example of conservative Biblical interpretation.If you're a fundamentalist however, you'll probably disagree with my assessment."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"I hoped the video would show more about the reconstruction and explain more details. I also wanted to see something about how they restored the Philodemus papyri. Instead, it seemed to be an attempt at a sensationalized account of death at Pompeii and Herculaneum. I did learn some things, but it was not as informational as I thought it would be. I thought I would show it to my class, but I think it would be a waste of classtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"not just Pompeii","review":"I found it interesting to learn years ago, that another huge ship had sunk before the Titanic. This work may interest many as it explains that Pompeii was not the only Roman town to be destroyed by the eruption.The work emphasizes that the tragedy for the people of the time is our triumph because we got to learn how they lived. This work shows that even bread was preserved by the volcanic elements. Researchers could even see that one victim was seven months pregnant.Still, if you've seen documentaries on Pompeii, then you've seen this. Since the same thing happend, the only original point is that it happened in a different place."},{"rating":"2","title":"France's problems explained","review":"France's political class gets the pounding it deserves. The book is academically researched, so there are agreements with other analysts, and disagreements with others. The need for research can make some of the points several times, but overall, the origins of France's problems are clear.A word about \\"since 1980\\". As with any history, it has to stop at a date near the publication date. A 2012 reader can see that many of the problems covered have continued. They show no sign of abating, and the reasons are clear from the book's analysis. Recently there have been new events in France and Europe which are important to a 2012 reader, but necessarily absent from the research. Even so, the book's analysis of the political class \\"since 1980\\" lets a reader project some effects into the present. Eventually, historians will be able to analyze what France and Europe are like today. Hopefully, they won't ignore the early political class origins of long-term problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the same DVD as \\"Fear of a Satanic Planet\\"","review":"This dvd is actually just the previous Manson documentary \\"Fear of a Satanic Planet\\" with a new cover. its entirely the same dvd, just a different name and cover. it has all the same stuff as the other dvd, even the same exact menu. the documentary itself is so-so. none of the music on it is Marilyn Manson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polemic is not Science","review":"Especially the chapter \\"Recherche de Josephine Deym\\", written in a polemic style, is a futile attempt to discredit the evidence in favor of Josephine as the most likely \\"candidate\\" (seeBeethoven's Only Beloved: Josephine!: A Biography of the Only Woman Beethoven ever Loved)by pouring scornful ridicule on her \\"advocates\\".

I've been at it a couple weeks now, following the program and it seems to be the ideal way to get from walking to running/jogging. I like it a lot and haven't had one iota of pain and certainly no injuries. Definitely worth the money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Running has never felt so GOOD","review":"I really got my money's worth. I have to disagree with S. Brown's review. He claims that the book offers common sense advice. Well, from reading the personal anecdotes in this book and from my own experience, much of the 'common sense' advice isn't really common sense.This book offers great advice not only to novice runners, but to recreational runners as well. Aspiring runners learn how to start slowly and gradually build their strength and endurance without getting injured--very important! Also, they learn about appropriate running apparel and choosing the right shoes, staying motivated, setting realistic goals, and keeping a well-balanced diet. For recreational runners, check out the chapter: \\"Becoming a Better Runner.\\" It gives excellent advice on how to improve running technique.I've definitely learned from this book and have put some newfound knowledge to good use. Now, running doesn't feel like a pain-in-the-butt workout anymore. Now, I actually enjoy running!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolutely beginner's guide to....","review":"...Running! This is a very decent introduction (and also highly motivational) for someone very new to running. In my humble opinion, this is not a book for even someone that is slightly advanced into running. If you are someone that has been into a program and can run 5Ks and want to improve your time or improve breathing skills, this is not the book for you. However, if you are just beginning to run (and want to motivate yourself), then this is a good book. That is the reason why I gave the book 4 stars because it says it is a beginner's runner book. I just assumed that I would find tips such as rythmic breathing or other skills that will help you run better. good luck and keep running because its good for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"common sense advice","review":"I should start off by saying the book acknowledges it is for beginning runners. However, the book is 168 pages long and the program starts on page 133. The first 133 pages discuss various subjects and gives advice. The advice includes, \\"your feet should point straight forward and ahead,\\" and, \\"focus on what feels good and not what hurts.\\" The book could have been 25 pages and contained everything it now has that is worth knowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Fluff no Substance","review":"This is mostly fluff. One hundred and fifty pages of feel good stuff before it gets to a running plan. I'm really not interested in running while pregnant or choosing the right stroller! Cameo's of runners take up about twenty five percent of the book. Again there's really no meat on the subject. Maybe it was my mistake thinking there would be more here,it does say BEGINNING, but the book suggests you are an absolute novice to running and maybe life in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to it's Title","review":"My wife and I (both non runners) picked up this book at the end of the summer based on the promise of getting into a regular running program without getting injured.Prior to starting, neither of us could finish a mile without walking. At the conclusion of the program, we're both running 30-60 minutes at a time, 3-4 times per week. We've recommended this book to many others and they've achieved the same success.If you're looking to \\"become\\" a runner, there are many programs to help you start, but none better than this simple, proven book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you're in your 20's or 30's ... not so much in your 40's..","review":"I tried to follow the 13-week program and couldn't do it.

I'm still fairly fit through weight training but wanted to start running again. I've been following the 24-week program in the book \\"Complete Book of Beginning Running\\" by Amby Burfoot. And I can honestly say that her program is much more realistic for me. If anyone else feels defeated by this 13-week program, try the 24-week program that Amy espouses ... it's working!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for beginners","review":"I bought this book because I had become out of shape in recent months and needed a push to get back on track. I have been an avid gym rat for about the last 10 years, so I sort of know what I'm doing when it comes to getting in shape. This book gives great tips on what to eat when aspiring to be a runner. It also gives advice on stretches, injury prevention, running shoes, and different terrain to run on. I felt this is a good book for beginner runners because of the basic tips and advice given. It helped me gather the initiative to get back on track."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding book!","review":"You can do it!! Before I found this book I couldn't run to save my life. I knew that there had to be some sort of program that could take you from point A (not being able to run over 5 minutes) to point B (running 6 miles and not be worn out!) This book has changed my life, literally! I now love to run and I couldn't have done without this book's guidance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch the editions!!!","review":"Just a note to those that are interested in buying this book. The 13-week run/walk program was completely revised between the 2001 and 2005 editions of the book. The 2001 edition is a much gentler approach, while the 2005 edition assumes that you have a certain level of fitness. Just to illustrate: the very first session of the first week of the 13 week program in the 2005 edition calls for \\"run 1 minute, walk 2 minutes; do this 12 times\\" (the 9th time just about killed me), whereas the 2001 edition of the book starts with \\"run 30 seconds, walk 4 minutes 30 seconds; do this 7 times\\". So if you're more fit you may be happy with the 2005 edition, otherwise try to find the 2001 or 1999 editions of the book. Otherwise, I liked the book a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"I was rather diappointed in this collection. A few of the poems are very nice, but overall the work is bland and dull.

Although I'm not quite sure if it really helped me eat less or loss weight. The reason I love it is mainly because I noticed an extreme improvement with my overall anxiety.

I purchased this DVD after my VHS copy had come to the end of its useful life. The movie is there in all its glory including some vocal touchups (that my tape didn't have)on account of the sound being so awful, many people had trouble hearing what was said.

I have a moive night once a week for some friends. Last night we watched \\"Withnail and I\\", and \\"The Hidden Fortress\\". Well, the three other people and I all looked at each other at the end of withnail. We couldn't believe how unfunny it was. The acting was awlful. The actors seemed to be trying to hard to sell their lines. There was some good writing in it, but it was so forced, I kept waitng for it to be beleiveable but it never was. The drug dealer and uncle monty were the only good actors in the film. Sadly there time on screen was about a total of 15 minutes. Usually if I buy a DVD that costs 10 dollars or less I'm not too shocked that it sucks, but at the price this DVD is, I couldn't belive how bad it is. \\"The Hidden Fortress\\" was funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a trap stay away.","review":"If you are one of those who entered the imdb.com recommended link and ended up here looking for a comedy or even anything remotely entertaining then I can promisse you that buying this or its sister movie will leave you disapointed. And I feel that it is my duty to warn you. Comon, drinking lighterfluid and rolling megajoints hasnt been funny for over thirty years, not since the days of the Big Bamboo record, with which this movies atmosphere bears no resemblance at all. Gay people, farmers, villagers, drunks, poacher, stoned people, dirty dishes, weekend in the country, DUI, contry animals, if this makes you amused and happy then go ahead, I completely missed the point. Two drunks rolling over each other and a weekend with their gay uncle in the contry. There, I just saved you 25 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Withnail = Genius. Leonard Maltin = Muppet","review":"This film is simply superb and is one of the few films you can and will watch again and again with it getting funnier each time. It has the best dialogue of any movie I have ever seen. I find Leonard Maltins (who he?) review above quite remarkable. How on earth did the one guy on the planet who doesn't like this film get to do the official review on Amazon? 'some amusing moments'??? err, yes, one or too Leonard, no custard pies or explosions though so maybe that's your problem.Anyway, ignore him (unless of course you think Steven Segal is REALLY REALLY GOOD), and read the reviews by the people below, and no doubt the ones to come above this.

Letterbox is used for the main feature, already cutting resolution. The colours are washed out and the picture lacks contrast.The 5.1 sound was handled quite badly, with voices inappropriately appearing in the rear (not only when narrating) and a lot of hiss. I've heard much better sound on movies much older.The (good) extra documentary was in anamorphic widescreen, giving the main feature itself an even more bedraggled appearance.Unfortunately, it will probably be some time before a better version appears. This is a well-loved movie which deserves far better treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genius film, but this edited version is very disappointing.","review":"I love this film, but as a resident in Japan I can only watch the US format.....several classic lines have been edited out, apparently only to shorten the running time.

Hey, if you can't find the original lps on CD, this is an alternative I wouldn't pass up. The sound is great, and while some of the cuts are short versions of the original LP songs, and at the end others fade out instead of going full length, it will bring back musical memories.Wish there was more information about the music and the players in the liners (there's none), but they have their reasons for doing what they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing!","review":"This Is Definatley A Fresh And Crisp Record From Mel.

What he doesn't manage to do, is actually conclude a 13-book series in a way that feels anything like a CONCLUSION; if I'm going to wade through 13 books of varying quality, most of which have no beginning and no end (just \\"come back next week, same bat time, same bat channel\\") the least that the authors can do is to give me an ending after book 13! But this book doesn't do that; it ties up SOME of the ongoing plotlines:The Sabbat War & Leopold and the Eye of Hazimel, primarily. But the \\"Possible Antidiluvian in the background and the end of days\\" plotline is still dangling, which leaves me with a definite bad taste in my mouth.Overall, I would give this series 2 stars, and that just barely; it's got a bit too much interest to leave it at 1 star, but it truly isn't very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Gundam","review":"This is a great toy.

When was the last time your preferences didn't change when you learned more about something. People who think of Kinkade as a :real\\" artist are expressing thier own ignorance as to what artist means. All artists know where they fit in the hierarchy of art.

At this point SportBrain is saying since it only has a 1 year limited warranty they won't repair it, replace it, nor sell me a refurbished unit at a discount.If you are happy with having to replace it every year or two its a good product, but I expect a bit more longevity out of my purchases.

I believe there are a lot more parents out there who are like the boy's parents than most would like to believe. Hopefully there are more out there who are like Miranda's Grandparents who show love and understanding when dealing with Miranda's situations. I enjoyed this book even though I'm an adult.

Unfortunately if you've read just a few of Perry's murder mysteries a lot of 'A Dangerous Mourning' will feel very familiar. The same issues and plot contrivances. Like Charlotte Pitt in Callender Square, Hester goes undercover in the murder victim's house. This feeling is exacerbated by the often slow pace of the book, which seemingly has characters going over and over the same details again and again. It's good to see some interesting times ahead for Monk, and Hester's glimmer of romance is handled quite sweetly but this book just feels too routine to really succeed. As part of a series I think it has merit, as a murder mystery it's just a bit dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Don't Read Interview Following","review":"Great book. Some slow parts; I agree with some of the reviews that found the courtroom scenes a little slow. I don't have a problem with Hester working so much with Monk. I love the characters of Monk and Evan, and of course Hester.My real problem is with the Kindle edition's interview at the end of the book.

The tester does not test the battery from the power of the battery being tested. The tester requires a 9 volt battery, which is included. I was disappointed to discover this fact.I do not recall if the description stated that a battery was required. I looked for information like that because I knew this person would be checking that first.Friday (1/12/07), I sent an e-mail requesting information on how to return the tester.

First off, the man who narrated it couldn't pronounce \\"Tupac\\". If that wasn't enough, he just jumped all over the place, stuck in a few interviews that had no relevance, threw in a couple scenes that made absolutely no sense, and didn't tell me ANYTHING I didn't already know.

There is little to no mention of the actual feud that these two had. If you don't know anything about Death Row or the artists in the title then you may have trouble following the film. Most of the facts are presented poorly and some of the information like the reports of Snoop being scared for his life are poorly-researched, one-sided, and very much opinionated.As a huge fan of this entire story, I was bored to death and those who would like a more professional-looking account of the events may want to check out the VH-1 \\"Behind The Music\\" on The Notorious B.I.G."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore martee and his vice.god accounts","review":"Hes upset of successful people because they can use their subconscious for success but unlike martee/druggie tell amazon.com to delete him.Buy this dvd if you like 2 pac, i don\`t like this dvd much but i respect the fact he used his spiritual subconscious for real success."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This product is very good.

How anyone could say that Frida was less talented than Agnetha is beyond me! Both women have exceptional voices, but neither contributed more to ABBA than the other.\\"Somethings Going On\\" is a fine first stab at an English solo career. The only song on this album that lacks is the Phil Collins duet. The title track, \\"Threnody\\", \\"You Know What I Mean\\" and \\"Tell Me It's Over\\" are the standouts. I'm really surprised that \\"Tell Me It's Over\\" wasn't a big hit...it had a very poppy, early 80's catch.I absolutely LOVE Frida. The woman is exceptionally talented and I think all three of her post ABBA albums are wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Second Fidlle","review":"Second Fiddle?I don't think so. If Mr. Everett had actually listened to even a few of ABBA's CDs he'd have noticed that Agnetha & Frida very often share leads on tracks. The remainder are usually evenly split between them (Agnetha singing lead on 2 songs, Frida doing the same)Frida's voice has always dominated ABBA songs, even when she's doing backup or harmony vocals. Not to bash Agnetha or anything, she has a fantastic soprano voice with an incredible range while Frida's mezzo-soprano is equally stunning. They're just DIFFERENT. And this is what makes the ABBA \\"sound\\" so special.In their later albums (Super Trouper, The Visitors) you really get to hear just how good these women are.....there're some incredible notes being hit on those songs. So if one can fault anything about this CD, it's because of the songs, NOT the singer. I still say it's good, but her \\"Ensam\\" CD from 1975 was better. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stick with ABBA","review":"I recently got this album through a friend at my office. I always loved ABBA. But this is no ABBA at all. Ofcourse I realize that the blonde singer was more responsible than Frida was for the ABBA sound. But that this Frida cd would be this far from ABBA's usual high standart I would not have imagined. It all sounds so aggresive. It lacks emotion and true feeling. Frida sings as if she is forced to do so, not with a hart. Next time I'll stick to my ABBA and Agnetha stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even her best is not very good","review":"This is Frida's best effort. But I must say that after my initial positive feeling, after all this time it does not stand out as a strong CD. Only the title track is still charming and powerful. The rest of the stuff doesn't create an album feel. It is more a collection of songs with no soul. The one exeption being 'You know what I mean'. This is the first and only moving piece which really shows Frida as a person. It's a shame she doesn't show more of herself. One wonders, if Phil Collins cannot make Frida shine, who can?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for trying, not worth buying","review":"If you like ABBA then don't buy this CD.

But it was years ago when I bought it on LP. Today I got the CD, and I am really dissapointed. It all sounds so oldfashioned. It has no soul. Only the tittle tracks is great. The rest is booooring.

On e of those reasons is Frida. Sure Ana was cute, but i think that Frida was the whole package: beauty, mystery, and of course one heck of a voice. That same voice is apparent on her debut solso album. While i have not gotten achance to hear the whole album, it is still a great solid record with some great tracks. The title track is off the hook with one of the best beats ever in music. Frida is not only a great singer, but a goddess in my book. She was never a second fiddle to Ana and never will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not finding what I'm looking for","review":"I am very tired of reviewers comparing Agnetha to Frida and vice-versa.I am interested in what reviewers thing of the CD, not who likes one better than the other. Combining their voices made the ABBA sound.I have heard many of their CD's and frankly I guess I just miss how theysounded with the group when singing solo. I long for the tempo and subjectmatter of the ABBA songs. I really haven't found what I'm looking for withtheir individual albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"leave her alone!","review":"I think this is a really cool album. okay it may not compare to ABBA but it's good. Who said she only backs up Agnetha! Do you remember Knowing Me, Knowing You, Super Trouper or Cassandra? Her vocal talents really show on this album. Oh, and Frida if you(or any other member of ABBA) ever read this Please,please, please get back together!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In defense of Frida - too","review":"I personally found Frida more attractive than Agnetha! True this album is not very good, but don't put all the blame on Frida, song writers and producers are also to blame. Frida IS a talented singer and has done wonderful songs with or without Agnetha (Check out the a cappella version of Dancing Queen on \\"ABBA - 25year tribute\\"). We can't say that LLCool J or Snoop Doggy Dog are as talented.What about yourselves? Are you that talented to judge so harshly?Frida is great , Agentha is great, Benny & Bjorn are great and all of them were even better together as ABBA.. I miss them together. Let's hope for a reunion for new songs not remakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frida's no second fiddle","review":"I can't agree with the editor that Frida mostly plays second fiddle to Agnetha. Frida had her share of leads in Abba's songs. Just to name a few Abba's greatest hits with Frida in the lead : Fernando, Super Trouper, Knowing me Knowing you, Money Money Money, I have a dream, When all is said and done, One man, One woman. Both ABBA girls were superb singers but I often find Agnetha's soprano a bit metallic and strident. I do prefer Frida's more subtle and mellow mezzo-soprano.But like Agnetha, Frida lost her magic when she ventured out of the Abba umbrella. The solo was just pedestrian. The memory of Abba was simply too overpowering for us to savour any solo makings from either girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Jewels on a Pleasant Album","review":"I've been listening to this album a lot lately, and I think it's well worth it as an addition to my collection. Two songs especially stand out in my opinion: \\"I Know There's Something Going On\\" and \\"Threnody\\".I like Frida's voice a lot, and the arrangements of the songs are crisp and not overdone. Phil Collins did a great job. I especially like the range of the album. Rather than being a bunch of same-sounding songs, each track has its own personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screw the critic","review":"Screw the critic whatever Phil Collins has done has always been gold!

A pointed and accusatory read, big business is described as an irredeamable taskmaster who seeks to influence or control employees, competitors and consumers alike.Most of the facts and quotes that are used to support these broad wandering accusations and goals are obviously too twisted and disjointed for any real analysis. Quite clearly, they often mix opposing or incompatable findings. Sometimes the read is entertaining but more often it is like the ravings of the confused. Written in 71, printed in 73, this book is only good for historical research of Nader's writings or socialist based theories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nunn Bush Men's Tempe Fisherman Sandal","review":"The sandals appear to be well made and are comfortable.

They performed well and I have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strongly unified performance","review":"This is perhaps my favorite recording of Winterreise, if only because there is a strong sense that the performers are on the same page. It is almost as if a stage director had focused the psychological details of each song and the shape of the cycle as a whole. Thomas Allen's slightly gruff voice works well in depicting the social outcast and Roger Vignoles' piano work has a clarity of specifics. I might quibble with a few slow tempos in the second half of the opus, but the pair obviously agree on the dramatic interpretation being put forth.(Contrast this to the Thomas Hampson/Wolfgang Sawallisch recording. Maestro S gives an intimate parlor reading of the work while Hampson leads a full-blown operatic assault.)This being a double CD set, you get the added treat of Arleen Auger singing a recital of some Schubert favorites. All in all a superb value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incipio's Handspring Treo Case - Don't bother","review":"This is a very poor design. It will probably be fine if it were larger, it is a struggle getting the Treo out. The side rocker switch was pushing too tightly against the case and constantly leave the unit turned on.

After reading Raised by Wolves I realized I know what he needed. He spent the whole book telling us not showing us. It must have been incredibly painful to relive certain beatings from his father, incestuous mentions, and a mentally ill mother, however just stating some events and having no emotional feel to tie the reader into the terrified view means you lose the reader. A memoir is unique in that you can say I, you can personalize each detail and make us feel the pain. Instead it was painful at times to read a poorly expressed piece. It was a good beginning just not a finished piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Poorly Spent","review":"I saw the author on the news, being very interested in the Elizabeth Smart case I decided to purchase the book.

You are better off reading Mistresses of Mayhem: The Book of Women Criminals by Francine Hornberger or Look For the Woman by Jay Robert Nash if you want to read a comprehensive book about female criminals. It is a wonder how this book found a publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"biased","review":"I have to agree with the prior review. It very poorly written. You can see the authors bias' from very early on in the book, even though they appear to be trying to do a book on facts. In the work the author draws a picture of abused women as ignorants who had many choices available to them. As a women who has never been in an abusive relationship i still understand that this is not always the case.

Being rather isolated, the islands developed a bit differently than mainland cities, thus getting the name \\"The Land That Time Forgot\\". This book chronicles the developments of the islands from early settlement to present day, covering many interesting topics. There are numerous places on the islands today which tell the story of the islands (National Museum in Georgetown, Pedro St. James, Cayman Turtle Farm, etc.), which are covered in this book and are also worth visiting. The book also showcases the courage, strength, and pride the Cayman people have in themselves, their heritage, and their country. If the book does one thing, it should make us more aware and help us appreciate that respect, not to let it get lost in modern-day society. Recently discovering my ancestry from these islands, I have a new sense of pride in my heritage, and am thankful it has been chronicled by a book such as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a full DVD Rack","review":"I have two of these to hold my DvD collection. They're great! Simple in design and fairly fashionable (the more dvd's in it the more fashionable it looks!) The one poor thing about this design is that placed on carpet the DvD's have an easy time sliding out. For some reason the decline that the DvD's rest upon isn't steep enough for the to and frow the stand moves while placed on carpet.Another thing, if you have cats they'll knock your DvD's out all the time! I pick up DvD's off the floor in front of the rack because of their running behind it and knocking it about.

That having been said, there doesn't seem to be anythng on the markat that is comparable, and I ended up buying two. Ultimately I had to shave down the bottoms of the doors (they didn't fit otherwise) and the hinges are crap. The shelves will sag when fully loaded.

It isn't pretty, it could use some insulation and a tighter door, the rotisserie is cheesy but we love it for baking. We are two old frugal people with a small high altitude kitchen. I bake our weekly bread, two loaves at a time, no problem. Cookies are quick on the convection setting and you can't bake more than you should eat in one sitting. Cake mixes take a little work to perfect but baked potatoes, beef jerky, quiches, pies, even drying fruit, it's all good. We park the oven outside for summer baking and love the way it helps heat the kitchen in the winter. Not as noisy as our last fancy Bosch $1500 convection range and the automatic turn off is nice. We weren't sure we could live without a regular oven but with this and a couple counter top burners so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great oven!","review":"I shopped around for a convection oven and narrowed the choices between the Cuisinart oven and the Hamilton Beach oven. I chose this one cause of the reviews, price (on sale at $69.99 at Bi-mart), had the pans with it and the quality. I've always had good luck with Hamilton Beach products. I still have the hand mixer bought 20 years ago and still works.We have a small kitchen and I love this oven! It doesn't heat up the whole kitchen. Baked cookies, cakes, roasted chicken (yum!), casseroles; its like a miniature version of our large oven.It does get hot on the top and the back so allow 10 inches of space around it. It does quickly cool down once it is turned off. I have it on the counter between the kitchen and dining room so it works for me.I've owned it for 2 months now; hope it will last a long time. Watch for sales or coupon off; may find a bargin.As of today, Nov 30, this oven is on sale for 59.99 at Bi-mart, 30 dollars off the regular price."},{"rating":"1","title":"kitchen fire!","review":"We just had a small kitchen fire with ours. The oven worked great at first, I loved the rotisserie, convection, etc. Then the convection fan stopped working, but the other functions seemed ok, so we kept using it. Apparently this oven is made very cheaply, with cheap materials and low quality standards. The cord seemed ok,( I always check before I plug anything in) but it was not. Suddenly while I was cooking dinner there was a popping sound and flames shot out from the cord. The circuit breaker tripped in time, stopping the flames so we did not have major damage to the kitchen, but I will never purchase anything from hamilton beach ever again. This oven is a fire hazard and completely unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it at first...but now it's dead","review":"I got it in April 2010, thought it was the best thing ever! A tabletop convection oven...so cool. I didn't use it that much...maybe once a week or less. But when I went to use it the other day, only the timer worked. Ugh! It is desvastating. Iwould not recommend this product. Get a toaster oven instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luck if this works for 1 year","review":"This oven worked well for about 10 months and then the heat would only come on if I stood and held the knob in the stay on position. When I called Hamilton Beach, they were willing to replace the oven for $25 shipping and handling, but the new one would have no warranty at all which means I may only get a month out of it. It seems like a replacement should be backed by a warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST CUTE","review":"I decided to buy this unit after reading all the great reviews. I agree that this is a beautiful oven, however, it only worked for three months before calling it quits. The unit also gets extremely hot, so parents with small children, beware.Three days before finally breaking, the unit's timer would not stop sounding.

Oven temp is way way off. Almost 100 degrees cooler than what it is set for. It says you can cook 2 12\\" pizzas but this is impossible as the temp will not even reach 400. The broiler element came on while baking a cake and burned the top while the rest wasn't even cooked. I returned the first one and tried a second one . Needless to say it was no better. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Appliance","review":"I love how it doesnt heat the whole kitchen up when I want to bake.

It does need to be pre-heated as mentioned in reviews that I read before I purchased it and does not heat up as quickly as a small toaster oven but it is 3X the size so that makes sense. There are trade offs from a toaster oven which I was replacing with the convection oven. First, I was able to (hence the name) toast/toast. Takes way too long with the Hamilton Beach...I just assumed I would be able to use it for that. The only other thing to consider is there is no way to tell if it truly has reached the temperature. A regular oven normally will have a LED Light go off to let you know it is as the right temp. I will need to purchase an oven thermostat to be able to tell this. But the price was amazingly affordable and I believe it is a great product in spite of the few bells I wish it had."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT PRODUCT","review":"I have used an oven approximently this size for over 15 years, this is perfect for myself, as i live alone and don't need a large oven . When i remodeled my kitchen , I did not leave room for a regular stove, i have a stove top , and this for the rest of my needs. This works perfectly , i do not like convection cooking as i burn everything , this toaster oven gives me a choice to use or not . I feel this product is the answer , hope it last as long as my extra large Toastmaster did.The problem with the description was they didnt show the inside and outside dimensions, so i bought another one which was so small, and then found this , perfect for my needs , works well , hope this works for another 10 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a pizza oven","review":"One of our friends had this oven and we fell in love with it too.

Also the pan set that comes with it is not non-stick. We've been covering it with foil to make cleaning easier. The rotisserie is fabulous. We've made pork tenderloin and chicken this way, both turned out great. The chicken did rub occasionally on the bottom tray, but I think this was mostly due to not tying it up well enough.

Unfortunately the door did not close properly, there was a gap when the door was closed through which the heat escaped. Consequently, the oven did not keep a constant temperature, something which is of utmost importance when curing polymer clay. The oven was also very tinny, the sides got uncomfortably warm.

When it was cashiered, I did research on Amazon.com for a replacement. The Hamilton Beach seemed the best and I have put it to the test for almost two years. It is slighly smaller than the Faberware(not made anymore) but does have a rotisserie which works wonderfully. I put whole chicken fryers, chicken breasts, and 3-5 lb pork loins on it. Mouth watering good!! It does cook much faster than an oven and because of this and it energy savings my oven is never used. Two minuses would be the door opens down from the top and not from the side so you run the risk of dropping something on it and breaking it and it also does not seal well but does not seem to affect cooking. Controls are easy to use and read. Comes with plenty of racks and trays. Works just great for baking also. Im very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"We bought this rotisserie to make our own rotisserie chickensat home. That was the only thing we really need from it.The manufacturer says it's rated for 5 pound chickens - ok,it's not exactly easy to find them then small, but we did. Fivepounds exactly. Trussed the bird, firmly attached to the rodexactly according to the directions - it spun reasonably wellfor about 20 minutes. But then it just stalled out! The motorwas groaning and the chicken was sort of flopping back andforth a bit. So we pulled it out and finished in the oven.We tried another time - this time managed to find a 4.5 poundchicken.

My kitchen's oven is not insulated well and is old and heats up the whole house when I turn it on. This oven is great and the convection feature is awesome. It makes great toast on the convection setting or under broil but this oven doesn't have a 'toast' feature per se. My mom has the same oven and has used the rotisserie and says it's great. I have yet to use it. On convection every thing cooks up faster and is crispy crispy. One thing I like to do is slice up a yukon gold potato into matchstick size pieces, drizzle with olive oil and put them in on convection at 400 for about 15 minutes or less- watch them and when they start to brown pull them out.

The rotisserie feature does not work the way it is supposed to. The chicken drags every time it turns. It is very hard to use the rotisserie ensamble in it self- it is junk. This oven is not big enough to have a rotisserie in it. They also should put a light in it. I have had this oven for 2 months-Thank goodness I only paid Seventy some dollars for it. I would not buy it again. Also-I work alot of food events, working with roasters, I should have known better to buy this oven-I don't like Hamilton Beach Brand Their roaster oven is very hot-hard to control-my least favorite brand.

Perhaps I am comparing too much but I had it over 20 years, it finely gave up...and although I paid slightly more it did all the jobs you could ask for.

The slide-out crumb/drip tray makes it very easy to keep your oven clean. The heavy gauge baking pans (two, 12 X 12 in.) don't warp when heated like most. The motor is whisper quiet. I hate timer dials that tick--this one is so quiet, you hardly hear it ticking. The exterior of the oven gets very warm; however, it cools off very quickly after it's turned off. There is so much room in this oven and it hardly takes up any counter space. I first seen it at Kohl's for $149.99, but purchased it at Kmart for $89.99. By the way, it wasn't even on sale!

The bottom tray barely cooked. (30 minutes later the fire department declared it was safe to return the building).I continued the demonstration, however, this time I assigned a person to watch the oven.....Again, same results...burned top tray, raw bottom tray. Repeated one more time, same reults. To call this a convection oven is ludicrous. This oven maybe large by toaster oven standards, but in reality one may only cook one tray at a time.

I've used all the features on it and my favorite is the rotisserie. I've made 4 pork roasts so far and they all came out perfect, moist and tender. I haven't tried chicken or beef yet but will do so shortly. I've only used my actual oven once since I got this and it looks like I won't be needing to anytime soon. From baking, broiling or toasting, this can't be beat. And the large capacity is an added bonus since I have 4 kids and meal sizes get a little bigger than a small oven can handle. The ease of operation, easy clean-up and affordable price really can't be beat.

The first one was so handy we finally wore it out but it lasted 4 or 5 years with constant use.

I will buy a third one if this one ever wears out. I recomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot & Shoddy","review":"Ordered one of these based on the reviews. Talk about shoddy construction. The outside walls are thin metal - pressing with a finger could dent. Edges of the metal are not smooth and don't meet together well.What others said about Hot - it gets really hot. Being that it is tall, can't have it under a upper cabinet - as the cabinet bottom gets blazing hot.Returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good oven.","review":"This is a very handy oven that works for me in the summer time when I don't want to run the big oven. This is my second purchase of this particular model. The first one lasted 5 years before the knob/thermostat went out. The performance outways the negative. Like that the shelves are adjustable and that you can fit two items in it at the same time. The other brands you could barely fit in one dish. Personally I'm a big fan of Hamilton Beach products and I would recomend this oven to anyone who really cooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probelm with max temp on convection","review":"This is a pretty good oven, but it's very limited on how high it will go in convection mode, as the power is too limited. I've found that it will not go higher than about 325 no matter where the temperature is set, and how long you preheat. The coils stay red hot (an issue with anything on the top shelf) and the temp never goes any higher. It's also too underpowered to really broil anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken","review":"My oven arrived broken, in that the center knob will not turn from broil. Unfortunately, I didn't buy it from Amazon, so returning it will be a pain.It was smaller than expected, about 12\\" deep, 12 1/2\\" across, and 10\\" high (from upper to lower heating element, which is not all usable space).Anyone who owned a Farberware Convection Broiler Oven will be underwhelmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this from Kmart and used the bake, rotisserie and convection features.Pros: the size of the oven is more than adequate; the price was comparable; the rotisserie function worked well (be sure to keep the legs tied up, or they will drag at the bottom of the oven); and the front slide-out crumb tray made clean-up easier.Cons: the door does not shut flush, allowing heat to escape; the temperature dial knob broke after only a week of use; the included bake pans warped when baking; the temperature was off by at least 20 degrees.I returned to the store for a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible & Dangerous","review":"I purchased this oven just over a month ago in order to replace my excellent, but now worn out, 15yo+, Farberware Convection oven.The Hamilton Beech Convection Countertop Oven is nice looking out of the box, but that was it.3 Attempts at using the Hamilton Beech Convection Countertop Oven demonstrated that I could cook food faster in my big electric oven than I could with this thing.Let alone experience the time savings I did with my previous countertop convection oven.And that turns out to be the least problem.I am surprised the Hamilton Beech Convection Countertop Oven is even allowed to remain on the market. It is a fire hazard!You can not place the side walls of this oven near anything flammable or meltable. Nor on the top, or over it. So forget about placing it near a painted drywall, or under a cabinet.Even worse, just from touching a side of it, a curious child could receive a first degree burn in the blink of an eye!DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't burn urself...","review":"I just purchased this item yesterday from Kohls for 78 dollars because I price matched the Walmart price...YAYThe only function I have used so far is the rotisserie. The instructions tell you to preheat first...I did that...Then, while trying to place the bird in the hot preheated oven I burned myself. It is quite a task to get the spic inside the oven. It's made like kinda like an arrow. You have to fit the pointed end in the hole which is impossible to do without burning something, your arm, clothing, potholders, etc.They should've made the spic easier to drop in like the one on the Foreman rotisserie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom Element Broken","review":"Based on your reviews, this oven had a lot of promise... but it never baked anything, everything was burnt on top and mushy runny on the inside.I have no other oven. After several months of owning it and trying to cook a variety of things, I discovered that the problem is the bottom element, it doesn't 'light'.I can broil things to my hearts content, but the temperature inside the over never gets above 250 degrees.

Don't bother as they won't cook evenly unless you rotate them halfway through, or one will be cooked on top, but not on bottom, and the other is opposite. I didn't have problems with rotisserie, convection cooking, or broiling. The timer was loose though, and I couldn't tell how long it would run. Then, several months later, it just died.

The case is very sturdy but the strap that holds the lid on just has a simple plastic clip to hold it in place. It would have been better if it had a metal clasp that allowed you to place a padlock on it. To get around this issue, I bought a TSA approved strap with a lock on it and rivetted the strap to the lid and case to create a more secure solution. It held up just fine during the flight, other than the TSA opened the strap and didn't strap it back down tightly again, but that is a whole other story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brass!","review":"Besides the fact that the MN Orchestra does a wonderful job with this piece, the brass will absolutely blow you away.

Spread over a few weeks, they would probably be much more entertaining. A few of the stories moved so slowly, it became difficult to sit through them. I can say with confidence that if I paid $48, I would have been dreadfully disappointed with this series. Since I bought it used, it was a little less painful. The stories do encourage self reflection, which should count for something. (two stars, to be exact) People probably could identify with at least one lead character. I was hoping for a good chick flick type anime, but this one was severely lacking something. I guess that would be the entertainment factor."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Anime Series I've seen so far.","review":"Diamond Daydreams goes into great detail on the problems and choices that a lot of people would go through in life.

I now intend to read some more of his longer works like 'The Damnation Game' and 'Cabal'.This short novel was very well written and had a very good storyline, I would recommend it to any horror fan.

It seemed to be written in a more 'old language' way, whereas I prefer modern, conversational language. I envisioned them being English, due to his way of writing. However I read it for a group read on goodreads.com - and that is why I enjoy group reads, because many times we do end up reading books I wouldn't normally read.It seems to be a book of settling. Julia settles for Rory, although she believes she would have preferred Frank. Kirsty settles for being a friend of Rory, putting up with Julia, although she would have preferred marrying Rory herself. Frank is the selfish rebel outcast, as a playboy and one who bucks the system.I'm glad I read it, although I don't intend to read more of his on my own - but I have surprised myself before!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!

This piece of horror fiction is a stand out among the best of horror fiction. This is truly a masterpiece. I first read this story in college, and then I found myself reading a new short story collection based on the \\"Hellraiser\\" mythology. That took me back to the movies, and that took me back to this story. The characters of this story are brilliantly drawn. It is a short book, really a novella, but packs a huge punch. I don't want to give anything away, but this story is not just supernatural horror, but also the horror that can reside in a human being. The horror of what people will do for another. If you love horror fiction, you must read this book. See where it all started and learn the meaning of true horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barker's best","review":"I still enjoy this novel the most out of Barker's list of works. This novel is the most frightening of his earlier works, and proves to us once again that he can easily bring us into his terrible world so that we experience the horrors of the protagonists firsthand. When I first read this book, and the description of the Cenobites, I remember the utter dread that I felt. If your looking for one of Barker's best, choose The Hellbound Heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful (terrifying) edition","review":"The Hellbound Heart was originally written before Clive Barker became \\"The Future Of Horror\\". This is what one would expect from a seasoned writer with years of 'getting away with it' behind him. It also shows what was left out of the filmed version (we'll see what the remake brings). This is a stunning edition with original cenobite designs drawn by Clive as well as the original first chapter reprinted with annotations and notes by the author. A must for Clive fans.

For anyone who likes bands like Badly Drawn Boy and Bright Eyes, you should know that you are wasting your time and money: those guys are shadows, pale imitations, of the true greatness that an indie-rock singer-songwriter can actually achieve. Soltero---now that's where it's at. I'd recommend him/them to anyone who likes Elliot Smith, Neil Young, Yo La Tengo, or even the Mamas and the Papas.This is great stuff. Lyrically, there's nothing so good. Musically, there's nothing quite so mind-altering.Soltero is genius, and this is, for sure, one of his best--definitely his quietest and most intimate.

For a real alcoholic to try the things suggested in the living sober book means that they will almost certainly relapse.

It suggests many methods which have no proven efficacy, and are simply ways to avoid doing what you actually need to do (the 12 Steps).

While it was slow, I was waiting for story to pick up or capture my attention. It failed to do so.Yossi and Jagger are two soldiers in an Israeli army, monitoring the Lebanese border. Unknown to their comrades, they are lovers. They go off in little missions together only to spend intimate moments with each other. Jagger wants Yossi to leave the army but Yossi loves the military life.Things change for Yossi and Jagger when a colonel arrives and warns them of a possible ambush that evening. The ambush will ultimately decide the fate of their relationship.Fairly simple yet severely underdeveloped. You're not missing anything if you never get the chance to watch this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW. This is a truly horrible film....","review":"This was really painfully bad - the plot was terrible: simplistic, predictable and shallow. The acting was pretty terrible, too. It really resembled a Cold War-era student film project. The ending was particularly bizarre...after everything that had happened (the main character loses his lover in battle), you HOPED you'd see a little depth to him, perhaps see him look back and appreciate his lost partner in a new way. Instead, you watch him sit at the guy's wake and sort of smirk knowlingly, while the grieving family talks about their closeted dead son's life, not realizing that he was this guy's lover. He sort of shrugs and smiles, as if he'd just gotten a flat tire or something, but now he's over it. Oh, and on top of all this, there isn't even anyone particularly attractive in the film.

While there are moguls now like Rachael Ray and Martha Stewart, Isabella Beeton started it all. Defying Victorian conventions, she got into her husband's publishing business. When many upper-class women left housekeeping to their servants, Mrs. Beeton taught women how to keep house. (When conservatives talk about \\"traditional\\"gender roles, they might only date back to the Victorian Age/Industrial Revolution,and it depended on social class)\\"Secret Life\\" is historically accurate, but it's also incredibly stilted. There is more telling than showing, since Isabella has an annoying,near-constant voiceover. There's a scandalous secret in the center of the movie, which explains the heroine's numerous miscarriages, and her husband's sickliness. Still, it doesn't give any life to the series. \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\\" is more thrilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbie and the Rocker's Vol 1.

I found myself fast forwarding looking for the next bit of dialog or human interaction. A few of these directors have fallen into the arrogant trap of believing that their work is so good that it needs neither plot nor momentum. It's not.My advice is to leave these shorts to their owners. They are from the early 90s, and feel even older. They will never become classics. They feel like film school projects.

The best description I can give is that it smells like a ninety year old woman who has been the same bottle of rancid perfume for about 50 years.I am a fragrance lover and enjoy many types of perfume from foody to oriental spicy but this poison like liquid defies description.It was cold today but I wouldn't wear the coat I had on yesterday when I sampled this hellish scent because it is still loudly lingering on the sleeve.It took several scrubbings with a variety of soaps before I could remove the toxic smell.

As soon as my mom got in the car, she said, \\"It smells like [so and so] in here.\\" Haha! It really, honestly is the most offensive scent I've smelled. I would choose the smell of dog doodoo over this perfume--really. I recently married, and the first thing my husband said after meeting my mom's friend was how bad she smelled.

I bought this thinking a Russian Pletnev will do some justice by recording all of Tchaikovsky's pieces for orchestra and solo piano... NO! Pletnv was was very play in all recordings. There are too many surprising changes in tempo and dynamics as if he was playing Rachmaninoff. Pletnev did not portrait Tchaikovsky the right way. To my own opinion, Pletnev had ruined these Tckaikovsky pieces. He should be ashamed of himself for being a Russian and a pianist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Compared to piano concerto cycles by other composers (Beethoven, Mozart, Rachmaninov), the complete Tchaikovsky cycle has long been neglected. There is a reason for this. The enormous popularity of the first piano concerto has for many years overshadowed the other works. Yet, as these CDs demonstrate, popularity isn't often the last word to a work's true qualities. The Tchaikovsky piano concertos, played here by the great Russian pianist Mikhail Pletnev, is filled with much fire and lyricism. The CDs also contain Concert Fantasy for piano and orchestra, also a worthy piece. Of all the complete recordings of these concertos, this set is so far the least expensive. Fortunately, in the classical recording industry, price doesn't always suggest quality. Pletnev's performances are charged, the Philharmonia's playing is great, and the recorded sound is clear and distinct. For such a low price, these CDs are not to be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Homes and Gardens Gas Grill Cookbook","review":"This cookbook comes in an easy format to read format and lies flat on a counter.

I was a little excited to get this album. In the end I ended up being disappointed with the album. Some of the songs sounded a little corny to me. It seems like Starsailor started to have a more Travis sound to them and I'm not the biggest Travis fan. Some of their songs sound like something that would fit perfectly with Love Is Here which made the album boring as well. I don't know why Starsailor included the song 'Born Again.' I remember it being released as a B-Side, and the album version sounds like it's been downgraded compared to the one they released in one of their singles. The only song that caught my attention is 'Telling Them.'

In the town of San Quintin there were three bus terminals and five bus companies with widely varying prices and none of that was mentioned in the book.

Thus two stars were earned.However, the big problem was with their conclusion. They claimed to know exactly who the headless Romans were. Their chosen method of mystery-solving consisted of the following steps: 1) they looked at the skeletons and theorized about who they were 2) they read about an event that took place in Roman-British history around the same time and place that the skeletons were thought to be from and 3) they conjectured that the headless Romans were none other than the people in the historical event.That is very poor mystery-solving.

My son chews on them occasionally and it actually starts to come off.

They are also cut to the image where the newer puzzles are mere outlines, haphazardly thrown together. I would have promptly returned this puzzle, but my 19 month old son really loves puzzles and saw this and the other 2 puzzles as they were coming out of the box.

The \\"scheme\\" that they are pursuing of making a killing, both literally and figuratively in the \\"parallel market\\" is hard to follow and equally difficult to believe.The bodies are stacking up like cord wood as you work your way through the book, but you find yourself not caring that much and just waiting for the quite predictable ending.

I'm currently using nice 18/8 oneida flatware which is nicer than 18/0 flatware. Why must I go buy bottom of the barrel flatware to use with these plates?! In summary, if you want to buy any Colorwave plates, prepare to either a) have ugly gray-marked plates on your table b) spend at least 30 minutes every day specially cleaning your plates or c) buy cheap flatware and hope that works.

I'll admit it's kind of fun to watch because it's very campy but the story itself is ridiculous. Peter Coyote stars as a lunatic Army colonel who regularly forces his junior officers' wives to have clandestine sex with him in his own private bunker. Courtney Thorne Smith stars as the wife who has the guts to say no.The story has no basis in reality and shouldn't be taken seriously, but I'll admit it kind of has a trainwreck appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining stories out way the time-wasters","review":"This book provides an entertaining read even with the occasional poor story thrown in. The Theme of the book is interesting and several of the stories more than do it justice. The story by Paul Kemp was exceptionally entertaining, and the Lisa Smedman story was also very good. Salvatore's characters are always interesting and, although short, his story was a fun read. There are several others that make the book worth purchasing also, just accept that there will be some stories that will leave you shaking your head in disbelief. This book does prime the pump of interest in the return of the Shadovar adequately to make this an anticipated FR event."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Palatine Families","review":"Henry Z Jones has compilied another super book on the Germans who migrated to the Colonies.

Until the latest Rambo, it was the only hollywood movie that focused on Burma. It actually provides a good sense of the 1988 protests in Burma, although the chronology of events and details are not historically accurate. For example, there are no accounts of a white woman becoming so involved in the protests. Furthermore, it is a one-sided portrayal, casting the military as evil and opposition as all good - but that's not too far from the truth.The movie is at times corny, with stale acting and all too naive Burmese \\"natives.\\" However, a lot of the scenes, particularly during the military's crackdown on the protests, are moving. Furthermore, Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is sublime and really sets the emotional mood.Overall, this is a great movie to watch if you are interested in Burma, but treat it as entertainment, not a history lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Rangoon","review":"I recall seeing this film yrs ago and manily paying attention to the pain of the main charactor,i would very much like to see it again.I have just returned from Thailand where I had the privilege to spent time with some displaced Karen peoples and other Bumese refugees.

If you have nothing to compare it to I guess it would be ok. The cool tip at the end is too small and I kept burning my finger tips. The on/off switch is right where your hand goes so you have to keep switching it back on. It does not get hot enough. If you have a lot of hair don't waste your money. I've gone back to using my conair. Wish it was bigger but it always makes my hair look great! I donated mine to a thrift store.

It's sort of showing signs that he's aging, but who cares...it's Elton! And hey what can I say, Mona Lisa's and Mad Hatters Part 2...he kicks his bench back and is wailing on the piano!

From Im Still Standing, to Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding, Simple Life, Burn Down the Mission, and big rocker of the night Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters Parts I & II. To the touching ending of Song For Guy/Your Song. Elton made the night. The Stage Crew and the Whole lighting crew did a crappy job as well. Elton looks blurry throughout the whole concert and the sound quality is horrible. I would recomend this to any Elton fan though because he gave it his all. I was only dissapointed by the fact that neither Bennie and the Jets, nor Take Me to the Pilot was on the list. Basically Elton Good, Crew Bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elton Video is a big blur","review":"This video is a complete disappointment for Elton. The video is shot in an open stadium where the acoustics are horrible and the lighting is too strong. Too many bugs are flying around and Elton's hairpiece looks like it's blowing off his head. Older concerts should be released where his voice was better and where he could hit the high notes. I suggest that The Elton John Central Park concert be viewed instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this video elton fans.","review":"Thie live elton concert fron 1992 in Barcelona Spain leaves much to be desired.

Using many new instruments (sadly, more electric guitar than acoustic) makes for a different \\"feel\\" to an album, and 'If It Was You' is NOT what we're used to when it comes to Tegan and Sara.With that said, it's still a great album. It's fun. It's poppy. It's in your face. A little disappointing to fans who love their old sound (like myself), but still a great album.Album highlights would include: Monday, Monday, Monday, I Hear Noises, Living Room, And Darling, and Don't Confess.All in all, I'd suggest buying it, whether you're a fan of Tegan and Sara or not.

I bought their album in August just saw them last night in Vancouver. They are just as amazing in person.If it was not for this CD I would of not have made it through my break up with my ex. Their lyrics are strong and real. Tegan and Sara are inspiration for any woman out there. I wish them the best in their career. Why they are not being played on the radio in Vancouver is absurd.Their music in my opinion is as good to my ears as anything I have ever loved or like. I'm an open minded listener.

For all Tegan and Sara fan's \\"If it was You\\" is a much needed album to add to the collection, however it is not their best. This album branches away from \\"Business of Art\\" and marks a beginning in their discovery for their unique sound. This cd includes what I like to call Tegan and Sara classic's such as \\"Monday, Monday, Monday\\" and \\"Not Tonight\\". These catchy, yet very well thought out songs are often heard on You tube as well as mixed CD's and Ipod's of Tegan and Sara fans. Check it out for yourself. Although this is not my favorite Tegan and Sara CD, the dynamics, structure, and emotions behind each song are very well thought out."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't like them? I doubt they care.","review":"With IIWY, Tegan and Sara depart from their folky beginnings (a start the didn't really choose, but felt pressured into...nevertheless..) to a more personal punkish loudness which better fits their personalities. They do what they want on this record, instead of what's expected.A T&S fan since their acoustic days, I was taken aback by this record at first. To tell the truth, I was kind of frightened at the change in their sound. But the more I listened to it, the more I began to appreciate it as a step in a new direction for the duo. Heck, I began to rock out to it a bit, and it was just more FUN than earlier albums.This album is great. Before it, I hadn't really gotten any of my friends to like T&S and the rootsy thing they had. With this album, I pop it in and my punk friends, the rap lovers and the top 40 devotees are all bouncing to it. It's an all around good record, and if you can't appreciate it...well, my condolences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teagn and Sara are a breath of fresh air!","review":"I bought this cd wondering if I really would like it that much. I am always interested in hearing something new so Tegan and Sara intrigued me. What a pleasant surprise it was to find out that they are awesome. I found myself within the first week of my purchase, listening to the cd everywhere, at home, at work, and in the car. My favorite songs are \\"Don't Confess\\", \\"Living Room\\" (the banjo was in my opinion an inspired choice of instrument in this song, it gives the song a slight rustic feel), and \\"Monday, Monday, Monday\\". So if you're intrested in folk music, and canadian chicks that rock, definitely pick up this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"T & S rock!","review":"Tegan and Sara are rock stars. Their lyrics are awesome, their music is addictive, their voices are their own. It's a shame they're not plastered on the cover of every big music magazine out there. It's a shame their video's aren't playing on MTV every 2 minutes. It's a shame they haven't sold out...oh wait...Here's a band that's sold a ton of records not because their faces are everywhere on magazines and television, but because their music is unlike anything you've ever heard before. They're a group unlike any other and they rock. They're just about the music. They kick @$$ and you're missing out on something great if you haven't added them to your cd collection yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"BUY THIS ALBUM! Tegan And Sara Rock!!

If this is supposed to represent \\"growth\\" for them, they have failed completely.

I had the pleasure of seeing Tegan and Sara live at the Vancouver Folk festival just a few months prior to the release of If It Was You. They played many of the songs off the album and i was hooked from that moment. What's amazing is that the album manages to capture the sheer feeling of light heartedness and joy that i felt when listening to them live.This album is a feel good album. Although there are a few songs that are somewhat slower, even they express an overall feeling that is upbeat.

You will waste your time studying unnecessary math and it can hurt your confidence if you haven't already mastered such high levels. As soon as I realized that, I lost confidence in the other parts of the guide. The sample tests are not well written. It is better to use the ETS and ARCO guides.

The math review sections were full of complicated word problems and geometry problems. I could not figure out how to do the problems in the exercises based on the few examples that were given. The list of formulas was helpful but the formulas can be found in better Praxis preparation books. The sections on the reading and writing portions of the Praxis may be helpful to some people, but I did not concentrate on these since I felt confident about my abilities in these areas. I did take the Praxis and I passed all the parts including the math, which worried me the most. I discovered the Cliff's notes Praxis review book a few days before I took the test and I think it did a better job of helping to clear up some of my confusion on the math."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistically tough!","review":"I only used the math part of this book, and I found it very helpful until I got to the section on word and work problems. They only gave a couple of examples with solutions, and then only three \\"drills\\" with no explanations of the answers. The drills were so different and so much harder than the examples that I got very frustrated and started losing confidence until I read some of the other reviews on this book. They verified my experience. I haven't taken the test yet, but compared to the material in other study books I've used, this one is much harder. So I'd recommend the math review except for the last section I mentioned, and keep in mind that the questions seem to be much harder than ones you'll see on the test. If you get freaked out easily, you're better off using a different book!

I like some of the songs, but when I'm in the mood for miss angie, I always find myself going to 100 Million Eyeballs and not Triumphantine.

I tried fooling myself into accepting the quality. Everyone who has seen it loves it and I'm sure there are some of you that could live with and love it. My experience with it is as follows. The video recording is no better than an average digital still camera with video capability. The mic isn't bad on the audio recording. The still pictures are only slightly better than a cheap net cam. The flash is totally out of range or control, say 5 to 6 feet no closer or farther. The mp3 player is terrible. The voice record function is the only acceptable function. Far from a 4.1 megapixel advertised quality. MPEG-4 format out of this camera sucks. Overall, this is a decent quality camera for a kid to goof with and a waste of 100 bucks in my book. Put it towards a decent mini DV camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a cheap toy...","review":"...so why does it cost so much?I got this because it was very small and could be a MP3 player as well as a camera. I was hoping to replace my 1.3Mpixel Kodak digital camera. I'm still using the Kodak.This camera has extremely poor color and focus. Images from it look like they were taken with a cheap webcam. The zoom is entirely digital, so it just makes the bad pictures worse.The MP3 playback is also bad. It does play MP3s, but I found that it had excessive treble and very little bass, so everything sounded tinny.The user interface is not bad for the photo modes, but it isn't very good for playing MP3s, especially if you have a lot of MP3s.I was so disappointed with this that I've entirely stopped using it, in favor of a single-function digital camera that is nearly 5 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"K'Nex Coaster not all thrills","review":"I BOUGHT THIS ITEN FOR MY 13 YEAR OLD FOR CHRISTMAS, SHE SPENT 2 DAYS BUILDING IT AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

Clarke was a great scholar who knew over 20 languages. He read widely on the customs of the ancient world, so he explains cultural references that would escape most of us.More importantly, Clarke's total respect for God's Word and his complete devotion to his Lord are apparent throughout his works. Clarke examines the Bible phrase by phrase and sometimes word by word with an unusual carefulness both for the correct understanding of the text and for the souls of his readers.This is an expositional commentary not a devotional commentary, but Clarke frequently pauses to apply the Scriptures to your life.Clarke was a good friend of John Wesley, and his theological positions are primarily Arminian, but his Commentary will be a tremendous blessing and help to any sincere student of the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frikken awesome and innovative!!!","review":"I come speaking to you as a Hardcore Techno fan.

It is now your turn. I advise you to buy this cd NOW!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"The Berzerker is definitely an incredible band. Their debut album showed the music industry how extreme music can get. This album had the same extremeness of their first one, but not the heaviness. Their first album was very brutal and somewhat dark in a sense. This album was almost a punk-sounding kind of grindcore; It doesnt have the same \\"death metal\\" aspect to it. I bought this album first and thought it was pretty good, but then when I listened to their first album, it put this one to shame. I definitely think that The Berzerker should learn from their mistakes and make their next album more like their first. In conclusion, dont buy this one, buy their first album."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Word: RACKET","review":"The Berzerker are one of the worst bands in so called 'music' history.. ever!

It has led us to have many, many thoughtful discussions on our personal pasts, our growth, our challenges, the role of women - past, present and future - and faith in God by using the chapters as weekly topics and reflecting back on the nuances in the Biblical account of Ruth, Orpah and Naomi.

So I decided I must buy one of his albums. I was looking for a greatest hits type of cd focused more on his earlier stuff.I knew that there was really no chance that a studio performance could match the performance he gave at Woodstock, but I gave it a try anyway. If I close my eyes and try very hard, I can actually see the energy pusling from Joe's body when I listen to this cd. But as I said, I think my expectations were just a bit too high.Still, if you are looking for a soulfull and gritty vocalist, close your eyes and hear what Joe Cocker can do.(Reminded me quite a bit of Jonny Lang if you are looking for a modern comparison)"},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd Coast Reppin....RIP MELLO","review":"\\"The Gift\\" is a classic album by own of the souths greatest Rappers.

I can dry my semi-long hair in about 6 minutes, using the cool shot button, and it is very smooth and shiny. I think it has helped calm the fly-away static electricity this winter, but not completely. Until now, I've bought inexpensive dryers that last about 3 months. I'm hoping that this investment will last a bit longer! My only complaint is that the manufacturer will not warranty the dryer because I bought it through Amazon, which is not a certified dealer.

For such an expensive every day product, a warranty would be nice to have in case anything were to go wrong. I received an email from T3 and a call back both confirming that they do not consider Amazon.com an authorized dealer. When I called Amazon, they had never heard of such a thing. Amazon.com offered to exchange my featherweight tourmaline dryer with another but that did not resolve my issue. I cannot get my T3 Tourmaline Featherweight 83808 hair dryer covered by T3's warranty because it was purchased through Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my hair type","review":"I had been lusting after a T3 forever because of all the rave reviews and finally got one for Christmas. I'm really sad to say that I'm disappointed and am going back to my ionic hairdryer from Sharper Image.To be fair, the glowing remarks about the T3 are written by people with wavy hair that tends to frizz. My hair is long, straight, and shiny, and I blow dry every day for volume. After using it, my hair was shiny, but very limp. I've given up after several tries.The T3 is light, quiet, and looks nice, but I agree with another reviewer regarding the design. When I use it, I tend to knock the switch into the \\"off\\" position because it's right where I grip the handle. Also, the air flow feels very weak to me, which is not really what I need when I'm trying to volumize.I'm sure this is great product for some people, but if you have straight hair, you should save the $150 (or save someone else the money)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick drying time","review":"This lightweight dryer did dry my hair quickly.

So far there have been no problems, it has been working great for me. I used to spend about 10 minutes drying my hair (not too terribly long) and the T3 has brought me down to 5. I like how lightweight it is, but I'm always scared that if it gets mishandled it will break. My only complaint so far is the lack of options for speed and heat. There is hi, low, and cool. I have been using the high option, and as far as I can tell it hasn't been frying my hair as most dryers set at a high speed do, so that is a plus.All I have to say is I'm very happy with it since I've been using it. I just hope it doesn't start to shoot sparks out after a year or two, as I've heard it can from other reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good sourcebook","review":"Okay, so the author probably took a few liberties here and there...this is still a darned good sourcebook for any Amberphile.

It is not a leisurely read. It is an academic book.The book adds much to the historiography of Richard Sibbes. While Sibbes is often seen as a radical non-conforming Puritan who stayed in the Church of England against his conscience, Dever disagrees. He sees Sibbes as a conforming Puritan. He was in the Church of England by choice. Sibbes was able to both be Calvinistic and in the Church of England because, during his younger years, there was a middle ground. This middle ground between the Laudian Church of England and the Puritans was quickly disappearing, but Sibbes taught his conscience to yield to authorities while not agreeing.This book is well written and worth reading. It, however, is not for the casual reader. If you like Dever's preaching and want a book to edify your soul, look elsewhere. If you are interested in church history and want to see how this Puritan giant can speak to your soul, buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good video","review":"this video is the sequel to barbie and the rockers.

I was in first grade and was given this tape as a gift along with other tapes such as lady lovely locks and charlie brown but this was my number one. I wanted to go to outer space like her and got interested in astronomy for a bit. Basically barbie travelled back in time on the way home from her outer space concert and ended up back in the 50's so while they were figuring out a way to go back to the 80's, they were entertaining crowds from that era. Apparently certain musical chords they hit while on the spaceship cause them to travel back into time and they figured that when they do a cape canavaral launching the first ever rocketship to outerspace, they would hit those chords again and be transported back to the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Family","review":"This movie is great especially if you like movies like The Godfather, Avalon, Soul Food.

Thank god I borrowed this from the library! I mean! I was really expceting the second coming of rock here!! And it just did not happen. Then it hit me that when it originally came out I never heard one song on the radio, not even college radio (the second clue!).

Pepper or any Beatles CD is a MORON because this band has no talent compared to the beatles. They have some talent, but not enough to impress me. I must say that some of their tunes are catchy but other than that they are average underground to me.Also, Contuid for Sale sounds like Primus, but in this case, not in a good way.If you really want the 90's version of SGT. Pepper, it's RadioHead...look at their transformation from songs like \\"creep\\" to \\"Motion Picture SOundtrack.\\" Anyways, yeah, Pavement is just another band that making weird music that doesnt sound good, and attracting alot of emo kids and underground kids to it...just Go listen to The Beatles, or Radio Head or Coldplay or even Dave Matthews Band if your looking for talent..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic and definitive example of lo-fi rock","review":"Pavement had a perfect sound forever right here on S&E.

The new edition compiles some stuff that used to be sold seperately or was otherwise hard to find and they're all a boon for anyone who hadn't owned it before.

I ordered this album from my local library just on a whim (I'd listened to Amazon.com samples and was not impressed) to see what if I liked it up close and the real cd. This instantly became one of my fav albums and made Pavement/Malkmus a big part of my life. For me, Pavement is the kind of band you get into \\"phases\\" for and leave alone for a while. Malkmus' lyrics are cryptic to the point of inscrutable and despite the fact that this guy writes completely indecipherable lyrics for the most part, he still has a huge following, so what does that tell you? I know most Pavement fans consider \\"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain\\" to be their best, but I actually prefer this to CR, CR. Every song is amazing and like I said, if you are new to this group and get this album, be prepared to become obsessed and fall in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a Try","review":"I actually bought this album without actually listening to any of it before hand. I bought it because all of the music magazines raved about it and it was a good price and I decided to give it a try. At first I did not care for it too much but with repeat listening it grows on you. Months after, I bought Crocked Rain, Crocked Rain which is there best album and then I Bought the other studio albums and I like them all but wowwe zowwe is a mix bag but it is still a lot better than alot of the rock albums release today. If you like Sonic Youth but do not like how long there songs are and the anoying guitars you would like this album. And if you like Velvet Underground then you will love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr Dyer, the ultimate 18th century hero.","review":"This book has a curious idea, which is treated surprisingly well. It seems to me Miller really knew what he wanted to write about and also possesses the necessary talent. Unlike some other readers, I didn't feel that James Dyer's lack of feelings made him a despisable or repulsive character. I was quite impressed by the way Miller describes his silent self-assurity. I think this novel can be read in many ways. Maybe it tells about how the cruel world can break even the strongest of souls. Dyer didn't die a happy man. He was beaten and destroyed, a shadow of his former self. This is a sad but beautiful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't get into it.","review":"I just could not get into this book.

Now I know you can't trust awards. This work defies genre characterization. It certainly is not a mystery (beyond why anyone would publish it). It is not a thriller. It is not a romance. If any reader can classify it, I would like to hear about it because it stumped me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant novel marred only by a rogue mermaid","review":"Miller's excellent prose and compelling themes made this the best novel I read in 1998. He writes so well, and so historically believable, that my suspension of disbelief left me only once during the novel. When the young James visits his master's mermaid in stagnant fresh waters beneath the grand country house I felt as if someone had substituted a couple of paragraphs from a Jeanette Winterson novel. I have a great admiration for Jeanette Winterson but this kind of fantasy is seemed completely incongruous with anything else in Miller's novel. never mind, still a fantastic read - but why did he do that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting view on what it means to be human","review":"An extremely unique tale of a man born without the ability to experience pain or pleasure - and his journey back into the 'realms' of humanity. Miller stresses the relation between pain/pleasure and conscience/humanity. A little over the top, but a VERY interesting, and at times humorous, book. Read it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unworkable idea","review":"Miller writes beautiful prose, but that's not enough to save this heartless book. Since the protagonist can experience neither pain nor joy, he's doomed to be a pretty boring guy to be around for any length of time. And when sensation does arrive, well, it wasn't exactly worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asks more questions than it answers","review":"Such a promising beginning, but like a wet skrocket, this book just doesn't leave the ground. I felt the author was torn between interesting philosophical issues (pain and human nature) and telliing a good story and ended up doing neither particularly well. There is more than enough material in many of the chapters of this novel for a whole book. However by the end, I felt that the narrative had been stretched to fit the plot and I was hungering for more insight. By the end I couldn't have cared less about the central character. One would like the author to rewrite this book in 3 volumes. It could have been a classic. I hate to think Amazon would lose revenues when you don't buy this book, so try Perfume by Patrick Susskind instead. A similar idea, but much better executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Bite and it Went into the Trash","review":"We were excited for this cake to arrive, thinking that it would be moist, rich and delicious.

Certainly there is some truth to the fact that this happens. However, sometimes it's even worse to be patronizing, to make the woman a bitchy crab and the men consistently awful. This does nothing to span the gap between the sexes, and it makes for a boring, badly written book.In addition. as a musician, I have to take exception to the praise for the musical content. It stinks. I'm sorry. I don't care if Mr. Modesitt is married to a music professor. He has no sense of it in his plotting or writing.This is midlevel fantasy. I wish I liked it better, because I think he had the right intentions."},{"rating":"1","title":"acceptable nighttime fluff","review":"A somewhat pedestrian sequel continuing Anna's travails through what is essentially a fantasy-by-the-numbers world. Anna lurches from crisis to crisis solving them with ruthless efficiency and in doing this, Modesitt has avoided the common tendancy to have a supremely powerful character agonise for chapters before taking action that most of us would realise is inevitable. Don't look to this book for in depth characterisations or novel concepts. Treat it as light reading and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please","review":"How can you take a book with names like \\"Lord Jimbob\\" seriously? The writing is fuzzy and the characters [other than Anna] are one dimensional. Anns is just whiney, unlikable and unsympathetic. Does everyone always have to be the most powerful all the time? Is there ever a character in a fantasy book that doesn't kick ass from the very beginning? And doesn't anyone have a handle on the craft of writing in this genre besides Robert Jordan? There may very well be answers to these questions, but they won't be found in anything by Modesitt.

I'm not usually much on the big tome books. This one is almost 1400 pages, which weighs in at 5 pounds on my bathroom scale. That being said, the text is really tight, the illustrations are cropped, not overwhelming in number, and are used effectively. And the book on the whole does not pander to the reader. The topics are also covered at a reasonable depth.The book is essentially three books, one on the compact framework, one on WinForms and one on database access, all in one book, in a well integrated form.

Coltrane himself plays rather well here, but he is far from the featured artist. Despite the cd title, there were never any Bethlehem \\"years\\" at all. Coltrane simply sat in as a backup horn during a few sessions in the late fall of 1957 for other recording artists. He takes solos, but only a few.

If you like Rap and the type of music that is on Dance Mix usa than this is good for you. My favorites on this album though are Inner Circle with Bad Boys (theme from cops) Even though this is old it is one of the few reggae songs on the album. Diana King with L-L-Lies is cool. Patra featuring YO-Yo was cool if there was no rapping in the song. Super Kat was cool too.

Beenie Man, who on average, has 2-3 of the top 10 hits in Jamaica, isn't even on this album. It goes to show how smart he is.

Unlike many concerts DVDs that are cut and spliced to give the \\"best\\" performances, this one also offers a few of the moments that are unexpected and aren't \\"perfect\\". Just face it....live performances are never perfect, which is what contributes to them being so special...you never know what may happen and what may be said! U2 are brilliant, as always. I see little problem with the editing of the DVD. While there are a few moments when the camera could have focused more on one target, I didn't find this distracting. In fact, for some songs, it is necessary, contributing to the effect of actually being at a show. Sound quality is superb.

Slane spares you most of the rants and song for song it's far better. Buy both (you should) as the new material, particularly City of Blinding lights and Miracle Drug is terrific. Older material like Electric Co. and An Cat Dubh, as well as material not often played like Zoo Station and The Fly is really awesome, although I would have like to heard Party Girl which didn't make the cut.I saw the tour in Philadelphia a week after the Chicago recording and even there I thought they were better than on this DVD. A glaring ommission to the lineup is End of the World - a really great song live - buy Slane Castle and see!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bono is messed up","review":"I am a huge U2 fan, but this dvd was horrible because of Bono's performance.

Sad but true.After watching this I have to point out that if U2 hadn't performed this concert or if this concert were performed by an unknown band, then this DVD would not have been thought worht even pressing. Really, the performance is so ordinary, inoffensive, cheap, thin and instantly forgettable that I can't stand watching it complete even twice.Now we are not even wondering whether U2 had any relevance in today's music... the answer is simple: Everything You Know Is Wrong"},{"rating":"2","title":"best show ever","review":"ok...i went to my first u2 show ever...and this was one of the ones recorded...lemme tell ya, it was probably one of the most amazing experiences of my life...most definately buy this dvd...ive already got my order in!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a U2 fan, I was a bit disappointed by this DVD. It's not that the sound or quality is bad, but the performance itself is just lacking. Bono just doesn't sing as well anymore and his voice begins to crack halfway through the show. The band plays like clockwork, but that's the problem--it's just business as usual.

Get a clue. They never played Bad, WOWY, Until The End Of The World, or Party Girl in the two shows they taped. Those shows were May 9 and 10. All but the last two songs are from May 10. The last two are from May 9 due to Vertigo being played twice on May 10. You would probly complain if they had Vertigo on there twice. Oh and Bonos voice is much better now than on PopMart, duh duh duh. His voice sounded strained and weak on PopMart. Bono even admits this in th Rolling Stone interview. I do agree about Elevation Boston though, way overproduced and forced. This will not be like that. May 10 was a great show. I was there, it rocked end of story. The crowd was very into it being Bonos birthday and all.

The show is plagued with fast close-up after fast close-up, often at wierd angles. Bono seems to be enjoying himself, but his performance is uncontrolled, slightly sloppy, and even maybe a little obnoxious. Plus, vertigo is not one of the best U2 albums, so the song selection is a little week.

Although the video was shot over two nights in Chicago, they kept some of the imperfections that go along with a live performance.

U2 is a very unique band. There are very few groups that receive the adulation that they get from their audience. The Grateful Dead comes to mind. As a result, they get really comfortable on stage and make some gaffes. It's only natural. But once you get past that, the four guys from Dublin kick into great form, as you'd expect. They have a terrific catalogue, and they display it with no embarrassment. Bono and Edge rule their stage like the pros they are; Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen keep it together, and there you have it: a great show preserved on some digital plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please retire - I can't take anymore!","review":"I bought this DVD for a friend, and, for some stupid reason, agreed to watch it with her. Just what I wanted to see - four middle-aged men prancing around onstage like a bunch of megalomaniacal idiots. I must admit that I respect Bono for his humanitarian work, but watching him onstage was like listening to someone rake their fingers down a chalkboard. I couldn't help but cringe whenever the camera was pointed at him. The worst part is that when he's gone, I'll still have to put up with Bono Jr. aka Chris Martin (Did anyone see the Grammys? Enough said.) It also doesn't help that their last album was horrible (Vertigo and Love & Peace were the only decent songs). Even the drummer seemed embarrassed to be a part of this travesty. Poor guy.

The stars of this show are Rain and Tangier. Against competition of that nature, Mr. Dyar's transformation seems inevitable. Once again, Bowles' sense of place completely subsumes the reader into a land so foreign and so complete that we feel the damp and smell the ocean. We watch as Dyar morphs, Kafka-like, into something less than human. Or maybe human of a very different sort. It's fascinating to watch, and still a little baffling. Bowles is masterful here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Promising Path...","review":"Paul Bowles' Let it Come Down is a footpath into the woods which appears promising at its entrance, but eventually peters out. Our protagonist, Dyer, arrives friendless in post-war Tangier and quickly finds the love of his life (a prostitute), and his true calling (illicit currency exchange). He navigates past the expatriate shoals and the native doldrums, and experiences his first original thought (steal the money) when he arrives too late at the foncier. You figure out \\"foncier\\" from context, but the trail narrows further and eventually the context peters out, too. The trail's end is a hashhish induced torpor in which childhood memories erupt and the essense of irrationality is explored. No worry; we're sitting on a sunny terrace outside Thani's wife's family's shack in the hills of the Spanish Zone, the policia seem to be several miles away, and the birds are singing.

This is a remake, duh!) The movie IS a lot of fun; Robin Williams and Nathan Lane were delightful in their portrayal of the gay couple, and Agador (aka Chief Wiggum/Apu/Moe from the Simpsons) adds the silliest note in the movie.

Where has the warmth between them- actually- where was the warmth from Robin? I don't see why his partner would love him as he was verbally abusive and the only warmth I saw was one tiny scene where he actually holds his partners hand for one whole second! Robins was miscast in this role - it would be better if someone else had his role. Then maybe we could have an actual believable love between the couple. Otherwise this is just mainstream media trying to make a buck of the gay community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired","review":"When Hollywood seeks to remake a Foreign Film, it is usually pretty bad. Case and point is The Birdcage. This movie is a flaccid retelling of La Cage aux Folles. Robin Williamns and Nathan Lane never acheive chemistry for you to believe for one moment that they are lovers. Lane lacks the the charisma to pull of Michel Serrault's role, and he never seems comfortable. Gene Hackman actually stands out in this movie and brings dimension to a character that could have been just one dimensional. He manages to bring charm and some needed humor to this otherwise stale movie. Most unfuriating is Robin Williams who seems to tread out his usual limp wrist routines to the point of being tiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Birdcage","review":"I also bought the movie The Birdcage and I can Not watch it because it's not for american TV i AM VERY DISAPPOINTEDand I don't know how to send it back"},{"rating":"1","title":"Birdcage [VHS]","review":"I had no idea My favorite movie was going to be a VHS instead of DVD.

The REALLY slow pacing of the story, not to mention the absolutely obnoxious son of two gay men who seem so I'll suited to one another, and Nathan Lane's over-the-top, whinning queen act get tired very fast. What exactly is so funny about two gay men having to hide everything about themselves to please a hateful, right-wing Republican? So if you're a straight, WASP-ish Republican bigot, then all is good? Why do gay men always have to be the brunt of the joke? Maybe straight audiences in 1996 thought this was hysterical, but in 2008 it's just plain old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best, by far...","review":"Robin Williams is one of my favorite comedians, but this movie was somewhat disappointing for me, even though there are a number of hilarious scenes in it. The gay Guatemalan house\\"maid\\" is absolutely hilarious and the fact that ultra right wing colleague of moral majority politician Gene Hackman died while visiting an under age, black prostitute made me howl with laughter.Unfortunately, Robin Williams is not able to play a convincing homosexual man with a long-standing relationship. I have never seen a homosexual couple where there was so much distance between the men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than popeye the sailor","review":"Robin Williams is a talented guy, can do comedy and serious.

Skip it and see La Cage aux Folles instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funniest Thing I saw All Week","review":"The birdcage is a beautifully camp film based on an original French story.

I guess it all has to do with the subject matter and not the movie. People think, \\"Wow, drag queens, it must be funny.\\" I don't think I laughed more than twice during the entire ordeal. When this movie wasn't boring it was sentimental. Robin Williams does his usual mugging one moment and cries the next. I hated the character of the selfish, bossy son and the way everyone bends to his every whim. I can understand the character of Albert being a little whiny and needy but he was just overdone by Nathan Lane. The whole thing was just too stereotypical to me. It could have used a little slapstick or some TRUE absurdity. There are much better mistaken identity type films out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Gay Humor","review":"Not really quite sure what anyone saw in this turkey.

And may I add that, while not having a HUGE role, Hank Azaria as the gay butler is just brilliant! This film has laughs from start to finish and just never stops. I loved it, have watched it over and over and will continue to watch it until something better (not gonna happen) comes along!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"It's hard to explain what makes this movie so great. Perhaps it's the amazing cast of characters which include: Robin Williams, Gene Hackman, Nathan Lane, Calista Flockhart, and many, many more.

Robin (my favorite actor) and Nathan Lane must have had a blast working with each other.

Now that son wants to get married to a girl with EXTREMELY conservative parents, and the two men have to tone it down a little.

The first player to make it all the way around the lily pads and back home wins. It is a really cute game for kids. I would say nice for kids anywhere between 3 and 10.The game is very nicely made.

The players who were able to sit still soon realized that there is a strategy to the game. I love the memory aspect because it keeps older siblings interested enough to sit through a game with their froglet siblings and friends. A great birthday gift!

We have Pengaloo and that game is way more fun because the Penguins are all the same that cover the colored eggs so you must really pay attention.

The characters and situations were very vivid and despite the abnormal quality of Charles family and there situation readers will identity with feelings of outcast and loneliness.

Close listening shows you how Mr. Gould changed his stylistic interpretation in those 26 years. It's not just the notes that are written in the score, as Mr. Gould so characteristically shows us -- it is how those notes appeal to the performer at a given time. Even if you have another recording of the Goldberg variations, get this one, and see for yourself why you don't need any others.Stuart Gustafson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfy your comparative impulse","review":"This set affords the fascinating experience of comparing two extremely diverse performances of the Goldberg Variations and of observing the evolution and maturation of Gould's understanding. I think the 1981 interpretation is the clear winner, but both are riveting. Still, I would gladly trade in this final product of his short career if he would have just completed his recording of the Art of Fugue on organ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glenn Gould should not get a free pass","review":"Ok. Glenn Gould *is* very good indeed (almost as good as Dong-Hyek Lim), but, all the same, he should not be given a free pass by his devotees. I will be the curmudgeon who awards the recording just two stars, not because of his (often eccentric but always interesting) interpretations, but because of his G-d d--n *humming*, for heaven's sake. Music is all about sound, and Gould's annoying and deliberate humming (especially audible in the 1981 set) spoils all his recordings. If the set was entitled \\"Sing Along With Glenn\\" I'd give it at least four stars, but it isn't titled that.I'm prepared to be awarded \\"0 out of 600 people found the following review helpful\\".

This 3-disc package includes Glenn Gould's 1955 recording of the Goldberg Variations, with raw exuberance and breakneck speed. Disc 2 contains his 1981 reinterpretation, and this music has never sounded more divinely beautiful to this perpetual Bach student. Disc 3 is icing on the cake, featuring Gould's professorial zeal and musical logic (also lame but endearing humor). If you love the Goldberg--and I passionately hope you will--then curiosity will lead you to superb piano versions by Andras Schiff and Murray Perahia, and Wanda Landowska on the harpsichord. For further Bachian \\"wonder,\\" Artur Schnabel's recording of the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue is awesome. Gould's Bach, however, remains my favorite. As for the brouhaha about his sometimes audible humming, I love it: Glenn lives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Goldberg","review":"I like the 1981 recording the best, but both are wonderful. There is also a video of the 1981 recording. Gould was a very unique person, and I appreciate him for being himself and playing what he was best at: Bach. I can't listen to Bach for as long as I can Chopin, but this is an invaluable historical recording worthy of owning for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good - an interesting meditation on the \\"Classic\\" world","review":"It's brilliantly played, as the other reviewers have already pointed out. What's interesting to note is that the commercial death (or massive withering) of orchestral and other \\"classical\\" music can be illustrated here:Bach must have written these pieces essentially as \\"jams\\", progressions of the same melodic themes. Think of it as Jazz, or some of the free-style jams known to musically-competent bands from the 1960s. But most modern non-pop music in this vein always insists on being reproduced note by note, and takes the absolute talent of a Gould to showcase any noticable variation. I wonder how Bach would have responded to the quasi-religous adherence to note by note submission by lesser talents than Gould."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing playing but","review":"Glenn Gould has mastered the Bach, Goldberg Variations with out a question of doubt. His playing and style is absolutely amazing. The part that spoils the whole thing for me is when he starts humming. If you listen to it with the head phones on you can hear him humming away in the back ground. It is such a shame as he spoils his own brilliant performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it just me ?","review":"The CDs sounded just fine on my laptop, but when I was listening to the 1981 recordings on my ipod mini there it was, loud as a leaky faucet and just as distracting: Gould humming along as he played ! At first I figured I was hearing things, but it became increasingly difficult to ignore the constant \\"hmm hmm hmm\\"s that kept fading in and out like some sort of auditory tease. Is anyone else experiencing the same problem ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trying to get on the \\"soy is good for you\\" bandwagon?","review":"Yeah, me too... Did not grow up with soy and soy products actually, but my mom had used it in her kitchen when I was little. Since my mom lives in Europe, I can't really go to her for every little advice on cooking with soy so I decided to get me the cookbook with best reviews at the time, and I purchased this one...It has a wealth of information though regarding soy and soy products. You will be able to whip up some tasty meals including this veggie wonder that helps you stay young and strong, and cancer free (as long as you use organic soy products).This is a cookbook with no pictures! Why? That is why I took off one star.To your health!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give a zero.....","review":"I've received this book as a gift, tried some recipes without success, then discovered what soy really is.....an unhealthy monster...so it ended in the paper garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soy is no good, for people with immune disorders","review":"IF you have an immune disorder like hypothyroidism, soy is not your friend. It can cause allergies, weight gain (severe weight gain), aches, pains, headaches, nausea, tiredness, and the list goes on. Please do your research before deciding to consume soy. I loved soy for years and ate it in the form of tofu, soy milk, veggie burgers, veggie dogs, etc. and it only did damage to my body. I know several people whom soy did damage to them, but yet to find one person soy helped someone. I think it is whoever is behind the \\"soy industry\\" that is making the health claims of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soy is an ANTI-nutrient","review":"I wonder if the author of this cookbook is aware of the mounting evidence of the dangers of soy. Go to the reviews of \\"The Whole Soy Story\\" by Kaayla T. Daniel, and you will see that the hyped claims of soy are just that. It will not be long before soy is recognized for what it is: an anti-nutrient. Most of the way soy is processed is so far gone from nature, that the human body cannot assimilate it. It is a myth that Asians consume lots of soy; what they do is in the form of miso, tempeh, soy sauce (which are all fermented and properly prepared), and miniscule amounts of tofu."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNY","review":"I had seen this movie on VHS many years ago and wanted to share it with my family. Great laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"an honest feel good movie","review":"Bustin Loose is one of the best \\"feel good\\" movies I have ever seen in my 44 years. Richard Pryor's true heart came out in this movie. He was obviously very talented, as we all know. the fact that he wrote and produced this movie says it all. Him and Cicely Tyson together in this movie was perfect. Along with Silver Streak, this is my absolute favorite movie with him in it. If you just want to watch a movie to make you feel good, then watch Bustin Loose. You will feel good. I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for \\"pryor fans\\"","review":"A very touching story about a group of kids who has special problems and the one woman who actually cares about their well-being played by Cicley Tyson.

After that, see if you can stand listening to this one. There is no way."},{"rating":"2","title":"You People Must Be Gettin' Tired!!!","review":"I've been a Saxon fan since '82. I saw them in a club (The Inferno, Buffalo NY) in '87. And anyone who rates this 4 Star Release @ 1 Star should have been in the way in Dallas @ 12:59 PM 1n '63. In no way does this sound like slapped together Metal. Some of the best lick's & Biff's heart felt lyrics are within!!!Rock Hard, Rock Free or Leave!!!!.....JRK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever pedestrian...","review":"Still finding their feet after their obnoxious glam / hair metal phase of the middle-eighties, Saxon returned to a more traditional heavy metal sound in SOLID BALL OF ROCK. FOREVER FREE follows that direction, but with one unpleasant surprise: the album is simply bad. No imagination. Boring, pedestrian and one of the worst entries ever in the otherwise generally very good Saxon catalog. The songs are lifeless, the playing is going through the motions. Only with UNLEASH THE BEAST (1997) would Saxon recover their former glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saxon can do much better than this","review":"It's a mystery to me how anyone can give this album 5 stars! But since that clearly can be done, I just wonder how many stars are you handing out to \\"Denim and leather\\" and \\"Strong arm of the law\\"?\\"Forever free\\" is a mediocre Saxon album comparable with \\"Solid ball of rock\\"\\". It's not as radio oriented as some of their other albums (when Saxon tried to break into the American market) but it's far from the heights shown on the masterpiece \\"Denim and leather\\" or the more recent and excellent \\"Unleash the beast\\". On this album, you'll find a couple of good songs, especially \\"Forever free\\", but you'll also get to hear a lot of average tunes. The production is rather bad (at least on my not remastered copy). Although I like the fact that Biff and his gang refuse to give up, I can't give this release anything higher than 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool no matter what stage of organized you are!","review":"This book is a great tool for everyone.

Unfortunately, the authors are overly chatty and seem rather thrilled with the idea of expounding not only the system, but stories about themselves and family ad nauseum.

I read it when it first came out some years ago and it really helped me get better organized.

I hve been using the 3x5 method for about 6 months now. My house isn't immaculate, by any means, but it is a lot better and a lot easier to maintain. It is really easy to file the cards away without actually doing the job...and that is my vice right now, but it is also easy to do the jobs once you've broken them down a bit. It takes a lot of effort, but it is worth reading and trying. If it doesn't work for you.. try FlyLady.net.

That would take me atleast a full week, and then I would have to go through each one and do the chore it lists. If I had all of that time I wouldn't need a book to help me get back in organization. I was very upset with all the great reviews this book got. Next time I will check out my books at the library before purchasing them. I guess you live and learn.

However, I was very dismayed to find that the only thing different in this book is ONE chapter (about 8 pages) pertaining to using a database program on your home computer instead of the 3x5 card system. They only say that they like Lotus Notes but that other database programs are available....in other words, it's not an instructional chapter on HOW to use the database, just that it's an option.

I generally think of myself as an organized person, so I didn't know how much I would learn. I learned a lot. The most important aspect was being in control of the household instead of the other way around. Instead of everything staring me in the face each morning saying, \\"This needs to be done,\\" and \\"Do this task first,\\" I now have a plan. I know ironing will be on every other Thursday, so I don't have to worry about it on the other days. That's the way it is for every job around the house. The authors are funny and endearing.

California Boys, unfortunately, doesn't represent the Roberts' style or subjects that I was hoping to see again. Within the pages of this--admittedly--well presented book is a collection of teeny-boppers and twinks that might represent the period, but not the style that I so fondly remembered. Only a four-page spread of model Gary Seegar represented the Roberts that I had longed to see again.

As the author tries to assist the athlete in getting in the proper mindset for athletic performance, the reader is left chuckling at the pathetic Luther, instead.For those that were fortunate to not know Eston personally, this book reveals his flawed characteristics as an exaggerator with a warped sense of thinking. For those who were less fortunate to know him, this book confirms his persona.Long story short... Eston lived in our dorm in college and one night we had a chef come over and cook a fantastic Tex-Mex dinner for the house. Instead of consuming this delicious food, I decided to launch my nachos and enchiladas at his door and wasn't finished until I painted his door with guacamole and sour cream.

He explains clearly the imaginary concepts that liberals conceive their ideals. He illustrates the roots that took shape in the 1960s that evolved into the leadership coming of age today. He exposes very well the outcomes of the law, Affirmative Action and public education. He also demonstrates common sense rules to live by that would create an orderly society. Mr. Evans was of the hippie culture of the 1960s. He later understood the irrational thinking that this liberal ideology would bring about. His book is an easy to read guide to the trends our country has been on for the past 40 years.

I'll guard it with my life if need be."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a favorite of mine","review":"Many years ago, a friend passed her copy of this book to my mother. She read it and passed it to me. That book has travelled around the world with me. It is always a pleasure to reread. Some parts of it always make me cry and one part--the bit with the little girl and the train explosion and the line, \\"You will be lead by light to the place where darkness began\\"--always gives me chills. I've got chills just remembering it though it's been years since I last read it. I think it's time to find my copy again.Maybe with the success of Mel Gibson's movie, \\"The Passion Of The Christ\\", and the popularity of the Left Behind books, there is hope for this book to be reprinted and that movie to be made."},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as before...","review":"I first read this book when I was in high school. In fact, it was the one that started my love of reading books that has lasted over three decades.Charles Sailor delivers a wonderful, thought provoking read. It is as entertaining as any of the currant main stream writers of today and is still as thought provoking as when first published.It was also fun to enjoy a story that takes place before the many of today's \\"essentials\\" existed (cell phones, computers, fax machines...)After finishing \\"The Second Son\\" a second time, I just wonder why Sailor was not published again.

Back then (while in my late teens) I thought it was completely ordinary, an interesting idea but not a great book in and of itself. Someone lent me a copy recently and out of curiosity I read it again. Boy, was I disappointed. The plot is ridiculous (hidden CIA informants, world conspiracies, ancient prophecies), the characters are cardboard cutouts and the \\"message\\" is about as subtle as a brick falling on your head.I noticed that the cover blurb said \\"Soon to be a major motion picture.\\" Looks like the producers came to their senses in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"i want this book back","review":"this is the best novel thats been writen. i hope the author reprints it. i will buy the first copy. one of the only novels i would love to read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a MUST read and then re-read!","review":"Like everyone else I was first exposed to this book in the early 80's. I wore my first copy out and then never got my second copy back and my third sits on my brother-in-laws shelf as he won't return it. I was able to get a (what I believe a REALLY rare) hard cover copy that was only for a book club, which I have just started reading again. If you get a chance to read this book, DO NOT PASS IT UP!

Linda Chaikin writes in exciting, refreshing style and her plots are very well thought-out. Coral Kendall, an English silk heiress born and raised in India, adopts a young native boy, an \\"untouchable\\"... a child of the lowest caste of India. When he is kidnapped, she must seek the aid of her brother's friend, Captain Jace Buckley. They're still in the middle of an adventure at the end and so you have to go out and get the next book. The series is like one huge book actually. In some series, each novel could stand on its own and each book is a separate adventure. Linda Chaikin's series are like really long stories...that are thrilling and fun. There's hardly any boring, \\"skim-through-the-pages\\" parts, which is a plus.

In this track you will see how talented Sharyn is. This album gets 5 ++++ Stars from me because one, the production was clean and modern and two, Sharyn wrote all the songs on this album!

It has sections on Service, Batting, Baserunning, Pitching, Fielding, Miscellaneous....in just the Regular Season section alone. Additional sections are Division Series, Championship Series, World Series, All Star Game. The book has lifetime records of the top significant events, ie, GP, BA, 20yr player and pitcher, >.300, .>300 10 times or more, SLG, AB, R, H, Dbl, Trpl, HR, PHR, Grand Slams, and on and on..... It also has team information, club records and individual records per team, back to the year, naught. There is a LOT of information in this book. I have carried this book with me everywhere for the past 2 weeks, and everybody I know who likes baseball has sat for at lease 20 minutes with the book.

Best known for the big hit \\"Baby Love\\" (not the Supremes song), this guilty pleasure has Regina deciding to call up a boy after her parents leave her home alone. Though the premise of this song is somewhat suggestive, there are no vulgar lyrics in it, and the beat is catchy as hell. The 12 inch version, which can be found on the 1987 Atlantic compilation Dance Traxx, Vol. 2, is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"She could actually sing...","review":"Some say she was a \\"Madonna\\" clone. I guess due to the fact the they both used the same producer for their hits, Stephen Bray, and their voices and style were similar. But the difference is Regina could sing. She had a bit of a soulful range that Madonna couldn't match. Unfortunately Madonna's marketing saavy beat out substance like it usually does with most singers, including the late Teena Marie, who didn't sound like Madonna at all. But again, this album, though it's very pop oriented, is very likeable. Unfortunately, Regina didn't do a follow-up to this album and who knows of her whereabouts. A very good album that unfortunately, along with the singer, has gone into the box of obscurity.

This is a \\"must have\\" for Halloween, but you can watch it throughout the year as it sends children a message that they should never give up. The video - a few dollars, getting an important message across to you children while they're enjoying a great video - priceless!! Get yours today; you won't be disappointed.

That way I wouldn't have to wait to receive the power supply if I did, and could get right to work converting VHS tapes to DVD.But, I quickly learned after hooking up the Canopus 77010150100 to my computer, I wasn't going to need the power supply to run the converter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big on science, but not much of a biography","review":"I've been a fan of Carl Sagan's popularization of science since the \\"Cosmos\\" days. I agree he wasn't the most brilliant scientist around, but he did more to make people interested in astronomy than any scientist of his generation and beyond.This biography goes way too far into the scientific realm, but doesn't tell me much about Sagan as a man. As a student of astrophysics (a hobby, not a career for me), I found the science interesting, but it wasn't why I bought this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a little shallow","review":"This is a very readable biography of astronomer Carl Sagan. Although he did a poor job on Sagan's childhood, the author dug up a wealth of interesting facts about his life. The one problem I had with this book was that Poundstone ignored the \\"themes\\" that reappeared throughout Sagan's life, or at least didn't point them out. Read along with Keay Davidson's biography of Sagan, which has fewer facts but more connections."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I've been a big fan of Sagan's since I watched Cosmos when I was a teenager. This book was interesting and I learned a lot, and I can certainly recommend it. But I believe that Poundstone put a positive spin on things that the reader could have decided for himself. I also was turned off somewhat by the style of the book. Each chapter contained little mini-chapters that talked about one incident or idea. It is almost like reading 350 pages of factoids. It makes the book a fast read, but it feels a little thin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the Stars","review":"I was more influenced by his books then TV appearances on Cosmos, which was a great show. The book really made me smile and reminded me of what was great about the scientist and the man. As we all are, he was mortal and flawed and this book did not try to hide either. It's possible Sagan's final note to us all was his article at the end of the now defunct George magazine. In it, he looked foreward and encouraged us all to take better care of our planet and fellow inhabitants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corruption Exposed","review":"Like Mr. Nadin's former profession this book is fast paced and to the point. The author doesn't pull any punches or sugar coat a thing. What he talks about is an everyday reality that no one wants to recognize. It will only stay with us and fester and grow as long as people turn a blind eye to the issues, and do not exercise their right to vote. I give this book three and a half stars. It's enjoyable and entertaining. It's just too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"A word of caution!","review":"I gave 4 stars because these blinds were perfect, but I cannot use them! I live in the East where we have moderate humidity, and unfortunately, I suffered condensation on the windows on my doors after I installed the blinds. ODL informed me their blinds do not cause condensation, and I agree! Weather causes condensation! But the result was that I could not use the blinds. The staff at ODL was very helpful and tried their best to talk me through the fixes, but the only remedy for me would be to get a whole-house dehumidifier. That wasn't an option I could undertake. The customer support and the return process were excellent. I would gladly do business with ODL again. Amazon sells hygrometers, (which measure moisture in the air), for around $10, so if you need to test the humidity in your building, that may be an easy method to determine your humidity level. ODL will advise you what the recommended humidity level should be when using their blinds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I was looking for a modern, simple and functional window cover. This is exactly what I needed. Product as described and arrived promptly.

Would definately recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another book that has the soulmate myth in its midst","review":"If I hear the word \\"soulmate\\" one more time, I will scream. That is the most stupid idea I have ever heard of...Somewhere out there is \\"the other half of your being\\"...So Im walking around right now only 1/2 half and I dont even know it...or maybe Im 1/2 emtpy, depending on my mood. This book says \\"you too can meet and attract your soulmate\\"...it is chalk full of the traditional crap...err new age ideology. This is a waste of your time, if you want to find your soulmate, the only place to look is in the mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great screen, I'm a bit nervous about the electronics","review":"This is a great screen. It's matte white surface should work with almost any projector. The motorized operation is quiet and smooth. I did not find the fact that the receiver box is on the cord the least bit annoying as some reviewers did. I simply hid the cord and used the RF remote (the unit comes with 2 remotes, IR and RF).However I did notice a electronic \\"buzzing\\" noise one day when I walked over by the screen. It stopped when I touched the middle \\"stop\\" key on the remote, but still you may want to make sure that you hit this button after retracting the screen. Other than that this is a great product for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't receive the product","review":"After a month waiting for the order, and lots of massages to Circuit City, I received the infirmation that the product had returned to their deposit. So, I canceled the order and bought another one (Elite), directly from Amazon. It was received in two days...About Circuit City, at least I received the information that I will get a full refound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evidence of things considered thoughtfully","review":"On one level, it is an insightful, moving portrait of complex relationships between an amateur scientist, his impulsive best friend, his wife, and his son. Although each character is uniquely and vividly drawn, each is also a symbol, and their lives act as metaphors for larger themes: the price of scientific and technological progress, the American Dream, and the enduring power of love. Set between the two world wars, the novel weaves personal tragedy with large-scale tragedy, as the protagonist unwittingly contributes to both the sickness of his wife and the development of the atomic bomb. The narrative is poetic and the dialogue has convincing, rural Southern voices. Though references to Moby Dick are a bit of a stretch, the novel ultimately touches both the heart and the mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty spectacular","review":"Wiggins does a masterful job of intertwining historical themes (American exceptionalism; ethical traps posed by 20th century scientific advances) with larger themes of love and death. But the book has tremendous heart, her characters are not historical constructs but as alive as people you know. Her prose is lyrical, but always inviting, never pretentious. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite Fillmore, but still good","review":"For those of you who crave the old sound of the Allman Brothers, this album may not be for you. But for the newer generations who are into Derek Trucks this is an amazing album. The quality of it is decent, and it was recorded recently which also means that it is composed of newer tracks. While most prefer the older ones, these are still quite excellent. This depicts the band as they are today which is nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you'd expect","review":"This is worth it for Desdemona-listen to Derek Trucks' solo-great modal jazz-type soloing by him. I wasn't sure what to expect because I hadn't listened to the ABB in about 10 years, but this version of the band has pretty much dropped the country sound and returned to the heavy blues with jazz feeling from the Duane era. This means more improvisation, and more INTERESTING improvisation (although I do miss Dickey's solos). Derek Trucks is the best guitarist that I have heard who is still alive and playing vital music today. If you haven't yet, you have to check him out, with the ABB and with his own band. Amazing talent. This album would get 5 stars if they left off the way overdone and not-interesting-anymore Statesboro Blues and Trouble No More. Get an Instant Live with Afro-Blue or Gilded Splinters on it and hear just how good the ABB is now"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blistering Hot","review":"It's 100 degrees outside today and the cd I'm listening to is even hotter. After several mediocre live projects the Allman Brothers Band has finally produced a worthy successor to Live At The Fillmore East in this brilliant collection of songs from their annual run at New York's Beacon Theatre. Gregg is in fine voice, and the interplay between guitarists Derek Trucks and Warren Haynes is almost telepathic. Bassist Oteil Burbridge is one of the rare players who can both hold the bottom and add a melodic component and the three headed drum section never lets up. Highlights include both classics such as Statesboro Blues and newer tunes from their last studio CD Hittin' The Note such as Desdemona."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Worthy Live Album","review":"Could there possibly be a reason for another live Allman Brothers release? The answer to that question is \\"absolutely\\"! Springtime at the Beacon Theatre is an annual ritual and \\"One Way Out\\" catches them on fire. I can't say enough about the guitar tandem of Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks. A lot of bands can't claim even one guitarist who can match Haynes and Trucks lick for lick. The best reason for buying this album is the live versions of the \\"Hittin The Note\\" material. \\"Desdemona\\" and \\"Instrumental Illness\\" stand out in particular. Dip your hands in your pockets and shell out the coins for this one. It'll prove to you that the Allman Brothers are still one of the greatest American bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing but predictable","review":"One of the best lineups of this legendary band, the playing is second to none and the sound quality is amazing. My only complaint is the same as the first reviewer, the song selection is quite disapointing to say the least. Having seen two shows from the 2003 tour and hearing them play Layla and Into The Mystic,I figured at least Layla would make the cut. Other than that, Greg has NEVER sounded better, Warren and Derek are on fire, Oteil is a machine and Butch, Jaimoe and Marc are untouchable. This is a great CD but the track selection could have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"They keep getting better.","review":"Although the Filmore concerts will never be topped, this live set from the best live band ever is as good as it gets.I hope the Allman Brothers road does go on forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"great guitars, weak singing","review":"Very good album, with a lot of classic songs as well as some of their newer material. Warren and Derek are awesome on guitar, as is the rest of the band. But Greg's voice is the weak link in this performance. Don't know if he was just having a bad night or if age is weakening his voice.The quality of the recording was very good for a live production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allman's Rule!","review":"One Way Out is the best live disc from the Allman's since \\"Live at the Filmore East\\".Recorded at The Beacon in 2004 it features a great mix of old and new tunes.The sound is fantastic!Buy it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An undiscovered gem","review":"I have owned this CD for years but never REALLY listened to it until I heard them do \\"Disconnected\\" and \\"Everybody lay down\\" in concert, both of those songs rock like nothing she ever has done. I gave it a spin and discovered \\"Somebody's baby\\" could have been a top 40 hit. Tradin' down, Ties that bind both SMOKE! This is different in the aspect that it is LOUDER and HEAVIER than Pat and Neil usually do, I don't think the exec's knew how to market it. For the price this is worth the dough as long as your not looking for them doing blues or pop. THIS ROCKS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sales mean squat","review":"For some reason, this album didn't top the charts. But I'm telling you Pat fans out there, this is tops. She still proves that she's got the best pipes in the business. Quite a wide range in the style of songs, from ballads to classic Benatar/Geraldo rockers. And in her own subtle way, she packs an emotional punch that still floors me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All of her music is great.","review":"Pat Benetar doesn't have a bad song. I am trying to locate another one that seemingly has dropped off of the face of the earth. I think it is \\"Le Bel Age\\" from the mid or late 80's. Any help out there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"GRAVITY'S RAIN'BLAH'......","review":"I love Pat Benatar's music, even when she wants to veer off from 'typical' PB sound... I loved all her albums to some degree or other from 1979 to 1988... TRUE LOVE is alright and her voice is truly amazing BUT it wasn't my 'kind' of music so I got a bit tired of that CD real quick... GRAVITY'S RAINBOW has some good points like SOMEBODY'S BABY, EVERYONE LAY DOWN, CRAZY, YOU AND I and EVERY TIME I FALL BACK but the rest though not awful, by any means, just seems like a poor attempt to recapture the hard rockin' songs she is known for in the past but this time it falls flat... This is the album I listen to the least, with exception to the above mentioned songs... Her following album, INAMMORATA, is 100 times better and prettier so spend your dough on that effort... Not awful, but not that good either... BUT Pat is still considered, in my opinion, the best singer from the 80's and she gets better, though, even if some of her 90's efforts are less than stellar..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much, too late","review":"This is an exceptional album that was fated to disappear into the vacuum of a music industry for whom Benatar was already old news in 1993. And that's too bad, as \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" documents the solid music evolution that carried Benatar and Neil Giraldo through the early pre-fab hit fodder and through the more personal excursions of their later works. An excellent and hard-edged balance of the styles and influences that filter through much of Benatar's work, and well worth experiencing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A return to rock, but not like the 80's.","review":"\\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" is Pat's 9th studio release, but it just seems Pat and Neil can't get back on the tracks. After the blues failure of \\"True Love\\", they thought let's go back to what we know, only the material isn't as strong like the 80's. I found a few songs worth a listen in the mid-tempo rocker \\"Somebody's Baby\\", \\"Everybody Lay Down\\" #3 mainstream rock and \\"Tradin' Down\\". Four years would pass until \\"Innamorata\\" would come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"PAT IS AT HER VERY BEST!","review":"AS A LONG-TIME FAN OF THE INCREDIBLE VOICE OF PAT BENATAR, THIS ALBUM IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE.

The BoreSnake is easy to use and performed as claimed. I went with the original BoreSnake because the Viper version has a thinner pull cord that's more prone to breakage.

I would recommend giving the bore a good scrubbing with a soft metal wire cleaning tool first, as the bristles on this aren't as densely placed. You don't have to do this, but it reduces the number of pulls through the bore you'll need to clean the firearm. I gave this model a 4/5 only because the fit is very snug for a .22 cal bore.

The other Knights of the Round Table were also about the same age as King Arthur, but in this movie theyare of wildly different ages. The acting is generally poor with several of the actors being just plain wooden. The script is pretty bad too.One of the worst aspects of this movie is the costumes and acting. All of the clothes look brand new and there are a number of instances where clothes that get dirty in a battle suddenly and mysteriously get clean again even though the characters are still on the battlefield.

Product was in good condition and was as described."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has Hollywood done?","review":"I usually enjoy the talents of Sean Connery and Richard Gere very much, but this movie needs more than their names on the marquee to make it good. I know there are different versions of Arthurian Legend, but this story doesn't come close to telling the Arthur story. Other than naming characters Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere, this movie bears very little resemblance to the known stories of King Arthur. While I know screenwriters are allowed to be creative with their ideas, why name the characters Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere if they are going to completely change the story? This movie is all right if you are in the mood to watch a romance set in medieval times (or if you are a HUGE fan of Sean Connery or Richard Gere). But if you are wanting the story of King Arthur, Sir Lancelot, and Guinevere, this movie is absurd and not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Knight","review":"Forget Jerry Goldsmith's music punctuating every raised eyebrow. Ignore Julia Ormond's ability to play two emotions: earnestness and confused earnestness. First Knight is a crashing bore. It insults its audience with the weakest dialogue this side of Camelot. \\"I want you; you want me,\\" says Lance. I couldn't tell if these two were medieval lovers stating their passion or it was day two of Woodstock.Worst of all, this isn't the King Arthur of Morte D' Arthur. It's not even the King Arthur of the musical Camelot. You'll find no Merlin, excalibur, or Holy Grail inside these city walls. The grand mythology of Arthurian legend is stripped to the barest of bones. This isn't First Knight; it's knight of the living dead with more frightening results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous film of love, maturity, betrayal and forgiveness","review":"This well-acted and told story features Richard Gere as the handsome, adventuresome loner, Lancelot; Julia Ormond as strong, principled Guineviere; and Sean Connery as noble King Arthur. Ben Cross perfectly portrays the self-righteously arrogant, destructive villain, Malagant. The settings move between the forests of Great Britain and the exquisite golden and slate blue castle of Camelot. The brilliantly written script contains various references to Christianity. The plot vividly portrays the struggle between forces of violent, oppressive domination and the defense of the innocent, which entails self-sacrifice. This story is my favorite. I've enjoyed it each time, and gain new insights with each viewing. If you enjoy romantic, historical adventures, you will surely savor this outstanding film"},{"rating":"1","title":"Connery is great, Ormond is beautiful, the film is bad","review":"This is such a poor representation of the myth of Camelot that its hard to believe that the same man responsible for Forrest Gump did this. Richard Gere is much like Kevin Costner, in that he has to employ a very poor English accent for his part. I could care less. Neither actor pulled that off, but I never felt that was important to the films. Costner's Robin Hood is a good escapist, fun film, whereas First Knight is boring, tedious and uninspired. If a viewer wants to enjoy a truly great film on Camelot, he/she should watch Excalibur. It is far better in every way, except one. Connery is a great King Arthur. Its too bad he couldnt have had the inspired talent surrounding him necessary to make such a great tale into a likewise great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A miserable, mis-spent two hours of my life","review":"Notes from the pre-production team of FIRST KNIGHT:\\"Re: The medieval and modern literary texts of the legend of King Arthur\\"Frank, thanks for sending me all these books about King Arthur, but I really can't use them.

It's all old and stuff.\\"I've got the script all done. You'll really like it, I think. I lifted it from a cheesy romance novel I read once, but that's okay, I don't think anyone'll notice. It's a lot more interesting than these old timeless literary texts.\\"P.S.: Who's this Thomas Malory guy, anyway? I've never seen him on the bestsellers list ... \\"sigh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This production is inexcusably poor on many levels.","review":"Considering the incredible talent and financial resources that went into the production of this film, it is astonishingly atrocious. The usually wonderful Sean Connery does King Arthur as a wimp, while Richard Gere is totally miscast as a 90's hero in the Middle Ages. With all the research available in Medieval Clothing, the costumes are more appropriate for Star Trek. The Production design is equally anachronistic. Ben Cross's band of evil doers handle their pistol crossbows (non-existent in the period) as if they were semi-automatic pistols. Merlin is nowhere to be found. Even Bing Crosby's \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" seems more historically accurate, and in touch with human truths."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sick [rehash] of the Arthurian Legend","review":"I have been a fan of Arthur for years. I have watched movies, documentaries, and read books. This movie has nothing remotely resembling the true tale of Arthur. There is no merlin, excalibur, quest for the grail, percival, morgan le fay...etc. They just thought if they used the names Arthur, Lancelot and Guenivere that this horrible movie would sell better. It is a silly plot with guenivere being captured repeatedly by the bad guy and saved repeatedly by the good guy. The worst part about this movie is the way Sean Connery plays this role. King Arthur is a hero and a king. This movie portrays him as weak and almost less than a man. He KNOWS all along what is going on with Lancelot and his wife and chooses to do nothing! If you want a real movie, buy Excalibur. It is as good as this movie is bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TRAVEL SIZE","review":"This is the original we've all grown up with and it still does a great job.

The recipes are delicious, easy to prepare, and do not use expensive, hard-to-get ingredients, a definite plus in my opinion. I particularly enjoyed the Chicken with Artichokes recipe. The blending of the the flavours of artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes gives a definite \\"lift\\" to the chicken meat without being too spicy. This is one of the best cookbooks I have ever used. One of the other reasons I favour this book is because the recipes are low-fat. My husband is diabetic and I know I can use the recipes in this book to serve tasty meals that are also compatible with his diet. I consider \\"Low-fat and luscious Italian\\" a \\"must\\" for anyone who enjoys cooking, especially healthy cooking. The recipes are great for both everday meals and also for dinner parties. An absolutely marvellous book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the series","review":"Ms. Shayne begins the book by thanking someone for encouraging this novel. But in truth, Ms. Shayne should smack that person.The novel begins with the main character finding Dante's diaries and believing they are works of fiction. She revises these novels into screenplays and eventually makes blockbuster movies.The story is much longer than I have defined and has winning moments but it is plagued with trying to do too much. Ms. Shayne was obviously trying to create another series from this novel and so there are more charcters than probably need to be. There is too little character development of the 'right'charcters, main characters, and too much development of sub-characters.If you are a loyal fan of this genre you might enjoy this book.If you are a fan of Ms. Shayne, as I am, you will probably be a little disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unfocused - disappointment","review":"I love Maggie Shayne's vampire series, but I was disappointed with this one. I kept waiting for the romance. A good romance to me has the hero and heroine spending the majority of the book together developing their relationship. That didn't happen in this book. And I didn't like those two characters either. The vampire was a true monster who didn't develop into a better person like her others in the past books have, and the heroine's personality deteriorated instead of growing on me. The secondary characters were only slighty more interesting, and took up the majority of the book anyway. Acutally, Maxine and her friends would probably have made a better book all together if this had been about them and left out the vampire story entirely. It felt like this book didn't focus on any one story line long enough to develop it into something interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"While the latest from Maggie Shayne is certainly original, it lacks the passion that her earlier novels have. As someone mentioned earlier, this is less a romance than a fiction novel, and perhaps that's why I was so disappointed. The secondary characters have nearly as much \\"page time\\" as the main characters, and the result is a basic lack of development. I just couldn't bring myself to care about Dante and Morgan- partially because the novel didn't facilitate it, and partially because the characters just aren't very sympathetic. The hero is, frankly, far too brutal, and the heroine is too self-absorbed, unethical, and just plain pathetic. It seems to me that Ms. Shayne is trying to edge her way into straight fiction with \\"Twilight Hunger\\"(and her recent \\"The Gingerbread Man\\"), but it's just not what she does best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I started this series in the middle, my first book was Dracula and Stormy. I liked the series a lot and read all the books from that point on to the most current \\"Lover's Bite\\". I liked them all. I went back to read \\"the \\" beginning of the story and just could not get into the first couple of books, it would have discouraged me at the start so I am glad I started in the middle. If you are a fan of the series, it give good backstory on the characters. But the later books starting at #10 Edge of Twilight (totally ***** 5 full stars on Edge) and the rest after 10 and up are all 4 or 5 *'s for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"I enjoyed this contemporary vampire romance. I thought the characters worked well together and I would recommend this novel. Morgan DeSilva is a struggling screenwriter, who cannot seem to get any of her work off the ground. Her family used to be very wealthy but with her parents' death she found out that she no longer has any money. She must learn to support herself. Morgan moves into an old house in Maine owned by a friend, and is trying to write, but is running into a brick wall. Then she discovers a manuscript that she just falls in love with. It is a story about a vampire. Morgan decides to use this work. Dante is a vampire on the run. He is being hunted, and while running ends up at one of his hideaways which is beneath the house he used to own. He discovers Morgan, and is oddly attracted to her, but at the same time furious because she is publishing his private diaries. I enjoyed this novel and would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best.","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this novel, as I have read all of Maggie Shayne's books up to date, but I was really disappointed. Too little time is spent on the developement and story of the main characters, while too much of the story is focused on supporting characters.The storyline involving the main characters is weak and boring, I found myself wishing that the story had been about the supporting characters.This is the only book of Maggie Shayne's that I haven't liked. Maybe the next one will be better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"We love this movie, it is not for the faint at blood or language but it has a good point and vigilantes. There's comedy, action, and friendship themes throughout the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boondock Saints are the new Cassidy & Sundance.","review":"I loved this movie. Although it's a very different type of film, it introduces an array of characters that keep you glued.The humor is dry and in some parts so unusual you can't help but laugh. This is not a family movie. It is quite violent but has you cheering for the brothers. I'm hoping a sequel is in the works. But it would have to have the same actors to be as good as the first. One sees a side of William Dafoe that one hasn't seen before. He's quite good in this role. Anyone planning on viewing this film needs to keep in mind, this movie is not a typical action movie. It's a movie that centers around two Irish brothers in a working class neighborhood and their scheme & actions to making their life financially comfortable. You can't help but love the brothers. They are 100% Irish showing us they attend church and call Mom every Sunday. This may not be a movie for everyone but it was for me and I'm glad to own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"Troy Duffy was way ahead of his time.

What more could you ask for? I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I saw this movie a couple years ago and instantly fell in love with it.

See it to find out why."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Cool Movie","review":"I first saw this movie at a friends house and fell in love with it. I love the way that Sean Patrick Flanery and Sean Patrick Flanery play the two brothers that decide to rid the world of evil people. Willem Dafoe was super in playing the F.B.I. agent stuck between taking the brothers down or joining them. Don Della Rocco plays his role great and I will never forget when Rocco yells out, \\"We could kill everyone\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An shepherds we shal be for thee my lord for thee","review":"This movie made me want to be irish and partly italian. It has a funny dialogue, interesting ideas about vigilantes. Dafoe is very humorous and gives a very good performance as he increases his roles and becomes more of a versatile actor. Normus Reedus and Flanery are amazing. The actions scenes were amazing and the pain they experience is jaw-dropping. The message s very good. Billy Connoly who played Judi Dench in Mrs. Brown is marvelous and his accent is both funny, repsectable and humorous. A classic in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catering to our animal instincts","review":"I know that everyone loves the Boondock Saints, but I think it is a terrible movie which exposes our dark, retributive instincts, glorifying vigilante justice. Are we still so primal that we relish the though of eye for an eye, patting our stomachs at having been satiated by a vindictive shooting spree? Do we like this story because it lets us live out our fantasies of having the power to exact revenge from our transgressors? I think the popularity of this movie shows that we still have a good deal of growing up to do.Message aside, I also think this is one of Dafoe's least impressive films, although I realize that many people disagree. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theocratic drivel","review":"Is this movie suppose to be cool because it is about Irish Americans from Boston who follow the law according to the majority religion of there community? Change the cultural and religious background and you have a documentary on the mentality of self riotous religious memeoids; i.e. terrorists such as in the 9-11 attacks which hold one idea above all else, including ones own life. Well my god says the screenwriter is a tool and should be shot, unfortunately I'm not as brainwashed as the fools in this movie and I don't feel a need to take a gun to someones head. Although while watching this movie my trigger finger certainly felt the urge to put this to an early end by whatever means possible; gun, remote, blunt object thru the screen.The popularity of this film goes to show how so many Americans are just as out of touch with an objective reality as those (terrorits etc) which they hate most and thereby really are none the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"4.5 Stars, Really?","review":"Saw this movie after a buddy of mine highly reccomended it. The acting is garbage, the plot even worse and there seems to be many gay undertones outside of Dafoe's character.

Any Irish Catholic would know this is an absolute no-no, and what's worse, NO Irish Catholic would insult the church that way.This movie takes itself way too seriously to be as inane and unbelievable as it is.

Never before have I seen an actor go that far for a role ..... and appear to enjoy it so much.The story is about two Irish brothers who beleive they are are on a religious \\"crusade\\" of sorts to rid the city of the entire Russian mob. They remain one step ahead of the police and Dafoe almost every step of the way. The way that some of the scenes were shot involving the crime scene shootouts was quite original. The meshing of the actual shootout scene with Dafoe's reinactments to the police was brilliantly done. Completely captivating.I highly recommend this film to any fan of Pulp Fiction, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrells, Snatch, Fight Club, or any other movie with a cast of interesting characters and an involving plot such as these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saints?","review":"Bought this movie for my daughter.

No. Great Movie? God yes!","review":"Correct me if I'm wrong, please. This movie isn't anything \\"new\\". That being said, I personally consider it to be one of the top 3 guy films of all time. Period. I have never seen a movie to match it. I loved Snatch and Pulp Fiction, Resevior Dogs and Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels. Don't get me wrong, all great movies. All worthy of a five star rating. However, when compared to the Boondock Saints...I'm afraid they just don't hold a candle. I would reccomnd this movie to anyone over the age of 13. I would reccomend it to everyone, except they do have a tendency towards swearing, you may have noticed. Again, 5...nay 6 stars for this truly amazing movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"great service but hated the movie!","review":"I received my DVD in a timely manner, but hated the movie & turned it off after 15 min."},{"rating":"2","title":"boondock saints","review":"Great movie!Both Actores and Plot, are brilliant.

For those of us who constantly wade through so many Indie movies to find those films that just really take hold of you and make the wait seem well worth it. After a long run of watching some really dry movies, I came across this one in a video store. It looked interesting enough to be in the theatres and I wondered why I hadn't seen it before. 'My wife and I took it home and watched it....then we watched it again. After we woke up the next morning, we watched it one more time. Once I parted ways with this enormously entertaining flick, I purchased it as soon as I could. I think the fact that my wife loved it speaks volumes about the movie. I show it to everybody that I come across, and it has since found it's way into every one of my friend's video libraries. The best thing about this movie is the fact that nobody knows about it. People are finding out though......don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"bets movie ive ever seen : the boondock saints","review":"i loved this movie! im not usually in to movies like this but it was really interesting i really love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"This movie was really good... it incorporated humour and various witticisms to make it not only intriguing and adventurous, but funny as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"got the dvd, it didnt work. case was in great condition, but the movie didnt play at all. not returning it because my boyfriend wants the aluminum case."},{"rating":"2","title":"sharing the joy","review":"Strictly bought this for my boyfriend who never saw it before i showed it to him.

Needless to say, I was not disappointed. This movie appealed to me because it is about two vigilante brothers who try to rid the world of evil. Might not sound like much, but this movie is action packed! I was at the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. Willem Dafoe is spectacular in his role as an FBI agent. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and gratuitous violence. You won't be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Movie of All Time","review":"You cannot get a better movie than the Boondock Saints. Troy Duffy does an amazing job with this movie and his style of directing is amazing. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus give amazing performances!! Just be warned if you watch this movie once, you will have to watch it over and over again because you will not be able to get enough of it. Even though this movie is more skewed toward a male audience, as a female who loves bloody, action packed movies I found that this movie kept my attention the whole time and took me on an awesome journey full of blood and vengeance. If I could give this movie more than a five star rating I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME. Great movie","review":"This happens to be the 1st time I have managed to see this movie, but it is great. As with older movies one always wonders if it will benefit from being put on to BluRay. However this movie looks great, no apparent issues with the higher resolution.Can't wait for tBS:II to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This movie is awesome! The storyline is well written and probably the best directing i've seen since pulp fiction. Although it stars no big name actors, the young cast fit the roles perfectly and have excellent chemistry.The movie centres on two irish guys who get mixed up with international crime mobs. They undertake a mission from god to bring vigilante justice to all the maffia bosses who are getting off scot free.The public and media love dub them the \\"boondock saints\\" while the police admire them for cutting the red tape and are only half hearted in tracking them down.This movie is a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boondock Saints","review":"This movis was great, thats all there is to say about this movie. The sequel to this movie \\"All Saints Day\\" will be even better. The fighting scenes are the greatest and Rocko was so funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good, thought provoking movie","review":"A buddy of mine had me watch this one, telling me it was definitely different, but very good. I have to say that this movie kept me captivated form start to finish. Yes, there is violence, but this movie does not focus so much on the violence so as to lose sight of the plot. I have always enjoyed movies with strong storytelling, and this is a movie with a rather strange yet quite memorable storytelling, from the way that the \\"slower\\" scenes of the movie being presented in ways just as interesting as the fast-paced scenes. This movie presents interesting moral, religious, and personal questions that are very well meshed with the action of the film. My only real complaint about it was the amount of profanity, but this is a movie that will definitely be a good addition to your DVD or video collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISGRACE TO EVERYBODY.","review":"This movie was absolutely HORRIBLE. That is all there is to say about it. The acting was horrible, the plot was horrible. It was plain silly, offensive and violent just to get attention. I am amazed at the reviews this movie got. My wife looked at me and laughed about a quarter the way through the movie, not saying a word as she got up as none was needed then went to the den to read.Thanks to all the Amazon reviewers out their that gave this just a high rating. That's two hours of my life I can never get back. I am just glad I rentedSaints are not mass murders, murder is neither fun nor cool, this one ranks up with Natural Born Killers, another waste of time and DISGRACE to humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"i dont hate to tell the truth","review":"this movie is not that good. here is the problem: imitation. everything in this movie has been done as well or better in some other movie. the dialogue is cheesy, the acting is horrible, other than defoe, and the whole movie is bits and pieces of what the director has seen in past movies. most likely tarentino films, which other than dusk til dawn, cant be touched by anyone. as for the violence, we have seen that as well. make it more over the top, you can never have to much insane violence in a movie. the directing was done well, but it was all deja vu. nothing that interested me, when the cat was on the table i thought to myself, they are going to kill the cat, oh and look what happened. totally predictable, totally stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Overrated Low Budget Movie Ever","review":"This is one of the most overrated indie films of all time. Like Donnie Darko, every hipster, emokid, and other counterculture subsidiary jumps all over this movie because it had no budget and therefore must be amazing. It's even more nauseating when you actually live in Boston like I do, and see all the stupid Southie kids rant and rave about it because it was filmed in their lousy little rathole neighborhood. The plot is ridiculous, the dialogue is awkward and heavy-handed, and the songs for the soundtrack by the band \\"Boondock Saints\\" sound like they were made by Nickelback's mentally retarded cousins. There is nothing that you can see in this piece of indie crap that you can't see in any well budgeted crime drama/action movie, except for grainy film and Ron Jeremy getting shot in a nudie booth. Save your money kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This movie is a stinker. Just awful. I'd be embarrased to be involved with this movie. Willem Dafoe is too good for this derivative nonsense. He should remove his name from the credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong film purchased","review":"I ordered the wrong dvd.

But if you are from Europe beware, than FOX will fox you.This fox will cheat you, because this Company is the only one in the State, who will not let you see your movie,because of code two for blu-ray.

A movie which has been done many times before with much better results, \\"Boondock Saints\\" deserves a miss. Its only redeeming quality is...wait, there are none, I should've given it one star. Trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this film about?","review":"I admit I probably had unreasonably high expectations based on reviews here. What a dissapointment! I agree 100% with a reviewer who said it was more style than substance. Stylish? Yes, but incredibly shallow. I gotta say, though, that the music score is excellent, photography is very good, and actors indeed do their best, but their best is not good enough to save this movie. Don't even start comparing it to Lock, Stock... or Snatch, or Leon, or Desperado even. Or, for that matter, to any other film that has plot, characters, and working script. Do yourself a favor and rent it if you must. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its okay .","review":"This Movie was okay. I don't know why anybody would compare this to Pulp Fiction or Snatch. I would not buy this movie, its okay to rent one day when your bored its somewhat entertaining. But overall this flick sucks the main characters are corny and the hole plot of the move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes the mafia look bad...","review":"First of all I can't believe how easy it is to kill mob bosses these days. Two wimpy looking boys with no training managed to kill a good amount of trained killers. Speaking of making no sense, the two main characters seem to stumble into killing bad guys (or those they chose to be bad) without any real motivation, \\"Hey these guys are bad... let's kill them.\\" \\"Ummm, okay..\\" says the other saint. We're just supposed to sit here and accept this pile of nonsense with sprinkles of bad acting. Yeah, some of the scenes are entertaining and the cinematography was top notch but without a foundation of decent acting and a solid plot the movie trips and stumbles under its own weight. Don't waste your time like I did watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"More style than substance","review":"I expected more given all the reviews on amazon.com. However what I saw was a movie that was trying to be about something deep and spiritual but failing because the director was more obsessed with style (how) rather than the substance (what).The acting is quite good. But the scenarios are so implausible, and the director is trying oh so hard to make another Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels that it became very hard to watch this film.My recommendation: see a Guy Ritchie or Tarantino film (again). And if you must see this film, rent it. So that you can be rid of it in 5 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really strange...","review":"Maybe I watched a wrong version of this movie, but I could not see any of the great things all the people are talking about.The story of the movie is quite boring. Two irish boys taking the law into their own hands and shootimg some mafia, or other bad guys. One FBI agent is hunting them, and realizes that he thinks these guys are some kind of cool...Okay, can be that this story could be interesting if it would not have set in scene in such a bad way. You see stereotypes all the time! The bad guys are kind of stupid and the \\"good\\" guys are clever and lucky. Sound like a fairy tale. I guess it is.However, I don't want to lose too many words about this film since it stole enough of my time. Just wanted to warn you. I read all these could critics and though this could be a good movie. I really tried to find something good, but it was too hard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"I'm not sure how a movie could get much worse.A boring, nonsensical plot?

It's a dumbed down, half witted, Tarantino film written by an egomaniac who doesn't realize that fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG!","review":"There are so many cheesy moments in this movie it's not even funny. people who seriously think this is a \\"master-piece\\" need a medical attention. i can understand teens liking this kind of mindless action, but adults? come on. one scene i found interesting in the movie is when the FBI agent pulled out his gigantic CD player, that is so 90's :P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Time","review":"I saw this movie based on the recommendation of a friend, but was sorely disappointed. The only strength of this film is the outstanding performance of the always-great Willem Dafoe. Still, his part, along with all the other characters, is poorly-written and underdeveloped. Hardly any background info is given. The premise of the story is weak and the movie contains many inconsistancies which are never explained. Why this film became a cult classic escapes me, but it can probably be traced to the excessive violence and low budget that led to comparisons with Reservoir Dogs. The major difference is that Reservoir Dogs had a smart script and an interesting,engaging plot that went somewhere. Boondock Saints starts off in the same place it ends up : nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Release date of 12/18/01","review":"The Boondock Saints is a really good movie. I think that Willem Dafoe was not up to his usual great self (see Platoon, The Last Temptation Of Christ, Shadow Of The Vampire, etc.). His acting was a little too over-the-top for my liking. However, everything else about this movie is great! The brothers were perfect, and the supporting cast played their parts well. The action was hypnotic, and the dialogue is some of the best for the genre. If not for Willem's excess, I might've given the film a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 10","review":"Plain and simple, one the best movies I have ever seen. Unreal.

Thats right, friends break friendships over this movie. I will be buying two copies of the DVD.

Buy it you will not regret it if you like action/adventure movies. The dvd was in excellent shape and it was shipped promptly and I have no complaints. I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK to rent, but wouldn't buy it","review":"The directing and acting are both enjoyable, and I agree with other reviewers who say that, despite being a movie about vigilantism there are quite a few funny and tongue-in-cheek character moments. Having said that, while the style of the movie is attractive, there's not much substance behind it. I see a storyline that subordinates itself to the characters from the outset, and because of a lack of character development, a principal tenet of the story- the morality of vigilantism- becomes an unanswered cliche. (As an example, compare this movie with Dirty Harry in \\"Magnum Force,\\" a less stylized but more substantive movie.)As an aside, while watching this movie I was reminded of \\"The Town,\\" because of the Boston/Irish connections, and this was interesting.In short, knowing what I know now, I might rent this movie once for fun, but I wouldn't buy it because I don't think I'll watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I just purchased this movie, which is one of my favorites. The video quality is pretty low for a DVD. The menus are jumpy. I got the regular edition soon after the movie came out and that DVD has much better video. I'm not sure what the deal is with this one. Also, the extras DVD will not display the video on my computer unless played with VLC, which is again, very jumpy. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boondock Saints","review":"The Boondock Saints is certainly gory and profane- expect graphic deaths and screaming, expletive-laden tirades- but underlying this gritty appearance is a meaningful exploration of morality. Like Crime and Punishment, the movie focuses on the righteousness of going above the law to eradicate evil, examining if the ends justify the means. Without giving anything away, the excellent twist at the end provides a fitting, Wild West like ending that effectively answers this question with an exclamation point. The action scenes are well done (though bloody), and the change of heart of Dafoe's character is also well done. If you are looking for a movie that adds some thoughtfulness to the violence, this movie is for you,though personally I felt that it was a bit excessive at times. Saints is not a happy movie that will leave you feeling uplifted at the end; rather, it is a \\"thinker\\" movie that makes you think about what you would do in the position of the \\"saints\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Kept Secret","review":"This movie, albeit unpopular, rates as one of my favorite movies. Though it is action-packed, it manages to keep the viewer mentally stimulated. It is essentially in a class of its own. There is no other movie like it. What other movie would you see a cat blow up and Willem Dafoe riverdance?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most underated movie of all time.","review":"I loved this movie, true I will give most movies the time of day but I rarley will say I have to own this. There is two scenes that I put on when having people over at the house playing pool and drinking some cold ones and I get the same affect everytime. Sure there may not be a Tom Cruise or a Mel Gibson in this movie but that only makes it better. Watch it and you will love it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Irishman, Hitman, and an arsenal of action","review":"Indeed, Boondock Saints is one of my all time favorites!

I watched it after hearing a lot of good things about the movie, but to me it's just a cheesy Quentin Tarentino knock-off. My suggestion: rent the movie before you buy it. You may really enjoy it, as it seems many other people have, but I ended up really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchably bad - prepare for a lot of fast forwarding","review":"There is an actor in this movie that looks like the actor Willem Dafoe and is apparently named Willem Dafoe, but can't possibly be the real Willem Dafoe, because any actor that was worth a damn would not have anything to do with this crappy movie unless they were being blackmailed or had to finance a bad gambling or drug addiction.I'll leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, didn't work for me.","review":"I watched the version of this film where the acting was terrible, the plot didn't exist, and every attempt at being cool failed. I'd like to get ahold of the version everyone is raving about though, sounds like a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless and unoriginal","review":"I must say that after having watched this I was offended that a friend had recommended it to me. I have no problems with the movie's message; my problem is with its complete lack of originality. I cannot recall an original moment in this entire movie. What I can recall is gratuitous edginess and a mindless collection of plotlines and vignettes ripped from movies like Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, and the Professional. I understand that in watching a film like this one needs to suspend a measure of disbelief, but this film asks its viewers to be idiots. The dialogue is terrible and the scenarios the characters find themselves in are often moronic. It seems like Duffy had a whole list of \\"Holy ****, wouldn't it be cool if...\\" moments and strung them together and expected them to make a movie. My only real wish is to have my 108 minutes back. Be thankful that the sequel never made it off the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Tarantino wannabe flicks","review":"Loud and proud but blatantly empty, BDS tries very, very hard to be an over-the-top gangster flick in the Tarantino school of filmmaking. Its the story of two unlikeable and slightly unintelligable thugs who do over-the-top things in over-the-top scenarios. Dafoe plays the over-the-top cop trying to find the thugs, trying very hard and almost succeeding in giving the film some life. Not the worst movie I've ever seen but the worst of the Tarantino wannabe flicks. No characters to care for, no dialogue, no story = no movie. Feels like a straight to video/made for tv flick. Rent it for your friend who likes his humor to be blunt and obvious.This film isn't nearly as fulfilling as any of the director's other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Time I trust amazon reviews.","review":"Big pile of suck. That about sums it up. It seems like every movie on amazon gets five stars. 4and1/2!!! Frick, this movie is retarded. F this F that F this F that F this F that. Everything is F F F. These guys are supposed to be saints. I can't think of one thing good they do in the movie. They cuss, get drunk, are mean, take vengeance in their own hand. Saints!!! Terrible movie. Trust Me. It really sucks in everyway. Terrible Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"I would only reccomend this movie to those who truly appreciate the worst of the entertainment world. By the back of the movie one would assume this movie has an extensive plot line, and holds perhaps a message that would be hard to obtain. This of course would make the movie interesting, and with the cast (especially Defoe,) it should be rather great. Instead you get a movie with a homowierdual Defoe and a plot line about as complex as a pokemon cartoon. It is also full of horrible oneliners, very choppy scenes, and unrealistic portrayal of law enforcement. I was very dissapointed, very dissapointed indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes, when choosing a movie,","review":"I want to see things blown up, a mounting body count and a bloody hero triumphing unrealistically over extreme evil. It was with such thoughts that I rented this movie. But....while this movie was obviously made with real enthusiasm and good humour, it was done so cheaply, and edited so badly that it becomes a game of count the goofs, rather than watch the movie. The plot was definitely thin, the dialog mostly fbombs, and the acting by Dafoe, one of my favorites, simply stunk. Too bad, the movie missed all the way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very","review":"don't care for the movie. i've had it for months and still haven't seen the whole thing. ho hum booooring."},{"rating":"1","title":"More style than substance","review":"I expected more...The acting is good. But the scenarios are so implausible, and the director is trying oh so hard to make another Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels that it was hard to watch this film.My recommendation: see a Guy Ritchie or Tarantino film (again). And if you must see this film, rent it. So that you can be rid of it in 5 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT","review":"I heard a few good comments about this movie, waited until the price dropped to buy, I did it and now I regret it. First, acting is bad, the plot is terrible, and no to mention the editing. Save yourself a few dollars and do not buy it. It's not even worth watching it for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I am not sure if I saw the same movie as most of the people who have reviewed Boondock Saints on this site. This movie was just what I feared it would be: poorly acted, boring and way over the top. Luckily I rented it first because watching it once was way more than enough. If you want a stylish, film with a great plot and engrossing dialogue don't watch this one. Check out Fight Club or Memento or The Usual Suspects or any Coen Bros. film. Leave Boondock Saints alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone needs to calm down","review":"In the battle of style over substance, substance didn't even show up for this one. That can be fine, but the style of this movie is ugly, mindless, and derivative. It is true that there is fancy camera work, and a number of impressively loud speeches are shouted between shootouts. The director seems overjoyed for the chance to make this movie, sweeping around and extravagently showing guns blazing while. Somehow this enthusiasm has blinded people to the complete lack of any other redeeming quality: the acting and plot are intensely bad. This movie isn't just empty of quality, it's full of stinking, rotten, cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid nonsense","review":"Utter and complete tripe. Two young actors playing at being tough - both of which look like the kind that got beat up at recess; and a disgraceful Willem Defoe - a homosexual cop that calls others fags - just so you know he's one of the good homosexuals - a regular guy and all. A shame and joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was in no way prepared for this movie's sheer awfulness","review":"I watched this based on the \\"you HAVE to see this movie!\\" recommendations of two people I know. I no longer trust their taste or judgment on anything whatsoever. The combination of the self-indulgent violence with pretentious pseudo-philosophical moralizing made me want to puke at times. These things made me think of The Matrix movies; the unbelievably bad scenery-chewing from everyone on screen made me think of The Black Dahlia. We have here an Unholy Trinity of Cinematic Crap.And why does Dafoe's character listen to opera, and why is this supposed to provide some insight into his character? Is it because gay men listen to opera? Shouldn't he be listening to show tunes instead? Maybe it's because Troy Duffy can't tell the difference. Who knows. All I do know is that it has been quite some time since I hated a movie-watching experience this much. Bleccch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent Movie","review":"I may not be able to tell you how the choreography was done- but I liked the way they did it. I loved the movie, and it became my all time favorite half way through it.William DaFoe was excellent (as usual), and the two beautiful young Irish lads acted very realistically.A wonderful movie for anyone who enjoys movies that are a bit complex, and creatively put together...But where at the same time where you can understand what is going on......"},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie not to be overlooked","review":"This is definitely one of the best movies I have seen in a while. The movie has a great mix of action, drama, and comedy. terrific acting and strong characters make this movie one not to be missed. If you haven't seen it I would suggest just buying the DVD, it is well worth the money. Some of the deleted scenes are hilarious. Everytime you watch this movie you pick up on details you left out before. Give it a chance and I think you will be glad. In my oipinion it doesn't get any better for my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shot 'Em Up, Line 'Em Up","review":"The Irish brothers Connor MacManus and Murphy 'Murph' MacManus are faithful Catholics who have a wicked streak within them. After helping a couple of Russian mobsters out of their local bar and later killing these gangsters they are named Saints by the news. This results in the brothers acquiring the necessary tools to continue their \\"cleansing\\" of the cities lower elements. However, the police are on their trail with the cunning FBI Agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) as their leader. The brothers see this as a threat to their calling, but at the same time the Agent Smecker is seen as good. Boondock Saints is an energetic film with humor and drama that deals with moral issues of today and entertains the audience. The film provides an experience that leaves the audience with a little of everything and still something to ponder."},{"rating":"2","title":"ggreat movie","review":"Great. Movie.

Finding it at a better price and in great condition made it an even better buy!! Completely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'IT IS YOUR CORUPT WE CLAIM' GREAT MOVIE","review":"This is one of those rare movies you come across that will amaze you. Boondock Saints is a tale about moral conviction, and the entire concept of devine intervention. The premise is two you Irish catholic boys have been sent a meesage from God. The message is that there is a battle on earth between good and evil, God sends them as soldiers to fight the evil of south boston. Although this may not seem so complex, this movie achieves and portrays its message effectively on several levels. Basically, the Irish brothers believed in absolute moral conviction, and that they are Gods tools in the on going battle. Do not miss this movie, it is a prophecy of moral conviction and heroism in a unusual form"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant","review":"The movie is fabulous. Best movie ever.

I've watched it over and over again and never get tired of it. Wish there were a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"doing evil to achieve good?","review":"I didn't know what I was getting into when I first saw this film. It had me crawling up the back of my seat in the theater, and elicited more than a few visceral yawps. Stylized, intelligent violence is something we should all be more ambivalent about, but it is a fitting device for this film. Two characters stumble into a career exacting God's justice, and never doubt either that God's providence is at work in them or that they are a lesser form of the scum they eliminate. It confronts directly the use of vigilante violence for the sake of justice, something that has become more complicated for us after September 11."},{"rating":"1","title":"more plot holes than bullet holes","review":"Everyone I talk to likes this movie, but I'm here to tell you that this movie is terrible. The plot is terrible. The characters are way out there - for example the guy that plays the best friend side kick is this zany, hyper-spaz who is juxtaposed with the two Irish guys and drags them down. And then there's the overtly gay Wilem Defoe who portays a gay FBI agent to stereotype-accuracy. The characters ... and the worst is probably the leather trenchcoat wearing long-lost father who emerges to join this circus train. There's more plot holes than bullet holes in this train wreck. Don't waste your time and don't let people sucker you into watching this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER, HANDS DOWN","review":"SAVE YOURSELF THE AGONY AND DON'T BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE.

However, this one is a BIG exception. In retrospect, I should have looked closer at the names of the supporting actors. If I had, I would have seen Ron Jeremy's name.., that would have given me the perfect clue as to the sleeze bag, low rent quality of this movie (I felt like I needed to take a shower after watching this).

I wish i could give this movie a billion negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catering to our animal instincts","review":"I know that everyone loves the Boondock Saints, but I think it is a terrible movie which exposes our dark, retributive instincts, glorifying vigilante justice. Are we still so primal that we relish the though of eye for an eye, patting our stomachs at having been satiated by a vindictive shooting spree? Do we like this story because it lets us live out our fantasies of having the power to exact revenge from our transgressors? I think the popularity of this movie shows that we still have a good deal of growing up to do.Message aside, I also think this is one of Defoe's least impressive films, although I realize that many people disagree. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An undeserving cult classic","review":"There's something about this movie that makes me physically ill. It's not the violence. I can handle as much violence as you can throw at me. Instead, it's the puppydog adoration that people follow this movie around with. It just isn't very good. It isn't horrible, but there are much MUCH better Tarantino knockoffs out there. Way of the Gun has better writing, a better soundtrack, and better fight scenes. Things to do in Denver When You're Dead is a much moodier film with a better atmosphere and far superior performances. I mean, you can always go and watch GOOD movies, but if you want an action movie, these are the ones to watch. This film basically has Willem Dafoe playing the same character he's played in every movie, no storyline, and depressingly cheasy plot developments. And there's a sequel coming out. I hate everyone who loves this movie. Screw you all. Hell, even Killing Zoe's better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Buy Different DVD","review":"My family and I have loved this movie for years. I bought this special edition when it first came out. The special features aren't worth anything, there's one joke on it and that's really it. If you want to see the trailer, go on youtube. Other than that you can find this movie in double packs with other movies like Snatch for $10, or just the DVD for $5. I know it seems dramatic, but I flushed over twenty dollars on my copy and then got it for the rest of my family for 5 a piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are others like this - watch them instead","review":"My friend and I watched this based on a recommendation. UGH!!! You keep waiting for the pieces to fall together but it just becomes white noise after awhile. Dafoe's character/antics are merely for shock value. You make no connection with the characters. And Billy Connolly at the end was just absurd. These other reviews mention other films. Many are very good and you should view them - even if its a second or third time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"I can only assume that the director (watch the far superior Overnight if you'd like to meet him) has enlisted his friends and family to plaster the internet with reviews for this film. It's rated well on here, well on iTunes, but -tellingly - it's rated horribly on Rotten Tomatoes. I hardly ever switch off films before they end. You've paid your money, right? But this was one exception. An execrable film: amateurish, pretentious, and trying so hard to be cool, it's agonizing. Don't say you haven't been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely dreadful!","review":"I don't understand how Willem Defoe agreed to be part of this charade. The acting being nothing short of unbelievable, Defoe tried to make his role work within the perimeters of his silly charcter he has accepted to play. His effortless acting peers don't succeed in following his example as their perfomances make viewers blush. The camera work and the editing are boring, the techno-ey soundtrack wishes it was written by Paul Oakenfold or Paul Van Dyk. The art direction is reminiscent of your avarage TV production.Duffy tries so hard to portray everybody as amazingly \\"cool\\" but fails in imitating cinematic muscleflexers like Tarantino. Furthermore there is an odd homosexual undertone to the characters (other than Defoe's who's character is gay) where all, especially the straight stereotypes, come off as awfully stupid individuals. As for female characters, is it me or don't women exist in Duffy's immature world of cinema?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever?","review":"Worse than, \\"Glen or Glenda\\"? \\"Robot Monster\\"? \\"Manos: The Hands of Fate\\"? \\"The Creeping Terror\\"? \\"Red Zone Cuba\\"?While \\"Boondock Saints\\" doesn't fall to their level of incompetence, it does come off much worse due the unbelievable pretentiousness that director Duffy seems to think makes him an artist.This film is like a Rorschach test. Want to find who among your friends has no taste at all? Show them \\"The Boondock Saints.\\" If they don't find it awful to the point of hilarity, perhaps you should reconsider your association with them.By the way, Duffy's commentary is priceless. You can't make stuff up that's that funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boondock Saints DVD","review":"This is one of the tightest movies I have ever seen. I give it a definate 5 star rating.

Anyone who does not like this movie just needs to Irish up a little bit. Great Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome movie, came out of nowhere","review":"i saw this movie at my friend's house about 2 years ago and i couldn't believe it. it takes place right in my hometown which is cool, and the 2 main characters are tough irish brothers who are hell bent on destroying evil doers of the world. it sounds stupid, but after seeing this movie, it made me proud to have irish in me. although my relatives overseas don't go out on saintly killing sprees, this movie is still excellent. it's funny, it's sad, and it's loaded with action. william dafoe's character is especially funny (a gay detective who is very good at his job) and bob marley (not the singer, the comedian) was hilarious in this as the obnoxious dumb cop. if all the hype makes you want to rent, or buy it, do so without thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Script writers had a tentative grasp of the English language.","review":"While I understand that there will be some level of cursing in movies this movie was pretty much a long string of the F-bombs mingled with a few other lines. Really, we have an entire language with which to express ourselves, and even the most intellectually inept have the ability to stumble through some semblance of the English language without resorting to the F-bomb every other word. So the concept of the movie I liked, justice being served, fighting bad guys etc. But I just feel their script writer had virtually no imagination and filled those area's when he could have built up dialog by just having them repeat the F word over and over. So just be warned, this might not be idea for a family movie night. Unless of course your concept of depth and success is measured by how many times you can drop the F-bomb while conveying an idea in a single basic sentence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Double Dip Worth Getting?","review":"Basically this Blu-Ray version is identical to the last Blu-Ray version. A new 30 minute extra giving more details about the movie is added and 5 seconds (yes just 5 seconds)of the film added to make it a \\"Unrated/Directors Cut\\". The written script feature has been taken out from the last version. So if you have the film already I really don't see the need for a upgrade. If you don't have it then this is the version to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamond in the Rough","review":"This movie is very solid- one of the most memorable action flicks of the past 6-7 years. The Terantino style reversed time sequences are done beautifully and the gun arsenal and accuracy of the ballistics and blood art are an excellent touch. My only qualm is that one the first assassination is very unbelievable. The movie compensates for this by providing the audience with an excellent moral dilemma, albeit this done without a hint of subtleness. At one point the 2 brothers and their Italian friend discuss the moral correctness of vigilante murder as long as the victims are criminals and societal undesirables such as mafiosoes, drug dealers, or pretty much any moral degenerate. It is nice to see a movie make an argument for right wing vigilante violence that makes more sense than Grisham's \\"A Time to Kill\\". But the action sequences are what make this movie great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish we had this material in the US","review":"I found out about Simon Webbe while searching for ring tones. I stumbled upon \\"My Soul Pleads For You\\" and from there I just had to download the full album. Unfortunately we don't hear much of this melody-driven R&B pop here on the US radio stations. Simon definitely writes some catchy tunes that remind me a bit of Seal. Good luck and Godspeed, Simon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit Bland at times but generally GOOD!","review":"Coming from a boyband usually means you'll end up nowhere or become a big fat bloke on a reality show somewhere. Simon's first CD was a big surprise to me because I generally believed he was the weakest in Blue but prooved to be the most soulful one on that album. with \\"Grace\\" I've finally come to respect him. Although he loses his way on some tracks such as Angel(my life pleads for you) and possibly the weakest \\"fool for you,\\" tracks such as \\"Seventeen\\" (my fav), \\"Sunshine(Love like that)\\" will keep you smiling. the title track is all the exciting as it is very uplifting. the chorus alone will make you wanna jump up and shout for joy.All in all, i love this CD. it continous where \\"Sanctuary\\" left off and greatly shows an improvement in Simon's voice. he is fast becoming our generation's Seal, but better looking.

Stuffed with oodles of atmosphere and some unique and spooky effects, the movie fails due to its frenzied plot, mediocre acting and a soundtrack that often overshadows the dialogue. Some of the accents also make it difficult to understand. The movie's twist ending is also rather forced, and it negates the basic plot of the film.

Rather, Terri Nunn has created a new Berlin (all new musicians) that is ready to take its place next to Garbage, No Doubt and other current electronic bands.\\"Blink of An Eye\\" is the lead off track and first single. If this is not a top 40 hit, commercial radio should be crucified! \\"Shiny\\" and \\"With A Touch\\" are catchy dance pop numbers. While \\"Lost In My Mind\\" may be one of the best songs ever written by Ms Nunn and Co. Billy Corgan lends a hand on \\"Sacred An Profane,\\" which has a film noir, haunting, cutting edge sound. \\"Drug\\" and \\"Stranger On The Bus\\" are hard edged electronic songs with a lot of guitar muscle in the mix. \\"To A King\\" and \\"Stronger Than Steel\\" show Ms. Nunn's vocal talents at their best.

Between the liaisons and marriages to beautiful women and his image as a hard partier, you would expect a livelier story, but Mr. Giuliano writes in such a laconic style, that you are almost put to sleep. This is really only for ardent Rod Stewart fans as unfortunately there are barely any literary works on this superb performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is chock full of errors","review":"Amazon reviews are meant to sell book so this review will never see the light of day, but the fact is, this book is full of errors--dates are wrong, songs are listed on wrong CDs, and it is full of sensationalism.

However, I could live with having to restart it every now and then, but just the other day it died. I picked up this router in September of last year, and I could only make it as for as 6 months. In short, this router is now worse than my 5 year old Linksys router. Now I'm left stranded with 6 devices (4 wired/2 wireless) with only a connection from my modem.

The only positive I can give it so far is our laptop shows 50+ mb/sec., but if I can't get our phones to work I will have no choice but to go back to the LinkSys for now and possibly return this one.. disappointed. I had planned to dd-wrt the old one and use it as a wirless adapter for my plasma/BlueRay.. obviously that is on hold.From my experience the old adage applies here, too good to be true :(Edit; got the phone issue fixed and has served us well for months w/ no problems - changed the rating to 4 stars to reflect this.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Newer revisions don't have detachable atennas!","review":"I bought this router because I needed to upgrade to high-gain antennas in my house to get acceptable signal everywhere, and Internet reviews of the DIR-615 specifically mention that it has external antennas that I could swap out for high-gain ones.

By April '08 it died just like so many others reported. Before that, we went through a period of intermittent signal drops. I searched D-Link's website for solutions and couldn't find one. I emailed tech support and got back a dumb response. Since I didn't keep my receipt and really need to get my network back up, I went out and bought a new Linksys WRTG54S and a Belkin G Router (I use the Belkin as an Access Point to extend my wi-fi coverage). Both have kept up with our networking needs without a glitch and they're in the same price range (less the free PCMCIA N card).My recommendation, avoid the D-Link if not tech-savvy. If you don't mind playing network system administrator, go right ahead and buy this headache. By the way, there is a fix for the dead DIR-615 which is pretty simple (involves reloading the firmware).

Once things were finally working, I started noticing that the router would kick me off the internet every 5-10 minutes for no reason! After calling D-Link for support on 4 separate occasions, I finally was told that my router was defective, but I had passed my router's 30 day warranty (by 2 days!) and they could not help me further.

Then another month later it kept disconnecting like 2 times per day and it was so ***** annoying, even my mom threw this stupid retarded router on the ground. DONT BUY THIS ROUTER!

The net was far too sluggish going through the router, so I sent it back for a linksys, which I had up and running perfectly in 15 min.

I had problems with the device dropping wireless connection so I did what everyone else does in this situation....upgraded the firmware. But guess what, after I upgraded, the wireless speed became slower! I didn't even think that was possble and am very upset! I normally can get 10-15mb, I was getting anywhere between 1-5mb. The firmware upgrade really killed the wireless performance. Shame because I liked it up to this point. I hooked back up my old reliable Linksys WRT54G and am only going to stick with Linksys for now on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it if you need help","review":"Delivery was OK.

Thought it was a defective unit, so returned for a replacement. Exactly same problem and unit that would connect quickly developed disconnects. Although the D Link interface is nice to work with and I have had good success with other DLinks over many years. This version is simply flaky. No wonder it was on sale at very low price. Installed a Linksys 54G2 worked flawlessly as soon as installed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for security....","review":"I wouldn't recommend this router for THREE security-focused reasons:1) can only use HTTP for admin login.-- even though the manual says that you can enable HTTPS server I confirmed with DLink tech support that HTTPS login is NOT AVAILABLE on the DIR-615; this functionality starts at the DIR-655....MANUAL IS WRONG!2) can not disable admin settings from the wireless interface-- having admin access ONLY from the wired LAN would also be another security issue3) can NOT filter wireless MAC's only-- have to enter ENTIRE network MAC's if you want to filter any devices; doesn't differentiate between wire or wireless LANs for this features...So in short I can't recommend this product; I am returning it and will go back to a Linksys prodcut where ALL 3 of the features mentioned above are available."},{"rating":"2","title":"For 40 bucks, tough to beat.","review":"Simply put, for the money, you can't beat this router.

Customer Service is awful","review":"After two other of the same modem that did not work, I ended up with one that did and I've had it for four months and it died on Saturday. No power. Since Saturday, I have spent over four hours on hold trying to get an RMA after the email support gave me a case number and it did not work. After more time on hold, yesterday I finally got ahold of someone in CS who gave me a new case number and a website to register to get the RMA. Well now the website is 'down' and they are 'working on it.'If I had not got out and purchased another router from a different company then I'd be five days without internet access and no resolution date in sight.I would not purchase an item from this company again. Which is a shame because my last DLink router lasted three years. But this model and my experience with their customer service has changed my view of them.Save yourself time and trouble. Buy something else from another company."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how hardware installation should be done","review":"When an older router died, I was attracted to this model because it worked with Vista, claimed a signal strength that would cover my house and was available at a good price. Once at home, I was even more impressed with the sheer ease of installation. All hardware manufacturers (including DLink on some of its other products)should follow this example. Every step was crystal clear and in minutes my network was created, named, secured, and joined by my variety of wireless gadgets. I have found the signal strength improved over my old G router and even though I have no other N devices and won't get N speeds until I do, the better signal srength is a real plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iffy Technology, Terrible Customer Service","review":"This router has a mind of its own and is difficult to keep up.

The Windows computers work fine with it, (usually) without a hitch but my Mac mostly has problems with it. Web pages usually do not load the first time. I have to reload the page 2-3 times to finally get it to work, but even then images have a hard time loading. Really a pain to work with on a Mac."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not always stay connected","review":"Every couple of days I have to unplug it so it can restart, otherwise it won't allow any connections through the device.Also, it requires a specific IP address to be typed in to the network settings if you decide to have ANY network security on. I am very proficient at network adapter configuration and I even had a tech guy come out and called the D-Link technical support. Having a specific IP address is not that bad as long as you don't plan to connect to other networks, in which case you have to change your settings on your computer to \\"Automatically select IP\\" for whenever you are on the other network, and you have to type in your IP address, subnet mask, DNS... etc every time you come home.I wouldn't buy this again, even if it was a 1/10th of the price of the other N routers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even their own techs couldn't make it work...","review":"Perhaps the worst computer product I've ever owned. Spent nearly four hours with a D-Link tech, a tech from my ISP and a tech from my satellite provider. None of them could get this thing to connect to my modem despite trying every imaginable configuration.Took it back to the store where I purchased it and traded it for an older and cheaper Linksys Wireles-G router that was up and running in 15 minutes.Normally I like D-Link products, but this one is junk. Avoid this router like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works badly with certain devices","review":"This router works fine with some devices, but others (specifically Apple devices) have major problems connecting and staying connected.

I bought this router in January 2012 to replace a Buffalo Technology Air Station Wireless Router WZR-HP-AG300H that is pre-confirgured to use DD-WRT. The Buffalo router was difficult to configure so I send it back and bought the D-Link 615 E3 instead. The D-Link router was easy to flash with the DD-WRT firmware and is working well. The signal is decent and comparable with other routers in its class.If you are looking for a router for OpenVPN at a low price,then the D-Link 615 E3 is a good choice. Hope this review will help other shoppers who would like to explore OpenVPN, but having challenges choosing the right router."},{"rating":"1","title":"Router blocks game voice chate","review":"Signal strength and speed on the wireless was lower/slower than my old Linksys Wireless G router. The built-in firewall blocked my in-game Voice Chat for Everquest 2. Opening ports or moving the PC to a \\"dmz\\" designation made no difference. Tried it hard wired and wireless. Same problem on multiple computers so I know its the router. It's going back to the retailer. Should have stuck with my original Linksys but thought this would increase my wireles range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice entry level Wireless-N","review":"I have owned this for about a month and really like it. Setup was simple and I was connected in 10 minutes. I don't have a device that has wireless-N capabilities so I can't really comment on that aspect. I bought it mostly because it was the same price as the wireless-G routers and in the future I'm sure I will utilize the N range capabilities. I have had zero dropped connections so far and it's been 100% reliable for me. My only complaint is the signal strength is a little weaker at close range than it is at farther ranges (go figure). My Nintendo Wii is about 40 feet away and only gets a 42% signal but when I moved it 75 feet away it showed 72%. If you have a large house or if your home office is at one end of the house this would be the perfect router to get as it seems the farther away from it you get the stronger the connection. All in all I think this is a great entry-level router at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Router for Apartment","review":"I've had this router for over a year and the results have been very good. The router plugs into my ISP's wall jack in my 400 unit apartment. I tested this in mixed mode and it worked fine, however I have chosen to deploy the router with N-only as all of my neighbors have G routers and I wanted to operate on a different frequency. I've got N-wireless on my laptop, have set WPA2 + AES, which is what you need to use in order to achieve maximum speed. Don't use WPA+TKIP or WEP unless you have no choice.Running Windows VISTA and the connectivity has been very good. I have had one occassion where I couldn't connect to the router and the odd thing is that I couldn't figure out why. Oh well, I'm going to buy another as a spare."},{"rating":"1","title":"ka ka","review":"I bought this and tried to deal with it for a week. I even exchanged it for a new one, thinking that the router I bought was defective. Same problem, as follows:Connectivity with Outlook/Exchange was spotty, and would drop connections every 5 minutes.Instant Messages would also get dropped (as noted by the way the messages would route to my mobile phone as I sat in front of the computer).Other applications requiring a constant connection would also drop connections.If you need to rely upon this router to get home office / vpn tasks done, and have complete reliability, then pass on it, and get a better router.Tech support was no help in diagnosing the issue, and it appears that in order to workaround the issue, you'd have to get into some heavy customizations of the advanced rules. A router should work for above functionality out of box, without additional configuration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pas on this router!","review":"I couldn't get it to work, period. I followed all of the instructions several times and while I could connect to the router, I could not get to the Internet. I could not find a single tech support phone number.

How retarded is that!. Second, once the software install is completed, the internet worked, FOR 1 second. I was able to go to the first web page, that was it. Then it will not work at all. I reinstalled, and did the same thing. Not really sure where the problem is, but it kept saying that my ISP account is incorrect/inaccessible, whichled me to believe it's the userid and password issue.

Every single month, it goes offline. I have to call customer service and reconfigure it. It stays online for a month and then goes offline again. Each time it takes at least 30 - 45 min to walk through reconfiguring in. I have never had so much problem with a router. DON'T BUY IT. IT'S NOT WORTH THE HEADACHES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Port forwarding failed to configure","review":"There must be a way, but not obvious, since I just configured the obvious thing -- and I usually very savvy when it comes to configuring routes and iptables.Also, the version being sold (DIR-615 I1) is not yet supported by DD-WRT -- that was my original plan.Finally when I tried to write D-LINK for support (after failing to search anything to help me with portforwarding) they must have misconfigured the url in their form. In other words, their site is broken, and I can't send messages to support.So they get 1 star because Amazon doesn't allow me to set 0 stars :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"does all that I wanted in a wireless very good speed and i am very well pleased with it. gm"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product for the Money","review":"This product was a great buy for the value. D-Link has a long reputation for providing stable wireless routers. I recently tried a Linksys router and it had to be continuously reset; hence why I returned the product for a refund. There have been no problems so far with the D-Link router. The security is very easy to set up so that even someone with little computer experience can successfully protect their network (it is amazing how many networks go unsecured, opening up a Pandora's box of risk). I previously had a D-Link wireless router. After approximately 8 years, it did not work anymore. Considering that routers are continuously on, I think that this is a testament to the quality of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dropped packets, no help from tech support; returning to Amazon","review":"We'd suffered under a Linksys router that had to be restarted at least daily, so we were excited to replace it with a newer, more modern router. I'd heard that D-Link was a good brand, but now I can't remember why I bought this when it had so many bad reviews.I've probably spent 12 hours fighting this router now, and I'm finally returning it. It works fine with my windows computers, but with my macs, it blocks various http requests. I tried turning off as many of the router's firewall options as I could, but no luck. So youtube videos don't play, and many internet pages just don't load. I tried calling D-Link tech support, which is apparently in India, but after I was on hold for a long time, the person just took a little bit of my information and then hung up on me.My search for a simple, reliable router continues."},{"rating":"1","title":"A scam","review":"I never got the product it was all a scam the price was never true and after all the process they claimed too be out of stock.

A wireless N router for $49.99, great deal, right? WRONG. This thing is garbage. After calls to support and reading up on it I have Rev A of this router and I cannot speak for Rev B. I lose connectivity, sometimes in the middle of long downloads on the wireless G and also lose connectivity on the wired port. Updating the firmware from D-Links website locked the ting up and required some sequence of holding down the resent pin while unplugging and re-plugging it back in. Now whenever i need to re-boot it to regain connectivity to my modem all the settings are set to default, including the admin password and the wireless network settings.This is getting returned tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless is intermittently horrible","review":"I bought the DIR-615 for my main gateway and for an N wireless network. For the most part it works well. The biggest problem is that the wireless connection is horrible. I have a D-Link DAP-1522 that I also bought to connect my downstairs Tivo and Boxee box to the router since there wasn't a way to make a wired connection. I get nowhere near N speeds. In fact, I have done multiple tests with multiple devices (THE DAP-1522, xoom, two different laptops, EVO, etc), and ALL of them get at most 1Mbps where they all consistently hit my 10Gbps cap from my ISP when going through my older wireless G access point.

Just don't buy it because it's wireless N."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"After trying unsuccessfully to use a Lynksis router with Vista, I bought this product without doing any research 5 days ago. What a mistake! After 4 straight days calling customer service (both D-Link and my DSL provider who kept blaming each other) with people who you can not understand, they finally figured out I needed a firmware upgrade.

Never have I experienced a drop of connection.The router also comes with a stand so you can stand it sideways a feature I appreciate as my desk is a little crowded.The only problem I have is when I test my firewall with Shields up I show about 4 stealth ports,Port 80 open and the rest closed. It may be because I also have Linksys phone adaptor for Voip installed in series with the Router and DSL modem.I'll have to research it but again I suspect the adaptor.

My PS3 is about 15 feet away from the router, and until a couple of days ago I could get decent throughput over wireless.However, now it's to the point where I have to connect my PS3 to the router via Ethernet, as the wireless is practically unusable.

This CD isn't worth borrowing, or even downloading. Don't even listen to the samples. It'll ruin your image of a once incredible band.

The reviews labeling this \\"their best ever\\", etc. make me question the sanity of the average citizen. This offering reeks. In the past, Ween has reached near-sublime heights with their playful hijinks and meta-modernist composition, but like Beck, they seem to have bottomed out and lazily slap together songs as if performing some bland act of musicological onanism. Tribute to the Beatles? Even worse, as the Beatles are one of the more horrific, derived group of musicians that came out of the hollow shell of the '60's. Where's the feeling? Where's that crass, yet pious zaniness that marked such creations as \\"She Wanted to Leave\\", \\"Fluffy\\", or even \\"I Play It Off Legit\\"? WHITE PEPPER is inane.

For some reason that reminds me of this album.I like Ween because they seem to be able to reinvent themselves with each new recording.

After the amazing Mollusk I had my hopes up real high for White Pepper. Does W.P. meet my expectations NO, but what possibly can after the Mollusk! Is White Pepper among this years best, absolutely. This record is about the songs and not \\"THE ALBUM\\" as Mollusk was. \\"Even If You Don't\\", \\"Bananas and Blow\\" and \\"Back To The Basom\\" are among Ween's very best. \\"Even If You Don't\\" has hit single written all over it and heavily reminds me of Squeeze, MiNsTeR HiLL and XTC...a fantastic pop rock track. \\"Bananas and Blow\\" is Jimmy Buffet on coke instead of weed. \\"Back To The Basom\\" is a modern day Floydian. A wonderful release that has me anxiously awaiting their next record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dealing with Abuse","review":"I'm engaged in Christian ministry and one of the most significant problems I find in talking and praying with people who have been abused is providing them with a way to express themselves. The second most difficult problem is the feeling of isolation because the abused person feels alone. This is true whether the abuse is physical, emotional, or spiritual.Al Johnson helps with his poetry in dealing with both problems. He models a way of expressing things that are very difficult to express. He shows abused people that they are not alone. He also talks things through to some form of healing.Not everyone will be able to express themselves through poetry. Not everyone will find poetry an easy form to read. That is true of all forms of expression. This book will, however, expand the range of tools available to those who help people deal with abuse. It will help those who have been abused find a way to express themselves, and in turn help others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of Gysin","review":"Gysin's work is on par with (and goes beyond) abstract painters such as Mark Tobey. His combines Zen brush painting with a cosmonaut's vision. Stare long enough at his work and find your own \\"Port of Entry.\\" Included in the book are his early surrealist drawings and desert scenes--very difficult to find reproductions of these. My only disappointment with the book is the long biographical bit lifted straight from the Geiger biography. Anyone truly interested in Gysin would own both books! I would've also liked to read more about Gysin's meetings with Genesis P'Orridge. These are very minor things and definitely do not mar the book's presentation. A truly remarkable book. Hats off to the author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Maybe this book was little too young for me. I just expected more from the author of THE DOLLHOUSE MURDERS, I was sorely disappointed when the plot became immature and pointless. The book starts out exciting enough, when Sarah is forced to move out of her room for her cranky old Aunt. As always, the relationships and character developement are the highlight of Ms. Ren Wright's story, but that alone will not be enough to entertain a reader who wants a ghost story. The plot becomes absurd and unbeliveable evn for a ghost story. In this book, I wasn't very interested in the characters and Ms. Ren Wright seems to hope that the entire book with stand on that alone, but in the the end it cannot. The ending left me saying \\"Huh?\\" because it was simply pointless. It just seemed like there should be more to it. The already ridiculous plot was resolved far too easily and the ending resolution will leave readers feeling cheated, and disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a side of Europe that's a lot like a frat house","review":"If you want to go to Europe and drink this is the book for you.

This is just totally unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been great","review":"However, after using for 10 minutes it automatically shuts off and would not come back on.

I've been using it for two weeks (probably 7 or 8 times total). And I love it! It works great, and has cut my styling time in half. In the interests of full disclosure, I have thick, wavy, shoulder length hair. I dry my hair 80% of the way before I use the iron, but don't even try to straighten it while blow drying my hair.

First one didn't work to start with. Second worked for a couple of months and got less hot as time went on - also kept turning itself off until it spent more time off than on. I got a third one a couple of days ago and during the first use last night - surprise - it stopped after 5 minutes and does not work at all now!It's going back for good to Sephora (thanks to them for being so helpful) I'm changing brands. I only used it on dry hair too - the one time I used it on wet hair, it steamed a lot and promptly turned itself off! $200 does not buy reliability even if it was good on the infrequent times it did work.I do have the T3 hairdrier - that at least seems to be problem free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I have nothing positive to say about this iron. 1. My hair got caught a few times between the plates. 2.

I'm black with relaxer, but I don't relax my hair bone-straight (it's more texlaxed). So when my hair is wet, it's still curly.I am afraid to use it on wet hair, but I have used it on dry hair.

I looked like Flat Stanley's long lost black sister.I ended up giving this iron away to my sister and sticking with my Chi Turbo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hair Iron Ever!","review":"This is the third flat hair iron I have owned and it is by far the BEST! I started with a cheap one that did nothing for my wavy hair. Then I moved on to a Solano Sapphire (more of an investment). This worked well, except for my hair getting snagged on the edges of the plates every time. I also found myself never using it because it was too time consuming to straighten wavy hair. I was skeptical when I first heard about his iron, at Sephora, for $200, so I purchased it from Amazon (this is a FABULOUS price). This is really the best iron. It's light and easy to maneuver, it heats up in about a minute, you can control the temperature, it's quick, my hair stays straight forever (even after sleeping), and it has caused much less hair damage than my sapphire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased this product after alot of research, I found that this was the best deal on a T3.When I got this product I couldn't wait to use it!!I plugged it up, waited for it to heat up then I began the long awaited process of straightening my natural curly hair.After about 5 minutes of straightening I noticed it wasn't working quite as well as before.The unit had shut off!!I unplugged it, let it cool off and tried again.The straightener wouldn't even come on!!Needless to say, I sent it back, and my hair is still curly!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased a T3 Tourmaline Wet Dry product 4 years ago and it finally broke, so I thought I was buying the same product. The picture advertised at Amazon.com is exactly like the iron I originally had. It was metalic and had heft to it. However, the iron I received is cheap plastic. It doesn't look anything like the picture advertised on the website. In the slightest humidity, my hair gets frizzy and begins to unstraighten. This iron takes much longer to straighten my hair and it doesn't make my hair shiney. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"Certainly a definite must for a Dokken fan.

Even a cursory glance will tell you that the stories included in this anthology are not, in their present state, ready to be published. There is zero evidence to suggest that any editing has taken place, however loose one's definition of the word. I feel sorry for all the people who have submitted stories. What these authors need - what every aspiring writer needs - is constructive criticism, in order to improve. These writers' works should not be in print without serious revision. Ironically, the \\"editor\\"'s short story is the worst of the lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I put out good money for this mess","review":"There was only a single half-way decent story in the book, the one by Steven Shrewsbury. I have read many of his stories and liked them, but this one, Home of the Brave, disappointed me.The others were trite, poorly written and unappetizing. The worst of the lot was Pacione's Bite of the Spider, which is a sequel to his House of Spiders. He cannot write well to begin with. His sentences change tense in the middle, his analogies don't work, and I sometimes wonder if he knows the proper meaning of many of the words he uses. His story is a perfect example of what is known as the \\"dumbing down of America\\".Hasan Abood's story, El Horror de la realidad, is the second worst in the book. The dialog is stiff and unworkable. His simplistic sentence structure read like a fourth grader wrote them. I found the story to be completely trite.The rest of the stories in this anthology are not worth mentioning."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful tool for Bible students","review":"I love this book so much.

The use of color, sidebars, maps, and illustrations is outstanding.The material itself goes beyond mere description of names.

I reccommend having a notepad alongside you while reading. That way you can write down all of the names and keep track. I am a lover of the hobbit, lord of the rings, and many other of his books but this one was just plain confusing and therefore I did not enjoy it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a niche text.","review":"Unless you are already an avid \\"Lord of The Rings\\" (LoTR) fan this is one to avoid. I read \\"The Silmarillion\\" after completing LoTR, about which I was only mildly enthusiastic. It was a struggle not to abandon it and move on to something more engaging. \\"The Silmarillion\\" reads like an ancient historical text, but one can't help but be aware that the \\"history\\" being portrayed exists entirely within Tolkien's head. The lack of significance makes sloughing through the dense and often pretentious prose a chore with little reward.LotR is an important piece of modern cultural mythology. It falls under the category of something one should read. It helps that it has an interesting story line and vivid characters. The same can no be said for \\"The Silmarillion.\\" All but hardcore Tolkien aficionados can safely leave this one by the wayside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading through to the end.","review":"This is an incredible book for those who just can't stop with TLOTR. The most difficult part is sticking through the first seventy-five pages, as there are literally hundreds of names that surface that are all very similar. If one can stick through this part, it is definitely worth it. Not only are the stories every bit as rich as TLOTR, but also Tolkien writes his first and incredibly beautiful tragedy. Stick through the beginning, it is definitely worth reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SILMARILLION-JUST TOO EPIC!","review":"Anyone who loves the Hobbit and then the Lord of the Rings as much I do is left wanting more. So naturally \\"The Silmarillion\\" is the next obvious choice. Sadly this grandiose work falls short of J.R.R 's earlier work.One could say that this was his son's influence on the text but sadly I think that both father and son had lost sight of the true magic of Middle-Earth. Namely great story telling.Yes with in depth history to back up the myth but not at the expense of the narrative. Still there are some great insights. Not enough though to sustain what is essentially a history (of biblical proportions) of Middle Earth and Numenor and lands beyond from the dawn of creation. I love escaping into fantasy but not to this degree. I even found the sheer wealth of detail a little unnerving.Good Luck!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"well written but sadly dull","review":"Yes as every other reviewer has pointed out this book is well written, but where i disagree is in the fact that the book will put you to sleep. Some parts will grasp you and not let go but then again not only are those parts short and far between but ultimately unfulfilling, each story is never fully realized and is to short in my opinion. If you would like to read a creation story go read the first five books of the bible, it's what you feel like you have just read anyways. A long list of who married who and their children and their childrens children, where their step neice lived etc... if you are a tolkien junky who needs his fix be ready because this IS NOT lotr, its completely different. Tolkien must be given credit though this book is well written. If you just have to read it buy it used or get it from a friend, its not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"But be warned, it's pretty technical.","review":"This is a thorough, careful examination of the theories and their supporting evidence about the Permain extinction. That's both the strength and weakness of this book-all sides are presented, but there's a lot of heavy technical reading. I have a decent biology background, and I still found it very heavy going. The book is also a bit dated now, for example it doesn't have much on the asteroid impact theories.

I'm happy with the player overall, no skips or chirps in mine and it plays my CD-RW discs without complaint.The only reason for the 4 star rating is the time it takes to move from track to track. I have many mp3s that are live performances, and the tracks are meant to be played right after one another to preserve the presentation. The player takes a good 2-3 seconds after each track to start the next one, which breaks up anything that is meant to run consistently.

The videos I'd seen before, and they are what they are. Entertaining, goofy, lovable. BUT, the documentary! It's terrible. The editing is terrible. There was little to no narration, very little new information. The art direction was non-existent. There was no definable visual threads through the whole film.

Most of the book is a very dull read. I doubt that it was a dull life on board. My point is that most of the book is the grinding of daily life, only becomming interesting when action was about to take place. Unfortunately the action was sometimes days in between any action. See a plane, clear the bridge, dive, up scope, plane gone, surface, at least 50 times. I found myself turning pages for the cream of the book. I love history, the author just made it dull.

Join Richard O'Kane aboard the Tang as he weaves a tale of suspense and action better than any work of fiction. Under his command, the Tang ranked fourth in the number of tons of Japanese shipping sunk. We get a rare \\"periscope liberty\\" look over the author's shoulder as he tracks his prey across the vast Pacific. Whether rescuing a record number of downed fliers or launching torpedoes from the very center of a confused and sinking Japanese convoy, his no-nonsense style and matter-of-fact delivery leave no doubt that this man was - in every respect - a true submarine commander.

While on some speaker sets, the album can sound muddied and bogged down, headphones are a perfect way to hear just how nuanced and beautiful the arrangements truly are.With a firm grasp of Van Morrison-esque blue eyed soul, Dunger does an amazing job utilizing a jazz band to play country flavored R&B.; All in all, this album is very reminisce of an Astral Weeks period Morrison, and the comparison is justified on songs like \\"Something New\\" and the title track, \\"Soul Rush\\", with joyous and explosive vocals over sweeping melodies.A must have album from an amazingly talented songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ballad album","review":"Very early LP from young Mel Torme famous for his \\"velvet fog\\" voice.I never understand why is Sinatra so revered and Torme known only to connossieurs ,in my opinion Torme was far better and more interesting singer - give him swing or balads,he was simply superb in everything he touched and is definitely one of my all-time favourites.On this particular album its all-ballad,smooth like velvet and perhaps too much of the same thing can make you comatose but I would listen Torme singing anything,his voice was so appealing.When kids today talk about Michael Buble,I tell them there was another singer long before him who was much better and give them Torme to hear.Actually there is interesting thing with Sinatra and Torme - Sinatra was famous for his swinging and I prefer him singing ballads,while Torme was loved for his ballads and I prefer when he was swinging,so there you go."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"I received a bottle of this as a gift during my pregnancy and just had to buy some more when it eventually ran out!

There's a blistering extended version of Reverence near the begining of the album, which by itself would have been enough for me to buy this album. There's several other bright spots--\\"Something I Can't Have\\" is reminiscent (but still distinct) of \\"Tumbeldown\\". JMC does good remakes of \\"Tower of Song\\" and \\"Guitarman,\\" but their remake of \\"My Girl\\" is a little too strange for even diehard fans like myself. If you like JMC, buy this album.

Don't think perversely, this is for others on the short side: The tip of the tie reached mid-pubic area. If you'll be wearing the tie so that it's seen, think about how long it might be if you are less than average height.

I had hoped that the book would be perfect and would clearly explain every relevant concept but that was not the case. When it came to the three interesting case studies that concluded the book, the author used concepts that were never explained - control-break layout, parent entities, ISAM file organization, repeating groups, reblocking files.

Since then I've seen other Antonioni pictures and to me, his films are the archetypes of the annoying foreign film pretending to reveal the deep mysteries of life to you but delivering nothing.

After a while they notice one of them has gone missing. In the ensuing search for her, which eventually takes them back to the mainland, the missing woman's best friend and her loved fall for each other to fill the void of their meaningles lives. The movie is powerful in showing the decaying and worthless lives of the rich, and towards the end of the movie the main characters actually fear the return of the missing girl.

Everything that has already been said on here about the beautiful images in every frame, and the freshness of approach, etc., I agree with completely. Viewing it from a \\"normal\\" movie-watching perspective, the story is very interesting, but a little slow; I probably would have given it four stars. But the entirley new perspective and enthusiasm that is provided by Gene Youngblood's commentary really elevated the film to a higher level for me. The film definitely stands on its own as a great work of art, but the Criterion edition helped me to adjust to Antonioni's style and language much quicker. A great film, transfer, special edition, and commentary. This is well worth the cost if you're looking for something interesting and new.

The story is that a woman mysteriously disappears while on a yachting trip with friends. Her fiance and her best friend search for her, and begin an affair. The premise may sound as though the film would be suspenseful or emotional, but it isn't. It's slow, meandering, and quite dull.

I could not stand this movie. The acting was so terrible and I had no interest in the characters whatsoever. The only scene I found interesting was when the character Sandro is in the square and he knocks over the young artists ink bottle destroying his illustration. I'm guessing it was out of jelousy. That is the only scene in the film wich shows any sort of authentic human behavior or emotion. The rest of the film is just amature jibbish very far away from resembling Neo-Realism.If you really liked every aspect of this movie you no nothing about cinema. Good cinematography is not enough.

The effort involved is worth the trouble because L'Avventura builds into a powerful experience. Some have viewed the film as Marxist tract against the idle rich but it is more than just that. Non-caring egotism,spiritual emptiness, easy betrayal are some of the major themes. The disappearance of Anna is more of a plot device than anything else; don't get too hung up on it as it is not one of Antonioni's main concerns.

The worst thing about this movie, though, is the dialogue. The characters refer to Vegas as \\"this Godforsaken town\\" so many times, you could make a drinking game out of it!

Tarantino has yet to realize that if you rape the audience enough with swill, they'll abandon you (explaining Jackie Brown's poor domestic gross).

Unlike normal dominos, which just goes straight and perpendicular, each piece in this game curves- so you not only need a snail piece, but sometimes a snail pieces on the correct side (depending on which way the curves are going).

The battery is a BL1830.There is an intelligent circuit inside the pack that needs to be powered, and it draws its power from the very cells it is monitoring.The basic design flaw is that the circuit is wired to be powered by only one of the many cells in the pack. The PCB draws a constant although small current from that single cell. If the battery is not used for a few weeks then that cell will deep discharge causing a weak link in the bank of cells, the pack then fails in the charger.Makita has programmed the circuitry so that if you try to charge the battery 3 times in this state, it will permanently disable it. Normal behavior is to think \\"why is it not charging, let me try again\\".

His technical precision and brilliance is obvious and he brings his uniqueness to this recording. Some may find his idiosyncrasies annoying, but I am drawn into this music and he plays with such zeal and joy I can't fault his playing and fast tempo. I find it exhilarating. Some reviewers have criticized the fast tempo as detracting from the intended spirituality of Bach's music, but I disagree. What rule dictates spirituality can only be expressed at a slower tempo? Isn't Glenn Gould's joy and exhilaration an expression of spirituality? I recommend this recording should be part of any Bach or Glenn Gould collection. I feel that as he went on his idiosyncrasies got more and more pronounced and the music became oppressed by them, but this recording is more refreshing than odd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goulden Boy","review":"There is no doubt - Bach and Gould make a utopian combination.

It it difficult to spend several minutes watching the man lean out of bed to throw up in the garbage can but that is the reality of withdrawal.

One advantage of the 24-track recording over the primitive 2-track used until \\"Landed\\" is the more sharply-defined sound, sometimes enhancing the band's highly imaginative atmospheres. The 15+ minute Animal Waves, which has a wondrous synthesized intro, runs a more sharply cut 8 minutes on the \\"Cannibalism 2\\" compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Changing of the Can","review":"On this album, Holger Czukay quits playing bass and switches to the radio, dictaphone, and various other bits of electronics.

The fluidity of earlier Can records from \\"Soon Over Babaluma\\" is now dispelled, replaced with a turgidity that would hit its nadir with the next release, \\"Out of Reach\\". Nothing on this release stands out and amazes, although what Holger is up to throughout is worth note, as it forms the basis of what he was about to start doing on his solo efforts which begin not long after this project.

Starting with their Adrenaline which sported a fair amount of melody and distorsion, over Around the Fur which displays what chaos can be, to White Pony Deftones show an amount of maturity over their years of growth. White Pony is softer than Around the Fur (example: DaiTheFlu in Around the Fur). The Maynard from Tool appears in one song (i think Passanger) and adds Tool's dark and cryptic feeling.

There is just something for everyone on this album, from the softened dynamics of digital bath to the haunting of passenger and change. My only real complaint is that they changed the song Pink Maggot to a softer version, rather than the rap-metal version that was on the internet a few months ago. But it is still great. If your in to heavy music, you will love it, and if your into more softer, more mellow and deep music, you will love it still.

Yes, like other bands out there today they are influenced by the hard rock giants like Metallica , Alice in Chains, and Nirvana, but this influence is not at all apparent. This record represents the evolution of hard rock. While Alice is brilliant and direct with their songs, thereby making them much more radio friendly, this album, (With absolutely stunning songs like Pink Maggit), represents the next step."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones' Best (In A Way)","review":"Wow, did this CD blow me away! From the first to the last track you hear Chino Moreno's voice change from yelling, whispering, rapping, desparing, and just screaming loud as f**k.. The Best Tracks, are (in order of dopestness): Passenger, Knife Party, Korea, RX Queen, Feiticeira, Elite, Street Carp, Digital Bath, Change, Pink Maggit, Teenager. This CD is not as hard as Deftones' CDs Adrenaline and Around the Fur, but White Pony is definitely proof that Deftones can \\"Change\\". I, like all other Deftones fans, fear that Deftones will start to soften up more, and make songs like Teenager. I hate the boy+girlsbands of today and hope Chino Moreno doesn't fall in. If your looking for a CD that can bring you from fears to tears, and jolts to catapults... then come take a ride on the White Pony."},{"rating":"2","title":"White pony is the pinnacle of the dtones (so far)","review":"i first encountered the deftones at hfstival 2000 (for those of you in the dc area who have anything to do with music, you know what im talking about) and i must say that they put on a performance that has yet to be surpassed, and ive seen 35+ bands in concert. the raw emotion in their music was definitely felt by the crowd and everyone was immersed in it, for better or worse (afterward, i unfortunately saw people being carried off on stretchers), but that performance had me hooked. i immediately purchased all 3 of their cds, with white pony emerging as my favorite. adrenaline is also a good one, and i simple was too enamored with both adrenaline and white pony that i never gave around the fur much of a chance. anyways, purchase the album and you will be in for a musical experience that transcends reality...even if the lyrics dont make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's not easy listening, that's for sure...","review":"white pony is one of these albums where you have to LISTEN. get some headphones, turn it up loud and go on a journey into the musical world of the deftones. and what a world this is...do you like TooL and A Perfect Circle? well, then try the deftones, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pot o' gold disc","review":"This is the first deftones cd i have ever bought, all though i doubt that it will be the last.The deftones were recommended to me by a friend and since then, i have become a big fan. Most of the songs on this album are pretty good. Several highlights include 'feiticeira', 'digital bath' 'elite', 'knife prty' and 'change (in the house of flies)'. on all the songs, vocalist Chino Moreno uses his extensive vocal range to its fullest, creating a dark, haunting sound. The bandmembers-Abe Cunnigham, Chi Cheng, Frank Delgado and Stephen Carpenter contribute to the music by exaggerating the heavy riffs and creating music that seems to reach out and fill the air. In all, this cd is definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones gets it's own category in music.","review":"This band is absolutely incredably- The lead singer's voice- as someone else mentioned is \\"hypnotic- and the guitar music is scary in a nice way\\". This band is unlike others- I think they have serious talent in making their music a blend of metal, rock and maybe even techno (like Moby kind of techno). And also they got a guy with an incredable voice- so this band has a lot of things that none others have. Go Deftones! (but make your lyrics a little less dirty) ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"i got this the otherday and it is one of my favorite cds! good guitar riffs, drum beats and bass lines make this cd into one hell of a good one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"deftonic","review":"Upon purchasing this Cd, a few have being raving it as the 'best metal Cd yet'. Thus judging on their prized taste in music i've succumbed and bought it. At first listens tracks like 'back to school', 'digital bath', 'elite' and 'change' certainly succeeded in making the money spent worthwhile.However with the word of mouth advertising did not hold up to expectations with this Cd. True the musical content at times can be sonically orgasmic with 'digital bath' and others mentioned, but at first what really made this album weak for myself was the 'lyrics heard' like 'heres my new address 665' taken from street carp and others like 'you're my girl and thats, alright' taken from Rx queen. Lyrics like these really irriiated me, but after reading the 'real lyrics' it did make sense in its own context. Thus makin it from 3 stars to 4.In reagards to 'the best metal album' ive yet listened to one, this Cd is good but that is all that can be said."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best releases","review":"Out of all the Deftones cds this could just be my favorite one. The songs have the perfect balance of screaming and mellow singing that people have to come to love about the Deftones over the years. You would be hard pressed to find a bad song on here and this is one of those cds that you can put in and listen to from start to finish. Overall, I highly recommend this if you are a Deftones fan or if you just want some good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool, something different for a change","review":"This song is excellent. I think the Deftones were very creative when they made this song. Most alternative rock sounds the same, but not this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"this is another good record by a great band, not as heavy or violent as their past 2 releases but there is material on here that will please the old emo-core fans and material that requires open minds, every track almost except for one has heavy guitars, Deftones didnt sell out they just kept going at their old pace with an experiment here or there. Favorite tracks: Elite, Knife Party, Korea and Feleitceira."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotion..pure emotion!","review":"This is a masterpiece in not only it's composition, but it's feeling that it leaves you with. Each song is carefully crafted from the full on metal tracks such as Elite, to the mellow ambient tracks such as Teenager. The Deftones still have their disinct sound and Chino has improved his harmonics to the fullest. I have to admit that I was worried that this album was going to be over-commercial but it isn't, it just shows how mature the songwriting has become. I'm not going to tell you to buy the White Pony, but don't you even think about having an opinion on metal, until you've heard this essential album."},{"rating":"2","title":"its about time!","review":"I have been watching Ebay and the originals never went for less than $100 and that was for a used copy. Thank you Deftones for putting this back out. It is joy to my ears! You can't go wrong with this. The vinyl sounds great and the gatefold is awesome. I don't need to review the music as hopefully you already know this is one of the best rock albums put out in the past 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"My fave song is \\"Change\\". I like this album because it flows well. It isn't too hardcore nor too mellow. I also like the song at the end. I listen to it on repeat. Love Deftones."},{"rating":"2","title":"New and slightly Improved Emotion Rollercoater","review":"Ah the Deftones...personally my favorite band. Their third effort White Pony was the most anticipated rock album of last year. For a reason. It starts off with the pounding sound of \\"Back to School\\"....an anthem for every teenager out there. This is probably Chino's second most screamy song. his first is \\"Elite\\"....not really my taste but constantly gets stuck in my head......To, me the best song is \\"knife prty\\"...its highly envigorating and refreshing....the lyrics are so intricate....chinos singing is purely mesmerizing......it always suprised me how chino can go from a soft whisper to a high pitched scream in about 1 second....this whole band has talentif youre looking for a cd that youll keep in your stereo for months....this is the one....white pony is an evolution for the deftones"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow","review":"This cd is way to slow for a deftones cd. I wouldn't say they sold out though they just changed into boring slow band."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd time is not a charm","review":"I SO wanted to love this CD, I really did. I have had a copy for months before it came out, so I have gotten the chance to REALLY listen to it. \\"Passenger\\" with Maynard Keenan from TOOL fame is the first song I heard off the CD. After hearing what came to be my favorite song off that cd, I proceeded to listen to the rest of it with the same expectations. I just could not get into that whole \\"be quiet and drive\\" vibe through the majority of the CD. \\"Elite\\" is a good track, and a lot like the harder stuff they are known for. Im not giving this CD 2 stars because it's not hard enough, but because I don't think it is that great. \\"Aroung the fur\\" had WAY better song structure. I am sure you will listen to this CD and right off the bat you will day \\"All right!\\" and love it. But just keep listning.....BUT if you are a TOOL fan, I highly recomend listning to \\"Passenger\\". Maynard and Chino are awesome, and that is a creepy song. Have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones come alive in new approach","review":"The Deftones have come alive in their new approach to their music. They have shown the ability to shred, and now they have succeeded in their attempt to haunt and to compel listeners to \\"go get (their) knife.\\" This is an album which can be most noted for the eerie guitar tones, and creeping, grasping lyrics. I couldn't help but be drawn in by the different cacophanies, and since this is my first purchased Deftones CD, I'm looking forward to hearing their previous efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit On The Darker Side","review":"I've been a fan of these guys since '96 and this new cd sounds so different from the other two.I mean the guitars are the same and the singing is too,it's just the songs sound so much more sad and dark,if i can use the word \\"gothic\\" sounding.Kind of disappointed that there isn't as much screaming in it,even though \\"elite\\" is probably the heaviest song they've made.They've toned down a bit but i really don't care cuz they're still my favorite band and are the best band out there right now.If you truly love the 'tones then you'll truly love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones ride high!","review":"The first thing that I want to point about this album is it is not rap/metal. It's just good hard rock with heavy metal overtones, plus some grunge added in on songs like \\"RX Queen\\" and \\"Feiticeira.\\" The lead singer has a voice that is better than most in this kind of music. He shows it off nicely on the only true ballad here - \\"Teenager.\\" But \\"Teenager\\" will not put you to sleep - there's still some funky background added in to help prevent that. \\"Street Carp\\" is very witty with the cool phone number parts in the lyrics. I'm not usually into mosh pit-type songs, but \\"Elite\\" and \\"Korea\\" were more true rage than just mindless shouting. I found that I had fun with those particular two. If you want good atmospherics, songs like \\"Digital Bath\\" with its hip hop beat parts, and \\"Passenger\\" will satisfy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done, Deftones!","review":"This album sounds little bit different from their other albums but it has interesting lyrics and the new sound is good especially on the track Change(in the house of flies). Even if you haven't hear their music before you will enjoy it once you have heard it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roll the window down, this cool night air is curious...","review":"I shouldn't have to tell you how great Deftones are. Go get this CD and you can die happy. Really."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Deftones, but not the Deftones","review":"The 3rd largely produced album from the Deftones is definatly the Deftones, but a new Deftones. Could I have fit the band name in that last sentence any more? I am actually listening to it right now. This is a more melodic album, it has less hard pounding and screaming as the last two. The guitars sound the same and the vocals are the same, but there is something just more mellow and organized about it. For those of you who like bands of this genre, but sometimes get turned off by consistant screaming every now and then, this is a must for your collection. Their previous albums, I would enjoy to a point and then had to take a breather; White Pony can keep playing and playing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellower than other albums but still a solid album!","review":"I bought this new deftones album knowing that it would be a change from the previous two albums.The white pony is softer and more melodic. In some ways I wish it was harder and Chino let out his bloodcurling screams. If you are a Deftones fan I still reccomend you go out and buy this cd. Best songs:Korea,Change,RX Queen and Elite"},{"rating":"2","title":"the Deftones still have it","review":"this is the 3rd album from this sacramento band. Well i can tell you that this is the best one ,but i don't know, it's still good, but if you like this one you'll sure gonna love the other two. and if you are thinking that chino lost his screaming and relly cool lyrics (like jon... you know who), well you'r wrong, his still got it as well as the other band members. you should really get this cd for yor \\"new-metal\\" collection befor somebody else do."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of the deftones","review":"The first 2 cd's kicked ass!

I have always found them to bequite over rated. They constanitly have been called a korn knock offby some or this phenomical genius of a band by some. to me they are just another knock off of korn. I have been a fan of both bands for about 5 years now so iam not some (edit) who watches T.R.L. Adrenaline was a great alblum so was around the fur. This alblum is comparable with korn 1998 alblum follow the leader in that they are trying for radio suppourt.

Adrenaline = good, Around the Fur = better, White Pony = booooo! I'm sorry, I thought this album was terrible.

Now theyre all popular because of Change (In th...) You get what I'm saying. I wish people would see that WP deftones is not real deftones. I'm sorry, guys, but I jumped off the deftones train just before all the WP bandwagoners jumped on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tonedeft","review":"A friend bought this album for me. After listening to half of it, I was wishing I was tone deaf. This is not what I call music and I definitely don't consider screaming, mumbling, and whining anything close to singing. Of course, some people must enjoy this sort of arrangement of noise, but if you are looking for real rock and roll that requires musical talent, stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre, at best...","review":"Here I am writing this review AGAIN (wink wink) and I will \\"keep my comments directed toward the content of the title.\\" (wink wink-again) So, here I am again, saying how average this album is. After Change and the rockin Back to School, I was totally psyched to buy it. However, I went back to borrow my sister's copy, and I'm glad I did. At first listen, a lot of tracks stand out: Back To School, Elite, Knife Party, Korea, Passenger, Change and Pink Maggit. However, after many listens, I usually go to Back to School then skip all the way to Passenger. Actually, BTS is a remix of Pink Maggit, but Pink Maggit is too long for its own good. Korea, Passenger (even though it includes vocals from the EXCELLENT Maynard Keenan) and Elite soon grow boring, and the other tracks are too slow. There's nothing spectacularly bad about White Pony, but it's average at best. It's been two weeks, and I can come to this quick conclusion-buy the friggin Back to School single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Aggresion....","review":"I bought this CD last summer, my only Deftones experience being the \\"Change\\" video on MTV and \\"My Own Summer (Shove It)\\" on the Matrix soundtrack. The first time I listened to it, I thought that it was really nothing special. It disappeared into my collection for a few months. I just took it out again a few weeks ago and it was like listening to a completely different album. What had I missed before? This is an amazing CD, starting from Chino's first scream on \\"Back to School\\" (a classic up there with Alice Cooper's \\"School's Out) to the long, beautiful closing track, \\"Pink Maggit\\". Some of my favorite tracks are \\"Digital Bath\\" (this one is genius), \\"Street Carp\\", \\"Teenager\\", and \\"Passenger\\" with Maynard James Keenan, which is an incredible duet between two great voices in hard rock music. I'm a Deftones freak, and I'm on my way to get \\"Around the Fur\\" right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I actually never bought this CD. It was my friend's and I liked it so much I \\"borrowed\\" it. Instead of the usual mosh pit anthems we find in rock these days, the Deftones have decided to experiment a little. The main force of the album's success lies in the first single \\"Change (In The House Of Flies)\\" which has the distinction of being one of the few non sell-out rock groups to ever make it to TRL. Another good track is the spooky RX Queen. The album sounds very similar to a Tool album, and Maynard James Keenan guest stars on Passenger, another standout track. It's very refreshing to have a quality rock record that doesn't base itself on anger and depression, and a vocalist who sings rather than raps. This is a very good recording, and I'd definately advise everybody to purchase it. Who knows, maybe I'll finally give my copy back to my friend. Probably not though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to School is sweet..but is it worth a whole CD??","review":"I LOVED White Pony.. In fact I had downloaded the album off of the 'net before it was release officially, and the promo had Back to School on there. I was upset it wasn't on the CD. NOW I understand. A marketing gimmick! Well, I will probably still buy it, just because I'm a die hard 'tones fan, but it stills seems like a crazy idea. If you don't own White Pony, buy this one. If you have it, I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought my year was allready made by A Perfect Circle.....","review":"I think this is a very strong and diverse album. Though clearly not as hard as expected, it has some cool stuff. Like in the second song it is like he is singing in the bathroom supported by waterdrop guitar licks. And the song Passenger with Tool singer Keenan: WOW! What a great song(and surprise!), the first time you sometimes must really pay attention who sings/whispers when, those two voices are mixed so cool, sensual and full of tension! Just buy this album, you won't regret it. What a beautiful year.. pfff... who's next? Tool ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones keeps rocking hard","review":"Deftones has done it again, this cd is different than their other two- they've said that they feel like making the type of music they want to at the time, so they dont stick to only one type of hard-core sound- but this cd is great and does deserve 5 stars, with Maynard James Keenan from \\"tool\\" and \\"a perfect circle\\" singing on the song \\"passenger\\" how can you not be interested in hearing it? it is a great cd for any hardcore fan, buy it now! you wont be sorry! later!"},{"rating":"2","title":"White Pony","review":"Once again the Deftones have done a wonderful job of recreating the magic of Around the Fur, and Deftones. The beats do not dissappoint, and the vocals are just short of greatness. Suported by thumping drum lines and bass riffs that can't go unnoticed, they have out done themselves this time! I give it a thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great change...not sell-out","review":"Wow...that's all I can say. This album is great...and CHANGE IS GOOD. Selling out is bad, and thats the one thing these guys avoided, which is great. Personally i really liked \\"Change\\" alot, and I'm sorry to say but it's one of the weaker tracks on the album. \\"Digital Bath\\" has to be the best track on here...it's simply put, amazing. \\"Elite\\", \\"Passenger\\", \\"Knife Prty\\", and \\"Korea\\" are also great tracks. Don't blow your money on the limited copies it's just a waste. Use your $14 on this great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of the 'Tones","review":"This cd is truly fantastic. I wasn't really into this type of music before, until my brother introduced me to the Deftones. They are my favorite band ever, and I can't wait until they create even more marvelous music. I haven't got a single negative thing to say about this band. They're the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"more emotional than the first two.","review":"This album is more of a statement of this bands maturity over the last few years. It is still really heavy in spots, but these guys really want you to get what they're saying by listening to the words.. I love the first two records, and practically wore them out, this one will get there too, but it may take some time.

The Slower side","review":"This cd is awesome.. it still has their technique where they playing slowly in a song and then metal starts blasting and chino is goin psycho. But the cd is not as good as the 1st but thats life. The 1st one, named \\"Adrenaline\\", was heavy, very heavy. In this one they did an awesome job even goin slow. My last words are, buy the cds in order. Cause 1 and 2 are awesome and so is 3 but isnt as heavy... and some of the songs still sound the same as the old one, so its not too origional.. still its a good cd so go and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is high quality material","review":"I listen to music everyday, whether it comes on MTV, the radio, or even live, at concerts, and take my advice, this band shows big improvement from its previous albums and seems as if new life charged the band through the new waves of vibrant yet, exotic music being exposed to the World every day and this album can be considered one of the Deftones very finest. The song that pursueded my purchase was of course, Change (in the house of flies), but later I discovered more heavier, masterfully written songs such as \\"Elite\\" and \\"Street Carp\\", the combination of these three songs makes this album a better purchase along with its other features."},{"rating":"2","title":"white pony","review":"Not as hard as the first two but I still love it.

I was blown away by this. Everything flowed together perfectly. I was afraid they'd lose something when I heard that this would be completely different from their old works. However, the complete opposite is true. They do something truly special here, mixing elements of their two previous works and yet doing something totally abstract from the previous albums.The album starts off well and only builds up from there. Each song is different, but coalesces with the others so that there is a definite flow. From the heavy Elite to the beautiful Teenager everything here comes together perfectly.It's hard to pick a favorite song, because I like each one, but I was especially pleased with Passenger, Digital Bath, and Knife Party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"Probably one of the most repetitive, blandest albums I've heard. Plain vanilla. Nothin' special here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"The Deftones are one of those bands that I can respect for writing their own stuff and not worrying about popularity. Unfortunately, I cannot appreciate their music. All of their songs sound just about the same, and none of the musicians in the band are particularly talented. The lifeless, effects-heavy vocals are probably the worst part of the album: Chino seems to do little more than whisper in a very annoying tone or deliver a tiresome, emotionless scream that serves no purpose. This being said, the Deftones have managed to put out another generic sounding, bland metal album that is listenable, but by no means \\"essential\\" nor even all that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a little problem with this CD...","review":"Just to let you know that despite the 2-star rating, I think this is a great CD, but if you're planning on getting it (which I highly recommend) you better do so after October 3rd, because 'Back To School' (Mini-Maggot) will be added to the CD. Unfortunately for the 500 000 who already bought this CD, you have to go through the tedious ordeal of going into the multimedia portion on your computer (it's an enhanced CD) and downloading the new song if you really want it. I'm glad that the band thought about those who already purchased it, but unfortunately, my computer is too slow and I can't access the multimedia portion of the CD, so I lose out.

The song Knife Prty played and I almost stabbed my Micheal Jordan poster but then the song was over and I threw the knife out the window. Needless to say I don't listen to this album much but I like Ponies and Change in the house of flies is cool cause Carson likes it so I gave it a 2 instead of a 1.

Chynoe thinks that all of us will buy his music because he acts punk, but if he were really punk he'd have to buy cool clothes, like Tom from Blink182. And we all know that if we want to listen to hardcore underground punk/ska, we have our Good Charlotte. So do yourself a favor, and don't buy this album, unless you enjoy supporting punk posers like Chynoe. From the reggae \\"Bak 2 Skool\\" to the emo/punk \\"Pink Mage-it\\", this album is a sure letdown.

Although this smoother more mature method of guitar and drum is flowing while also pumping adrenaline into your veins, you dont know its happening but slowly...it does. Better than adrenaline, as good as Around the Fur, Deftones make no mistake in progressing, and trying new amazing things. The album also feature a guest appearance by Tool and Perfect Circle vocalist Maynard James Keenan. Best song: Change (in the house of flies) --their first single I might add. Final Analysis: A-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones are still the best!","review":"This album is a must need for everyone...The Deftones are getting better and better from an album to another...It seems that their sound is always evoluting...if you enjoyed Adrenaline and Around the fur, you will love this one...A lot of energetic songs, with heavy and slow parts very well mixed...So, stop reading this review and buy it, you won't be disappointed...Deftones RULES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Korn meets The Cure with mindblowing results","review":"What a great idea, take break-neck gutairs and hip-hop beats, and combine them with acctual emotion! This album stands out as the first great masterpiece (excluding the work of Rage Against the Machine, Cypress Hill, and Primus who have always done outstanding stuff) of the rap-metal genera, and genra i myself have been very critical of. Its hard to imagine Fred Durst belting out the kind of tunes that are presented here, emotional, hartfelt, and vulnrible. More Robert Smith, then Jonathan Davis, but the Deftones pull it off. The music is great to, what set Rage apart from the crap bands was the guitar heroics of Tom Marello, and these are up there too. The album is by no means perfect, but it is a step in the right derection for a music style known for misogynie, bigotry, and Homophobia towards the ideals of the grunge area. Lets hope those morons Limpbizkit, and there never ending army of copycats can pay attention!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminicent from Aenima","review":"This is a damn awesome CD...it is so strange because this CD compares to Tool's Aenima so much and i thought only Maynard himself could compete with his albums. I hadta write a review....here are the stand-out tracks>>>> 1,3,6,10, and ll...all the rest are awesome too but not as mind-numbing. I actually got the new release so the tracks start with *Back To School(Mini Maggit)* For the unfortunate ones who got the older version (the one that doesnt have one extra track)get a slower version of *back in school* on track 12...i tell ya what i like the heart beat sound at the end of that song (kew Bass-line)...BUT besides the point..This is a really great album no 1 should pass up! Listen to \\"Change, Passanger, and digital bath\\" AWESOME"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy, yet beautiful","review":"First off, don't say this CD isn't heavy. Just because the lyrics are more upbeat than usual on a few songs (Digital Bath, RX Queen, Passenger), that doesn't mean it's not as heavy.But at the same time, this CD is beautiful. The lyrics are touching, the guitar work is stunning, and Chino's voice---I can't even describe Chino's voice.The best songs on this CD are Back to School (I have the white version, but it seems more people read reviews for the standard silver version...), Feitceria, Digital Bath, RX Queen, Street Carp, Teenager, Knife Prty, Passenger, and Change.No matter how awesome Around the Fur was, because that CD is also a masterpiece, White Pony is that much better. Get this CD today."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album rocks!","review":"I don't care what any one says, this album ROCKS! I hate it when people keep saying that the album has no heavy tracks...There are! The album has a combination of heavy songs and lighter songs. Songs like the first one, ellite, Street Carp, Korea and a few others are very heavy. All the others are not that heavy, but is still metal. Some songs are super FREAKY...which is good. Songs like Digital Bath and Change are brilliant and twisted.Overall, this album is great. There is only one disapointment...yes the last track 'PINK MAGGOT', I thought it was supposed to be 'BACK TO SCHOOL'. The track is around 7 minutes long. For the first 2 minutes, you can just hear some very wierd sounds and then BACK TO SCHOOL starts up. BUT, it's not the proper version, he just keeps repeating Chorus over and over again...non of the verses are there. The orignal version 'Mini Maggot' was ten times better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal with meaning","review":"A couple of years ago it was hard to tell boy bands apart, now its becoming increasingly hard to determine which heavy metal band you're listening to when they come on the radio. This is not the case for the Deftones though, they have beautiful lyrics with trippy beats that make this album one of the most distinguished of the slew of heavy/rap metal albums being pumped out these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"very very good","review":"i think this is a very good album...although it is quite different from their first two releases, it is a good change. their incorporation of the dj helps increase the depth of the songs, and it turns out awesome...the best songs are probably teenage and knife prty...don't hesitate to buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Entralling","review":"The Deftones new release White Pony is one dark and mysterious album. If it isn't Chino's screaming lyrics that catch you then it is the harsh guitar riffs. The whole album just has this dark and bitter feeling to it which makes it such a great listen. A lot of the songs have Chino just screaming his lungs out like Elite and Knife Party. Some songs though so the softer side of the rage such as Teenager or Pink Maggit. The Deftones sound better than ever and the album is great. It is a must have if you really enjoy some great dark but excellent music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"This CD is a good buy. If you like the first single off of it, \\"Change\\", you will like the rest of the CD. It ranges from being sort of \\"light\\" at times while being \\"heavy\\" at others. Overall I think this is a good CD and you should look into buying it, especially if you like \\"Change\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A subdued, but excellent album","review":"While this is not as intense and loud as their last album, the Deftones have nonetheless put out one of the best albums I've heard all year. From the first single \\"Change(in the house of flies)\\" to their collaboration with the lead singer of Tool for \\"Passenger\\", \\"White Pony\\" is one of those albums that I hoped would have been longer. But despite that, this is one great rock album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones Rock!","review":"What can I say? The Deftones are back with yet another emotionally explosive album. What separtes this album from the past two is Chino's expanding vocal horizons. Chino sings on many tracks, adding a wonderful artistic touch to the album. But just because Chino begins to sing does not mean he stops his ferocious screams charateristic of the previous two albums. This is definitely an album to grab, whether you are a seasoned Deftones listener, or just someone lookin for a new band to delight your ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones #1 Metal band ever","review":"This cd and Adrenaline are the two best cds The Deftones have ever made, it's the perfect mix, buy this cd, and you won't be dissapointed.

It is heavy but disciplined, and occasionally conjures up Slint's catastrophic musical neurosis. Emotional without being emo, it is an intelligent example of what popular rock ought to be for the masses. The album has real soul and an aching, beating heart, as demonstrated by the throbbing beat that concludes the 11-song cycle. Devastatingly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imperative to own this","review":"I'm a fan of the Deftones, but above that, I'm a fan of MUSIC. This is without doubt in my top ten albums of the decade - and to own in in vinyl it's a whole different animal. I have a decent stereo, and to listen to it from the vinyl gives it another perspective. I do not own the first pressing - so I can't tell whether it's better or worse, but soundwise, it is FLAWLESS. Buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones have really outdone themselves this time","review":"After listening to White Pony I was literally in awe. This could possibly be the Deftones finest album so far. White Pony is nothing like any of the Deftones other stuff. The majority of the songs are melodic and a much slower tempo than what most Deftones fans are used to. Don't let this scare you away because White Pony still has a few songs like Korea, Street Carp, and Feiticeria that have the heavy beat that all Deftones fans love. The standout track on White Pony is Passenger because it is a collaboration between the 2 best singers in the world, Chino Moreno and Maynard James Keenan(Tool & A Perfect Circle). That song is just breathtaking and you have to hear it yourself. Overall this a must buy album and so far is the album of the year. So if you don't have it yet(shame on you) go get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should thank them for not selling out like limp","review":"Thank these guys. they're so great. they took everything that was their strong points from their first two CDs and put them to the limit. I'm excited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type of ride","review":"I did not enjoy this album. Based on the triple digit number of reviews for it, I must concede I am in the minority. This is a chart topping hit. It is also well produced, and performed. No one should be ashamed for liking this CD. Maybe it's just me, but I found it to be boring. The sound is intense, as are the lyrics. However, it seems that variation is achieved through modulating tempo alone, and that plays out quickly. And yes, I did give the ENTIRE cd much more than one listen. If you like the first three songs, I would think that you will like the entire album. Regretably, I failed that test. If you are interested in intense, heavy music or are interested in what is currently popular, this CD might be interesting to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love the deftones","review":"this cd is very good. i love the deftones. i have seen them in concert and everything. deftones is my favorite group. i will always listen to deftones. my boyfriend's song to me is \\"RX QUEEN\\". deftones rock.

I previously purchased a 95cm ball by Physioball (like the one I had been using in Physical Therapy)and it did not flatten when sat upon. I had no problem with the ball (until the cat puntured it).

If it were not for him, music would not be the same. If he had not been in this world, that alone would have made life suck.

My understanding is that in the mid-'60s, Dylan asked Lennon why the Beatles' songs didn't say anything. There followed a spate of limousine liberal songs of the most predictable type, and they're mostly very boring; not only did Lennon fall into the typical rock star trap of having to \\"prove himself\\" by going solo, but he also had to try to ape Dylan's inspired protest songs. \\"Girl\\" is about as witty as he got, and the rest is sheer pretension. \\"God\\" and \\"Imagine,\\" for example, might have seemed deep if the man had been 13; for a grown mega-star, though, they are the most childish of ruminations.

Cats can't digest plants they are carnivores. high usage of grains, high levels of carbs and of course no water. Do Yourself a favor and feed only wet food to your cat. This stuff or any dry food is nothing more than meat flavored cereal, made the same way as Capetian Crunch. If you don't beleive my review, do your own research.

It is not that the songwriting is bad, he has plenty of practice as a major lable in-house songwriter and, indeed, it takes skill to compose this type of pop/funk;rather, Mr. Nevil is capable of so much more. A more jazz or fusion-oriented approach would allow this monter guitarist the room he needs to really stretch out. And, whatever the merits of the compositions, one has an uncomfortable feeling of listening to a jazz artist caught trying to work within the constraints of the 3 minute pop format.

The reviews listed here range from one to five stars, with most of them either one or the other. You love it or hate it, folks.

I am looking forward to the next Bonnie Raitt album, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is someone filling in for Bonnie?","review":"Weak, cliched, and over produced, Fundamental sounds like more like someone trying to emulate Bonnie, rather than the real thing. Nothing stands out on this album. I am an avid Bonnie Raitt listener and eagerly await each new arrival. However, she seems to be either stagnating or selling out to the high-selling and bland Yuppie market (all the way down to the fashion statement album pics). Fundamental continues the downhill slide that followed Nick Of Time. Don't be surprised if her next album is heavy with big name guest artists.I'll take her Nine Lives album over Fundamental anyday!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Luck Of The Draw Instead","review":"See Bonnie Raitt be slowly overtaken by the blahs, actually one is temped to think the album will be cool when listening to \`The Fundametal Things', but no."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second only to Nick of Time","review":"My first response to this C.D. was to file it away after one listen, however on a recent seven hour road trip I listened enough to realize it was one of the best by Bonnie. The album is a great mix of blues and pop played honestly by Bonnie. \\"I Need Love\\" and the title track are the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have tried to like this CD but it is 'Fundamentally' borin","review":"I have tried to like this CD but it is 'Fundamentally' boring and disappointing. Bonnie Raitt is absolutely one of the best, and I've loved her music for years - roll'in down the road blast'in Bonnie - lots of times, but honestly I can hardly get through this CD. It is just an echo of all her other music (the same intros, the same sound, the same mix) coupled with the imagination of a rock. You hear the same sound here that you've heard time after time, just different words - there is nothing new. She deserves better and so does her audience. I feel ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment!","review":"After being convinced that I would never hear a Bonnie Raitt song that I didn't like.....I have now heard an entire collection among which there isn't one I DO like!Seems like an experiment gone terribly wrong....please don't do that again, Bonnie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing playlist and production","review":"Bonnie Raitt is my favorite musician and I will always buy any album she does. This one, however, coming after four earthshakingly great albums was a real bummer. Boring songs and really bad production. Did she have a fight with Don Was? No songs stayed in my head, and pretty much everything reminded me of something on another album. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, this CD is the traditional Bonnie Raitt","review":"I love Bonnie Raitt and all her music. This CD is almost a flashback to the traditional Bonnie Raitt of the '70's. Anyone who is a true Bonnie fan and had her records of the '70's and early '80's understands this. You can tell by the ratings that some people only like the Bonnie Raitt music that was extremely popular. Those albums are great, but this is what the blues are all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music the way it should be heard...","review":"I'm new to this artist but i picked this cd up after hearing the song \\"Spit of Love\\" on the radio and after a few spins in my car have grown to really love everything about this, un-polished but funky, rock and blues. Bonnie Raitts \\"Fundamental\\" should be in everyones collection! One of my favorites this year. Great singer and slide guitar player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Production is intrusive and at odds with Raitt's groove.","review":"I don't care for this much. There's a few good tracks but Mitch Froom's \\"quirky-for-the-sake-of-quirkiness\\" production seems real forced. It sounds like he came up with the junkyard groove arrangements and then had Bonnie sing over the top of them. That stiff clank-clank stuff may sound great behind someone like Tom Waits, but Raitt has a different way of feeling the beat, so it never seems to gel.While I can appreciate Raitt's willingness to try something different, this experiment didn't really produce favorable results. The string of albums with Don Was (producing) were among her best and the change of producers was a \\"mistake\\", at least as far as the listener is concerned.Disappointing album."},{"rating":"1","title":"fundamentally blah","review":"One reviewer says this is the best blues ever heard. Get out of the house and open your ears!! This album sounds like it was called in from a phone booth. Sorry, Bonnie, I'm only disappointed because I've heard you do so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamentally went wrong","review":"Tried it a couple of times and although the songs are good, the production is mediocre. Sounds out of phase, almost mono it its reproduction. Very little character to Bonnie's voice which comes across harsh and flat. Probably sounds OK on a car radio, but not for a good hifi system which reveals the flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MARILYN MONROE","review":"Please, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. This is NOT Marilyn Monroe. It is in fact, Arline Hunter. It sickens me that this film is being sold simply to cash in on Marilyn's name. You can view screen captures from this film all over the web.

And look at pictures of the real Marilyn from 1948, you will see the difference!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Marilyn?","review":"I wonder what film is stored at the Erotic Museum. The one of the three films that look the most like Marilyn, in my opinion, is the second film. That one has been stated as being acted by Arline Hunter. It is a much better quality and is more believable as it is primarily a tease film with poses like Marilyn made in her career. The other two simply do not look like Marilyn and the quality is so extremely bad, it is doubtful anyone could be certain. Also it seems doubtful that anyone filming would do it with such poor equipment. A stage film is shot to be seen. The first and third film are basically unwatchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Relevant 20 Years Later","review":"It is hard to believe this book is now over 20 years old. Guy Kawasaki does a marvelous job of conveying key traits of effective \\"Macintosh Way\\" companies and managers. The key, really, is to do the right thing, the right way. Seems common sense enough, but even 20 years later, it appears as elusive as ever.The book is extremely well written, engaging, relevant and funny. The technology/product focus has shifted somewhat over time, and Guy holds to the \\"Field of Dreams\\" build it and they will come mentality that has led Apple to success over and over again, usually from the brink of disaster.Well worth the read and very relevant even today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Formula for over the top success against all odds","review":"The teams I have been a part of that followed the basic attitude that Guy outlines here have accomplished amazing things against all odds.

Worked flawlessly for 9 months (had it mated with a Tivo series 3), and then failed. The Tivo drive tests say that it is suffering from read errors.The drive warranty is only one year. That says a lot about the product, but fair enough. So, I go to the Western Digital support site and enter the serial number. It says the drive was manufactured in 2006 and I need to provide a purchase receipt to get warranty coverage. A hassle, but again, fair enough. So, I find my Amazon receipt online, save as PDF, upload to Western Digital support site and... nothing. No response except an email saying they have received my message. That was 10 days ago. I again send an email. Again, no response. Perhaps they are trying to wait out the warranty.

They verified that it was a DUD and told me that they could send me a replacement if I give them a credit card number to hold while I return the DUD. Because I only had a debit card, they said that would work just fine BUT they would DEDUCT the cost of the REPLACEMENT drive from my card until the DUD arrived there.An absolute ripoff!!

I planned to use it with my laptop but since the drive needs it's own power supply it's not very mobile. I should've gotten a USB powered drive instead. If you want more storage space for your home, just buy an internal and have your kid install it. Also, WD's SATA enclosures are terrible. They bend the SATA cable at 90 degrees which causes guaranteed failure. So if you have one of these and it no longer works, take the HDD out of the enclosure and put it in your PC. You should be able to get your data. (Doing that will probably void your warranty)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been great if....","review":"....my computer would have recognized it.

It died, oh, it comes on and the USB port shows something there, but the device is clicking like a tap dancer on speed.

First the USB interface started getting errors then completely failed. I switched to the eSATA connection to get my data off which I was able to then it started to give me problems as well. I was very lucky to recover my data off this drive. It's still under warranty so I will get a new one, however I am forever skeptical about their external Mybook series drives. I have always owned Western Digital hard drives and they have never let me down and have always given me countless years of use. I recommend staying away from the mybook series hard drives until WD gets some of these flaws worked out. Their internal hard drives are excellent and have never failed me.

Even then, it still only reduced scratching of those spots by 50%, if that. When I applied it to general small areas where he is digging with his back feet (sides, sides of face and chin) it did nothing. The best way to apply it is only to hotspots (rashes from digging) or to a bigger yet still smallish area, in which you would have to have your dog have a very short haircut. This is the last resort after I have tried everything else (changing food to non-color, non-chicken & non-beef, treating carpets for mites/bugs, and a dozen other things). The only thing I havent tried yet is herbal medicine that the vet said would help a lot, but it is expensive. Only cortisone shots work, and they are expensive and last about 2 months.

It is super easy to apply (but be careful when soaking your applicator because it comes out fast), a little goes a long way, it soaks in nicely, and *most importantly* it works well. It does smell very strong, as there are no essential oils or fragrance added to the product. Luckily the smell dissipates in about twenty minutes and in about a week the spots heal nicely.My pup is not a fan and sulks when I get the bottle. He has never given me any indication that it hurts (stings/burns) him (I never apply on torn skin though).

The same thing would happen, they would give an antibiotic and a cream/spray to put on the wound, it would heal then 3 weeks later it would return. I was getting tired of footing the vet bill when they kept returning, so I looked elsewhere. I've been using the sulfodene twice a day for the past 5 days and his hot spots have dramatically improved. Although they are not completely healed they are doing much better. Plus it deters my dog from licking his spots, something no other \\"no chew\\" or \\"bitter\\" flavored sprays have deterred him from doing. This stuff does smell terrible but doesn't seem to sting my dog, he doesn't even try wiggle away while I apply it.

And I fail to see where anyof the humour is in the book. The humour that does exist is of thejock locker room variety, not very sophisticated or particularly interesting. The event that brings the characters together is so sillyand unbelievable, that the novel reminded me of an episode ofGilligan's Island. The whole thing reads falsely.

You get emotional romances such as Laurey Bright, and you get gritty suspense stories like Frances Housden's previous books.Maria was a great character. she'd had all this bad stuff happen to her but she was getting out there and dealing with it, she wasn't being a victim with a chip on her shoulder.

The gift, the poverty, love and denial, the play of external forces all combine to blend an artist's life into World War II and England of the day.

Look for the Avenger blade (or AVEPRO) at literally half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted","review":"This saw blade has proved to be of poor quality. The blade was installed and used to cut light gauge steel, of 18 to 20 gauge. The blade teeth wore out in a very short time and was unusable in less than a week. Some teeth broke and some lost their sharp edge after very short use. I am sorry that I ever spent good money on such a poor quality tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the Undertaker Fans!","review":"I bought this tape when I didn't know wrestling was staged. I was a huge fan of The Undertaker but watching it now is brutal! This is purely for the old-school fans that love Undertaker, the tape features the legendary Undertaker w/. Ted Debiase (Actually \\"Bulldozer\\" Brian Lee) vs. Undertaker w/. Paul Bearer."},{"rating":"1","title":"UnderTaker, He took them to Hell","review":"This video wasn't that bad because the UnderTaker took them all to Hell and back when the UnderTaker chockslammed him straight to Hell so the Video wasn't that bad it was kind of cool but that is my thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"a solid home video for any undertaker admirer!","review":"hosted by ted dibiase. undertaker vs. undertaker from summerslam 1994. undertaker vs. kwang from monday night raw in the summer of 1994. undertaker vs. yokozuna in a casket match from the survivor series 1994. undertaker vs. jim the anvil neidhart from wwf superstars from the fall of 1994. undertaker vs. jerry the king lawler in a coliseum exclusive casket match from the fall of 1994. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"This is a terrible selection of Taker matches that makes me question his greatness. First you get the Undertaker vs. Fake Undertaker. The crowd isn't into it at all, and rightfully so as it is a very boring match.Undertaker vs. Kwang is a decent match, but certainly doesn't belong on a highlight DVD.Undertaker vs. Yokozuna is pretty much standard fare for the Undertaker, and fails to grab your interest.Undertaker vs. The Anvil is a complete joke. The match ends in a countout! A complete waste of space. Undertaker vs. King was only on video, and is probably my favorite on the disc, although that isn't saying much. In summary, don't waste your money on this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"undertaker - he buries them alive","review":"This is a compilation of undertaker's matches of 1994. It features 5 matches.1 Undertaker vs Undertaker (SummerSlam) - An underrated match with a nice entrance. Cool ending 8/10.2 Undertaker vs Kwang (Monday Night Raw) - A good match. Kwang is a masked Savio Vega. This is a short match 9/10.3 Undertaker vs Yokozuna (Survivor Series - Casket MAtch) - A slow match. But very good. A lot of cool moves especially when they fight in the casket 9/10.4 Undertaker vs Jim \\"the Anvil\\" Neidhart - This is the worst match on the card. But funny when Paul Bearer cheats 7/10.5 Undertaker vs Jerry \\"the King\\" Lawler - Great match. Funny as well. That lawler can't get undertaker down 9/10.Recommended for a taker fan. Only 9.99 so what the hell?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing DVD","review":"WWF has had a lot of great DVD's but this one fails. Only five matches on the DVD. No story lines and No Interviews. The matches are boring and a waste for a dvd. But if your an Undertaker fan you might enjoy it. I bought it and will probally never watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT NOSTAGLIA","review":"this video is excellent is you like undertaker as the dead man. it's like taking a trip down memory lane. recommended buy for undertaker fans or new generation era ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep this DVD buried","review":"What were they thinking? I'm a HUGE Undertaker fan and this DVD is just a tease and dissapointing. I agree I was hoping for a 'From the Vault' type DVD with the actual career spanning history of the Undertaker.Hopefully they are in the process of making one a DVD that The Undertaker deserves. A Neidhart match? Good God !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book. This is a must read. The author takes thru some personal experiences and perspective of the church...coming into a new revival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Friends","review":"I served in 3rd Brigade First Cavalry Division in 1967 and 1968, This troop of the 9 Cavalry supported our brigade with reconnaissance and attack missions. They were superb, and this is a well told story of this extraordinary unit. The author does not mince words about the deadly nature of combat, and his story is the better for it, It is pretty raw at times and brings back memeories for me long put aside, It is not for the faint of heart, but if you want to know something of what that war was like, this a good place to discover it. A riveting story..Garry Owen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashing Sabers","review":"This book is so well written and brings reality to the daily life of a Soldier in Vietnam. Thank you Bert for taking the time to share your experiences with us. Great job, great read, very much recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"gays of the world are here!","review":"This book was great. In it, Miller visits every continent inhabited by humans and speaks with local gays about their lives. The great thing is, he makes a point of speaking to lesbians, gays of color, and the HIV-positive in all these countries. This would be a great book for gays and lesbians of color to read. There are two chapters on Thailand and this may feel a little exploitative and sex-touristy, but Miller is an obvious progressive and wouldn't mean to offend intentionally. While reading this book, you will ask yourself how Miller got the money to do so much travelling and investigating in the first place. Readers will wish they had the opportunities that the author had. This book was both informative and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated, But Still Relevant","review":"From my reading of gay and lesbian literature, Out in the World is a unique book. In it, Miller discusses gay and lesbian communities in many different countries, each with unique challenges and opportunities. Although the book is dated (it was first published in 1992), and although the situations may well have changed in the specific countries that are included in the study, Miller's insights are still very relevant as we deal with issues facing the gay and lesbian community today. As he states in his introduction, Miller is a journalist, and the writing style is reflective of this background. It is informative and direct without being dry or flowery. Out in the World is well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for an aggressive chewer","review":"If your dog is an aggressive chewer do not purchase this product. I feel it is only recommended for a puppy or small dog. It is not as durable as the orka."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent time-flow read","review":"A very human look at the life and times of Presiden Ikeda and the SGI. I'm an SGI'er but I'm also an American who works and lives in Asia and as such was always ready to try and see the dark side of everything. Is Ikeda evil? Is SGI a cult? Google \\"Ikeda cult\\" and he's blamed for everything except kidnapping the Linberg baby. The proof is in the practice. If you chant nam myoho renge kyo you will see a change in your life condition just as sure as if you start to go to a gym and start lifting weights. You will get stronger with each practice. That's the point and I think the book covers that very well. I like the book's \\"prove-to-me-you're-the-real-deal\\" approach. I have to honestly say I see President Ikeda in a very positive light as a direct result of this read. Why is President Ikeda slammed so much in Japan? There's a saying over here that is so very not the American way of looking at things in general that goes \\"the highest nail always get pounded down first.\\" Indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks like a helpful book","review":"I ordered this book for my fiance, who is having kidney problems since suffering a medication interaction that damaged his kidneys.

I have the last edition. This edition has been improved. Mine is just starting to have that used/broken in feeling.It's my favorite in terms of depth and breadth of coverage.Whether doing the work yourself or highering specific contractors familiar with what it is that needs doing. This book may help familiarize you with a great many things you're likely to encounter owning an old house.It also gives a nice explanation of the difference between Restoration, Renovation, and Preservation. As in religion and politics, those are very, very, different things.I'm preserving the 1765 end while renovating the damaged/shabbily repaired sections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for olh house owners","review":"If you have an old house, then you should own this book. Perhaps you don't want to tackle the problems of owning an old house yourself, but hire out instead. If that's true you should still read this book.

Simple, clear illustrations of what's inside the walls of an old home is very handy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The author is passionate about old houses....but:)","review":"I am so glad I read the book after I bought my turn of the century farmhouse.
