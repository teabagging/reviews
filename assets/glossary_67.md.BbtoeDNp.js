And to be honest, I was hoping that he could tell me. I usually dislike movies that take place during the night and all in one place but this movie has edge. It's a movie that leaves something to talk about after it's done because it makes you think. Everyone who watches it will have to put the peices together.

I feel that EA sports, just threw it together and did not think about the players enjoyment. I was almost ready to take it back, the same day I got it, but I have stuck it out and will keep it. But it is not worth $60, if it was priced around $30 like the tennis game for Xbox 360, I probably wouldn't have written this review, since I would feel I was getting what I paid for. But for what I paid, this should be a much better game. Maybe they will come out with updates to download that will improve the player experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I buy a 360?","review":"I have to say, as a customer, and many of us at that, I suggest a class action lawsuit against MS and EA Games.This latest release is a disgrace-I traded up my p2 and Xbox for a 360. For what I may ask?To date, only a handfull of games have been released. Sure some have better graphics, but not so much as to warrent the cost of the games themselves.In NCAA on the 360, most of what we have gained to enjoy over the past several years have been removed. This is sad. As a consumer, and avid gamer, I look for enhancements and more to a game, not a stripped down version at an exagerated price.And what happened to Backwards compatibility? This is an Fn Joke.Do not buy this game, or any EA game for that matter. BOYCOT is the only way to create a change.Madden 06 on the 360 was very disappointing(stripped down version)Tiger Woods Golf very disappointing.NCAA 07 extremely disappointing.Head Coach not even released on the 360So I ask, pay more to get less?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT WASTE YOUR 60 BUCKS!!!!!

Ever year they make NCAA better and better but the 360 version is greatly lacking all the options that PS2 and the XBOX version have. Dynasty mode has no magazine covers none of the spring drills, just 3 repetitive mini-games. If they dont make a drastic improvement with Madden 2007, I'm trading in my 360 for a PS3 this fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"This is a great game, I love all the game modes, the dynasty mode and even the mini-games are pretty cool.

Everything is so realistic from the quarterbacks to the kickers. The AI is very nice, and you really feel like your watching a live football game being played. They don't have reace for the heisman, or rushing attack, which is upsetting, but they still have a great dynasty mode, and some new fun mini games. Buy this game if you love football and you care about graphics. This game is meeant to be played either with a friend, by yourself in dynasty mode, or online.Its not for people who like all the speical game modes."},{"rating":"2","title":"EA Games Scores A Hit","review":"EA comes out with another hit, however their first on 360. The depth and realism of the fields and stadiums not to mention the two mile radius around each stadium is amazing. The fact that the shadows are in the realistic placement to where the sun would be at the time of day of the game just goes to show how much time and effort the developers put into 2007. Rosters are tight and clean with the option to name the unnamed players, gameplay has been improved with about 10,000 new animations, and the cut scenes are entertaining at first. The only negative to this game so far is how it bogs down when panning into the coin toss. Overall, EA's best game on the new platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"you guuys are like oo theres norace for the heisman mode but rly all that wa for was to take emphasis off the awful gameplay that was ncaa 06 this game is all about the game play and it is very fun the only thing that bugged me was no celebrations and the players dont come out of the tunnel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never going to buy EA again","review":"NCAA football 06 was okay..., but I expect a lot more from this game. The 360 has so much power, why did they not use it? I do believe even if you get this game at a flee market you are losing your money.The gameplay sucks! Teams bite on play action WAY to much. Hard to find a play, hard to invite a friend to play, why can't I send a play invite from the 360 dashboard?, okay graphics, try and make a comeback when the computer has already determained the outcome. I played it the other day and on the kick off my IMPACT HB fumbled the ball ran back for TD. Next kick off the HB fumbled it again! Ran back for touchdown! Next play that I had I passed to the TE on a angle pass interception ran back for TD.

I have purchased ATLEAST 1 copy of every year's release since 2002, most of those were preorders so I could play the day it came out. I own this game for Playstation 2 and enjoy it as much as any of the other releases, the Xbox 360 version is another story. This game has so many glitches it is basically a game of luck instead of skill. For example: when on defense you can, at times, press the dive button and it will allow you to sack the quarterback even though he is five yards away. Your player and the quarterback's movements will look like a real tackle although it is obvious that they are nowhere near each other. Overall, nice (but far from great) graphics and HORRIBLE gameplay. I'll be sitting on the sidelines for 08 until I see if EA has managed to bring their NCAA franchise to the 360 the way it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"NCAA = Sorry excuse for a game","review":"Every year for the past 3 or 4 years me and my brother have played an NCAA dynasty where we play on the same team, set the level to heisman, pick a horrible team (to make it a challenge), and run nothing but option no matter what the scenario is (4th and 30.....still run the option). Then we save and export our draft classes to Madden until our roster is full of NCAA players we recruited and we ultimately win championships in both games with the same players. Well, this years NCAA does not allow people to play on the same team, so ultimately this tradition is ruined!!!!! Not only did NCAA ruin the college game, but this is going to ruin Madden as well. Thanks for nothing EA sports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the promised features?","review":"The ad mentions several features that I have yet to find in the game.\\"Balance your time wisely between studies, practices, and social events ...\\" I've played through 1 1/2 dynasty seasons and haven't found this.\\"Hone your skills with 11 new challenging spring drills...\\" I have only found three mini games: bowling, tug of war, and something to do with the option.Where is the \\"Student Athlete\\" mode?I agree with other reviewers. The higher price for this game on the XBox360 isn't justified. Some of the most concerning shortfalls follow.* Several staduims are defaulted to a large bowl* The game pauses during the middle of a play - particularly when you break out for a touchdown* The momentum meter seems to have little affect and may track in strange ways. I was once up by 21 points and my momentum meter went down when I kicked a field goal.I just feel cheated out of money and features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst NCAA game ever.....","review":"I always look forward to NCAA football being released every year but this is without a doubt the most disappointing version of this game I've ever played. Every year my brother and I play a dynasty with an option based team and take it to the top. I use the QB and he uses the RB's and it has always been a lot of fun. For some reason, this version decided to take away the feature of using 2 players on the same team!! Why would they take that away? Also, they took away all of the Division I-AA teams. If this system is supposed to be so great why are they taking features away from the game? In addition to these problems, the Heisman level seems easier to play than ever so it'll take no time for me to dominate the computer. For these reasons and many more I would suggest not purchasing NCAA2007 for any system and pick up a copy of NCAA2006."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away - Very Buggy","review":"This is the only game I have for the Xbox 360 that crashes at all, and this dud crashes all the time.

The game is really bare bones, and somewhat buggy. I came on here to write this review because some of the game is annoyingly buggy. A linebacker went past my quarterback, not even close to tackling him, but the quarterback fell down and lost yardage. Also, running plays that go up the middle is completely a game of chance because the middle turns into a blob and you just have to hope that the back jumps or something. Then, there is the momentum meter that makes fumbles and interceptions magically happen, all too often. I hope Madden 07 is better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another EA Blunder","review":"I am not going to rehash what everyone else is saying other than this is a bad game.

Thus Stakes Is High is quite possibly one of their best releases to date. De La brings many issues to a head from the start of the album with track #2 - Supa Emcees, which shows Posdnuos explaining that everyone and their mother wants to be an MC nowadays and asks rappers about the direction in which their career is going. Unfortunately, De La Soul will never receive the mainstream attention and respect they deserve because they refuse to \\"sell out\\" to the glamour and glitz that has overpopulated mainstream hip hop in recent years.

I bought two cheaper books thinking, foolishly, that I would then be able to identify most mushrooms. Cheap and thin is easy to carry in the woods, but this is the \\"mushroom bible\\" all naturalists should own. Arora handles a jargon rich science exquisitely. His use of humor in a virtual textbook takes away the thick book intimidation factor. Academia could learn a lot from David's style. I wish all the pictures were in color, but that would increase the price and thickness of the volume tremendously. I will add a few other field guides with color pictures for referencing. I now have a hard time believing there are still copies available for sale. I don't know who in their right mind would sell such a volume. I'll have mine until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, Arora could make it perfect","review":"It's an excellent book, but could be perfect if it has color spore charts, one of the most important taxonomic features are spore color and Arora recognize this on his book, why let that out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shroomers Bible","review":"Contains lots of cosmopolitan species.

I got this book for my wife and I to use as our complete reference book on mushrooms. The book is a little intimidating because it gets so in-depth. And definitely lacks in good pictures. However, after reading a lot in this book you really start to learn a deeper side to those mysterious fungi. Great humor and candor mixed in throughout the book. The step by step ID section has been right-on in helping to identify mushrooms. There are quite a few I have been unable to identify if only I had a great picture of it! Some of the Step by step groups are so extensive its easy to get lost in them without ever finding your mushroom. By far the the most complete book on mushrooms I've seen but probably not for the total beginner. I will be looking for a companion to this one with more color pictures to help. Don't get me wrong, if you want to really get into mushrooms, or already are into them, this book is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Buy for Every Mushroomer","review":"From the beginner to the expert, this book contains enough information to keep both satisfied. It can even make the beginner feel like an expert after a while! It is entertaining, interesting and filled with information that is simply unavailable elsewhere. Often I find myself reading it for the sheer pleasure of learning about mushrooms. It is amazingly comprehensive for a book that is supposed to be from the west coast. I live in the east and I find it incredibly useful. Often other books are incomplete or vague in their descriptions and this one steps in to fill the gaps. If there is one flaw with this book it is the lack of pictures. Often I consult other books to match a mushroom to the picture and get an idea of what it might be. Then this book helps to narrow it down to an exact species and supplies more information than most other books combined.

I can't wait until this Spring to start picking the usuals for around here but armed with Mushrooms Demystified I might expand just a bit, especially with the Boletes. If you need a book to fall back on for those species you've been eyeing for years, this is the ticket, however you will need to keep it in your vehicle due to the book's size and you might want to use some clear mailing tape on the book's cover for additional protection if you plan on using it outdoors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demystified indeed.","review":"Mushrooms Demystified is an excellent work on macromycetes, i.e. mushroom fungi.

The keys contained within it are both comprehensive and easy to follow, and (as far as I can tell) every conceivable North American fungus is described within the book's pages. In addition, the book is actually fun to read -- Arora's got a great sense of humor, and he manages to strike a balance between rigorous taxonomy, humorous anecdote and eccentric perspective -- this book is the tops in its field, as far as I'm concerned.

For example the various chanterelles of California were not known at the time it was published. The section on Russulas is quite out of date as it seems at least a third to half the names are no longer valid. I should also mention that this book, in the best of times, is not easy to use without a microscope. The book is an interesting reference for the curious, but certainly not a current field guide. I like the humor in the book and the honesty on the part of the author that there is not enough space to be thorough on various groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"old adema was awesome","review":"This CD sucks.

The music is not Adema nor is the new vocalist. I think they sound just like every other new rock band out there albeit not as good. Mind you I only heard the 30 second samples which can be misleading as to how the actual song is. Believe me I have previewed a few CD's on CDNOW that sounded like crap but were actually pretty good when I bought them. But I have no reason to believe that this CD will be any good. They should have at least changed their name, I mean if your going to sound like a completely different band you should. This is about as bad as when Sugar Ray changed from metal to pop.

Personally, I find his voice makes all the songs sound too similar.

Adema was a great band and well, they lost it. It wasn't for nothing they lost Chavez and Mike though. At the time Mike and Mark were having problems. They actually didn't speak to eachother for a whole year. Which was why their sophomore effort was titled \\"Unstable\\". So why be in a band with someone you don't like? Unfortuatly it was true. Mark and Mike departed the band with this new singer. He's good too and there are two outstanding songs in this album: Shoot the Arrows and Tornado. Those 2 songs is what gave this 2 stars and is the reason why I still have it. I have nothing against the new singer however. If Adema is loyal to their fons though I suggest a change of name since it is very wrong to MAKE the new singer like Mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Lead Singer Makes Me Sad","review":"I did not enjoy a single track on this cd.

Get over it.","review":"The new Adema is here, and they're here to stay. Quit whining about Mark being gone and get over it. Just take a quick look at some of the bad reviews here. Is there a single bad review that doesn't mention Mark leaving? Didn't think so. Adema now has a new vocalist in Luke Carraccioli who actually can sing like a real vocalist should. Despite the loss of guitarist Mike Ransom, Tim Fluckey and bassist Dave DeRoo have stepped it up a notch, and drummer Kris Kohls is amazing as always.With the release of Planets, they are no longer the Adema of the past, but that doesn't take away from the new album. The new style is very catchy, and with songs such as \\"Tornado\\", \\"Shoot the Arrows\\", and \\"Barricades in Time\\", it's hard to stop listening.To sum it all up, if you can't get over the fact Mark Chavez is gone, this isn't the album for you. If you can accept that this is the new Adema, and want to listen to some real rock, this is the album for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Expect Adema","review":"Bands in the past have done fine pulling off a change of singers...Adema is not one of them. I loved their first few releases, and this one is not half bad...it's just not Adema. If they announced a breakup and started a new band with this new singer I would probably really dig this album. However,I bought this album expecting Adema and got a completely different CD. This album has a cool and interesting sound...but it sounds nothing like Adema."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought It would be.","review":"Well, the band was going downhill. But this release was just a big plunge. The new singer is not as talented as Chavez. This is nothing but a mediocre band trying to milk the Adema name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I still don't see why they kicked out Mike Ransom and Mark Chavez. For a nu-metal band they were pretty good. How dare they kick out the guitarist that made them sound heavy and the singer than made them sound angry? Marky's lyrics were sub par yes, but they way he integrated them into the songs was amazing. This CD deserves a 2 because if you never heard of Adema and this CD is the first you ever heard from them, then I guess it'd be ok. But in comparison with the original Adema CD's, it's a bag of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good...","review":"I used to like adema, but since ive heard this cd, I really don't like it at all.

If you simply listen to it, you can't argue that it's not good. This release is awesome in its own right. You can't listen to it and expect it to sound like previous Adema albums, you can't be biased. This is not the Adema you are used to. With a new singer you have to expect a new direction with the music that is produced, and possibly a differnet sound, which is exactly what happenend. This is a new Adema so deal with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adema's New Whiney Singer is their downfall.","review":"I had not learned of Mark's replacement singer, till I had picked up this CD,when the first song played, immediately I knew. This whiney, higher pitched voice was earache invoking and brings thoughts of whiney no-talent bands such as AFI or Dashboard Confessionals. I listened to every song on this CD, and was thoroughly upset at what a waste of money it was. I was even more disgusted at the rap song on this CD. I threw this waste of paper and plastic away. I wouldn't wish this music even on my worst enemy. Sorry Adema fans, if you're looking for Adema's true talent and music, it isn't here.If I could rate it less than 1 star, or negative stars, I certainly would."},{"rating":"1","title":"this band sucks now","review":"but if ur wondering where mark chavez is than he formed midnight panic which is better than this crap. his band's new cd is coming out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, not bad","review":"Whoa...what a shocker.

I have seen a few reviews compare the album to emo music, well that is exactly what it sounds like. Not even good emo! There are one or two peanuts lodged in the rest of the crap on the CD but I was expecting a lot more than what I got. Honestly, I can see some people liking this album, just not me or many other original Adema fans, as you can read. Bottom line is I agree with everyone else, change the name if you are going to change the sound of the music!! If your lead singer changes and the music stays the same then maybe I can understand trying to keep your old fans around but if you change the style of music you play, all you are going to do is piss your old fans off!! Business 101 damnit!!!!! I give it two stars for the one or two songs I do like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adema isn't the same band it was....","review":"Adema used to have a unique sound... I dont care what anyone says... they didnt sound like Korn. I think for the most part the only thing that Korn and Adema EVER had in common was the half-brother situation with their voices sounding similar... but aside from that... they were not another korn band... This CD was possibly the worst idea ever by Adema.... they should have changed their name and just started over... dont try and ride out the wave of their past successes and think that if you keep the name you can fool people into buying it cuz it has the Adema name attatched to it... thats really lame.I want to hear Marky Chavez's voice again soon... hopefully he'll be in another band... I really liked his edgy distinct voice with simple lyrics I can relate to... He showed so much more emotion then Adema's new no-name singer that doesnt deserve to be associated with the name Adema..."},{"rating":"1","title":"i AGREE WITH omg","review":"The vocalist makes a band, unless they die you should never remove your vocalist and keep the same band name its FALSE advertising. I loved Adema with Mark Chavez this new band sounds nothing like old ADEMA and the singer & the band don't sound like they belong together.

It's a shame that Mark parted ways with the rest of the band but I guess he realized something. They suck without him! This new lead singer, who's name doesn't even deserve to be mentioned, is god-awful! This is by NO means Adema! Adema left with Mark. This is a shell of the formerly great band known as Adema.

As long as anyone is buying those insults to 'Artistic property' (which are much more perverted than any pirating), no wonder some studios keep on releasing such ludicrous editions. Any movie should be seen (and heard) in the original format (and language) : subtitles are ALWAYS better than dubbing (once upon a time, movies were even shot in 2 or more languages, best example is Laurel & Hardy who were even funnier in French or Spanish -because of their accent- than in English).Of course, rating only apply to the studio, whose name should be read \\"Tangled Entertainment\\". When will so-called \\"Enforcement Agencies\\" look at this as a crookery worse than piracy : a 2.35:1 movie is missing almost half the image when butchered in 1:33.

It's pretty lame, but not really cheesy save for Ustinov's buffoonish clowning which belongs in a different picture. The great William Holden shows up for maybe a day's work -- he's supposed to be a cynical mercenary and crack helicopter pilot, but comes across more like a craggy old-timer going 40 in the fast lane oblivious to the fact that his turn signal's on. Much better is Rex Harrison turning in a tart cameo. He seems to have wondered in from a Graham Greene adaptation and he's welcome. Caine wears a Paddington Bear hat for the first third. You'll note his final confrontation with the villain of the piece is almost the same as in The Wilby Conspiracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine cast wasted on dreck.","review":"Working my way through the Michael Caine canon.

Texas Heat a little less so. Texas Fury ended with a tornado, but the myriad events in this novel seemed to swirl for the duration! And then.....here's the REALLY IGNUNT part......Fern seems to have no concept of central Texas. For the location she is describing (just west of Austin), she has the terrain incorrect, the foliage incorrect, and most of all the WEATHER incorrect. At one point a character notes snow clouds in the sky, and the text reads: Snow. More snow. What region of the country did she think she was writing about? Minnesota? Snow is such a rarity, especially in this area of Texas. Ice storms do occur every few years. Not snow. Not six inches. Not more snow. And then we get to the INEXCUSABLY IGNUNT part......Fern refers to a TWO HOUR TIME DIFFERENCE between Texas (CST) and New York (EST). Huh?

By the time someone gave me the third, I was ready to die of boredom. The first book wasn't bad as far as romances go, but it should have ended there.

On paper, it sounds like an absolute mess. In fact, it joins Singles Going Steady and the Undertones as one of the catchiest and most lovable punk albums ever. Every song is a little masterpiece, with a memorable hook and some truly zany lyrics. The pace is amazingly fast, but the title track, the one song that slows it down a bit, merits special mention. The dub reggae sound clearly influenced the Slits and Liliput and the lyrics are truly hilarious. The rest sounds like Debbie Harry and Clarence Clemons on massive doses of speed.

All the excitement of the times is captured in the fast numbers like Day The World Turned Day-Glo, Identity, Warrior In Woolworths, I'm A Poseur, Highly Inflammable and the inimitable Oh Bondage, while my favourite is the slow song Germfree Adolescents with its flowing melody and Poly showing that she can sing ballads too.

For once, here is a down-to-earth, simple, everyday gay couple with their own fair share of idiosyncrasies. What makes the film so enjoyable are the little details: Mark's t-shirts, Joey's aversion to food with seeds and bones, their little in-jokes, secret phrases, morning rituals, and a sweet discussion about cheetah farms. As each of the men tackle their own private crises---Mark his preoccupation with his own mortality, Joey, his search for his birthparents--- there's never an overwhelming sense of great tragedy or unbearable grief. Just two people trying to figure out the questions. All in all, a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"World and Time Enough","review":"I thought the movie could have been just a little better than what it was. It was slow, long, and boring. The movie tired to present a nice theme of a one on one couple falling in love and staying faithfull to one another, but did a bad job of it.

Mine jammed almost immediately and when I went to unjam it, some parts came loose inside and I had to ship it back for a replacement (which they did at no charge). This printer is constantly jamming and requires very high quality paper (not general purpose like most HPs) or it will pull in 5-10 sheets at a time. The cartridges have a \\"smart chip\\" which means you have to by Epson factory cartridges which are VERY EXPENSIVE.

You can not put more than one piece of ANY type of paper in the feed tray because the things sucks the whole stack half the time (even though the stack is not stuck together or carefully shuffled...)and either self jams or ruins the print job wasting MORE ink.Total piece of crap.

Sure, it prints good pictures - but the print head gets clogged so often that most of the ink in your ink cartridges is drained before you can do much!

Subsequently, you run out oif ink in less than two months without doing much printing at all!

I have rarely been so impressed by any book about film. Newman provides a fantastic survey of post-nuclear, disaster, and other \\"apocalypse\\" types of movies while maintaining a scholar's approach and a likable wit. The writing style flows easily, and the humor helps maintain a slightly \\"human\\" perspective about such grim subject matter.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in post-nuclear or disaster/apocalpse movies either for fun, research, or learning.

I do a good amount of printing, both color & b/w. While I do need to do cleanings more often with this printer, mine is not sucking up ink at an unreasonable rate at all. And it is very affordable. Photos don't always print well... the only photo paper I have found to work well with my S530D was very the glossy trial pack that came with it when I bought it. No other photo paper has done well at all, so I suggest theirs. This is the best printer we have had in 10 years, and belive me I've thrown my share out the window! I can offer THIS advice to owners of ANY printers. Always use the power switch ON THE PRINTER to turn it on off, never use the power strip switch, or the switch from properties.

Nearly in Canada as the main character's ex girlfriend put it succintly. Meanwhile, it's December 30th, 2011, right now and we've barely gotten an inch of snow here.

In the end the movie shows that along with friendship, laughs, and love, the path is easy to find, if you follow you heart. This movie is definitely a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go someplace else on break","review":"From the box cover & the rating, this movie would appear to be a party movie that takes place @ a Colorado ski resort. Well, it does take place in Colorado, but that's where the veracity of the box cover ends. Despite an \\"R\\" rating for sexuality, this was a \\"PG\\" film at best. While there are some hot babes in the film, there is absolutely no nudity in it - zilch. If, like me, you're enticed to buy this DVD based on the provacative girl on the cover, I would urge you to look elsewhere.As for the story itself, well......I just found it boring. It's not really a comedy as the only funny scene is at the beginning when the Duke grad finds out there aren't any Wall Street jobs available for him. Meanwhile, he owes Duke university $250,000 for tuition. Bummer!

I stand by my review, however and would not be writing this unless I firmly believed what I am about to write: \\"Paradise\\" is a beautifully done movie about a young woman's spiritual journey and maturation. If you are like me, that description initially might be squirm inducing. However, the movie is also a warm and tender romance and is often quite funny. This is not your typical indie drama. It is at times a surprising story about spirituality and grace, particularly given the hero of the movie is an atheist who comes to the aid of a Christian going through a crisis of faith. The acting by the two leads is splendid, they are a pleasure to watch, as are many of the supporting performances. The direction is sensitive and spot on. 'Paradise' is a lovely, entertaining movie with some complex ideas thoughtfully and honestly addressed. This is well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"i can relate!","review":"i also was in a christian church that was extreme and legalistic w/ much false indoctrination.

That's actually a good thing. If you don't know why you do what you do, why are you doing it?I loved Esther, in all her naivete, and Gabriel's character came across as a truly good person, whether he believes in God or not.For a first time film, shot on a shoestring budget, in less than a month, this movie is wonderful.

This movie is about true love which has no religion and can be only expressed through kindness. The young woman in the film had a troubled childhood and was essentially looking for God to provide her with answers. She ended up in a cult like church run by a tyrannical minister that used religion for control and domination. Her courage to get a job outside the church started her journey with a \\"free spirited\\" young man who showed her true love isn't about religion and God is about love. I connected with the \\"free spirited\\" young man who wasn't bound by any religion, but had a philosophy of kindness and love that changed the young woman's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got God? Get Friends!","review":"The movie deals with an important topic (cults and people trapped within them). For me the treatment is unconvincing; I felt the actors were trying to act out something they heard about. The heroine's transition from cult to \\"middle America\\" seemed to require nothing more than a change of habit--the deep and often quiet power of a conviction never came through to me.

The stories and images children are exposed to help form their ideas about their own roles and relationship with God and religion.

It reads like a second draft that brings the plot together, and now is ready for color and life. But the color and life are never added, and despite the interesting basic idea the book never takes off. We learn nothing about any of the people that we didn't know at first meeting them, Moon gains nothing of value to his character, and it's just a very sadly dull book that should and could have been a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillerman is excellent even off the Reservation!","review":"Hillerman is the kind of writer who draws the reader in with his sense of place and character.

It's as if he got started on a story about the recovery of the daughter of Moon's dead brother from a disintegrating Vietnam, and just had to force the story along no matter what. The cadence is wrong, and there are dozens of pages which go no where and add nothing to the story. And, who needs the high-moralizing? The final part, where Moon incredibly drives an abandoned armored vehicle from Vietnam into Cambodia during the child recovery operation defies even suspended belief.

I wanted an ethnography, not a text book.2) The author did not one observe employees at work. Although this is understandable, it makes it hard to write a believeably ethnography.

Gesture drawing the figure is the primary fundamentals of animation according to the best animation schools, best 3d studios, and best animators in the industry. I do however respect the artist for being a stop motion animator. Also the tutorials are too concise. If you're not too familiar with the Maya interface and langauge then you'll be very frustrated.

First, the novel is a great exploration/discovery of the ambition of one man and the pain this ambition brings him in the end. Second, Ruth Rendell's last novel, Adam and Eve and Pinch me, disappointed me with an overly multi-layered plot and characters. It was a pleasant surprise that she went back to a story that is less dimensional, without being simple.The novel is engaging. It tells the story of a man who is trying to write his great-grandfather Henry's biography and is researching his past to uncover facts. Henry, a prominent hemophilia specialist in the 19 century turns out to be a person obsessed with his career and areas of study to the extent that he commits the cruelest act.My only negative comment about the book is that unlike other reviewers I found the House of Lords subplot/descriptions tedious and not really contributing to the theme of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt cheated","review":"Barbara Vine/Ruth Rendell has written several very good books. That is why I thought this one would be like that as well. The Blood Doctor is very well written, not complicated at all although it deals with genealogical charts. But since the beginning of the novel you'd think the great secret of the Doctor is that he was Jack the Ripper or something along those lines, and when you get to the denoument you end up thinking \\"and this is the horrible secret??\\" I mean, this would have been a great short story or novella, but not a novel of almost 400 pages.I am going to continue reading Barbara Vine's books (although Grasshopper was awful!) because I know there is going to be another one that will leave me completely surprised and excited like The Chimney Sweeper's boy or No night is too Long."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Themes of obsession and murder\\"","review":"Well, there is an obsession, and there's a death that can be considered as bad as murder.I agree that at 370 pages, the book is too long, but other reviewers have not noted these two additional facts: it takes forever to get the unveiling of the mystery started, and when it does start, I guessed what the secret was long, long before our hapless narrator does. Both these facts made me restive.I suppose the themes of the House of Lords, and of Martin and Jude's problem, are brought in to weave additional symbolism about \\"blood\\" and inheritance; but both become wearisome.And no one, even the ever-reflective Martin Nanther, notes that the creation of \\"designer babies\\" poses in its way another question of killing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only boring Barbara Vine book","review":"I love Ruth Rendell as herself and as Barbara Vine. She is my favorite mystery writer. I particularly like her psychologically suspenseful novels and have read many of them. I may have liked one better than another but it wasn't until I tried to read \\"The Blood Doctor\\" that I finally had to admit I just read the only boring Rendell book ever. The main character is wimpy especially as it concerns his demanding and boring wife. The plot gets bogged down with details about the makeup of blood such as DNA, genetics, etc. The \\"mystery\\" is easily guessed at which isn't something I'm usually bothered by. In this book it would have been appreciated. I think someone scientifically oriented who also happens to like mysteries may like this book. What makes Rendell's books so compelling are her interesting, intricate plots that are set in motion by equally interesting characters. I found no evidence of that here.The Blood Doctor: A Novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"A reader's labor with no writer's pay-off","review":"Only the die-hard Vine fans will want to attempt this long, redundant concoction of biography and murder mystery. No plot device, interior monologue or character analysis is not repeated as many as three, four or more times. And still the Russian-novel-like list of generations of characters in one family remains confusing and vague. I slogged on and on because I detected some major shocker of an ending, a twist to make it all worthwhile; unfortunately that is never delivered. Vine has written some choice novels, but this is not one of them. Not even close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complicated and surprising","review":"An amazing, complicated mystery, in which the past comes alive in startling detail. Martin Nanther is an engaging character who finds himself drawn into the story of his ancestors, as he prepares to write a biography of the first Lord Nanther. What is the great secret that Henry carried to his death? How did his wife die? How does all this affect Martin and his wife, Jude? It was an ending for which I was completely unprepared. Past and present are entwined here perfectly as the mystery unfolds.This is a must for all Barbara Vine/ Ruth Rendell fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expect from Barbara Vine/Ruth Rendell","review":"I am sorry to say that I did not like this book. I eagerly look forward to all Ruth Rendell's new works, except the Wexford series, not being a detective fan.I was quite disappointed with The Blood Doctor. I was soooo bored and felt no connection to the characters. I got so tired of Jude's whining that I just wanted Henry to find another wife! I am sure people who are interested in the workings of English Parliament found the book enjoyable.Ruth Rendell still remains my favorite author, and I happily await her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad novel","review":"Presented at our book group. No one liked it. Mostly people did not finish it. Be warned and buy if you wish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I have read Ruth Rendell books but this was the first Barbara Vine. Having been seduced into reading it by reviews of her other books I was most disappointed. I really don't care about the re-organization of the House of Lords, the characters were totally non-involving (couldn't care about a one of them...they are a whiney lot)and the \\"mystery\\" wasn't much of a mystery. I dragged myself through the book, hoping against hope that something might occur that would engage me...never happened. A tedious, tedious book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Amen to Mara Kurtz' review! I became completely bogged down in the genealogy of people I have never heard of, and could't care less about.

The ploy didn't work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, Boring and Dry","review":"I thought this was supposed to be a mystery. However, it was more like watching someone else's vacation photos or reading in depth another person's family tree. Completely mind numbingly boring. The cover and back page reviews state it \\"builds in tension\\". HA!It takes almost until the last two pages to solve what we as the reader saw coming miles away, and is so bland in it's actual revealment that who cares????? After all of that talk of Mrs so-and-so married Mr so-and so over and over and over, you just dont care anymore. Dont waste your time. This is not suspense, it's tedium."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the intensity?","review":"I feverishly look forward to every new Rendel/Vine novel, but I was very disappointed with this one. What is so wonderful about her novels is the opportunity to be inside the head of someone with an off kilter view of reality. She has an uncanny understanding of the warped mind, and the reader is right there with her as the story unfolds. Unfortunately, in the Blood Doctor, we are a hundred and fifty years away from the warped mind. The story is being uncovered by the doctor's great grandson which creates a distance between the subject and the reader. Added to this, the doctor has deliberately destroyed evidence of what he was thinking and feeling at the time the story took place. This makes for a complete lack of immediacy.Instead of being inside the head of the doctor, something that would have been quite interesting, we are inside the head of his rather boring, though sweet, great grand son. All in all, not up to her usual excellent standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful","review":"If you love to read about exciting and exotic places, this is your book.

The 2nd track even comes with a warning that the audio intensity may cause speaker damage if played at too high a volume level...the storm is indeed dramatic, but soon passes to the refreshing sound of Spring Peeper Frogs and songbirds. The rest of the album is just as beautiful...you will hear walruses and crackling ice fields in \\"Arctic Life\\", the eerie howl of wolves in \\"Timberwolves\\" and various other forms of wildlife and nature sounds, and all set against a backdrop of beautiful music.

This is absolutely fascinating history.For the most part reading the book is smooth sailing, at times readers can suffer from information overload and once in a great while Gerard Helferich will put the reader to sleep with expansion concerning some miniscule details.Now, this is a book I will re-read because it is so detailed and well written.

I'm here to tell you, I am VERY VERY VERY disappointed. The marketing geniuses at Windham Hill did an excellent job at creating these BOGUS Christmas CDs. They could just as easily named them Songs of Easter, or Songs of Summer Vacation or Songs of Thanksgiving. Of course, they'd have to rename a couple of the songs, but you'd never know it. I'd rate this a MINUS 5 STARS if I could.

At first I did not notice a difference but after wearing it for about an hour my back pain subsided to a tolerable level. Now I wear it everyday. I am currently 29 weeks and had the product for two weeks and would not go a day without it. The other review are right about the straps being visible with open neck tops, but for me the benefit out weights the fashion. My only advise would be to wear a cami under it, it makes it that much more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your Money!","review":"I was very excited to try this product. This is my second pregnancy, and my first daughter weighed 10 lbs 6 ozs, and I am not a very big woman. This pregnancy has been rough, my body seems to be worn out, and to beat it all, I work at a hospital and am on my feet for 12-13 hours a day. I thought the cradle would help, but it is just a jumble of elastic. It does not support like it claims and I did not even notice ANY difference in having it on. AND, you can see it under your top, I wore mine with my scrub tops and I peeped out of the shoulder area and all day people asked what it was. Not cool:-( Buyer beware...save your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable!","review":"I was suffering with severe groin pain during my pregnancy, so I purchased this belt hoping to find relief. I found this belt to be very uncomfortable. The elastic is so rough,it irritated me all day. Also the straps that go over your shoulders come up so high you are very limited on shirt options without the bands showing. Also, I had seen that it runs small and to order asize up, so I did. The band still cut into my lower ribs around my waist. By the end of the day I couldn't wait to take it off! I wore it once, then found a different support band and am much more comfortable now."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks better on screen","review":"We had great hopes for this -- because my wife's belly was hurting toward the end of the day. We waited anxiously for the mail delivery and kicked ourselves for not shipping it overnight.Upon trying it out, the belt was too tight to be comfortable sitting (even though my wife was in the lower end of the weight range for the size she ordered). This presented the problem -- when going out shopping, do you wear it or not?? It can't be easily removed. so we ended up not using it, and wish we never had purchased it. It helped somewhat when standing -- if that is all you do all day. But for the average person, there must be a better designed belt."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad I got this!","review":"I am 33 weeks pregnant and this has really helped me get through the day.

They don't seem to be sized for petite women; rather taller women with long torsos. I tried two different sizes and neither fit appropriately for me.

I was hoping it wouldn't be this way for me since most of the reviews were positive, but it was - height was perfect, but the waist was too tight. Oh well. I was already 7 months along when I began using it, so maybe it would have helped more if I had started using it from earlier in the pregnancy? It aggravated the pain I was trying to alleviate, so I ended up returning it and using a velcro adjustable one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prenatal Cradle , Enough with my Pregnancy worries !","review":"Although the idea is good, the prenatal cradle has to be modified in many aspects:This product was not made thinking about fashionable and practical pregnant women.If you live in a hot weather,clothing is light and does not cover all your body,therefore,the prenatal cradle will show up either from one side or the other!!!!!!! (specially if you are proud of your new body and use low rise pants or short t-shirts)it also can be seen through your clothing because the cradle is white and made of a thick material. It is one added worry,every time I have to dress up for work, workout or just going out, I have to spend a long time thinking how to cover it. I am dissapointed about this product, it makes me feel frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prenatal Cradle a Plus!","review":"My doctor told me to buy this because my back pain was so bad by my 3rd month that I couldn't stand upright without a pinching pain in my lower back. Within two days my back pain was at a tolerable level, and now I am even exercising! It is a little difficult to get on, and it shows with ALL of my maternity clothing, but it is worth it. I tightened two straps with safety pins so it is a lot more comfortable for my growing belly. This is the exact invention that I needed. With a toddler running around I couldn't be laying in bed all day.

I have been searching for long time for a I have been searching for something to relate Budhism to me and Franz Metcalf has written it. It does not preach about buddhism but relates to it every day things in the life of a teen, such as homework, relationships, bullys etc. It also includes quotes and thoughts of teen buddhist so you can relate your thoughts with them. But it also teaches the basics of buddhism like meditation, the four noble truths, the eight fold path and how to use them in daily life. I would HIGHLY recomend this book to anyone intrested in Buddhism or a great gift idea for a teen intrested in Buddhism.I could only put five stars put this book deserves many more. I could not suggest a better book to open the world of buddhism to teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something you should definitely have in your backpack...","review":"While i was reading this book, I could relate exactly to everything Franz Metcalf was trying to talk about in this wonderful book that he's written for our age group. He talks about teen issues like dating, pregnancy, sex, family, friendships, gossip, and how to apply the Buddha's teachings to almost ANY situation you can dream up. In each section is included an inspiring quote from some of the greatest Buddhist teachers, and I found it comforting how open and honest he was when discussing issues that we as teenagers have to face today. He even talks about discovering whether or not you're gay,lesbian,bisexual, etc. but I would've appreciated it if he had a section devoted to gay/lesbian/bisexual teens and the issues they face, such as harassment, etc. Other than that, I thought it was an AWESOME book and I would highly suggest it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read","review":"i think my kids are a little young for this book.

I honestly don't know what i would've done without this book. This book, along with professional counseling helped me recover from depression and anxiety attacks. To be brief, I had been sexually abused by 2 family members, and this book helped me to finally realize that it was never my fault, and I know that now. It's been about 10 years since I've stopped counseling, but I still have this book, and every once in a while when I start to have those feelings of guilt surfacing, I grab this book and start reading. Recovering from childhood sexual abuse, I believe, is a lifelong process, and I'm sure we need all the help we can get. I recommend this book to anyone who has been sexually abused, and also to anyone who knows of someone who has been sexually abused. Maybe they can be a great help and support to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful if your just getting started","review":"I was first introduced to this book by my psychologist.

It comes with a disk to update the outdated information loaded on the globe. Of course, the disk only works with Windows XP and Windows Vista (yes I am writing this in December 2011).

Since Nieng Cheng's quick and cunning analytical thinking was her only available weapon of self-defense, she spared neither time nor effort in analyzing every minute detail of her surroundings. Cheng's conversations with her interrogators at the detention house resembled a real-life chess game played between two grand masters. Both parties spent days, weeks, or even months formulating a defensive and offensive strategy. Life and Death in Shanghai leads the reader though a plethora of original logical thoughts and conclusions, not unlike the deductions of Sherlock Holmes, which give the story an almost fictional feel. This book will be of interest to both casual and critical readers. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"A powerful account of life under incredible stress .

Or at least I would be, if I believed that she could remember everything down to what color the dust was on the bottoms of her feet. This book was a required read for my group, and I was surprised at how dull of a read it was. Topping 600 pages, It would be a much more interesting read if it was chopped down to... how about 300 max? This book is so full of prejudice and angst, it can not be viewed as an objective point of view.

Her openly expressed faith and dependence on God strnagely complimented her enormous personal integrity and strength of character. It is endearing without manipualtion, very human and frank. One of the best books I have ever read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope, it sustains life.","review":"Life and Death in Shanghai paints a horrific picture of China during the cultural Revolution. Any book portraying the deaths of so many innocent people is disturbing. Perhaps what gives the book its ultimate potency is that Nien Cheng writes from experience. Her characters are more than real. We are saddened by the death of her daughter, but at the same time, her fight for survival, her will to live gives us courage to keep to our hopes and to look towards the future. This autobiography stresses on the importance of hope. One catch is that some parts get too \\"historical\\" and slow down the pace of the novel, so much so that at the end, you feel you have accomplished great feats"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Unlike other memoirs about Twentieth Century China, Nien Cheng does an excellent job relating her own tumultuous journey to the greater chaos of Mao's Cultural Revolution. The result is a stark tragedy from which it is impossible to turn away. I teach a course on modern China, and this book will become required reading during the unit on the Cultural Revolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is interesting to read about life in China during the cultural revolution but this book is boring.","review":"I understand that the author's plight was horrible but this goes on too long. A shorter version of the hardships in the detention center would benefit this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps reading this book should be death reading Shanghai","review":"This was a selection for my book club.

It will give the reader an idea of the people behavior during the so called cultural revolution. Nieng Cheng is an example of courage, strengh and wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph of the Human Spirit","review":"This may be one of the most important books I have ever read. The lessons within its pages are as much about a period of history in China as they are about the power and strength of the human character. I bought the book as one of many to provide me with insight into China's recent history and what I took away was so much more than that. Nien Cheng sets the bar high for standards of integrity, discipline and commitment to the self. I am grateful she shared her painful, though triumphant, story with the world. This should be required reading for anyone interested in Chinese culture, but also for anyone who welcomes inspiration to overcome life's hardships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life and death in Shanghai","review":"This is a really excellent book. It is amazing to see how much energy and drive the woman had to survive her long imprisonment and still maintain her sanity.

Unfortunately, it is nothing like his earlier works. I would never have fallen in love with his music if it was all like Gulf Coast Blues. This new one is way too heavy, loud, and generally abrasive. I am very sorry to have to say these things, because I am such a big fan of his."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to George Winston's Standard of Excellence","review":"I was disappointed in this CD and have only played it once.

This is matt in the U.s.a. I hope they will release it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment","review":"I was absolutely thrilled with volumes 1-4 in this series. This was, stylistically, more jazzy than chill. It has been a couple years since they released a chill colection. I think that after the feedback they got on this one, they gave up. Nooooo- Just bring back the producers on 1-4!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in the same vein as previous UCs","review":"I have all of the Ultra Chilled series and while I usually enjoy 80% of the music on those collections, with about half of that entering my permanent rotation, there were only three songs in this version that I could even sit through.Those were the tracks done by Jon Hopkins, Bent, and Federico Aubele. The rest were not strictly chill, dreadful as music and some were depressing (a few tracks regarding death, including one where the singer is \\"waiting for suicide\\" or some such angst).There is a bit of jazz, electronica, blues, dance and alternative music in Ultra Chilled 05, but little chill and nothing exemplary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the others","review":"I just wanted to reiterate the other one stars... if you liked the first UCs, then you may be disappointed. The emphasis seems far less on electronica and more on an eclectic mix of low key music.

This however is not the real problem. The real issue is that the book applies to the retired exam (9E0-569), not the current exam (9E0-402). Unfortunately, this little parcel of information is not written on the cover, but instead on one of the introductory pages, making it impossible to know this when you are ordering the book online. The worst thing is that this book was actually published after the exam it covers was retired. Why Cisco would release a book on 01/15/2002 when the exam it pertains to was retired more than 2 months earlier is beyond me. As you might guess, I am not particularly pleased to have discovered all of this after I had already purchased the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"This book is poorly put together, dry, repetative, and does a very poor job of explaning the material. Whatever good there is in it seems verbatim from Cisco's web site.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to read and understand. May not be what you want!!","review":"I am preparing for CIPT exam. I thought this was the preparation guide for CIPT. I was hoping that this book goes in depth analysis of all components of CIPT clearly. In my opinion, this book is short of explaining VoIP protocols. It needs a little more elaboration on the fundamentals. For example, I read about clusters in this book. I was very much confused. Then I read about the same subject in Cisco CallManager Fundamentals. It was actually a streightforward concept. All discriptions in the book are confusing, and insufficient. I vote strongly against this book if you are planning to buy this book only because you are preparing for the CIPT test. It might be a good reference for using the CallManager menus."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Exam is this for?","review":"The current exam for CIPT is 9E0-402 - in the first few pages of this book it states that this book is for CIPT exam 9E0-569...the recently retired CIPT exam!!! What is the story here?? The book just came out and it is already out of date?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many typos","review":"This book has way too many typos that are confusing. Unless you are an experienced programmer, the errors will throw you off. Also there is not a list of errata on the Sam's Web site for this book. The book has a lot of potential, it is organized well but the author uses too much jargon for a newbie and the typos are downright annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this book..unless you want to waste your time","review":"this book is not the one to get if you want to learn PHP. I bought it on impulse before checking out the others from Wrox or from Julie Meloni. Professional PHP programming is a good basic one if you know some basics of PHP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good PHP primer w/ some typos","review":"I would actually give this book 4.5 stars if I could--content was excellent, but lack of attention to detail in some of the examples brought it down a bit. Also, the author points out some shortcuts in the book (like using the short tag extension syntax <?=$var?> instead of the more verbose <? print $var; ?>,) but never seems to use them in the book, thus not getting new PHP'ers into the habit of using them--perhaps for readability's sake. Having gotten out of the way with what's wrong with this book, here is what's right:-Organized, easy to follow-Lessons are task-oriented, and it's easy to find small code snippets (albeit some of them contain incorrect syntax--that's were experience coding in a different language can be a mitigating factor.)-Serviceable as a lightweight code snippet reference once you've finished the lessons.This is one of the better books out there for newbie PHP'ers out of the 4 or 5 that I've looked at."},{"rating":"2","title":"the dog's bollocks","review":"very well presented, straight to the point and also very practical.

I recently emailed the author trying to get the code for this edition since I misplaced the original code download, he refused to give me the code, trying to get me to buy the newest edition. Sams and this author have no respect for customers of an edition after a newer edition comes out. I made sure the next PHP book I bought was NOT a Sams book or from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sams Teach Yourself PHP","review":"This book is definately not for the new programmer. It is written in Geek and for a Sams teach yourself not very well presented. I have been using the Sams books for a number of years and not had the difficulty with the comprehension. As a refrence book there is a substantial number of better publications, all of which should be consulted before wasting money on this volume. The volume I have is the Second Edition Published in 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"great php book","review":"i know that Sams Publishing is often synonymous with the word \\"lame\\" (their Mandrake book comes to mind...), but this book is suprisingly good. probably not to difficult for new programmers(just make sure you know some html first!), but for anyone with prior programming experience (especially C++), this book is a breeze. it's straight forward and gets to the meaty content fairly quickly. the mySql sections provide clear and helpful info, however the examples aren't anything spectacular, and few of them really seem to jump out as actually useful, so much of the creative aspect of php scripting is left up to the reader. good book thats alot easier to flip through than the official manual at php.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"Allright, but not reccomended","review":"I havent even finished the book yet, and I have found about 5 mistakes in it.

It's very interesting...and worth listening to.Along the way of your journey you'll become friends with beluga whales, killer whales (or orcas), narwhales (like belugas with marbled skin and males with a \\"tusk\\"), and everyone's favorite...the Humpback.I am very fond of the sounds of the breaking and floating ice on track #2...accompanied by the sounds of red-throated loons; it transports me to Northern Alaska."},{"rating":"2","title":"College Days Revisited","review":"These marvelous albums, especially the song \\"I wanna be Loved\\", take me back to my college days in the 1960's and how much I delighted in the sultry voice and appearance of Julie London, one of the real phenomena of that era. The appeal of the supremely attractive and truly gifted Julie London to a college guy does not require elaboration. These recordings reminded me that my assessment of this lady was well founded. BRAVO!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the king never smiles","review":"This book gives the other-side of pe rspective of Thailand under constitutional monarchy. I believe the people who live in Thailand don't have a chance to access to these kinds of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful uncensored look into Thai royalty","review":"There is plenty of speculation in this book but if you have lived in Thailand for any amount of time you realize that much of it is warranted. There is little to no open dialogue in the Thai press or English language Thai newspapers concerning the royal family, however there is plenty of controversy behind the scenes. The King of Thailand is a bit of an enigma to the rest of the world as he's the longest reigning monarch but lives much of his life behind a carefully constructed image that's only accessible through trusted royal handlers. This book does a lot of in depth examination at what motivations the royal family in Thailand has in maintaining and keeping power. It's far from being a libelous or tabloid like piece of work like many Thais fear it may be. It's an honest and insightful look into the power struggles in Thailand and the psyche of the Thai people as a whole. Well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far Better Than Thai Text Books","review":"This book is one of the best of all Thai history. It is better than the Thai text's books in schools. This book is disclosed so many things more than the Thai would ever know in Thailand. Buddhism and Hindu have been playing very important roles and have been used as tools for the monarchy to brainwash Thai people since the old Sukhothai Kingdom. It was continued to Ayutthaya and Bangkok today. This book is still censored in Thailand, because it tells too much of the truth that the Thai conservative cannot handle it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda fake research!","review":"Just read the book and I have to say it's fun to read as a light reading but don't take anything serious out of it.the content is bias and not enough supporting fact.a lot of info can be found on Internet and that's not proof if it's all true.found his so called research to be wrong too.and you can find out the true easily if u visiting Thailand once.I don't think this book is worth your the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bottom line.","review":"The bottom line is that if you're not Thai, you will never fully understand our love for the king. We never talk bad about the king because we love him like a father and we take pride in knowing our leader is better than yours. Thais may smile a lot, but we are not so ignorant as to think people can be perfect and we should worship them blindly. There have been many scandals dealing with the royal family and many jokes made within Thai homes. All you need to know is that Thais love their king, because they choose to, not because of propoganda. We love him, because he loves us. We love him more than you farangs, because he loves us more, We can see it in his eyes, hear it in his voice, and feel it in his presence. Why would we point out his shortcomings when he has done so much good. It is like Thai idea of \\"kraeng chai\\" to the fullest. Westerners do not have this term. I'll leave it at that.p.s. Why is Handley's research so highly credited by you folk?"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor research, the author really doesnt know what happened in Thailand","review":"Actually, I would like to vote 0 star for this book, unless I have to give 1-5 star for it. The author showed his poor quality in this book.He does not understand what really happened in Thailand with his poor research.In Thailand, the king stands above the political issue, do not participate in any political activity. The corrupted governments have been chosen by (very) poor people (votes have been bought by using money, 80% of popultion in Thailand are poor) not by the king himself. The king is the one who can maintain the balance of power in Thailand. The king is the only one that the corrupted government can not win. PM Thaksin S. try to control all the things in Thailand by his power, but he couldn't do it until today, because he can not control The King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot of mistakes and bias","review":"I was curious about this book so I tried my best to read it from beginning to the end. The problem was his researches were so plenty of mistakes. He refered to things with low credibility sources. I expected to use contents as references in my future works. But now I believed I shouldn't.Many of his statement fulled of bias. may be it's because of Far Eastern Economic Review problem with Thailand. I am really hate this kind stupid author who did things on his favor by destroying some others.If he has more evidences, then this will be a valuable research, but he hasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"flawed and biased","review":"For anyone already familiar with the Thai monarchy, the holes in Handley's work are two obvious and too numerous for it to be taken seriously.

As he put his worst intention to exaggerate for authoring this book and almost parts of this book are distorted out of the fact. I would like to appeal the publishing company to stop printing this book and heartly recommend, so please, do not waste your valuable money for this fake book.

Seduced by a review in a major publication, I broke my two self-imposed rules about buying cookbooks. Never buy one by a chef and/or restaurant owner and never buy without looking first. But the review was so warm and enthusiastic, I went straight to my computer and ordered it. Would that I had read both the reviewers' and readers' comments first. Then I would have known I would not be at all interested in the first 52 pages. Having cooked simple but good food for almost half a century, there's not much I don't know about kitchen tools and basic techniques. Judy Rodgers is, indeed, a good writer, but if I want to read about one's formative years in the cooking field, I'll look for a memoir. Then, too, there's the early salting recommendation which informs many of the recipes. I strive to reduce sodium in my cooking, not increase it. Perhaps I shall give it to a daughter or daughter-in-law."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present from my husband. I am interested in healthy eating & cooking. This book does not fit into that category. He ordered it based on a review from our newspaper, which I also read & stated that it sounded like an interesting book. It is not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll Make 10% of These Recipes","review":"I received this cookbook as a gift from someone who thought it was about Southwestern cooking (as in Zuni Indians - actually, the food is mostly Mediterranean). I am not in the restaurant or food business, nor am I a personal friend of the author's.Undoubtedly, Zuni Café is a wonderful restaurant experience. But, if like me, you are a home cook with limited access to quail, various imported Italian goodies, and glasswort, etc., etc., etc., forget this book. Much of it is just too dang precious.Precious also is the language. Like the author, I have spent significant time in France and speak French at near-native level. However, I really question her use of French (sometimes Italian)when English will do - example: \\"restes\\" for leftovers. The impression is one of insecurity or a need to elevate herself and her recipes.The book is a giant step backwards to someone like Narcisse Chamberlain - eurocentric cooking for Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing natural bubbles!","review":"I bought this bubble bath for my four-year-old son. Because it is natural you have to agitate the water to make a lot of bubbles. My son uses a wire whisk to do this and has a blast doing it. Also, it comes with a bubble wand so I blow bubbles into the bath and my son loves it! They smell fantastic! I love this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed, I cried, I drank a 6-pak of Lone Star beer!","review":"I think a lot of people will like this one-it's sort of a neo Jim Stafford meets a softer Lynyrd Skynyrd. if you can imagine that, I think that's actually a good description. I'm not much into country, but this Americana album tickles my rural bone. I don't really know where that bone is, but what I'm trying to say is that I likes me some Daryl Lee. There's good guitar-almost rock-n-roll acoustic at times, there's some hellacious harmonica like I've never heard before and some really good lyrics. Some of the songs are funny and then every now and then, when you're least expecting it, he slaps you with some old school profundity. i must say (in a surprised voice) I LIKE IT LIKE IT LIKE IT. Enjoy!! Daryl and gang: KEEP JAMMIN'!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Texas Spirit","review":"I heard Darryl Lee Rush live in Austin during SxSW this year and was floored.

As to what to do about such humans I am never a supporter of the death penalty as it is uncivilized so life without parole is just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"McFly flies high","review":"McFly's new single is one to be reckoned with. Consisting of extremely fun and catchy tracks, McFly's new single has a main attraction, and that is the very catchy and energetic Don't Stop Me Now.Don't Stop Me Now, a cover of Queen's version, is the theme for Sport Relief 2006, and is filled with good electric guitar riffs and drum solos, giving the song a fun air and good to sing along to.Please Please is a less-attractive song, but nonetheless fun to listen to. Featured in Just My Luck, Please Please has all the elements of a fun bop-along song, but it has parts that remind me awfully of Hilary Duff songs.The extras include three different versions of Five Colours in Her Hair, an old single of theirs, undoubtedly one of their older successes. The three different versions take the song to a whole new level.Overall good. Not Grammy-award winning stuff, but not fluff either, and likely to cheer you up in a second on a gloomy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive, a great addition to any music collection","review":"As a long time listener of TCM, I have always enjoyed them. I just recently heard this album and was blown away by it. The vocals are solid and with artists like The Doors, Uberzone, New Order, Smashing Pumpkins, etc, how can you go wrong?! The beats are clean, the hooks and builds are catchy. Overall, I am impressed as usual with their skills and musical taste. My only regret is that I didn't find this album sooner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ever","review":"I was very dissapointed in this CD. IT only had 3 good songs on it.. number 2,5,and 7 are Ok... I have been a big fan and like very much all the past CDs from The Crystal Method. Looks/Sounds like to me they have run out of good music to write. All the CDs before this on is way worth buying, but not this one.. I hope they get back to beening the best again on the next release. Community Service 2 is a waste.. WAY TOO MUCH CREATIVE NOISE and not enough music on this one.

I suppose I should have waited for or found a better description, but I never would have assumed that the phrase \\"Adult Edition\\" refers to two previous novels being crammed together and sold as one. I have little to add to what has already been said by another reviewer; I mostly wanted to vent my frustrations.I would, however, like to encourage anyone who hasn't read the first two Georgia Nicolson books to give them a try.

Realistic pictures give a younger child a lot to look at while you are reading the story. Once I started reading the story I was in awe. Mrs. Graham retells the story of the bible in a simple but captivating way. It is easy to see the paralells that occur in the bible - the way God looked for someone to save His people repeatedly - ending with our saviour. The book intertwines the importance of not only the birth of Christ, but his crucifiction and resurrection. Mrs. Graham also writes wonderful cliffhangers from one chapter to the next which had my five year old begging to read more.

You could spend a long time just studying all the pictures. Ruth Bell Graham writes about a grandmotherly woman who offers a warm place for a child to get in out of a snowstorm. She opens her Bible and tells him a fascinating story that begins with creation and ends with the Resurrection. I purchase this book all the time to give as Baptismal gifts. I'd also highly recommend it for anyone sharing their faith with an adult who grew up Biblically illiterate. It's a fun, easy way to cover the basics in a way anyone can understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Wintery Night","review":"I love this tape and wish it were out on CD.

I bought this book just for myself, but I have also gotten a ton of really good ideas for writing prompts for my students from this book. I particularly loved the sections on Bernadette Meyer and Harryette Mullin. Daniel Kane's interviews are very good for the most part.

The Ice touches on everything about Antarctica: the history, the landscape, the literature, the geology, the biology. The book is all-encompassing--as is The Ice that is its focus and deep passion.

The only neat thing about this are the two \\"hidden\\" movies. But these are easy to find on youtube and other sites.The menus are annoying, the interface is tedious, the music is good, but much more convenient on a CD, the trailers are nothing special... the interview with the guy who made the movie is nice, since it shows his passion for the series, but there's almost no addditional information about the series to be found here.

They didn't come into this deal with that adolescent inexperience and uncertainty of what direction to take. Their former musical projects already have them at the top of their game, and their sound was patented to a tee from the very first recording. I put off buying this EP for awhile; I was wary of 'Fantasy' because of their other underwhelming electronic blip-and-bleat tracks such as 'Uw' and 'Bttls'. As it turns out, the track isn't half-bad, especially on headphones. Also, 'Tras' is probably Battles' most accessible track, with a rock propulsion that makes it instantly palatable. Not a bad buy at all, especially if you already have the other EPs. I can't wait for future releases. Oh wait, I forgot about the 'Tras' video. I was disappointed, because I was expecting a live performance, but instead I got this white-washed recording that reminded me of a Macintosh commercial."},{"rating":"2","title":"I about wrecked my car!","review":"I am a huge Tom Mabe fan and I have his first CD.

As an example, if you listen to one, would you like to hear it again?

The \\"telemarketers\\" seem to play along too easily and know just what to say to set up the \\"jokes\\". Most of the telemarketers I've dealt with don't have a real stake in what they're selling so they would more than likely just hang up rather than keep feeding him the straight lines.

I figured it was a great idea and when I looked at the track titles I thought this has to be funny. Well I was wrong. First of all, the sound is horrible. It sounds like it was recorded in a toilet. Second of all, it just isn't funny. I don't know what's worse: his Southern accent or his attempt at comedy.

Do a search on \\"Telemarketer\\" and look for \\"Reverse Telemarketer Pranksters.\\" These are what we listened to on a road trip skiing and it was the funniest thing I'd heard in a long time.

I tried for 45 minutes to untangle just one of the three foot lengths of swag. Even when I got it untangled, it looked very bad. I put it back in the box and instead put up one of my old sets. At least two of the additional bows were useful in my revised decorating.If you want to use these, pull them out very early and hang them up for a long while.

This book is so useful in very many situations! With my basic skills in pronunciation and grammar, this book carried me through at restaurants, metro stations, going out, etc. The two-way dictionary is also great because I had French people look up words they didn't know in English. There's also a funny romance section that I don't know if you would ever use, but it's a great read and my French friends love it as well.

I expected to hear the phrase in English, then in French, perhaps repeated a second time so that I could practice saying the phrase too. Instead the phrase is spoken only once, in French, with such a brief pause before the next phrase that there is not time for me to repeat it. The spoken phrases are listed in the book, but not in the same order, so it is not practical to follow along in the book to get the English translation.

Though the book wasn't as good a story as the first one, I felt myself wanting to know what happens to Sarah and her family. I wanted to tell her that her neighbor is not to be trusted, and to follow her feelings about Lazarus. I wanted to hold her hand and sometimes hug her. I know that most of the complaints is that it wasn't as good a book because Jack wasn't in it, but it proves that life has to go on, even when you might not want to. This book took Sarah through her healing process with the loss of Jack, and showed us her strong spirit we all know well.I gave this a 4 star because it isn't as good as the first, but I think it is worth a read.

Once the mouse started charging properly the battery had excellent life and would last for days. Overall feel and shape is the same as any other typical mouse out there.Initially I had problems charging this mouse. It would charge sometimes and not others. Eventually took some abrasive paper to the contacts and solved that problem.Buttons started acting up after 4 months, occasionally sticking. By the time 6 months rolled around I was ready to toss this as far as I could throw it. I constantly had buttons locking up and have recently resorted to slamming the mouse on the desktop repeatedly to return function to it.

I have used a variety of different optical mice over the past 4 years from the likes of Kensington, Logitech and Microsoft and none of them can compare to the MX1000. I am visual designer and a casual gamer and I have not experienced any of the issues that the other two reviewers have mentioned. I have found it to be so much more responsive and accurate than any of my previous optical mice. So why the 4 stars instead of 5? Well, I am concerned about the life of the lithium-ion battery inside of the mouse and the lack of access to it. The manual did not indicate if it is accessible or replaceable. Other than that I have absolutely no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"MX1000 Laser Mouse","review":"This mouse is simply the best I have ever owned.

Wasn't expecting it to work so flawlessly - had researched some hacks to make wireless mice work with Linux (editing X11 config files etc).The mouse tracking seemed a bit fast after the older wired mouse, but after a few minutes of use - it feels good - very sensitive, smooth.Its good to have the on-off switch on the mouse as well - can switch off for prolonged non-usage.I would gladly recomemnt this for normal Windows users as well as the more discerning Linux users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mouse I have ever had","review":"I have been using this Mx1000 for more than one year now.

Although this mouse is incredibly accurate, I have huge hands, and the shape of this mouse is not as comfortable as the mx700. The back is more curved, and so my wrist hits the mousepad/mousing surface. It gets uncomfortable after a while.

I might just have to buy another because it's that good. The ergonomics are very good. The mouse feels natural in my hand. It glides with ease over any surface with ease. It has plenty of button options which are programable.The only quirk I found was that the back button doesn't work with the Firefox browser. I'm sure I could figure out how to program it. Barring that, this mouse is flawless, the battery is long lasting and build qulity is very good. The mouse fits neatly in the recharge cradle.

This mouse is destined to be returned as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails when starting from a cd","review":"Overall the mouse works as well as the optical Logitech I was using. However I found a huge flaw in the way the MX 1000 works. The mouse does not work at all when you need to start from a cd (such as Disk Warrior) or when you use the option key at startup (on a Mac) to choose what disk to start from. In order to do anything in these cases you need to connect a different mouse. This is entirely unacceptable to me and I am returning the MX 1000. I contacted Logitech support and they tell me that is not a feature of the mouse. They also sounded rather unsure of what they sell. To have software that will not support the mouse use at these times is completely unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mouse Not just for Gamers.","review":"The MX1000 is a great product. I would have given it five stars,but the install docs where poor. I had to find information at Logitech's support site to get this rodent working.

Many units are not level and wobble when on a flat surface. Many users report issues with lag. The Setpoint driver software has issues. I've contacted Logitech and they expect me to pay for a toll call to get an RMA number, pay for shipping, and then wait 6+ weeks to receive a unit without the wobble. Do yourself a big favor and wait this one out. There's no excuse for Logitech letting this slip through quality control and then expecting the customers to bear the expense. On the plus side, the mouse is very comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A driver bug makes it unusable with a KVM switch","review":"Switching between computers will cause the mouse wheel and extra buttons to fail until the computer is put into suspend mode and resumed. This is caused by a (probably simple) bug in the mouse driver, but rather than fix the problem Logitech just says they don't support KVM switches. Switching to a standard ps/2 mouse driver takes care of the wheel problem, but you won't have use of the extra buttons or side scroll. My impression is that Logitech is too big to care about their customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"its ok","review":"It worked and did its job.

The big problem is, it works poorly. Very poorly. I have a black desktop, where the mouse works not at all; just wave it around and the pointer remains wherever it was when you started. I therefore use this mouse on some sort of substrate, typically a blank sheet of paper. It works better under these conditions, but still very poorly. The pointer wanders around and I have to labor carefully to bring it to my intended mark. Often it overshoots the target. It's not that I move the mouse past the target, I move to the target, then the pointer continues to drift away slowly, not responding to my movements of the actual mouse. So, I'd keep looking. The idea of this mouse is promising, but the reality is sorely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Fine, Odd Shape and Weight","review":"I disliked this mouse. It worked fine and connected with the iMac easily. But it's an oddly-shaped mouse, and very heavy. Beginning to use it, I enjoyed the absence of a wire.

It also helps if you're positioned relatively close to your desk and are elevated over it on a standard computer desk.The mouse does not, out of the box, come customized for Firefox (i.e. the back and forward buttons won't automatically function).

Nice amount of buttons and no more going through the double AA's. I do have to remember to put it in the charger every once in awhile but it charges quickly and lasts quite awhile so it's really not an issue.

As I'm now in the middle of finishing my PhD thesis, I wouldn't risk using it with my work.Honestly, I was always a logitech user, but not any more, after investing in such unreliable product, which can cost more than the $50 paid for it.My advise, if extreme accuracy is not a requirements for you, go for an older, more reliable and stable mouse.

But the ergonomics of the mouse and the button placement make it un-usable. I tried this out for close to a week and was not satisfied. It left my hand cramped from even 15 minutes of use. It is too large in all directions and is very heavy, which required too much force to move the mouse. It would have been nice if the finger cutouts would be a little deepr for the pinkey finger and its counterpart and that the thumb print be shallower. The back and forward buttons strain your thumb to push becasue they are so akwardly places. The only thing to praise besides the laser is the scroll wheel.

Here are a few: poorly placed buttons that required completely reorienting your hand to use, poor software GUI, incompatibility with other Logitech receivers, LESS button programmability than with older products (no minimize all feature?!?! Come on!!!) and the kicker, random cusor jumping. On the plus side, it did come pre-charged and the on-off button appears to work.To be fair; it may not perform very well, but at least it's expenive."},{"rating":"1","title":"very nice mouse and very nice service","review":"very nice mousehard to get used to.. feels heavy at first but few days later, it feels goodshould of made the color white so the heat of the mouse could of been lessvery nice service and fast shipping.I gave it a 1 star because first I didnt like itbut I want to give it a 5 star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Charger & Software are poor","review":"Generally a good project except the mouse had to be placed in the charger just right or it would not charge. Also, as with all Logitech products, the software is awful if you have installed more than one Logitech product.

However, I normally never turn my computer off, but just put it in a \\"sleep\\" mode. About 10% of the time, when I \\"woke up\\" the computer the curser would lock up and not respond to the mouse. I would have to reboot my cpmputer and the mouse worked OK for a while, then it would lock up again. I contacted Logitech technicians on two occasions, but the problem was not resolved.

Well balanced, nicely polished, feels great in your hands, and most importantly when you tighten it on a tap, it stays tight. I have 2 smaller tap wrenches I purchased from a big box store and they are junk in comparison. I either have to tighten them after every turn when using or I have to use a vise grip to tighten the heck out of them. I plan to buy the two smaller Starrett sizes soon. If you make a living with a tap wrench, or like me you just appreciate fine tools and get pleasure from using them, the Starrett tap wrenches will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing","review":"This CD is so soothing.

It'll go from orange to red in 2 seconds after charging to full, but run on the red setting for a long time.-Too much work and a learning curve to actually shave.-Only gives you a close shave half of the time.-Pop-up bikini trimmer doesn't work.So in short save your money and buy a better electric shaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"i'm warning everyone, keep your money. it takes too much time to get a shave that isn't close enough. ideally a product should make things easier and better.signed, still using a razor, and out $50.panasonic, go back to the drawing table."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Panasonic for me","review":"This is the third Panasonic eletric razor I've owned. The 1st one broke when I put it in my checked luggage on a 2 hr flight. It got a little shook up I suppose and no longer would charge. The second one I had worked for about a month, and after being charged twice, would no longer hold a charge. The third one I bought just died yesterday. Had it about 3 months, charged it for the second time, and it's no longer holding a charge. I've owned other brands of razors and never had a problem with them holding charges, so I've wasted enough money on these Panasonics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic really dropped the ball","review":"The charger is cumbersome and doesn't seem to actually charge the razor most times.

One minute it says it is full, the next it claims it needs to be charged.The form of the pivot is nice, but that's the only plus to this razor. I'd suggest staying far away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad battery charger","review":"I owned this Panasonic shaver for one and half year. Since I'm very blessed to not have as much hair in my legs, I've been very seldom using this shaver. Nevertheless, I've always annoyed with its charger because it takes more than 8-hours of charging. Finally, after one and half year, this shaver has to retired. I don't really know what went wrong with it, but then it won't hold any charge anymore. I only took it on a trip once and it hasn't been charging properly ever since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong album from Good Looking Records","review":"I've been to a few places in Chicago where this music would have fit right in with the laid back, groove-appreciating attitude of the crowd. A kind of modern and progressive jazz feel permeates throughout the tracks. A jazz album this is not in the traditional sense. I hear Funk, Jazz, a little Soul, a little R&B. This album is definitely worth actually listening to. It is relaxing yet upbeat. If you are familiar with LTJ Bukem's Journey Inwards, this compliments its style well. Both are off the same label. Expect to hear vocal samples and sound bytes, some solid beats, a few traditional jazz instruments, and synthesized sounds mixed together on these tracks. I would not rate it as an outstanding CD, but it is definitely worth listening to and will not leave you feeling untouched by the music, as I find myself occasionally playing these tracks through in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Unless You Own \\"Baking for Dummies\\"...","review":"Because there are clearly unspoken steps to these recipes that will thwart beginners' efforts.I like to bake.

When trying something new, I do no more or less than what is written down.And there's the problem with this book. I have already tried four of its recipes, and three of them were awful. The fourth, while edible, was nothing special.

If those little song clips can impress me then you know this bands gotta be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jawbreaker is music for the sad.","review":"This album, along with the other Jawbreaker albums are essentially about being sad. Every song is a truth, and every word is felt. This music is not the kind of stuff you blast at a party, but more like music that you listen to when you are alone and sad, or together and distant. I always find it sickening to meet that pretty girl at a party that claims to be hip because she's heard a tune or two. I usually have a tune or two bouncing around in my head, too, especially when I realize where I stand. Not on two feet, not in her door. Who am I to say what it is? You'll never now... take my words for what they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Buy It!","review":"JAWBREAKER....What else can I say?A great band and for many,their favorite album by the group.If you like jawbreaker just a little..get it.If your curious (after hearing a song or two by them)...get it.This is their first full length recording raw,relentless,and of course lyrical full-filling.Not as \\"pop\\" as their later attempts but still as catchy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute for a few hours.....","review":"I really love this because it looks pretty in the light with the \\"pearlized\\" style...however....after eating and brushing your teeth the pearl like stuff comes off and its just clear.

There were several pieces I was familiar with that I had heard on Atlanta's Christian music station, 104.7 The Fish, but I didn't know who sung them.She is an incredible talent, with a true love of the Lord.This CD is really good, and you will certainly enjoy it, and when she is in your area, go and see her. You will be truly blessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A for Effort","review":"Sara Groves heads in a poppier direction, with very satisfying results. \\"Esther\\" shines with producer Charlie Peacock's world-beat tendencies, while \\"Compelled\\" sparkles like a lost track from Peacock's former proteges Out of the Grey. \\"Like a Skin\\" and \\"Roll to the Middle\\" hum with the muted feel of Groves' earlier acoustic work, and her command of a devastatingly appropriate turn of lyrical phrasing is similarly undiminished. This album is a fine counterexample to those who are preoccupied with the banal majority of albums released as CCM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it now!","review":"I wasn't sure I would like the Charlie Peacock version of Sara, but it is amazing. There is not a weak song on this album. Sara sounds just as natural and hoest on upbeat, funky, & soulful tracks like Jeremiah, the Boxer, What I Thought I Wanted, etc. as she does on her traditional ballad-style tunes.Roll to the Middle is an icredible love song that speaks the truth about the simplicity of reconciliation in marriage. All I Need is an increadibly bright and witty look at how we chase after just a little bit more thinking it will make us happy.Do you self a favor and buy this now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a *huge* dissapointment","review":"This album is so poor! I expected so much more from Sara, being a big fan of Conversations and All Right Here. Those two albums had not just excellent lyrics, but also excellent music and production. This album has little of any of those qualifications. The writing is haphazard and without emotion. The music is poor and overpowers Sara. What was Charlie Peacock thinking when he produced this album? *Was* he thinking?The redeaming value of this CD is the bonus disc with piano versions of a few songs. This is Sara at her best on the album. Strip away the crap that's drowning her, and some of these songs would be decent. But many of these songs really shouldn't have seen the light of day.If you're a die hard fan, I guess you'll want to buy the album. But if your into good, quality music, make a pass on this and grab Conversations or All Right Here (Conversations being the better of the two)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clockwork Crazy","review":"This CD is a great example of the melding of music styles to achieve a fresh sound. The band combines a funk, metal, folk quality with origional lyrics. Trapped in the Carnival is a great example with the funk rhythms, the metal guitar and the carnival like piano interludes amplifying the unique lyrics. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone looking for something a little different and a little crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is heavy metal ????? no way jose!","review":"Working in music retail for 15+ yrs and having a cd collection in the thousands I'd think I'd know what music, especially heavy metal, sounds like.Are you kidding me??? Iron Maiden, Dream theater, Faith No more comparisons ..... to what ? This cd isn't even heavy metal much less worthy of the tag progressive metal and to be lumped in with those praiseworthy bands mentioned before. This cd is nothing more then basement Collective Soul meets Poi Dog Pondering. From the provided description I was thoroughly ashamed that someone would even dare think this is heavy metal. This is fluffy pop at best but just a tad better than what you hear on the radio. Avoid if you are a heavy metal fan - at all costs!

I have finally found a CD of this brilliant performance.

A must for the serious collector; skip if you don't like pre-Machinehead DP."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent idea from Jon Lord","review":"it is an excellent idea from JON LORD, he was a hero in this album, Dr. Malcolm Arnold helped the band in 1969 by doing this stuffs.

If you really want to change your life to be pure rather than just learning to stay away from porn(which is a short term solution not a long term way of life)you need to read and think about more than this book has to offer.Try joshua harris's I kissed dating goodby, or the smaller books in the new testament- phillipains and collosians and such. perhaps even Bonhoeffer's Life Together.

That means he worked for the Ministry Of Defense. Pope believes that UFOs are real and explains what he discovered while working for the MOD in his book \\"Open Skies, Closed Minds\\". Although a lot of the information in that book is known to most UFO researchers he does uncover some new UK material and it is a good book about UFOs from an MOD insider. A worthy addition to any UFO book collection.In this book he goes into detail about what he learned about Alien Abductions while working for the MOD on this topic. So it is pretty much as good an insider look at the MODs take on this whole issue as you will likely find anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for anyone curious about UFOs","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who is new to the subject of UFOs, and a good read for those already fairly well versed.

Some parts sound like ocean mist, others like waves/bubbles which makes you really feel like you're in the water with them. The songs are almost hypnotizing in both their simplicity and the wonderful compositions that seem to embody the essence of water and the sea. The whale sounds themselves seem to touch me at that quiet inner place that seems to speak of eternity. Its just amazing, so soothing.

I believe he is correct. Personal narratives of war are increasingly popular, but for the historian or the buff who wishes to dig back a little, the results can be disappointing. The inevitable tendency to reflect the prevailing mood of the time, or at least not butcher too many sacred cows, means that many of the post-WW2 accounts are to be taken (in my opinion) with more than the usual grain of salt. Bowlby exhibits an unusual degree of candour for the time. This work also comes from the pen of a men accustomed to expressing himself clearly, and it shows. A 'must' for scholar and buff alike.

Another problem is that a lot of what is true is not new. The basic themes of incompetent allied generalship and the unfavorable casualty exchange rate were first presented by Churchill in \\"The World Crisis,\\" and have been fully documented in numerous works since then. At best, this book brings the similar follies of the French to the attention of the English-reading world that tends to ignore the French role in the war. For a healthy alternate view, read Paddy Griffith's \\"Battle Tactics of the Western Front\\" to learn about some British officers who actually did develop new tactics adapted to the realities of the trench war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely excellent","review":"Finally!Both my grand-fathers were French soldiers for the entire duration of the conflict.

Mosier makes a lot of assumptions and clearly has'nt done his homework on the learning curve of both French and British forces.

I have never read such a poorly informed or researched work on the first world war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh, not that great","review":"First I will preface this review with the following disclaimer: I found the approach the author took offensive. I had to keep reading just to see how offensive it got. Now that that is out of the way, overall this book misses the mark. While the contribution of the AEF to the end of the War can not be discounted, the author discounts far too heavily the efforts of the French and the British in the previous four years of conflict. The book also fails to adequately explore the problems inside of Germany that play a part in the War's end. The book is too U.S. centric to be considered objective. Also, the author devotes only one or two chapters to explaining the contribution of the AEF towards ending the war. I don't think that is enough space to effectively make an argument, even a faulty one, convincing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionism is an understatement","review":"Mosier, who is not a historian, wrote Myth of the Great War after touring some battlefields on the Western Front. Nice idea, but scholars of history actually do research with original documents such as memoirs government records and correspondence to ascertain the truth as close as possible.His bias is obvious from the beginning, making the American military effort supernatural. While the American soldiers played a role in the victory, but to state that ANY one country or event was the turning point is ludicrous as any student or scholar of the era knows.In addition, Mosier's book is narrow in scope limiting the bulk of his 'work' to the Western front with minimal mentions of the Eastern front and almost ignoring Africa and Asia.Biased, poorly researched and altogether lacking. While non-historians are welcomed to write about history, they should hold themselves to the standards historians are held to by their peers."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful...","review":"not only does mosier revise history in whichever manner he wants to, but his highly irritating and arrogant writing style will put off even the most neutral and open-minded of readers. mosier's books are not history, they are 'history according to mosier.'AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Other side of the hill","review":"Most all military books start with a lot of movement that has to be followed on a map,witch can be very boring,but i guess us people who read military history will have to put up with.This book should be read with with Denis Winters \\"Haigs Command\\".A lot of new information was released when the British archives were opened in the60's.Iknow most people like myself don't read much fiction,but i would recomend C.S.Forester's The General to get a feeling of the type of officer's some of the British high command had.Those who read Honblower know Forester's reseach ability.The proof reading was a disgrace,i hope it's not going to be the standard and not the exception.This is a good book,but you must have patience to read it as with most military history."},{"rating":"2","title":"the true story of the winning of the war","review":"I read and actually liked this book. Although no scholar of the Great War it sure looks to me like we pulled the Brits and Frog's chestnuts out of the fire just like we did again 25 years later. These other reviewers don't seem to appreciate a good story when they read one. If the Europeans were this bad at waging war, it's clear why they have deteriorated to helpless lackeys today. Still, you have to wonder: what exactly were these people killing each other for so hotly 90 years ago? I don't get a clear idea of this from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read...helpful contrarian perspective","review":"I found Mosier's data and perspective fascinating. To often we only hear the British view of the war, or the American view of their importance to the effort.

I could hardly put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learning phrases isn't enough, need to be able to reply","review":"I had high hopes for this audio CD, but found it to be a one sided exercise. The problem is that there are over 700 Greek phrases, but the phrases are spoken in isolation and not repeated unless you replay the section. It may be great to learn some Greek phrases, but the CD doesn't provide the listener with appropriate responses - so you will be able to say a phrase, but not understand the response. The book that comes with it is very good, with each phrase spelled out in Greek and also showing the pronunciation. If you're looking to learn some conversational Greek, this isn't the CD for you. Also, the audio is very bad - the English speaker is extremely soft while the Greek speaker is fine.

The liners are so small that you'd need x-ray vision to get them lined up right when your dog wears the diaper. I don't, so the fabric got wet, and totally defeated the purpose of having liners. I ended up using two at a time just to use them up. Ugh. My advice? Go on eBay and see how many people are out there making and selling male dog belly wraps that don't need liners.

First of all, I have a 12lb Miniature Pinscher, and the size medium is kind of tight on him. And, he is by no means overweight. Occasionally, he likes to mark, so we figured this would be a good purchase. We were wrong! The item is not soft to the touch, and it has tight elastic, meaning it bunches too much and tends to squeeze his belly. There seems to be extra fabric, and it almost looks like a diaper or ballerina tutu on him. He looks absurd.

We thought for sure he would not like wearing it, however he has yet to acknowledge that it's even on him. We received the item only a few days after ordering which was a giant plus for us. One thing to note before ordering is size. I originally ordered a size Small and it was significantly too small for our 10-lb toy poodle. We ended up ordering a size Medium for him. It fits pretty good circumference wise, however it is a little too big for him as it covers a larger area than needed. Even though it is slightly too large for him, there has been no leaks.

They fit perfectly into the diaper, have the same strong adhesive, and cost me 1/6th the price.Yes, it was a little embarassing to buy these at first, but considering I needed a solution that was less expensive, I decided that my little guy is more important.

I bought this in x-large and washed and dried it in the dryer so it shrunk to just the right size for him. I can't be bothered with waiting for it to air dry. It did shrink alot. I needed something that would handle alot of urine so I bought baby diapers and pinned one going vertical and one horizonal using safety pins. works great. my dog never gave it any mind at all, though I must admit, he's rather exceptional :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couch Saver","review":"We have an 11 year old border collie with a love for marking and this product has saved our couch and house from him.

We have been using them for a couple months and as time progressed he soiled it less and less. Starting with every time we left and now he rarely does. We use it with Overnight Pads, since by itself it isn't absorbent enough. We bought two, so that we would always have one clean.Make sure you always air dry these.

For that reason, few scholars of the art of the past can resist the temptation to cloud their work with terminal over-analysis and obfuscating jargon. Fortunately, Walter Gibson (like St. Anthony in the desert) does not succumb to these demons. With a clear eye, he reviews the work, thought and religious sentiment of one of the most mystical painters in human history; however, he never lets daylight in upon magic. The reader finishes this delightful little tome on Bosch with a better understanding of his work, but a profound respect for his mystery. Gibson is erudite without being obfuscatory, respectful without being unduly ingratiating. An excellent work by someone who truly loves and understands art."},{"rating":"2","title":"More color pictures, please!","review":"A wonderfully written introduction to the works of Hieronymus Bosch.

But this book may well change your mind about the genre. Rucker has a definite comedic gift, as well as very strong story-telling abilities, and is able to construct mind-bending plot twists. The basic premise revolves around two screwball physicists who create all manner of havoc with their reckless inventions, then must try to undo the damage, skewering a multitude of sacred cows in the process.

Una buena pelicula sobre este tema es Espiral.The worst tragegy about this film is that it was ever made. There is not much of a plot, aside from the obvious. There is ABSOLUTELY no character development since the script only calls from the actors to speak for literally moments at a time. Perphaps, worst of all, conversations by the actors are interspersed by long and tedious songs.

This is the one new readers should start with. It is rather difficult, and for some a dictionary may be needed, but its rewards far surpass its difficulties. Soloveitchik's thesis is that there are two stories of creation in the Bible, not because there are two literary traditions, but because there are two sides to man. Majestic Adam sees God in the splendor of the universe, and shows reverence through science. Lonely Adam craves a personal relationship with God, which is glimpsed in fleeting moments. Soloveitchik has no use for cheap \\"spirituality.\\" His is the real kind, which takes deep thought and a lot of work. His is also the kind which, once attained, lasts a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen","review":"This was recommended to me by a friend, an Orthodox Jew, who correctly intuited that this Catholic would benefit substantially from reading it. Rabbi Soloveitchik's little book belongs among the (my) short list of spiritual classics. And while he speaks with particular insight into the modern condition, his concerns are perennial, and address the heart of authentic spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"So I'm not the only one...","review":"Right on the first page, Soloveitchik surprises the reader by confessing, \\"I am lonely.\\" While he acknowledges that his life is surrounded by loving friends and family who care about him, he writes that another reality also encompasses him. He and his community of faith (or just \\"community\\" in general; some readers will readily translate his meaning into the social circles of their own). A chasm separates what Soloveitchik calls \\"Adam I\\" or \\"Majestic Man\\" (the supremely confident, driven, maker/doer) and \\"Adam II\\" or \\"Covenantal Man\\" (the isolated, non-engaged observer of Majestic Man's legitimate projects, who years foremost for redemptive relationship: I and Thou, and together, our Creator.) What Soloveitchik says, in essence -- along with Kermit the Frog -- is: \\"It's not easy being green.\\" Green readers will understand what this book is about; the not-so-green, not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as represented","review":"Our canary had just come out of a stress molt due to a move and had stopped singing.

The philosophical aspect is deep and historical analysis is unique for the reader to have rich understanding of human action. It is a book that challenges the mind and brings to light hidden truth. The reader should have much patience because the book draws the mind to think and it can be confusing fo those who have static mind in traditions, believes, historical facts and any intellectual information that has been left without critical examination. By reading this book I have a better view of our world in terms of Religion, Sexual gratification, conflict, societal schism, individual growth, living in hamony with others no matter of ones position on issues, and has given me a mind to examine critical issues in politics, education, economics,religion, feminism and social structure."},{"rating":"2","title":"An up close and personal view of WWI","review":"Ellis brings the reader right into the trenches.

The dangers of trench foot, mustard gas and barb wire seep off the pages. Graphic photos and excellent illustrations bring the labyrinth of trenches into focus.

I must say there were even some good ideas (not that I would ever use one of these tricks). Definitely a unique read, but not worth the [$$$] for it, it has the width of a long comic book. I was a little disappointed on the size, a problem when buying a book over [the internet], but it was very interesting and it had me laughing in some chapters.

Every cart inserted would result in a blinking red light. Swapped it out, cleaned up the games (again) and that problem vanished entirely. It still takes a little bit of effort sometimes to get the games to properly load (often the image is garbled, I blame poor cartridge-seating design) but it does at least load the game, every single time.If I ever encounter another NES that needs fixing, I'll go straight for another one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"NES 72 Pin Connector","review":"Item installed quickly and easily .

As is most of Nabokov's work, this book is excellent. My advice to other Nabokov freaks and readers--if you liked 'Lolita', you will most likely like this. It isn't quite as good, but is definitely worth a glance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lolita-esque","review":"While Laughter is a great standalone read, it pales in comparison to Lolita. Far and away, Lolita is one of the best books ever written. Laughter and Lolita share a very similar dynamic being that both fall in love with younger girls that don't share the same affection. Both Humbert and Albinus also share a penchant for resolving their problems with a gun wrapped up in a scarf. But, Laughter lacks the dismal humor that Lolita captured. And the story line was somewhat unclear and too many characters were underdeveloped. By no means is this a bad read, on the contrary its quite good. Just compared to the best book ever written (Lolita), Laughter is missing a certain finesse that Lolita embodied."},{"rating":"2","title":"middle of a trio of black farces","review":"Laughter in the Dark forms the middle point of a loose trilogy of black farces that were written early in Nabokov's career during his European residence period.It tells the story of a man ruined by infatuation. The plot undergoes peculiar twists and turns as the gullible Albinus is played like a puppet by his teenage lover Margot and her cruel artist ex boyfriend, Rex.It improves upon 'King, Queen, Knave' in its stylish treatment of the theme of delusional romance allowing in wicked cruelty, but is less accomplished than the masterful 'Despair', with its crackpot narrator who weaves a masterful downfall, entirely of his own making."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect novel","review":"If Lolita is a great symphony, Laughter in the Dark is a flawless sonata. It's a simple story, elegantly told and deftly plotted, simultaneously tragic and comic. A quick read, both for its relative brevity and because it's so difficult to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"none better Lemmon,ever","review":"Jack Lemmon, \\"The Long Way Home\\".

However, he has a decent amount of articulation, a wicked looking battle axe weapon, and those cool pop-out heads which work in dragon or robot mode. The necks actually have limited poseability to them, and Scourge's sound effects change depending on what form he's in for an overall total of three different sounds from the same buttons: roaring, lasers, and the famous transformation sound effect.

Gone are all the influences from folk and world music, leaving only some generic FM rock in 4/4 beats and major scales. Nary a hummable tune on the whole disc.Competent; perhaps more-so than the first two (which may have reached farther than their grasp); but not improved by this provincialism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another english delight","review":"Principle Edwards is another englisg folk rock band.Their third album has it's ups and downs.The album has 8 pieces.

The ghose stuff is great, and VERY unfinished, so I can't wait for Red Lily to find out how Amelia gets \\"exorcised\\".

I am an avid gardener, so the setting of the garden center, and details of the business was an added bonus. The characters in all her books seem real, but never more than in the In The Garden series. I love the balance of personalities, and their wonderful interaction. I felt as if I knew these people! When I started reading Black Rose it was like visiting old friends. Black Rose is my favorite, I think, because it is centered on Roz. She is such a strong woman, but does not let her strength take away from her warmth and femininity.

It had nothing to offer to me as an animator who wished to learn more about lighting. I went through the first 50 pages without learning anything new or useful at all. Yes, lots of colorful pictures, but they are either stills from big Hollywood productions which have little if anything at all to do with the text or are specificaly prepared for the book which look so bad you don't even want to read through the text to see how they were made. There are many interviews, but you can find similar ones for free on internet. Digital Lighting & Rendering by Jeremy Birn might be more expensive but is a far far better book than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pictures not very connected to text","review":"When I first got this book, I looked through all the pages, and there was a colour picture at least once every few pages - and many came from famous ILM films such as Jurrasic Park. I looked forward to reading about how these images were lit or rendered or composited -- but (sadly) the text had very little if anything to say about the specific shots, the images often were a tangent to the main topic of the text, where it seemed as if it were a stretch to work in a mention of the image. I don't blaim the companies for wanting to keep everything about their work a secret, but without any specifics the general discussions in this book were essentially unillustrated and not very useful.

Their case of Stalin, however, is completely unconvincing; Stalin clearly was a psychopath.Napoleon was a charismatic leader, but he completely abandoned his army both in Egypt and in Russia. With the bi-polar disorder, the authors have found a convincing explanation for the extremes of his behavior.In the case of Hitler, I want to refer to the book \\"When Illness strikes the Leader\\" by Post and Robins. They describe how Hitler was taking coke and speed simultaneously. Cocaine produces a sense of well-being and confidence that can mount to feelings of elation and grandiosity. Hitler's doctor, Morell, administered his notorious patient a wide array of sedatives. Hitler confessed: \\"If I had not got my faithful Morell, I should be absolutely knocked out!\\" Hitler's addictions could also explain his successive symptoms of elation and depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took a chance cause they were cheap..","review":"I ordered a pair for my husband and was very disappointed, the 11 medium that I received was probably as wide as any EEE width I have seen, and whats worse -these just sort of look cheap.

The shrinks constantly making Amy out to be some kind of monster when she's the victim gets old fast, especially when there is justice for abusive jerks and anti-social pervs being dealt out as appropriate.Overly long, poorly paced, Amy Girl is the sort of book you read when there's nothing else around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read-Gripping Tale","review":"I, like many others, read this book when I was about 15 years old.

As some other reviewers have mentioned, there are some excellent and useful knitting tips but these are quickly read through. The constant name dropping (mostly second rate actresses) and pretentious fawning over any sort of quasi-celebrity becomes extremely tiresome (my midwestern sensibility here).

The author comes off as self-important and obnoxious. She is almost sure no one would have learned how to knit if it weren't for her and that she has the only yarn shop to carry good quality stock. I expected the name dropping, it is in Hollywood and all, but she goes on and on. She takes credit as the very first person to ever have a baby blanket making shower---that's been going on for years and that same concept is what is used for the Linus project and any other number of charity groups.

Instead, it is warm chenille, with easy snaps all the way down the front and no drafts. The best part is that it closes at the collar, which means you stay warm at the top as well as the bottom. I hope it lasts forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy Robe","review":"The fit on this robe was comfortable, and it is very warm. The color is an attractive pink. (Just trying not to be completely negative here!) HOWEVER, this robe sheds worse than any product I have ever owned, with the possible exception of a dog. There are little pink balls all over the house, in the carpet, countertops, my hairbrush - there is just no end to it. I have washed it several times and it has not stopped shedding. I am now waiting for another robe I ordered to arrive so I can ditch this one. The problem is, I can't use it for anything else, even my husband won't take it for garage rags. I absolutely lost my money on this thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chenille bathrobe","review":"I love this chenille bathrobe!!! I love it so much that I ordered another one in a different color because my family might get tired of seeing me in it all the time. I does shed some fibers so wash it a few time alone in the machine in cold water. It stays soft and warm and has the extra room for my larger hips. Can't wait for colder weather so I can start wearing them again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! --- Avoid Like the Plague --- A Health Hazzard!","review":"Vendor, National, should pull this item immediately due to unbelievable amount of shedding --- not just bits of chenille that fall off on floor/carpet (as if you are Gretel leaving a path:-), but also a huge amount of finer fuzz that coats your bed, and upholstery, etc. Worst of all however is the incredible amount of air-born particulate matter --- I have developed chest congestion/bronchitis after wearing for 1 week in spite of 3 washings --- never suffered from any lung/chest condition before, even though I am a \\"senior.\\" More details to come (have photos) after I contact manufacturer, but in the meantime wanted to warn my fellow Amazon customers of the serious danger to health from inhalation --- not to mention the clean-up of my previously immaculate house (hours of vacuuming, dusting, upholstery brushing as it went \\"viral\\" )."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy customer!","review":"I bought this robe for my mother who had certain requests. She didn't want flannel material, or for the robe to be long. This robe fit the bill! I ordered it and she received it today. She couldn't be happier with the fit (roomy)and comfort (warm and cozy).

So they will just shrug it off...and think I want to be a Light of Good!HOWEVER....to me if someone was to Give/Read this book to any child and most likely any adult....that had been Severely Abused....I think it would be \\"SLAP\\" in the face....Someone who has been abused be it emotionally, sexually or physically! Or another example someone has been raped or beaten by a spouse!Yes you should forgive....because it helps you personally to forgive....but lets not make the victim suffer more! ***By making excuses for Very Bad Behavior!Therefore I would not recommend this book to Everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not so sure the 8 yr old can get into this...","review":"I love NDW & CWG, as I've read & listened with the highest interest & enjoyment & am thrilled with the enlightenment I've received from them.

I also bot the other book (....Earth), & decided not to give that one to her. I'll read it & give it to her sister on her B/D this coming spring. I'm dissapointed in the book, as I thot NDW would have found a much more easier & enjoyable way of expressing his message to children.

Especially long trips!A MUST to have together with the \\"Little soul and the Earth- I am somebody!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A special book for special children","review":"As the mother of a special needs child I find the message in this book delightful. Granted I haven't gotten to the point of having to explain the book, or its message to him yet. But I think that for any child, on any subject a book that inspires conversation and discussion with a loved one, is to be treasured. And in many ways I think that it answers many of the questions about God that frequently arise.I think that in addition to using this book to teach about god, it will also be a tool to teach my child about others who may do unkind things and how to respond to them. ALso I really appreciat the focus on the emotional and personality ways that people are special instead of the focus of so many books on being special because of actions and sports- things that my son may never be able to do- but he will be able to be kind and loving and sharing and forgiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complex for young minds","review":"This is a lovely book. Walsch has set out, as he has in all his other books, to bring love, peace and understanding to the world. Unfortunately this is not his greatest success. Two types of children will get this book - those whose parents are CWG fans and can explain the book to their children, and those who receive this book from someone outside the immediate family as a gesture of love. The latter group are the losers because the book needs explaining. The topic of \\"slowing down vibrations and becoming heavy\\" is something that some CWG readers cannot grasp so what chance the children? I think Walsch has made a good attempt to bring CWG to children but it could have been so much simpler than this. You have to aim at your audience and I think he should have imagined a kid picking up this book and understanding it first time round with no assistance from outside. He would then have tackled it a different way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Little Soul shines his light...as the midday sun.","review":"Hi everyone,I can not say enough about this beautiful book. I know it was intended for children,but as a adult (not grown up..yet)this book I have just thought, thought, and thought some more about, and I learned so much from it. My nieces and nephew absolutely loved it, and I think they have read it several times now.It really does a great job explaining to everyone, \\"Why we came here to this planet, and what it is exactly that we are here to experience.\\" It just makes too much sense to me to not be true. The illustrations are extraordinary! If you love Neale Donald Walsch's other books, then you will fall head over heels in love with this one, folks! A must have for any library, as far as I am concerned. Not just for kids,eitherDennisdennis_aiken@yahoo.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to grown-up books...","review":"I adore all of Neale's \\"Conversation with God\\" books, but he really should have gotten a children's author to tackle this subject for him. This book is VERY confusing for children. I couldn't even get mine to sit through the first page and I've shared all of my CWG philosophy with them and they are avid readers!! You can't slap pictures of baby angels on a grown-up story and call it a children's book. I was very disappointed. I've noticed that all the positive reviews on this list were written by ADULTS who hadn't yet shared the book with a child. I'm sure they'll feel differently when they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't agree. Highly recommended, thou!","review":"I liked this book from the first pages, but...I don't agree with the idea, that \\"evil\\" is natural, which seems to be the a backthought of this book.As someone told in his review:\\"Now I understand my choice better\\", but if you choose EVIL - it wont make You any better!The book for adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"God and Darkness?","review":"I love the adult books and looked forward to one for kids.The book idea of a soul that choices to be born is great and the idea that God creates light works for me but needs explaining. I have a problem with the idea that if God only creates light how does he create darkness with another light so the first light can get a sense of how it feels in comparison? That does not work for me or our Church. We believe that man, not God, by our free choices, creates darkness and that God creates light and good and wants only that for us but does not create the darkness.Blessings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jessica Lunsford buried alive ...","review":"... and according to this book, she and her family were done a favor, by someone who went out of their way to be, against their true nature, evil - so that others could forgive them for their atrocities.That is the message of this book, like it or not.Those who like it have probably not been done the great favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"This way of thinking could change the world!","review":"This book could change the way we interact with one another on a daily basis.

The message almost instantly connects me with the love I have for the people in my life. It helped me forgive those I had difficulty forgiving. It is a book for the child within, no matter what age you are.This little, innocent looking book may just rock your world. It did so for me.

Neither my wife nor I could understand the lyrics. This was a real disappointment. (I was appreciative of Amazon's returns policy so I could hand it back.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldies but goodies","review":"I love the song There Will Never Be Another You and I think that Chris Montez does it the best. A lot of people like this song and it's a favorite of mine.Many artists have recorded this song like Doris Day, Nat King Cole, Andy Williams, and these are also very good.

The piano is so moving with a beatiful flute and violin to accent the mood. The ocean sounds are gentle and soothing and don't get in the way of the music.

You feel as though your with him on the ocean shore or on a journey to a magical place filled with beautiful music.

He was at his vocal peak when recording these two Roulette albums (after three hitless years on RCA, which sadly seemed to saddle him with the novelties that Como turned down). On \\"Love Songs,\\" he sings with remarkable passion and strength - his version of \\"How About Me\\" must rank among the all-time best versions of that song, which can be taken to maudlin extremes (even Garland overdid it- here it's just perfect). \\"Sunny Side\\" is just that, a marvelous collection of uptempo standards.

Or probably this guy has some standup comedy talent and makes fun of all that Starbucks vocabulary or the MacBooks in the stores.Not so. What you see is a guy with obvious and quite serious psychological issues visiting some Sbux branches along the west coast in the US. This is shown mostly in grainy pictures from handheld camera.

This is not a music CD. Mr. Gibson used a very sensitive directional microphone and sat still like a guru while nature spoke. Not so easy--think about how frequently planes fly over our heads. Yet, this is not another noisy, monotonous hissing ocean recording either. Throughout, it is consistently relaxing as well as rich with almost visual detail.

It was recommended by my friend, and I almost put it down not too far in. It was clear it was going to be sort of a war book, and very pro-military (not my kind of reading).But I kept on.... and man did I get sucked into it. By the end of the book (and yes I understand this is just a sci fi book about a war with bugs, but...), Heinlein had pulled me into his way of thinking. I have a new understanding of the military mindset and what it's appeal is for many people. I really feel like my eyes were opened a bit, and I feel like a richer person for it.Highly, highly recommend this book. I've read a few other Heinlein's since, and I continue to marvel at what a masterful, manipulative writer he is. (Manipulative in a thrilling way... as in taking you on a ride you didn't even know you wanted to go on.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a political rant!!","review":"I've read many of Heinlein's books and loved them all...except this one. I was expecting an action novel and instead got a polictical rant!! This is one instance where the movie was much better than the book...and I thought the movie was little more than a joke. I suffered through the entire book hoping the political thesis would eventually turn to action but it never did.

The author, Robert Heinlein, was a Naval Academy graduate. His characters in this book present his beliefs in some very well laid out paths of logic. If you are looking for an adventure/thriller, however, you need to look elsewhere. Starship Trooopers continues to be held in high regard by our military establishment, as it is currently on the Commandant of the Marine Corps' recommended reading list. This book was first published in 1958 and it has apparently withstood the test of time, considering Vietnam transpired shortly afterward. One can only wonder how many young troops, inspired by this novel, died in 'Nam. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in science fiction, politics and the role of the military in a free and open society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, poorly read","review":"This book is my all time favorite Sci-fi book. I have re-read it several times. I was excited to find it on inunabridged audio cassette format.Unfortunatly, who ever hired Lloyd James to read it really blew it. He reads this exciting adventure story like he is bored stiff. He drones on in a monotone voice with extremely few voice inflections and long pauses between conversatons. He doesn't even try to sound like real people would speak their parts.My girlfriend and I are very disappointed with this audio book. As much as I love this book all I can say is DON'T BUY THIS AUDIO BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"The movie was unworthy of the title - forget the movie!!!

A magnificent work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book , all categories.","review":"In Starship Troopers, Heinlein tells the story of Johny Rico, a young man who joins the Mobile Infantry, defending earth against the Bugs (Spider-like aliens). Below the surface, though, this book is a social commentary, primarily about responsibility for one's actions, and while it might go to some extremes here, RAH does have a few very good points. A must read for anyone. Yes, anyone :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Obligations in democracy","review":"This book was one of RAH's first real political statements, and touches on the entire issue of what obligations citizens have to their country, if they wish to have influence over it.While seen as \\"right-wing\\" by some, it is really an attempt to match up privilage with responsibility, and is both fascinating to read as SF and as commentary.This book seems to be a clear view of what would later emerge in all of RAH's books, which is the TANSTAAFL idea, or there aint no such thing as a free lunch.worth reading by anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could I Get a Glass of Water Please","review":"Unless you enjoy reading long, drawn out detailed monologues do NOT buy this book. If you want to buy this because you liked the movie version do NOT buy this book. This book is a VERY dry read with nothing to grab your attention and very little action. Yes, I admit, some of the ideas represented are realistic, but that alone does not make a good story. With no real dialogue or connection with other characters in the story, this book gets Real boring Real fast. I finally just gave up even trying to force my way through it in hope of getting to anything interesting after about 80 pages. A huge waste of time and money even if it is a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Holy smokes, was this a boring book! If you like reading books where something actually HAPPENS, don't bother with this one. It's just a long, boring diatribe, no action to speak of. And it's not like you're listening to Johnny pondering the vagaries of the universe after seeing his buddies slaughtered in battle, you're listening to his PROFESSOR drone on about in CLASS! I don't think Heinlein could've made it any duller.Bottom line: if you want to read the book because you liked the movie, DON'T.

However, the one I bought was an \\"econoclad\\" book which seems to mean a paperback with a poorly glued on card-board cover. Hardly what anyone would consider a real hardcover.

It proposes political and philosophical concepts as well as military training and strategies. It weaves all these themes together in one impressive book. A lot of people that gave ST a bad review didn't even seem like they read the book. This book is also original. The political and philosophical concepts in the book seem like they are of Heinlein's creation, but not his personal belief's. READ THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a shootem' up space opera","review":"I've read this book innumerable times, and still get chills atthe end of the first chapter. Exploring the coming of age of a youngman, this book is not about fighting and warfare.I've also read all of the reviews here... the reviewers that call this book ultra-right wing are missing the point completely. The fact that only service veterans can vote is *NOT* because that is the best possible society, but because it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story about Fascism","review":"I love the way that the main character goes into this story hating everything about his society and world. In order to become a citizen he is forced to join the military, in his own mind. During training his world is destroyed and there is a call to arms. By the end of the story, amidst this war, it turns out that he agrees and believes in many of the ideals he once loathed. Great story. I read it as a teen and again a few months back for the first time since then. Whether you like sci-fi or not, this is an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blueprint for responsibility","review":"I've read all of Heinlein's books and have read this one 25+ times. Some people have labeled it \\"fascist\\" but I think they are confusing militaristic with fascist.For me, it works on many different levels. You can relax and treat it like a classic space-romp with aliens, spaceships and cool weapons. Or you can dive in deeper and read several discourses on responsibility and how personal responsibility (or the lack of it) affects all of society. To me, that's what makes this book shine.You will also see a reflection of the times in which it was written. Most notably, the communistic Bugs which are the relentless and hated enemy.This book has had a huge impact on me and I recommend it without reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, 'sensitive reader makes it, um...sensitive\\"","review":"Lets face it, for those that have read the novel, the movies are a pretty poor, inaccurate substitute. Well, I like an audiobook, if the reader is appropriate, and inflects their voice (you know-story teller) I can really get lost in it and my imagination makes the experience just as satisfying (if not more so) than a good movie. Well, for me this wasn't going to happen with this character reading. No emotion when he describes combat, or personal interaction. Everything flat, sensitive tone (he seriously needs to put some \\"bass in his voice\\") Really sad effort for such a great book and not worth a penny, the publisher should pay people to suffer like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starship Troopers","review":"Excellent read, though it doesn't muster the \\"contreversial\\" label it's been given. Maybe for 1959:). Just some old ideas revisited with a twist and a couple of new thoughts. What this novel lacks in minor character development and plot it more than makes up for with the tale of the protagonist's journey from recruit Private to Lieutenant. A good yarn, and refreshingly thought-provoking philosophy woven throughout. The book combines realistic combat soldier experiences, sci-fi technology, and an interesting theoretical society. Good insights on soldiering from recruit training to taking command whether you want it or not. Social theory: compelling look at the place of corporal punishment and an entire society where citizenship requires military service. Especially recommend this to veterans. I'm glad I bought this book, I'll probably read it a few times, the pages on moral philosophy and history are dogmarked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book, skip the movie","review":"Heinlein is one of my favorite writers. I started with Rocket Ship Galileo 60 years ago.

I've read many who have tried to copy this idea, but nobody has come close to relating the incredible sense of power Heinlein imparts to his warriors. If that was all there was in this story it would still be a great one but the characters and view he paints of the military lifestyle are what really shine through. This book is required reading at West point, so that should tell you everything you need to know about its merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Heinlein at his best","review":"Heinlein truly is a grand master of science fiction as proven by this excellent book.

Why does \\"Troopers\\" continue to excite such heated controversy more than 30 years after first publication?

I see some of Bob's points concerning citizen responsiblity and harsher punishment towards criminals, but when I read a science fiction book, I like to read more action and a fast-paced adventure. Overall, the book wasn't totally dull like 2061 and The Hidden War, but I have definitely read better. In letter grade form, this book gets a C+."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST EVER","review":"First, all the movie had was good special effects, a nice little shower scene, and a few lines from the book thrown in. The movie did this book no justice.(Don't get me wrong I liked the movie but it fell flat compared to the book.) What I found most intersting about the book was the philisophical, moral, and social ideas described in the book. The last time I felt so compelled to think about such issues was my in my sociology class.But anyway the detail it's written in is great, it has great action, and the storyline is good. Definitely one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"I kept waiting for the plot to start! Heinlein's ideas about citizenship are intriguing, but clumsily presented. There are pages and pages of exposition of these ideas by teacher characters in the book. This type of presentation is way too didactic; it bludgeons the reader over the head. I hope the movie is better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work of military science fiction.","review":"This was the first of Heinlein's works that I've read. Going into it I had heard of the controversy that surrounded it; most were criticisms of the perceived socio-political theories that he was promoting. While it does appear that he was promoting a philosophy of some kind, it in no way lessens the literary merit of Starship Troopers. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and consider it a seminal and great work of fiction. Simply put, it's a great read. I recommend it to any fans of military fiction, science fiction, or Heinlein's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Finest Work of Sci-Fi","review":"I first became a fan of Heinlein with Tunnel in the Sky, which was great. But Starship Troopers is far and away my favorite fictional work EVER.I'm typically a slow reader, but when I first read this back in the late 80's, I could hardly put it down and blew through it quickly.But now, having grown up, joined the Marines, and experienced a little bit of life as an adult, the story has taken on new meaning for me. It's not just a sci-fi adventure anymore.To me the story is a classic tale about growing up and attaining manhood, the friendships won and lost as a soldier, and the accelerated \\"growing up\\" that happens as a soldier.Either way, as a teen then and as a 30-something now, an absolutely incredible, worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Although it had it's good moments and some great in depth thought I found everything else to be slow, dragged on, and just plain boring.

Ender's Game is the book you should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing -- no match for Ender's Game","review":"After reading so many glowing reviews, I was immensely disappointed in this book. Although it had a few good moments, I generally found it slow, a bit juvenile, and no match for a novel it inspired: Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, a book I couldn't put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about not that much","review":"Sorry, folks, but I didn't find this thing either the work of genius some would have you think, nor the abomination others decry. It basically reads like a recruitment guide for the military. Nothing inherently wrong with that, but if you buy it looking for action you will be sorely disappointed; it begins with action, and there is some action later, but not very much. Seventy-five percent of it is the author's political and/or moral philosophy, as rendered by various teachers, military officers, and the narrator."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Happiness consist in getting enough sleep.\\"","review":"This is an amazing book, probably the best on the Marine Corps Reading List I've come across so far. It has an amazing military life aspect and includes the authors veiws on thing such as communism and disipline. Great read, buchered by the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't anybody get it?","review":"The majority of these reviews seem to have misinterpeted the message of the book. First of all, if you read Expanded Universe you'll find that Heinlein advocates restricting the right to vote in the manner the society in his book did. A lot of this books criticism is complaining that the vote should not be limited in any way. Hello! In the United States you cannot vote until you're 18. Does this not prevent certain individuals from voting? Its a damn good book and Heinlein is a wonderful writer, he also knows the military well. This book is not pro-war. It's pro defense of the rights which are properly derived from ones existence as a human being. If you're confused about Heinleins political beliefs read the Moon is a Harsh Mistress, in particular the Professors speech while forming the cell, about Rational Anarchism."},{"rating":"2","title":"ST is as relevant today as the first time I read it.","review":"My father read this book in 1960 as a brand new Airborneinfantry 2nd Lt. He introduced the book to me as a 12 yr old, and Ihave owned a copy of it ever since. During the interim, I have carried a copy of ST through army basic training, ROTC, airborne, air assault, and training as an officer. I have it with me now (very dog eared and 100mph taped) as a Major of Armor in B-H. Why? Simply put, this book has served me well,(with a choice few other texts), and has formed the basis for many discussions of values, philosophy, and citizenship among the soldiers with whom I serve.There is no perfect book, but ST causes one to think, reason, and even argue. Plus, anyone who has ever been a soldier can relate to the situations and characters Heinlein presents. I guess the best recommendation I can make for this novel is that wherever I am, I can pull it out, open it to any page, begin reading, and still feel drawn into the world he has created."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Read is just like a military manual.

When i learned that the movie was based off a book, as an avid reader, i became incredibly exited. I immediately went on Amazon to look for this book. As always when i try a movie book combo i expect some disappointment in the discrepancy but the book was so good in its own right that i could not find myself disappointed in the book and just enjoyed the entire experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Top Sci-Fi Novels Ever","review":"I have read this book probably 8+ times. It ranks up there as one of my favorites. Robert Heinlein not only is creative and well ahead of his time, he also shows that he's well read. If you've read any ancient history, you'll see that Heinlein bases his future society on the principles of Sparta. All \\"citizens\\" are soldiers, all soldiers fight, and education of the younger generation is done by veteran soldiers.I like Starship Troopers MUCH better than the Forever War by Joe Haldeman. Maybe because I get a kick out of Heinlein's conversative politics, rather than Haldeman's liberalism (I mean really, the soldiers of the future smoke grass and engage in nightly orgies?) Heinlein takes things back to basics-- capital punishment, public floggings, and NO LIBERAL WHINING! Read Starship Troopers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Characters vs. Action","review":"I just happened to be reading some of these reviews, and it seems to me that those who read ST either loved it or hated it. I loved it. The characters make you want to care about them because they are almost overflowing with personality. You want to get to know them. Johnny Rico could be just about any one of us growing out of the innocence and sometimes aimlessness of childhood to join the ranks of the world we live in. This book is about understanding yourself and the world you live in even though the world Heinlein created may not be exactly like ours. I think that if you read this book and didn't get anything out of it, you weren't reading it.I haven't seen the movie yet, though I read the script and judging by that, I think the people that made the movie were more concerned in making this into an action flick, rather than focus on the people and the motives like Heinlein did. I'm not so sure Heinlein would have been happy with it, but I liked it. : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"Bastardized by Hollywood, Starship Troopers is not about war and space travel but about the journey from youth to manhood of Juan Rico, a child of privledge and wealth. Joining the mobile Infantry on a lark, young Juan soon comes to realize that life is about responsibility and accountability, about the sacrifice made by the few for the good of the many. Even if you liked the movie please read the book and discover the real \\"story behind the story\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"I love this book. It is truly imaginative in the way in which he builds the society. Also if you read between the lines of what he says in this book it really is an extrapolation of what he saw in society and military technologies. All in all a very good read. The best part of it is that Heinlein describes the revolution in military technology that we see today, but he wrote of it in 1957!!!I really enjoyed this book. I will say that I was supremely disappointed in the movie. Although, the movie could be in no way worse than Dune's adaptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Reintroduction to Sci-Fi","review":"I hadn't read sci-fi for a long time, and because I was one of the few who actually liked the movie, I thought I'd give the book a try (I'm usually a hard core Fantasy fan). Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! I couldn't put this book down! It reintroduced me to the amazing world of sci-fi that I had foolishly put aside. It also gave me a glimpse of a side of military life/death which I hadn't encountered before (because I thought that it wouldn't hold my interest - but I was wrong!). I'm glad I read this book - it's WAY better then the movie, which is VERY loosely based on the story. Now I'm scrambling to see what other Heinlein books are out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heinlein was not a fascist","review":"It seems to me that Heilein discusses various real-world today problems by letting people from a future world where those problems don't exist or at least are under some control look back and analyze them from an \\"outside\\" view-point. Heinlein says \\"Some of the child-rearing practices of today are rather strange\\"; he does NOT say \\"We should beat our children to make them better citizens\\". Heinlein was a humanitarian and a liberal in an age where the last large war had been fought against the faceless masses of Chinese troops in Korea (\\"Suddenly the entire hill was just Chinese, yelling KILL GI! KILL GI!...\\") which might perhaps explain the nature of the Bugs?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking Read","review":"I read this book when I was in high school, and have re-read it several times since then. The novel, in itself an interesting hard-science fiction story, is also a thought-provoking look at how a person transforms from a self-centered child into a responsible adult and citizen. I do not espouse the politics presented by Mr. Heinlein, but I do like the emphasis in the book on personal responsibility, and on putting the common good above your own. I agree with the comments that the dialogue is awful, the characters are poorly drawn, and the situations are at best improbable; however, the ideas presented are interesting, the technological advances are fascinating, and the story does draw one in. For all the flaws, I would still highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will it be read now there is a film ?","review":"I've said it before , read the book.It's about a young man who has to think about war.That's it. How American to discover that the film is confused with a novel. Read the book without baggage.It's not bad,and makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended.","review":"This is an exciting, thoughful book. For a book written so many years ago, the technology depicted is quite interesting. Heinlein also shares some refreshing libertarian views through his story. I don't read sci-fi very often, but this author was recommended and I wasn't disappointed. I also enjoyed the movie, even though it was only loosely based on the book. The armor suit reminded me of the book Armor which I read many years ago. That's a good book too. My only gripe with ST is that I enjoyed reading the battle sequences so much that I wanted to read more of them. But that's my problem, not his."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is much better","review":"This is probably the worst and most boring book I had ever read. I watched the movie first and loved it. I couldn't wait to read the book, and boy was I disapointed. It was nothing like the movie. There was hardly any action at all. It had to much discriptions in it, and the story kept jumping around which made it very confusing on what was going on. I don't see how this book got so many high ratings. I don't know how they made such an awesome movie out of this book either. But save yourself the time, watch the movie and trash the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was bored out of my mind!","review":"The first and last thirty pages were as eventful as the movie, but nothing happened in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facist rant","review":"Starship troopers is book thats only work as a vehicle for the authors facistic ideas. It contains hardly any story or action but only a background for promoting facist ideals.The \\"philosophic\\" rants in this book is so shallow and full of logic holes that it is unintentionally funny; that is if you can laugh at such matters. If you want to read Heinleins ideas in a non-fiction form try good old Adolph's \\"Mein kampf\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie was better","review":"the movie had action, drama, good characters with a decent story line. it is not acadmay award material but the book bored me. the book is all about the time in the military and the different facets of this military and it seemed to have no direction. it dragged and had nothing to keep you interested whereas the movie had the war with the bugs but there was little battle and action. it was one long book about being in the army with little or nothing interesting. so it seems most people disagree with my review. i see 1/22 people agree with my vote. im sorry people but this book put me to sleep. i found it so complacent and boring. i like heinlein but my daughter (18months) has better books than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Often misunderstood piece of scifi","review":"While many consider this the archetype \\"boy with guns\\" novel, it is actually a deep and compelling examination of society and citizenship flanked with action packed fight sequences.The questions Heinlein asks are all worthy of examination. What makes a citizen? What is the meaning of responsibility? What are people's obligations to each other and to their society? When the movie removed the philosophy in favor of showy violence it also took out the heart that made this novel great. Indeed, it was reading this as a teenager that first peeked my interest in political theory.Unfortunately, many people have decided that this novel represents the author's ideal society. Interestingly, Heinlein has an enormous body of work that argues for every social structure from fascisms to anarchy. What makes his work great, is that each is in some ways compelling in the context in which he presents it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Challenging and Benchmark Space Opera Novel","review":"Like others have said, IGNORE the stupid, stupid movie. Starship troopers is a great novel that revolutionized an entire subgenre of science fiction. The action scenes are brief, but the situations and background are well-crafted and gripping. Yes, it's also loaded with political science, much of which feels dated now since it was written during the Cold War, but even these ideas are challenging and rich. I find this novel as absorbing today as ever. The lonely and brave feel of the human soldiers against the bug army is haunting. I'll read it again soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"growing up","review":"I first read this book when I was about 17 then reread it when I was 21, and just the other day at 28. Each time it has reminded be about what it means to become a man. This book teaches something different at any age. When I was 17 it made me look to the future to make my destany come true. At 21 it made me look back at 17 and see how much my world view changed from 17. How different I was from that young age. Now at 28 the book makes me want to change, as part of a natural order, I look to the future and wonder what will I be then.I keep this book very close to my hart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satire?","review":"Hard to tell which parts of this book are satirical. The movie takes it a little more over the top. I know this is a sci-fi classic but i thought i was to preachy to read through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry for Heinlein","review":"I am a Heinlein fan. Stranger in a Strange Land, Friday, and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress I have all loved and read more than once. Actually, Stranger is my favorite book of all time. Be that as it may, I was shocked at how dry and shallow I found this book. No real characters, only names. No depth to the story, just an interstellar space war. It would have made a great comic book, I guess. 2 stars instead of one because I've read worse (it could have been boring and not just flat and lost.) Please, read everything else you can by Heinlein, but let this one go."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I thought it was going to be...","review":"I checked out these reviews before buying and reading Robert Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers.\\" I was looking forward to a good read. Boy was I in for a surprise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic, boring, overrated.","review":"This isn't a novel so much as a collection of pedantic, \\"philosophical\\", ramblings on war and government that are either (at best) truisms which would only be insightful to a child who has never done much thinking or (at worst) illogical or pointless proclamations.One of the most overrated books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I was expecting something completely different, and no, I wasn't expecting something along the lines of the movie. I'm a big scifi fan, but I don't really consider this scifi. Sure, there are space ships and marines killing bugs, but in the end. It's just a long justification for war. Mind you, I'm not anti-war, and I did enjoy some of the battle scenes, but I felt like this book was 1 long lecture. The ideas they presented were ok, and cleverly thought out ( I especially liked the speech about Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happyness), but lecture it was, and not scifi in my book. I'm moving on to Stranger in a strange land, and I'm liking it much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a Classic","review":"I must agree with a recent review - not at all what I thought it would be, especially after watching the trailers for the movie. And agree with another - it is like a lecture, as if Heinlein was afraid we wouldn't get it. He certainly was afraid we would get distracted if there were too much action or too much technobabble. Make me feel something, make me care, make me hate, but most important of all - make me figure it out on my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old classic, but slow","review":"This book was, no doubt, great in its time. By modern standards it is extremely slow. There is very little action, most of the book is a lot of preachy lectures (literally lectures from profs) telling us political background and theory. It was original and unique in its day, no doubt. But now, although the tech holds up in spots, it is quite dull to actually read. I'm not sure why people always rate books a couple of bonus stars for being old, but this seems to be the case here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starship Troopers","review":"I was excited to jump into Starship Troopers after reading Sirens of Titan, another book nominated for the best science fiction written in 1959, expecting something of even higher quality with ST winning that prize. With only 40 pages left I have found myself struggling to finish this extremely technical and dry book.My recommendation is to not read this book if you were a big fan of the movie as it bares little resemblance to what I have read. The bugs are not mentioned much and a lot of the story revolves around the details of daily military life. Very disappointed with this novel expecting a rousing combat tale and left with a boring and slow moving story that does not make a lot of sense. BTW I am not here just to bash this book, I read a lot and know a good book from a bad one, just here to warn anyone who may have been mislead by what they should expect. There is little in this book that is memorable or exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old-time Views In a Future Utopia","review":"Heinlein's STARSHIP TROOPERS is a very entertaining book that explores the possibilities of an almost utopian future society that integrates much old-type morality and punishments into a society of equality for all. While it is centered more on the philosophy of morality than action, it still manages to inject the suspense and excitement of an action book. It is a clean, fun book to read for young teens and adults alike, though it is a bit too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hope for the future","review":"Those who dismiss this book as \\"right-wing facsism\\" probably took one look at the book and labeled it as that. They did not look deeper into the meat of the book. They would have found a world that glorifies duty, honor, responsibility, and personal integrity. Every time I read the papers and see the Secretary of the Army lowering the standards of enlistment because some minorities can't get in, or the UC system considering dropping SAT scores as an entrance requirment, I wish to myself that I could live in the world of Juan Rico."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so arguably the best Sci-Fi novel ever written","review":"1) READ THIS BOOK 2) Skip the movie. It does not feature the use of Power Armor, a key component in the warfighting capability of the Mobile Infantry in the book. Without it, there is no \\"Mobile\\". 3) Possible the most misunderstood (or simply misread) sci-fi novel ever written. Read it and THINK. I find it amusing that it has offended idiots on all sides of the political spectrum (\\"Heinlein's a Fascist! No, he's a Communist! No, a Libertarian! No, a Liberal, a Right wing-nut...\\") What counts is that he was one of the finest authors the U.S. ever produced. 4) I envy those of you about to read this book for the first time. It forever changed my way of looking at the world, as it has done for many others. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life","review":"No fooling. It changed my life.I was introduced to the wonderful writings of Robert Heinlein at the age of 16 by a buddy at military school who suggested this book to me. It's hardcore conservative politics and disregard of the 'pseudo-sciences' of sociology and pop-psychology changed me from being a wanna-be hippie to a free-thinking man.The story it's self is entertaining (please do not confuse this with the movie of the same name. The similarities end there, no mater how much they robbed from this fantastic book). It's quite amazing to follow young Juan Rico as we watch him grow from spoiled high school senior to 2nd lieutenant. The real joy, however, is Heinlein's explanations of why conservatism works.I recommend this book to anyone of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like the movie","review":"Scary, not the story, but the predictions within the story. Heinlein wrote this book in the 50's yet alot of the things he says will happen in the 20th century do happen. This book is a must if you are into politics, and it is a must if you are into future societies. Highly suggested."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"A moral and philosophical novel as well as a good yarn. Those of you who just saw the movie missed 80% of the book. This was a replacement for the one I bought in the 60's and lost in a move; a reread today is just as fresh as the first read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fire the moron is who wrote the Amazon review of this book!","review":"How dare this person presume to decide for us what should or should not be used by the reader as a political manifesto !!!The reviewer's arrogance is typical of socialist \\"thought police\\" who propagate, and try to enforce, \\"political correctness\\"!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book with a thought provoking view of the military","review":"True Heinlein fans are going to hate the movie. The book shows a society that has found an interesting method of weeding out the irresponsible from full citizenship. Only those who have served a term in government service have the right to vote or serve in public office. A lot of people assume this to be a facist society (The ridiculous movie helps this belief) But in fact the society Heinlein depicts has more personal freedom than our own. Government service is made as hard as possible so only the truly committed can get through a term. Rico the young hero enlists for obscure reasons even he does not understand and winds up in a war. Through his service he learns more about himself and responsibility than he ever thought possible. I really wish the people who made the movie would have read the book first. There was a lot of potential there. The movie resembles the book in name only."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, a must read for those who like to think! : )","review":"Although many people seem to have bad opinions of this book, I myself found it very enjoyable. This book, along with providing an entertaining story about the life of a young soldier, provokes readers to think about their morals, politics, and beliefs. Heinlein's views may not all be right or agreeable, but they do raise interesting points. If you like SF and enjoy books that don't just cater to the stereotypes, get this one.

Over the years, from time to time, I have read the book again. So I decided to get the Book on CD and listen to it on a road trip. Big Mistake. This reader book requires a gung ho reader, not the wimpy reader they selected. Save your money and stick to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for all","review":"This book is classified as \\"science fiction\\". I like to think of it as a primer on moral behavior, a manual for humane conduct, and a thought provoking examination of life. Forget the movie, forget that it's \\"science fiction\\" - READ it."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to define a Citizen","review":"Seconding other reviewers, I had to disassociate the movie of the same title before I was able to enjoy this book on its own merits. The \\"bug war\\" offers Heinlein a backdrop to showcase his political and sociological beliefs, many of which would be well employed in the current state of corrupt and lawless politicians. In his reality only those who have proved themselves in the military, learning to set the human race over the individual, are allow to run for office or vote. Johnny Rico, the main character, learns how to be a part of a greater whole and flourish during his years of military training and deployment. Although the prose can be flat, Heinlein's teachers of \\"History and Moral Philosophy\\" espouse some interesting theories. An excellent read for anyone interested or considering the military as a career choice, Heinlein does not shy away from the brutality of training, but always reminds us why it is necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining story.....thought provoking commentary.","review":"This book, written in 1959 in Cold War America, follows young Juan Rico during his military service in the Mobile Infantry of the Terran Federation. RAH uses the evolution of Rico from spoiled rich kid to responsible soldier as a backdrop for musings on society and government. In this society of the future,the right to vote is granted only to those who have served a three year (or more) hitch in the service of the government. RAH uses the lectures of Mr. Dubois and the Officer Candidate School instructor to emphasize the old issue of rights vs. responsibility. Although I don't consider the book fascist, as some readers do, I can see why it was considered radical. Calling for a restricting of suffrage goes against our democratic sensibilities, but it's an intriguing idea nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HAD to put this book down!","review":"After watching the movie, I was expecting much better from the book. Instead I got a slow-moving book mostly about the thoughts of Johnny Rico, instead of the war he was fighting. I did find the suits the Terran Marines wore interesting (including their absence from the movie), but the book just couldn't keep my interest. I had to FORCE myself to read this book to its end. If you like the action of the movie, do NOT read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heilein at his goose-stepping, paternalistic worst","review":"Heilein wrote some pretty good SF, however he also wrote a lotof trash. RAH was probably at his best in short-fiction (as can besaid about most of SF), and there are many SF gems to be found among those works. The worst element of his writing is at the fore in this book, Heilein standing on his soapbox and beating the reader over the head with his simplistic politics. It's no wonder that this book has appeal with its simple solutions to complex problems (a hallmark of RAH's work), especially at a time when the pendulum has swung well over to the right. The question is; would this book even be remembered, let alone held in such high regard by many, if it wasn't written in the genre of SF. I strongly doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon!","review":"I read this book in 1977 and 20 years later I am stillwondering where all the \\"action\\" is in this book everyone is talkingabout.

One of the few books I have ever thrown away in disgust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not meant to be a movie","review":"Geeze...First of all if you paid good money to watch that abominable movie and liked it, you will most likely get nothing at all from this novel. Starship Troopers is not an action/adventure movie. It is not a story about a Fascist society nor is it a political manifesto. Starship Troopers is an examination of military ethics (easy pacifists), motivation, and leadership. Most people with some military experience and a solid high school education will get this immediately. Many without a military background who possess a solid high school education and an open mind will also get it. If you come up short on either of those, keep re-reading until you do get it. I was once assigned with someone in the USAF who read it, didn't get it, and referred to it as \\"rightist drivel\\" but then he wasn't much of an Airman anyway..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Book, Forget the Movie!","review":"Starship Troopers may be the best science fiction piece ever published. Too bad the idiots at Hollywood couldn't take the time to read the book and follow Heinlein's genius. The first chapter is an adrenalin-packed air(space)borne operation that starts with troopers jumping into a hostile planet through the atmosphere, laying waste to a major metropolis (with an arsenal ranging from guns to nukes), and rallying to come back to the mother ship. Just one of these guys would dessimate an entire ship of the movie wimps. Following the raid, Heinlein manages to incorporate an outstanding story line with some deep meditations on society, citizenship, service to the nation, and the root of violence. Read it when you are in junior high for the rush, in college for the deeper meanings, and as an adult for some true inspiration. I've read my copy about five times and its still one of my favorites. No wonder its required reading at the military academies..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"An excellent story!

I have read it at least 10 times since. I managed to get my sons to read it and my wife. Why? This is Heinlein at his best. Here is solid SF woven with thought-provoking ideas. Do I agree with the Master? Sometimes! but I find him more interesting every year as the world unfolds more in the vein of his ideas than ever. I have taught History of Personal Moral Philosphy. This is one of the texts. A must read for anyone willing to challenge their beliefs or anyone in for a great read. Science fiction at its best.

Verhoeven took a military tract verging on religious zealotry and turned it on its head, using its very words to put the lie to Heinlien's ideas and ideals. Verhoeven's cutting parody of military propaganda makes Heinlein's treatise look flat-footed and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR THE LOVE OF SPEACHES AND TRAINING","review":"OUCH!

Kind of scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heinlein's black sheep classic","review":"Starship Troopers is one of those books that you have to read over and over to fully get everything that goes on in it.

Mostly Heinlein waxing philosophical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical political messages, but more juvinile","review":"I read this book twice in my life.This book was typical in the Heinlein political and social messages.

But it is a classic for its kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a perfect book, but highly interesting nonetheless!","review":"I never really got to like Johnny Rico very much, but his story is certainly an interesting one. The constant flashbacks from his days as a fighting M.I. trooper to his high school memories to his boot-camp training days keep this novel moving at a fast pace. Johnny always seems to be at the low end of the totem pole, just barely surviving to advance to the next level. But he's still a bit smug at times, and I just never felt much sympathy for him. And while I don't necessarily disagree with Heinlein's political views, I got tired of his trying to bring in every single geographical group of people on the planet into the military. It smacked of those modern, politically correct Saturday morning cartoons, where every little group of kids has a representative of every race & religion among them. In the same fashion, Johnny's unit is made up of people from every single country on the planet. It just seems too contrived to be real."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This is one of the classics of sci-fi. Some of the moralizing Heinlen does can be disturbing, but you have to remember when it was written and Heinlen's background-- he's a graduate of the Naval Academy. Also, the movie went way too far in trying to draw analogies to the Nazis. And of course, dropping the power suits! Might want to check out some other sci-fi books-- Area 51 series by Doherty who is a West Pointer-- interesting checking his views in his books against Heinlen's; The Time Patrol is neat; Dune, of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, and not just for the action","review":"I read this book and really liked it. When the movie came out I naturally watched it, knowing that it would be nothing like the book. However, the movie was even worse than I expected.

Starship Troopers is by far the worst book I have ever read. It is just the constant and incessant rambling -lectures in school, lectures in the academy- of one guy who enters the military in order to become a citizen. How did Verhoeven came up with the script, characters, action and so on, for Starship Troopers Movie? Beats me, it was certainly not this book. If what you liked about the movie was the action packed scenes, stay away from this book (you will only find 3 maybe 4 medium to none action pages in the whole book).I really wanted to get to know the Starship Trooper's characters more, also thought that, almost every time, the book is far better than the movie... this wasn't the case.

(ofcourse this is my opinion; who have read this book and liked ofcourse have their point of view)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Supports beating people (abuse) to \\"teach\\" them better","review":"I liked the movie, so I decided to read the book. It was far different. I found that Heinlein was a very nasty person who writes in a mean, nasty, boring style. When I got to the part where he advocated beating soldiers during training, I had enough. Japanese soldiers in WW2 were beaten a lot in their training, and they were by far the most vicious, sadistic soldiers in WW2, committing many atrocities, rapes, and murders of innocent people and babies. I think Heinlein was an idiot and won't be reading any more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book it is not like the movie","review":"The book and the movie of Starship Troopers share very little, save the name, in common.The movie offers very, very, very little of the rich detail and thought behind this book. The only real \\"action\\" is in the very first part of this rather short book. Although it may not be \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" or \\"Aria Kalsan\\" it has a lot to offer. The rest of the book is a discourse on the nature of citizenship, among other virtues.If you are expecting a bug hunt, look elsewhere. But if you enjoy thinking about and reading different viewpoints then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it - Read \\"Forever War\\" or \\"Ender's Game\\" Instead","review":"I'm a big Heinlein fan but this one was for the dogs - poorly written, with no redeeming values. It's as if Heinlein was able to get away with publishing his first draft. For a FAR BETTER written novels on the same topic, read \\"Forever War\\", or even better, \\"Ender's Game\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable book!,A prescription for healthy society ?","review":"The basic premise of the book, that Military service is the highest moral attitude, is quite acceptable. The sketch of a cadet's impression of military Training, is superbly done, with a careful interweaving of the philosophical foundation. The book can even be set in today's time, and could be called contemporary fiction. a must read for everyone worried about today's tattered social fabric. It is also a gripping story with racy narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starship Troopers is study in philosophy","review":"Although many people may now associate the book with the \\"comic-book\\" movie that shares its title, the actual novel deals more with the philisophical questions which many professional soldiers struggle with from time to time.The questions are: \\"Why must recruit training be so hard?, What keeps units functioning in battle?,and; What are the qualities of a good leader?\\"The story is broken into parts which attempt to answer these questions, by changing the environment Jonny Rico finds himself in,for example from civillian to recruit and \\"confirmation\\" by a test of fire, usually a battle.You may not like the answers Heinlein came up with, or his observations about how a moral society should be structured (by having citizens earn their rights through service, not entitlement), but you will be left thinking for a long time after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morale Debates that cannot be put aside","review":"After seeing the movie, I expected the book to be just as violent, and to only about violence, but what I saw in that book has forever changed my life. Heinlein's theroies about the government, the military, punishments, religion, and almost all aspects of life are certainly something that is worth looking into, and if our government was run that way, all of our problems would be solved. This no non-sense book reminds me that there people in this world who still believe in a world government, which brings peace by violence. There is also a great deal of action for the thrill-seekers, but the action is quite real, and is nothing like rambo and his \\"one man kills all \\" figure. This book is a must read for anybody that is thinking about joining the service, is in the service, or is a verteran. We could all benifit from his ideas. IN MY OPINION THIS IS ONE OF HEINLEIN'S GREATEST WORKS, AND MAYBE EVEN ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS IN THE WORLD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanted more action","review":"I read this many years ago and decided to re-read on my kindle. If you watched the movie, you will be surprised at how much was changed. They did that for a reason, which is that the book is 80% talk and 20% action, which would have made a boring movie. Instead, they made a stupid movie, not at all true to Heinlein's ook.That said, the book is a fun read, but it could have been so much better. Most of what we are told in the talk scenes could have come through in action scenes as well. The war ends up being a subplot to the ethical and political message, not the medium through which we are taught.Heinlein is a great writer, no doubt, but read The Forever War if you want an SF war story, or read early Clarke like Rendevous with Rama, or 2001 to see how the message and the story can be merged. Even Ender's Game makes us think more without preaching at us.Still, a book worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't confuse me with the movie.","review":"Ok. The movie (one of my favorite B movies) was horribly awesome. The book is much much different and well worth a good read. Above average - I'd give it a B to a B+."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb read!","review":"Robert Heinlein's Hugo Award winning \\"Starship Troopers\\" should be on everyone SciFi reading list. This book is a social commentary delivered in a fun and engaging story. For those hesitant to read this book due to the shortcomings of the movie...don't worry. The movie is an anemic and superficial substitute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Citizen Soldier","review":"I must agree with Robert Aarhus on his thought provoking statement in his review. The ideal of Honor is scoffed and laughed at by most of todays elitist society. Heinleins treatise put forth in this book is a view that should be pondered by anyone seeking insight into the problems that the U.S. faces. Love of country, and especially LOVE OF COUNTRYMEN was displayed with the highest honor by a diverse group of people on an airliner over Pennsylvania in September 2001. We can all take a lesson from that action. Honor, courage, and selflessness are key ingredients to strengthening this nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was better","review":"Hard to believe when the movie is generally considered to be campy garbage with a cult following and the book is a sci-fi \\"must-read\\" but that's how I felt. I don't love the movie but I liked the general idea and was hoping for a more polished story-telling of the key elements of the goofy film. What you get is something much different. There is actually only one encounter with the aliens and it's pretty uneventful. Most of the book is made up of lengthy descriptions of their equipment, troop movements or the details on the inner-workings of the military including lengthy philosophical debates in the form of flashbacks of the hero having discussions with his old high school teacher. It's very dry. It's very boring and I'm glad no one every attempted to make a film true to the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor attempt at classic Sci Fi","review":"I'm afraid this book is a poor attempt at a sci fi classic. John Steakly's \\"Armor\\" is the real deal.

I was dissapointed. Heinlien seems to preach throughtout the book of this \\"wonderful\\" new nation in which military and brutality is held above all. I got a little sick of Johnnie's one-armed teacher ranting and raving about the weaknesses of the 20th century democracies \\"a department of defense never won a war\\" and the harsh treatment of military offenders. And there was little character realism. Nearly every line of dialogue dated the book, I found myself imagining characters from 50's sitcoms as the book's characters. Anyway, this is as ok book if you're looking for something different. If you like philosophical looks at people fighting insects, try Ender's Game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"One of the best Sci-fi novels of war ever made.

His comparisons to the game of baseball are brilliant. For instance: every year, at the beginning of each season, even Major League players go to spring training, where they are schooled--again--on the fundamentals of the game, and they get in shape. Similarly, sales people--from \\"rookies\\" to veterans--also need the same things. I know that the technique is very effective.

Only a few of the houses even mention the square footage and none have information about costs. This was VERY disappointing, as it seemed to be the whole point of the book. I also have to question the position of \\"on a budget\\" one house, for instance, has an exterior that is clad in raw steel. There is no mention, of course, in what this actually cost, but it would seem not be a \\"budget-friendly\\" approach. The discussion of \\"Keeping costs down\\" for each house is a short paragraph, often two sentences. The wood framing has already been mentioned by a reviewer, another favorite of mine is the ability to open the windows allowing \\"temperate ocean breezes\\" to eliminate the need for air-conditioning.

Second, the sattelite speakers can only swivel about less than 180 degrees on the same side - that is, if you want to mount them on the wall, you can't get the angle that you wanted especially on the right (front and rear) speakers. They should have the right (front and rear) speakers swivel on different direction as the left (front and rear) speakers. Thirdly, a \\"wired\\" remote control - which is quite inconvinient to have especially if you are watching tv and wanted to adjust the volume.

He was last seen as Scorponok, the Terrorcon Supreme Commander in Energon. But now he is back in the Cybertron line as a \\"zombie\\" of his former self, complete with an Animatros, the jungle planet, Cyber Key.While the colors might be a bit jarring in on-line photos, the figure itself is quite nice in person. The \\"baby blue\\" isn't as obnoxious as the online pics make it out to be. And the other colors (Black, Dark Grey, Gold, and the tranlucent Red of the clear\\"Energon parts\\"), blend together nicely. Many long time Transformer fans will understand the significance of this recolor. Also included is a remolded scorpion tail/cockpit with Cyber Key feature that activates the tail/cockpit's cannons and sounds.Dark Scorponok, very good recolor and nice addition to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S DARK SCORPONOK FOR THE LOVE OF PETE!!!!!!!!!","review":"This so-called \\"Ultra R01\\" has gotta stop.

It was shown in a quaint little screening room at Raleigh Studios to an audience of about 30 people. I had no idea what the movie was about but I enjoy free screenings. 90-some-odd minutes later I'm surprised I didn't gouge my eyes out in protest to this horrible, god-awful excuse of a movie. It had no plot, flat, urelatable characters and gratuitous nudity and violence that was unsettling (a kid lights a cow on fire for no reason!). And I like violence and nudity in films! I'm particularly fond of the horror genre but its place in this movie was unfounded. Everyone in the movie is drugged out and sleeping with each other. There's no real conflict, no redeeming characters. For the life of me I can't believe someone invested money in this film and I'm even more astonished it got a DVD release.My advice is stay far away from this \\"film\\" at all costs. I only wish I could get those 90 minutes of my life back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Famous Murder Cases of the Great Pathologist","review":"Observations such as the ones depicted in this book were the stuff of daily routine for Bernard Spilsbury, the man who dominated the field of criminal pathology in Britain for nearly half a century. This official biography is both an absorbing record of some of the most gruesome of the twentieth-century killings, and a fascinating insight into the psychology of a man whose metier was murder.Written with full access to his official and personal papers, this detailed study of Spilsbury the man, and Spilsbury the pathologist, must rank among the most important and valuable works on the most macabre side of crime.No one man has done more to further the prestige of forensic medicine and its application to law in the criminal courts.But such was his life, living with the horrors and tragedies of others, that he became a man obsessed with his own unhappiness: in December 1947 he took his own life."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"The description of this tool should be changed and made clearer.

This recording retains some of the energy Mason Proffit was well known for without a lot of studio gimmickry. This played to the group's strengths as back in their day they often upstaged the better known acts they would open for. Rife with the idealism and passion of the day, it is a treat to hear John Michael Talbot's yeoman work on the pedal steel. He is now a world famous Franciscun Monk with influence over people from the Pope to the President. Terry Talbot's rare talent as front man exudes his heartfelt concerns over any professional ambitions. Love songs would have certainly carried them further up the charts. Bassist Tim Ayers and Drummer Art Nash gave this band a seminal place in the fusion of Country, Rock and Jazz laying the groundwork for much of what is happening in popular music today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After having been a big fan of the Come & Gone double album for years (I have both the vinyl and the CD) and having heard great things about this album, I was disappointed when I finally heard it. It has none of the strong song writing, deep and politically provoking lyrics, original and heart-felt melodies of Come & Gone. Instead it sounds like a band that had fallen apart and run out of ideas. There's almost a thrown together feel about it, as if they were in a hurry to get the album out of the way just to fulfill a recording contract. If you are new to Mason Proffit, avoid this and pick up Come & Gone to hear some of the best country rock ever recorded, not to mention some of the best song writing ever.

It's filled with way too many quizes and testimonials, that you find yourself thumbing through the book to find some substance.

It's a riveting and unforgettable experience that will CHANGE your perception of rock and roll. I have several friends who were into Led Zeppelin, but when I had them listen to this CD, they started listening to Duran Duran.

I have been, am and always will be a diehard Duranie. I've loved the guys since 1982 and would never say a bad word against them; so I am sure you are wondering about my title for this review and why I only gave it 1 star. Well... this is NOT a live album. What it is, is Capitol's sorry excuse for a sampling of Duran Duran's \\"Sing Blue Silver\\" 1984 Tour. If you want the REAL version of this tour on CD, hunt down the 2 CD import \\"Two For The Show\\". Despite the \\"Notorious\\"esque cover, this is the 1984 Tour on CD and it is brilliant. The closing track \\"Girls On Film' is pure heaven for a Duranie. Also, with the exception of \\"Crime And Passion\\" and \\"(I'm Looking For)Cracks In The Pavement\\", the entire show is on these two discs. So, in closing, the one star I gave to \\"Arena\\" is for Simon's singing and their \\"Wild Boys\\" track; otherwise, this is a poor excuse for a live album... shame on you Capitol Records"},{"rating":"1","title":"If You're Gonna Make a 'Live Album', It Better Be Good","review":"I like Duran Duran.

Yes, studio albums are much much better (RIO to tell one!) and it's a shame audience is not \\"alive\\" in this recording, but it's indeed a good recording that sum up Duran style at that time (they were at the top after Wild Boys release).If you never heard any song of the boys let's start with RIO otherwise this live cd is a good starting point!!!!!!!!!And they are back now!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"... this is a live show?!?!?!","review":"The following review of \\"Arena\\" by Duran Duran will add some corrections to my review as well as correct Annie from Philadelphia. First of all, despite how you argued in your review, this is NOT a live show. You cannot hear the interaction between Simon and the audience (like you can on \\"Two For The Show\\"). This IS Capitol's sorry excuse for a live album. Also, despite what I documented in my original review, Capitol left off more songs than the two I had mentioned; besides \\"Of Crime And Passion\\" and \\"(I'm Looking For) Cracks In The Pavement\\", two more songs, \\"Friends Of Mine\\" and \\"My Own Way\\" were also excluded from this so-called \\"live\\" recording.

In the past, live albums were pretty much worthless and were released just to fulfill the terms of a record contract. But \\"Arena\\" is a different story. Duran Duran give touching live concert performances of many of their hits like \\"Is There Something I Should Know,\\" \\"New Religion,\\" and a [worthless] version of \\"Careless Memories,\\" which just makes me go wild! These guys really rock and lead the pack when it comes to putting out a great live show that doesn't cheat the audience. Duran Duran are legends and I love them and this CD is a total MUST OWN.

I bought it twenty years ago and I recently purchased the remaster. I have always loved \\"Arena\\" for several reasons. For one, Simon's voice sounds awesome live. Two, it is always nice to hear your favorites songs slightly different than the way they sound on the studio albums. My absolute favorite song on the album is \\"Careless Memories,\\" I love this song live. The addition of \\"Rio\\" and \\"Girls on Film\\" really make this set complete. I always wondered why they would include lesser known songs like \\"The Chauffeur\\" and \\"The Seventh Stranger\\" on this set vs. more popular songs, now we have them all. It's just a great album to listen to when driving too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster Live Album from Duran Duran.","review":"In the classic sense, this is a very mediocre live album by Duran Duran. Many fans get irked by that statement, but it's the sad and honest truth. In 1984, when Duran Duran peaked in popularity, Capitol dropped this record instead of a studio LP to capitalize on the band's popularity. While the material here isn't terrible, performances of \\"New Religion,\\" \\"Is There Something I Should Know,\\" and \\"Union of the Snake\\" come across as perfunctory at best. Simon LeBon sings off-key one time too many, and the band members Nick Rhodes, John Taylor, Roger Taylor, and Andy Taylor perform with a clean efficency that strips the performances of any spontaneity. The only half-worthwhile track is a song that isn't even live: the killer studio cut \\"Wild Boys,\\" which went to Number Two in the fall/winter of 1984. Take it from a fan of this group: skip \\"Arena\\" and leave it for the diehards and completists. Duran Duran's studio albums are way better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Duran's Worst.","review":"First of all I want to say that I got all the duran albums and singles.

The alap is vintage Vilayat with all the note permutations and dynamic intricacies. As usual, Vilayat gives us a taste of his charisma with some talking and singing; basically attesting to the genuiness of his gayaki ang. The gat composition in teental is pleasant but lacks an antara (second line) and does not really do justice to the Vilayat Khan we heard in the fifties and sixties. He is a much older man now (in his seventies), and although he does not have the speed and clarity of those early years, he still succeeds in carrying the listener away on the path of his musical fantasy. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music but wrong Raga in the title","review":"The album contains excellent vintage music from Ustads Vilayat, Imrat and Bismillah Khan with superb percussion support from Pt.

It's the first film I've ever seen Sam Neil perform in and he is a superb and conflicted villain. The acting is flawless throughout, and the action/adventure scenes are unrivaled.

In this movie we have the thieves of the forestin Robin Hood backing King Richard the Lion Hearted.The tournaments of Knights were a sport not unlike American Football or Roman gladiators as a popular spectacle that killed and injured many.Justice of trial by combat was still the law of the land, so that ahiring of tournament champions was much like getting a good team of lawyers in the current American system.I enjoyed the movie almost as much as I did the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, Boring, Disappointing","review":"This version of Ivanhoe is flat and boring. The love between Rowena and Ivanhoe is barely mentioned, in fact Anthony Andrews flat character rarely shows up in the film.The movie has been politicized...apparently the writers were more concerned with using the characters of Isaac and Rebecca to portray jews as superior and Christians asinferior and barbaric (this theme appears many times throughout the movie) than making a good film.The Robert Taylor version of this movie is MUCH better if what you want is a good swashbuckling yarn true to Sir Walter Scott's original Ivanhoe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Sir Walter","review":"Hard to know why this got so many good ratings, it is really awful. The only good thing are the jousts, which are fun. Everyone else overacts, and the whole thing is totally implausible. Antony Andrews is a cold fish, and Lysette Anthony is absurd, a painted doll with bad hair. Of course the main fault is with Sir Walter Scott, the whole plot is such a crazy quilt. James Mason and Olivia Hussey (So that's what happened to her) with ridiculous accents.It is hard to say this, but the Robert Taylor version is better. Of course Elizabeth Taylor was the most beautiful Jewess in history.Somebody, someday may point out to someone that synthetic colours were invented in the 19th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so adaption","review":"I read the novel Ivanhoe several times as an adult and i horoughly enjoy each time i pick it up to read it. so, I bought this film from a video store thiking it would be faithful to the book. But, the first part of the book is missing. for example, in the novel, there is a tense dinner scene in which Sir Brian and a monk of the catholic church mak their way to the house of cedric. It is here that we find out that ivanhoe is back from the crusades, but is in full desguise and the lady rowena is betrothed to a saxon lord. It is here, too, the sir brisn is attrzcted to rowena. and there are a few other details tha are missing from the novel that should have made it into ther film. But, it is still entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed!","review":"The title for this collection \\"Platinum Collection-Spanish Version\\" is a misrepresentation. It is not even a \\"half-truth,\\" more like a \\"one-third truth.\\"Of the three CDs in the set, only the first CD contains songs sung inSpanish. The songs in the other two CDs are sung in French. I ordered this set because I thought I could finally get a complete set of his songs sung in Spanish. This is not it. The first CD is a recompilation of songs sung in Spanish that are readily available in various compilations as a single CD--at a much cheaper cost.Part of the problem for the unwary buyer is that the information for this set did not, and still does not, set forth the tracks on each CD so there was no way of knowing that two-thirds of the recordings were in French."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utter genius","review":"This book, or should I say, work of sublime genius is necessary reading for any one concerned, worried, excited, turned-on, bored by the events of this age.

A must read for any serious human."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Presencia\\" - Justo Betancourt y su Conjunto Borincuba","review":"Many people just associate Justo Betancourt with his great music. What many people don't see about Justo is that he was a great artist with a deep sense of creativity. You come to see it when you hear \\"Presencia\\", the title track. Later, he'll make you dance to a nice merengue, \\"Merengue a Quisqueya\\", and the hard-hitting \\"Ella Esta en Otra Rumba\\", one of my favorites. He'll then make you laugh with the slowed-down \\"Camaron\\" and \\"La Tapa al Pomo\\". I must say though that Justo Betancourt experiments with new rhythms and comes out awkwardly and falls short on \\"La Ilusion de La Vida\\", a song that should've been kept a bolero. Yet, one will be completely satisfied when they hear the deep, soul-penetrating lyrics of the boleros \\"Sicologia\\" and \\"Consejo del Alma\\". A nice, well- rounded album, recommended for 70's salsa lovers and Justo Betancourt and Borincuba fans alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"i didn,t receive this item yet please refund my money back","review":"hello ,custmer service, This item i didn,t receive yet .i already contact ups they said contact shipper . please help me to refund.thanks ,thomas varughese"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as discribed","review":"The item that I recieved was not a flat bed tow truck w/race car, It was a semi tractor trailer w/ 1 ATV on it and there was a place for another but was missing.

It was more of a blue, than bright white. I was told by JBJ that the bulb needed a burn-in period before it turned bright white, but I returned the Viper after a few days.I thought it was a great concept, but I can't recommend it because of the clamp and stock lamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haggard is like no other movie ive seen","review":"Bam is a great film maker. these guys are funny in everything they do. make sure you watch the documentary and making of after the movie. also has one of the best soundtracks ive ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED","review":"This movie is so overrated by everybody! It feels like everybody likes it cause it is the cky-guys in it. I mean what's so good about it? They're really bad actors and manuscript isn't that good either!

Bam as always was brilliant and has proven himself once again as an extrodinary talent in whatever he chooses to do. Raab and Brandon are true comedians and they made me laugh throughout the entire movie. Ryan was great because believe it or not the CKY/Jackass guys can act! The cameos were awesome and the music off the hook. I suggest this movie to anyone who loves comedy and doesn't mind a few swears or nudity here and there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haggard","review":"I am a big fan of all of the CKY films, they are great. Then they decided to make this movie with a plot unlike the others. It is by far the funniest movie they have made. This is one of them movies where each time you watch it you pick up something else thats funny. I have bought this movie like 4 times because my friends keep stealing them!

Watching Raab and Bran in action is like a farm birth in outerspace. The acting is extra ordinary. Don Vito is a God in his own time. This movie has a story so compelling that it compels you. I remember a time when casual sex amongst teens was a every minute occasion, then i viewed this, film and realized I had left my cupcakes in the oven for way to long, disaster my, friends. Enjoy the wonderous fragrance of this dvd and yell at the top of your lungs \\"Republic,Republic!\\" or have a random staring contest with a complete stranger.

An actual movie unlike viva la bam or cky. Its about this guy named Ry(Ryan Dunn), whos girlfriend(Jenn Rivell) breaks up with him, so hes depressed, and shes with this new guy named Steven( Rake Yohn), but rys buddies help him, by showing him that she was no good. Very good, and entertaining. Bam Margera also wrote/ directed this film, and did a pretty good job of it. Buy it, and trust me its much better than viva la bam, plus its uncut, i hope theres a sequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gnar Kill Rules","review":"One of the funiest movies I've seen in a long time , and not just because I am a fan of CKY. Brandon Dicamillo is outstanding , possibly one of the strangest and funniest people I've ever seen. Check out his Chinese freestyle rap on the bonus features. Easily one of the funniest things on the DVD. Raab himself......well , what can I say? Hysterical. Bam , Ryan Don Vito and even Phil , what more can you ask for? Check out the behind the scenes. The true story of Ryan Dunn."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most hilarious films I have ever seen","review":"Simply stated, Haggard is one of best (if not THE best) comedies I have ever seen in my life. This is a DVD that comes with us on every out of town band gig and family vacation. Every person I have shown this movie to has been left to near pants pissing hysterics.My husband and I met Cky after a show in Ft. Lauderdale, FL and the only thing my husband said to Derron (vocals) was: \\"Dude, I love what you did in Haggard\\". Derron looked confused but obviously was amused by the comment.Whether you are into the Jackass scene or Bam Margera makes no difference. Haggard is a stand alone movie that needs no Cky references to be known before seeing it.HILARIOUS!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"<3","review":"Definitely a MUST BUY for fans of Bam and his crew. SO funny, shows Ryan Dunn in his prime. He's such a great actor and everyone else in the film is hilarious. (Only downside to the movie is that alot of inbetween scene clips are filled with Bam skating and HIM's music video. But ofcourse if you love him and watching Bam skate then this is perfect for you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haggard is Ridiculous","review":"Haggard is probably the weirdest movie I have ever seen. It was so random, but it had everyone in it so it was amazing. I miss Ryan Dunn. I think anyone who is a Dunn, Bam, or any other Jackass fan should watch this movie. It does have some great quotes that my friend and I randomly say to each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow...","review":"i watched this again tonight and man, this movie is nothing but hilarious. i wish Don Vito could be in more movies, but because of his legal issues, he cannot. if i am right, this was his last movie. however, he is in Bam's Unholy Union for only two seconds in the back row of the wedding. to me, that counts. all of i have left to watch is Minghags, then i have seen everything pertaining to Bam and friends. if anybody is a Bam and his friends fan, watch this. RIP Ryan Dunn, you are missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Are Not Actors!!","review":"Let me start by saying that I love CKY and Jackass. Bam is a personal hero and his troop always cracks me up, but I didn't laugh at all watching this movie. I watched it twice and never laughed once. The acting is very weak! It feels like CKY wihtout any of the spontaneous creativity. It's not unbearable to watch, but it was way below my expectations. I had total faith that the CKY group could make an awesome movie, but acting and screenwriting is tougher than it looks. The camera work is very impressive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie","review":"Funniest movie ive seen all summer, raab acting stupid the whole time with thta voice he makes is the best, music is good, brian dicamila is awesome n he makes the reverse microwave yo try n win a diamond bike, ryan dunn is funny he got stabbed i nthe yee with a fork, eileen is the coolest, hellboy's great. if u see any movie u want laugh from watch this movie and youll laugh non sotp no matter how many times you see it.. Later, Rock on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low brow juvenile and unfunny","review":"I watched this movie on the strength of other reviews that rated it highly. I should have read more closely and paid attention to the Jackass connection. If you like Jackass you'll probably like this but who likes Jackass except jackasses.The 'entertaining' bits include (...) the main character is stabbed in the eye with a fork and another hilarious piece has an unknown bit actor laughing histerically at absolutely nothing. If this sounds good to you then go for it and get the movie.On the other hand if this sounds like juvenile humour aimed at immature boys between 12 and 16 and you're not in that group then my advice is to avoid this movie and rent something that at least has entertainment value. This movie has no value at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy crap crap (crap)","review":"This Clerks-esk low budget film is, shall I say, crap. I love Bam and his CKY disks and Viva La Bam make me laugh so hard I have to pee. This movie was poorly acted (no surprise) but the crew are actually trying to act so it just seems dumb. DiCamillo was annoying as usual. The \\"plot\\" was boring and average. There are a few truly funny moments but not enough to warrent buying this DVD. Do yourself a favor and buy a CKY DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haggard","review":"I was really shocked at the content of this movie. It should be called \\"Prelude to Porn\\".

Yes, it's silly but what did you expect from the CKY crew? Ryan Dunn, Bam Margera, & Brandon Dicamillo's comedic genius.

I watch this movie every time I'm bummed out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Bam and his crew then this movie is for you","review":"This movie is pretty funny. If you like Bam and his crew you will love this movie. I love all of the characters. Rabb is sooooo funny. Dico is another favorite. Ryan is pathicticly funny. And Bam is just Bam. While the acting is not so great it doesn't matter, this are not perfessional actors. It is just a small indie film.The music is awesome. A ton of great HIM songs. The music is one of the best parts of the film. The music made this film totally worth while. Even if you don't watch this film, I highly recommend you check out HIM.This film can be quite rather gross. It should be expected from Bam and the CYK crew as they are not the most wholesome people. This film is not rated but if it were it would receive an \\"R\\" rating.There are several cameo apperances made in this film from Bam's parents to skateboarders. I love the one with Phil and the watermelon.Bottom line: if you are a Bam Margera/CKY fan you should watch this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style of jewelry","review":"I do NOT like this book at all - I think the designs are not attractive at all!

It is a warm, familiar scent without smelling like candy. I get compliments every day on it and people say \\"you smell great,\\" not \\"I like your perfume.\\" My other favorite is Thierry Mugler Angel, but I found it is wayyyy too strong for an airplane, so I wear that when I'm going out.

I fell in love with Harry and the way the whole movie portrays the myth. It's a great movie for children and adults alike. There's humor for all ages, plus, who doesn't love Harry?It's a wonderfully acted movie, it puts family movies that come out nowadays to shame. I honestly think this is one of Lithgowe's best performances ever even though it's a kids flick. It's perfect for kids though, even if Harry can be scary from time to time, he is easier to love and will most likely enthrall your child as the movie makes a point to show the soft side of Bigfoot.AWESOME movie, my favorite family movie of all time, and I am super excited to finally finally finally have this classic on DVD.

Obviously, the onlyreason it was published was because ofHideous's very short stay with the revival of the powerrock/punk band, The Misfits; the band name sells people, andthe book got published, it's as simple as that.Except for the journals Hideous kept while in the Misfits,when all was said and done, I didn't believe any of themudslinging (whether is was true or not) and Myke Hideousaccomplished nothing other then portraying himself as aangry, bitter, self-loathing, hateful person with nothing better to dowith his time but make a few bucks off another band's name, aband he barely knew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic","review":"I'm sure this book would be very scandalous if it weren't so stylistically painful to read. The author suffers from a very common problem that plagues many authors, he overcompensates the main character's confidence to the point of self-righteous arrogance. It's hard to take a pretentious protagonist seriously. The whole book reads like it was written as a creative writing assignment at a community college (which probably got a B-). I was no where near as offended by the subject matter as I was by the style. I threw it away so it wouldn't contaminate my other books with it's crappy writing. Hack work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I think the author and/or publishers, etc. tried to cover up how badly written this book was by playing up the taboo part of it -- of a man having a relationship with a boy.The writing was laughable, to me -- overly sappy descriptions and the use of too many simple adjectives, as if a thesaurus was constantly being consulted, making the words almost redundant. Also, it's just not interestingly written. I wasn't captivated by the characters or the storyline.I really wouldn't recommend spending money on this; if you're curiosity has to be satisfied, check your library. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition misses essential notes and comments","review":"Unfortunately, the Kindle edition of this important and interesting book does not link correctly to the editor's notes and comments.

I liked how she explained how there are so many different aspects to a fatal dog attack.One thing I thought was interesting is that 1 day old infants to 2 month old infants had a high number of fatal dog attacks.The only thing that could have been better were her data charts.

(3) There is no genuine acknowledgment that the Freudian thesis presupposed throughout has not been found credible. Freud had issues, and so does the author of this book.

I find this book to be a very helpful tool and guideline for praying specifically when certain situations arise.

I also love the scripture references that I can refer to when faced with difficult situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent: Wish Their Was An App Also!","review":"Love this book as a guide to pray scripturally for my kids.

She cites God's work in her life as a answer to her prayers, leading to the conclusion that if God is not answering your prayers, you must not be living up to His standard, actually asking, \\"Are you a candidate for God's blessing?\\" (Study guide, week 3 question 5). About 1/2 of my bible study is unchurched and the book is reaffirming all the reasons they have chose not to participate in organized religion.

I love her books, but this one just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-simplification","review":"Stormie Omartian's book is easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to implement into one's own life. However, the lack of specificity misleads one into thinking that prayer can be a quick and easy fix for any parental situation. Not the case at all. It's faith that does all the work, and no prayer in this book will generate the faith necessary for psychological healing. That, my friends, comes from within."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Dog-Eared, Beat-Up Book I Own","review":"This book is always right where I can find it. It is highlighted, underlined, tattered, and beat. No other book reminds me more of how much I need God's help parenting, and how much our children need our intercessory prayers for them. It's not a book of \\"magic formulas,\\" but a book of hope and love. And often, when we are stressed about a situation, it is hard to find the \\"right\\" way to pray...well, naturally there is no one right way, but Stormie's book helps me to clear my head and focus on the issues that need attention. I'll be forever grateful for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This book is a great book for parents who are needing that little encouragement and direction for daily prayer for their children.

I am a single parent of a ten year old boy and I work and go to school and like every parent, I am concerned for my son's future as well as his well being. We are supposed to turn all our worries over to the Lord and this book helps you do just that.

MP3 discs that played fine on several computer drives, a Sony DVD player and a Phillips portable CD player would hiccup between songs on the Panasonic.

So, as I scoot on down the couch to make room, I spy a little one with his eyes glued to the TV. Even the five-year old was watching this movie. Maybe Abbot and Costello's charm that began when I was a child was still working. Well, I spent the entire movie making popcorn and brownies for the kids. When I asked the teenagers why they liked the movie, they just said \\"it was kinda cool\\".

There are some great comedic lines in this movie that will live forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aging Monsters","review":"This is a good film in that it gives us almost a final glimpst of our aging monster hero's. Lugosi would die just 8 years later, but not before wearing the cape again in Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space (about 10 seconds worth). Lon Chaney Jr., who would not play the wolfman again, died in 1973. And Glenn Strange (the Frankenstein monster), the tall B Western movie actor, would also die in 1973, but not before playing Sam the bartender in the Gunsmoke TV series. Yep that's him.

The Texan parlayed a winning poker hand into a decades-long career trapping animals for zoos, animal collections, and other buyers. He survived an attack by a spitting cobra, trapped an authentic man-eating tiger, cornered a tiger loose on shipboard, and took as a challenge any claim that a particular animal had never been captured. Operating out of Singapore, Buck's adventures led to books, then movies based on his books at a time long before nature films now commonly available, an appearance in an Abbott and Costello movie, and even the understandable inspiration for a TV show in the Indiana Jones mold. Watching these movies on TV in the early 60's inspired me to dive into the woods to make my own animal traps which, happily, no animal was careless enough to be caught in."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting visit to a past time and a larger than life real person","review":"I remember this title from my childhood days.

Here was one of the few big game hunters who didn\`t hunt for trophy heads and actually cared about the welfare and treatment of all animals. A wonderful read. Brought back that childhood excitment. The cost of the book ( received in excellent used condition ) was embarrassingly low, almost what I would have paid as a child in the fiftys. Speedy shipping let me enjoy this that much sooner.

She lumps von Braun in with ardent Nazis and the historical record shows that von Braun was an apolitical rocket engineer and manager and he was never a goose-stepping Nazi. Neufeld's book, \\"The Rocket and the Reich\\" is well-researched but suffers from the author's need to find blame without any evidence. The attack on von Braun and his team by Hunt, Neufeld and others has little to do with accurate history but is rather an opportunistic vendetta to garner attention, fame and book sales. Lost in this smear campaign is the great work done by von Braun and his team for our nation during the Cold War that culminated in landing on the moon.

Anyhow, i did manage to put them all on and at first he didn't mind them, and after like an hour or so he started to lick them. Well, now he does not mind them at all.

Could have been brilliant.But, in the end they only stayed on for about one week. So I doubt I would buy again. Our cat is very easy going so putting them on was probably about as easy as it gets with any cat. But, that being said, I thought these were tough to put on and there were two of us - one holding the cat and one person putting these on. Too much effort for a one week solution.

Lasted about a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good alternative to declawing","review":"After moving back to the US, we needed a way to keep our 10 year old cat from ruining all of the furniture. Declawing would be traumatic for a feline her age, so we decided to try this out.Initially, it can be difficult to get the cat to let you touch it's paws enough to get these on (ours is a bit hysterical anyway). After 4 months of using these, I can tell you that the Cleat Lock System (or the ridges inside the rubber caps) do a lot to help keep the caps on. She still spends at least an hour a day trying to get them off, but at least she has nails to chew on! A couple times a week she pulls one off and I have little problems putting a new one on. This is a great (although very expensive) product."},{"rating":"2","title":"These work great, as long as you don't have looped carpet...","review":"We tried these some time ago with our first cat, but she kept catching her claws in looped carpet and pulling these off. The medium size fit her well at 10lbs.Now with our second cat, who is only 7 lbs and smaller, these still fit, so we ordered more. She picks at them if you let the glue run out and catch her fur. Otherwise these work great. Also, we use superglue because the tubes that come with the soft claws aren't enough to last the whole package.It's cute to see the cat \\"scratching\\" with these on.

Thinking that I did not place enough glue I put new nails and filled 1/2 with the glue. Again by the next morning they came off.

Granted it wasn't the easiest to put on at first but u get the hang of it pretty quick. And yes she kept pulling them off, but only a few at a time so it wasn't a big deal.

I don't think my cat really minded them that much either"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get on and easy to come off!","review":"I bought this for my kitten who scratched anything she could get her little paws on. It was extremely hard to put these on because the glue dries quickly so you have to hurry while holding the cat still and paws/claws out. Also, the piece does not go all the way down on the claw so the end always snagged on items and we would have to go get her unstuck from everything.

If you are a RHCP fan this book is a MUST read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intersting story from under the bridge!","review":"This book really grabbed me. Kiedis is a good story teller and has had a very interesting life. Its filled with a bit of overkill when it comes to the drug/sex life of Kiedis since this really doesn't break new ground when it comes to \\"rock star\\" books. What makes the book so interesting is how his childhood really set him on a course of destruction that would have led most people to a place of no return. Yet he somehow comes through it, stays in touch with his own failings and never lets go of the joy of life. I think what really carries the story is that Anthony is a likeable person that has done some unlikeable things and many people can identify with that. I would have liked him to expand more on his relationship with Flea. I would have also been nice if he had talked more about his feelings as the band grew in popularity. Overall this is a quick, enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't about the music.","review":"I feel that Publisher's Weekly missed the point of this book when they said Kiedis devotes too few pages to his music and too many to his drugs and women.Having read the book, it appears to me that while the book is biographic in its nature, his motivation in writing it was to explain to others the dangers of drugtaking so that they could be disuaded from it and also to help himself stay clean as part of his 12-step programme.I feel that his music represents something that saved him from drug-taking and a vehicle to express some of the emotions that the drugs induced- it is not the focus of the book in any way, and he might well argue that it has not been the centre of his life either. Readers hoping for deep musical analysis should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Candid tales from the edge","review":"I admire Anthony for being so honest and candid about a life full of drugs and chasing drugs. As a life long fan of RHCP I can say that I love this book because of its great stories about the climb of their success.

I only gave it 4 stars out of 5 because of the few typographical errors and verb tense errors that were a bit distracting for me to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look into the orgins of the RHCP","review":"RHCP fans will enjoy this one, especially the detailed look into the early years of AK, Flea, and the formation of the band. I would give the 1st half of the book 5 stars, but I took a star off because the 2nd half becomes very repetitive (band rehearsal, drug binge, breakup with a girl, go to rehab, and repeat, for about 6 straight chapters).As I was reading the book I kept thinking \\"How is this guy still alive, and how does this band still exist?\\" With his friends and fellow musicians dying all around him from overdoses, AK somehow made it through, and the world has some phenomenal music because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scar Tissue","review":"An amazing and life-affirming story. At times shocking, but nearly always inspiring, Anthony's unwillingness to let addiction control his creativity or his life spoke volumes.

Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring and repetitive.....","review":"I have read some biographies, mostly about musicians or groups, and I must say that this one is almost worse than the John Lydon one.This guy tries to be, or looks like he wants to show he has lived the rock and roll lifestyle more than Motley Crue (The Dirt is a GREAT book) or Lemmy (another brilliant autobiography).75% of the book is about how much drugs he has done, in such a repetitive way that is anoying, and also on how many girls he had sex with; more ego than Gene Simmons if that's possible. Has some good stories and anecdotes, but sadly are the 25% of the whole reading.You've been warned, it's up to you. Bye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writing prose from a rock star.......","review":"I didn't see this autobiography of Anthony K. as another drug crazed rock and roll idol, I saw it as a very intelligent journalist and book writer putting this book together in easy to understand chapters of his interesting life. Most rock stars are predictable and after reading several of them they start to all sound the same. Drugs, bad parents, more drugs, hookers, band practices, drug networking, band networking and eventual fame and fortune while doing mass quantities of drugs. This guy is a master book writer and I'm surprised he isn't a writer instead of a rock star. He did write another book for Dave Navarro and there just wasn't enough interesting material to make Dave interesting no matter who wrote the book. I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to read about an intelligent rock stars' life starting from pre-teen to present years and being very interesting and page turning the whole time. I was never bored. Keep writing Anthony!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read.","review":"Anthony has definitely had an interesting life. I found myself laughing at some of the stories and becoming annoyed with his inability to keep his life on track at times. All-in-all an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ari","review":"I am already halfway through the book! I received it right on time and I am very satisfied although it is a used book it looks brand new to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever","review":"In order to fully understand music, one must understand what's behind the musician's life. How can it be that such beautiful music is produced by someone with such a poor youth?This book is absolutely amazing. Contrary to other reviews, I don't think less of Mr. Kiedis after reading the book. When in such an ugly setting such as a slum in Los Angeles, Mr. Kiedis could consider himself lucky that he came out the way he did.I learned more than Kiedis' background after reading the novel, I also now know that I will never even consider doing drugs. I absolutely love this book, and I was up until 6 in the morning reading it the day I got it. I'd recommend this book to anyone. Astonishing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"arrested emotional development","review":"Very disappointing read. The book needed a good editor to cut down on the number of times Kiedis describes the tedious process of waiting to cop, copping, drugging and nodding off. Only broken up by stories about his myriad sexual escapades with women (only under the age of 25 and/or of the model/actress/fashion designer variety except for one patronising paragraph about a fat girl). Don't be expecting any eloquent turns of phrase either. He's selfish, a bit sexist but still very charasmatic. Save your money and buy his CDs instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to burst your bubbles, but....","review":"This is a story of Anthony K's life, which I'm sure was dictated by him, but the other guy listed above actually WROTE the book. So when you talk about how it flowed, the eloquence, blah blah blah..... you are talking about that other guy. Anthony Kiedis did not WRITE the book.Kiedis was on the Howard Stern show this morning and didn't even recognize certain passages as they were read aloud from the book. So I don't think he had too much to do with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"story of hope","review":"I read this book because I have an addict son. I read everything I can about drug addiction, drug addict artists, effects of drugs on the individual and the family and friends. It is excellent in describing Anthony's long journey beginning at a very young age his incredibly hard journey with drug addiction. I liked the RHCP but that's not the reason I read this book. It is a book of hope to me. Anthony's struggles will resonate with anyone who is an addict, IF they can see themselves, but especially families of addicts who suffer as much as the addict. Congrats for making it Tony. I know that it was alot of luck you survived but I'm so glad you are well and alive to help others. If you made it, then I believe my son (and his other addict friends) can make it too. Thanks for the hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful","review":"I chose this rating because this book made me think wow. I have always loved the Red Hot Chili Peppers, I remember when they came out, I was not a super fan but there music always made me stop and listen. I went to my first Chili Peppers concert a few months ago and I was blown away, the music, the energy, soulfulness,the whole vibe was the best experience I have ever had at a concert. When I came across this book I had to read it. I wanted to understand where they came from, or Anthony, got to where he is now. This book did that for me. I understand where and what he has gone through. I have been there myself and with loved ones. I am so happy to read about his sobriety, and really hope it stays that way, for himself, and his family. This book also helped me understand some of the songs, and has made me aware of some new ones. Thank you very much for a great read!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big fan","review":"The Red hot Chili peppers have been my favorite band for years. This book is a great read for any fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's that droning in my ear?","review":"I believed this was going to be a great read. I love the RHCP's music and had heard some of the Kedis folklore, like sleeping with his Dad's girlfriend at the age of 12. I was truly looking forward to expanded versions on these tales of debauchery. I really appreciate his lyric writing style and had thought it would transfer into his book writing style. It didn't. There was no style. It was the literary equivalent of having a monotone droning in your ear for three days. What could have been great stories of lust and addiction were written so blandly and devoid of any emotion, that they came across like some guy in a tie trying to sell me some extra life insurance. Do yourself a favor, just stick to their music and read Junky instead. Excerpt as perceived by me: \\"Woke up, did drugs, got laid\\" Repeat. Oh yeah, there was something about starting a band on page 343."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNBELEIVABLE","review":"And by that I mean truly unbelievable. The tales of excess and debauchery come across with little conviction and credibility. And after reading for the umpteenth time about Anthony \`getting laid', \`shooting up', \`getting busted', etc, not only do the little yarns become somewhat tedious but one also starts to wonder if they indeed actually happened. So much so that even after the second attempt at reading this book I gave up altogether.If you want read a good autobiographical account of people going over the edge in the music biz read The Dirt or Wonderland Avenue.Scar Tissue is badly written, has little story development and is altogether bland.Anthony should stick to what he knows best.Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um....","review":"I have always been a fan. I just wish to read the positive side of being a multimillionaire. The world has too much negativity and tragedy. Come on Anthony, let's not contribute to it. We all know about your amazing path and how you trashed it. Welcome back and may you find peace. Just don't abuse consumers with public information for profit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purple light","review":"Two big highlights of this book:1. The language - sharp, funny, relaxed style, not convoluted, not trying too hard - the street language and the descriptions are hilarious2. The tales of addiction - this is the core of the book, his description of his addiction. He doesn't dwell on the horrors, but he also doesn't get too religious in his sobriety - it's just a sympathetic, believable story. And the insight into the lying, coniving mind of a 'dope fiend' makes great reading.I love the description of the seedy motel on Sunset, with the wicked purple light out front - tempting even the most reformed addict."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drugs, Teenage Sex, Drugs, TeenageSex and more drugs","review":"Anthony details his daily search for drugs, going over a period of about 20 years. In between the drugs, he has these girlfriend relationships that are similar to the ones we had in 9th grade - pledging our \\"one-ness\\" and having a lot of male-gratifying sex.They say that drug and alcohol addiction \\"freezes\\" the maturity of the addict to early teen years, and this book is pure proof of it.I like Anthony - he's not a bad guy - and I hope he will now focus on writing, working and helping others, as well as staying sober, and hopefully, through the process, go from 14 to 40.I just wish I had half of the money he spent on drugs...ugh, what a waste of success..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"The frontman to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Anthony Kiedis, has written a fantastic memoir of his life. He was raised by his hippie, drug-loving father, who exposed him to drugs at age 13. We hear about his crazy childhood and crazier days as a Chili Pepper, all about drugs, girls, and music. Kiedis's fluid writing at times rambles, but for the most part is very interesting. I finished it in a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"No bio compares","review":"Never ending page turner..the theme generates from ups and downs of a rockstar whose life seems to stem from fiction when in actuality is just another day in the life of Mr. Kiedis...there needs to be a continuation ..a part II"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating... Anthony takes you on a journey into a world most people will never get to experience.","review":"Anthony Kiedis had lived an exciting (sometimes dangerous) life. While you may not agree with everything he is or does, you will certainly enjoy the ride through his life this book takes you on. You may even learn something about yourself along the way. The honesty in these pages will move you. This book is not just another rock and roll auto-biography. It is, perhaps, the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and addicting!","review":"This was one of the best biographies I've read in a long time. It's dark, honest and brutal. The type is small which makes it long but I didn't want it to end. If you love Anthony Kiedis and/or the Chili Peppers, you will love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, fascinating book!","review":"I've been a fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers for a while now and just recently decided to read Anthony Kiedis' book. I'm so glad I did (and wish I would have done it sooner)! What a highly entertaining, surprising, fascinating book! I literally couldn't put it down! I've always been intrigued by Kiedis' lyrics and the meanings behind his songs so it was very interesting to read how many of his songs were written and the true meaning behind them. Kiedis doesn't hold anything back in this book and is highly explicit and honest, which made for an absolutely excellent read. 5 Stars for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and Awesome","review":"This book is a great read. It spans the life of Anthony Kiedis in first person from birth, through his school years with Flea, the formation of his various musical ventures and the ups and downs of RHCP through the album By The Way. There's sex, drugs, rock & roll with a little more sex and drugs thrown in on top. It's obviously written from the viewpoint of an older, more mature and very reflective Kiedis, owning up to his faults and highlighting his many talents, while detailing his progression into and out of drug addiction. If you love RHCP, you'll love hearing their story from the amazing front man. If you've never heard of RHCP, you'll love the story of a man struggling to be the best person he can in a life of rockstar morals and hollywood dreams. Definitely read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad far out weighed the good","review":"I like the red hot chili pepper's and I like autoabiographies. That being said this one is slow, not well organized and uinspiring. I kept reading, convinced that it had to get better, unfortunately, it never did. It took me 3 weeks to get through, when a book never takes me longer than a few days. Anthony Kedis should stick to making music."},{"rating":"1","title":"peace and love and... a lotta loathsome","review":"honestly newsweek found the book \\"inspiring\\"? oh hell yeah, it even tells you exactly where to go in LA for heroin and crack cocaine...honestly, nothing but gloating on the part of this once attractive carcass about rampant drug abuse and noookie nookie nookie, oops I mean the \\"strong beautiful women\\" in his life... (retch)not impressed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"and then everything changed","review":"I thought I had mixed feeling about the book. The writing is sometimes very cheesy, I hope due more to Lomas than to A.K., however the little window it opens into the 80's and 90's LA music scene is pretty cool. He's lived one of the craziest lifes I've ever heard of and, in comparison, what I used to call my wild years seem pretty stablishment now. This book has also been the trigger to a 180 degree change in my life, nothing to do with the book itself or with the author, it just opened my eyes to certain things (again no direct connection, but who cares) and now I'm finishing up a chapter of my own life and opening a totally different one, so cheers A.K. I'll be very curious to read if this has been the case for anyone else.So all in all, the book is very entertaining and easy to read, and, as for A.K. I think, good on him, he's lived the life and can still write about it, I'll have him over for tea any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCKAPOTUMUS...","review":"Great read.

He has had a very unconventional life--getting into drugs and sex with 20 year olds when he was 13 and 14, getting into hardcore addiction in his 20s, being homeless, becoming famous, touring all the time, etc.I alwas thought the Chili Peppers sucked until they matured and began writing more thoughtful songs, but as a story of a totally crazy-acting (but not really that crazy, when he explians it to you) guy, this is entertaining to a total square like me.The only thing that cold have improved this was more about the early alternative scene in the '80s, but Anthony was such a druggie, he maybe didn't really know.Also, there are many laugh out loud scens here, like when he has to look outside at traffic to see if it's dusk or dawn whenever he wakes up from a drug stupor. And when he holds a hunger strike to get a leather jacket on discount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"Scar Tissue immediately draws the reader in through its easy-to-read style. Some of Kiedis' stories are hard to believe, like drug use with his father at such a young age or the people he met and spent time with on intimate levels, but it's those events and people that keep the reader hooked. Although the book is sad at times when Kiedis tells of his repeated attempts at rehab and relapses, the ending is uplifing and inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This book is interesting if you have watched Anthony jump around on stage and wondered what makes him tick. It is very readable, written pretty well. I think it may be useful for addicts as well as fans of the Red Hot Chili Peppers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book. Made me a fan.","review":"I bought this for a friend who love the Red Hot Chili Peppers. On the subway ride home I started reading it just to pass the time and quickly became engrossed in it.

This book made me a fan of their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time & paper.","review":"OK, this book was SUCH a waste. This guy could have told his so called \\"story\\" in one chapter & it would still be useless.

Don't waste your time & $$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sir Pyscho Sexy indeed","review":"I was looking forward to Kiedis' book, having been a RHCP's fan from way back. What a disappointment. Kiedis brags about his sex life endlessly, I found myself looking forward to his next relapse back onto drugs to relieve the monotomy of what sexual act some random chick performed on him. Kiedis occasionally showcases his masterful (ahem)lyric writing ability by displaying some of his lyrics throughout the book. Thank you Mr Kiedis for highlighting the true talents of the RHCP."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS BOOK,,THEN I FIND OUT THAT SOMEONE ELSE WROTE IT ALONG WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM ANTHONY KIEDIS...ALL THIS BOOK HAS IS PAGE AFTER PAGE OF ANTHONY KIEDIS'S SEXUAL CONQUESTS, AND A REALLY BORING ACCOUNT OF HOW THE BAND CAME TO BE...IT GIVES NO INSIGHT AT ALL INTO WHAT MAKES ANTHONY KIEDIS WRITE THOSE AMAZING LYRICS OVER A PERIOD OF 20 YEARS...YAWNNNNNNN...DON'T BOTHER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scar Tissue","review":"Only bought it because my son ordered it.

Amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a insane ride.","review":"I went into this book a big chilli peppers fan since the mid80\`s. I knew about some of his using. But I had no idea how bad it really was. He should have been dead long ago. This gives new depth and meaning to all of their great music. It has also given perspective to my own struggle with dependencies in my life. I devoured this book in two days like a new sack of drugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and energy...","review":"What happend!? Suikodan 3 was probably one of the most inventive RPGs I've ever played, but Suikodan 4 stinks.The characters are boring, the story is dull and without any plot twists or inspiring hardships. The music is quiet, non-existent or boring. The gameplay lack challenges and the enemies constist of roughly 13 or so models in the whole game colored in different variations. Traveling from one island to another is slower than mud (literally hours if you want to explore the sea chart). Plus while getting most the 108 characters was optional in Suikoden 3. In Suikoden 4 it's practically required to continue the boring story. Basically it's: find people, watch a scene, find some more people, watch a scene.I would rather watch pait dry, it's faster paced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst one of the series","review":"Having played Suikoden 1-5 I can say that 4 is by far the weakest. I didn't care about any of the characters, and got sick of being in a big stupid boat. Sea battles were kind of fun, sea travel was tedious, and over all this was by far the weakest of the series in almost every aspect. I would rate them best to worst as: 2, 1, 3, 5, 4.2 stars might be being generous but any Suikoden is still better than many rpgs out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool game","review":"The playing experience is cool.I like duel which was a little improved.The part on traveling in the ocean was kind of boring.I say it is good to play it and have some fun.

The ending is as obvious as an on-coming train, and just about as troubling. Like another reviewer, I could not determine what the writer and director were going for, relative to genre or even the point they wanted to make. There are way too many dream sequences and flashbacks. Why do so many directors believe that non-linear storytelling is artful? I have no idea, but this film's director clearly buys that line of thinking. On the positive side, the acting is first rate and the principle actors are easy on the eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Poor video, video taped in show.

Instead, we provided her with several different scratching posts with a variety of material, sprinkle catnip on them, and introduce her to their purpose by raising her legs and putting her paws on them in a scratching motion.

I looked at Reel Chill as being a good way to bring them all together on one album. These are the original compositions - but NOT the original music as heard and performed for the movies.I was looking for that emotion you feel when listening to the music from a significant film, and it just wasn't there when it's a 'remake' from another orchestra.I won't knock the music - it's beautifully performed, but if you're looking for that 'exact' sound as heard in the movie (A.I., Chariots of Fire, etc) - this is NOT the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on laughs","review":"While in Egypt, Peter and Freddie (Abbott and Costello) get involved with a walking mummy, his cult followers, and a cursed medallion.That's a pretty short summary, but honestly, that's all there is to this disappointing comedy. Abbott and Costello were past their prime in 1955 and the film shows it. The jokes aren't much unless you think endless punchlines with \\"mummy\\" instead of \\"mommy\\" and snake charmers with rubber snakes are funny. Abbott yells too much at Costello and they both are barely going through the motions; in fact, they call each other \\"Bud\\" and \\"Lou\\" throughout. The ridiculous casting of Richard Deacon (\\"Mel Cooley\\" inThe Dick Van Dyke Show) and Michael Ansara (TV's \\"Cochise\\") as Egyptian mummy-worshippers makes the story even more far-fetched. It's about thirty minutes too long and plays like a bad SNL skit.

The dialogue was inane, the slapstick was idiotic, drawn out and repetitive and the acting so wooden to the point where the only reason this sorry excuse for a movie was made was to capitalize and profit on the Abbot and Costello name. As opposed to the top quality of \\"Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein\\" with it's superior characters, plot and monsters, this cheap rip-off doesn't even have a decent Mummy character,(a guy in a jump suit with duct tape attached, big deal!) or any talented actors and special effects for that matter. If you must see this movie check it out from the library. Buying or renting it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes! The comedy is kept under wraps here...","review":"The Abbott and Costello films fit into one of two categories; really good or really bad. Sadly, this film sits in the later camp. I'm not sure what the screenwriters and Bud & Lou were thinking when they concocted this strange mishmash of bad comedy and bad horror. The Universal Mummy films were always the weakest of their horror films (the exception is the eerie but really slowwwwww first film with Boris Karloff. It's only alive in the very beginning).I'd suggest sticking with the first and best of this bunch A&C Meet Frankenstein. All the later films (including Dr. Jekell & Mr. Hyde)are little more than pale imitations.Any A&C film is only as good as their routines. This one, sadly, doesn't have very inspired ones. The best involving the tools is a pale imitation of the who's on first variety. They don't make them like this anymore (on second thought....what about all those Halloween and Friday The 13th sequels? They're not comedies? What?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Docs than Films...but I don't mind!","review":"Seeing that I don't own the DVD copy of Bud and Lou's famous-\\"A&C Meet Frankenstein\\", I really enjoy the Best Of...Vol.4, if just for the fine documentary about their most famous film.

He skillfully manipulates language (e.g., calling loyalty to one's boss 'fealty') in order to deliver what he thinks is an indictment of bureaucracy. He does have some interesting things to say about the press, but this occurs near the end and comprises less than a page of material. Save your time.

First of the home records sound like they where taped on a dirty tape recorder. The studio tracks are not on any real album cause they sound awful. Last lets face it Gun Club was one of the greatest bands to ever exist but they suck live. Every time I say them JLP was drunk and made no sense. They are great to watch live but you can not capture that feeling with a poor recording. This is great if you want to hear outtakes and stuff. I gave it 2 stars because it has some historical value. If you really want to hear a great Gun Club album by Fire of Love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"This recording is absolutely delightful! I first bought this record when I was 18, shorly before I went into the Army. When I was stationed at Ft Gordon, GA, to my suprise I heard it on a radio, a huge console stereo in the dayroom, probably was on a National Public Radio type broadcast station. The recording burned in a fire about 8 years later. Then about 22 years later while stationed in South Korea, I found a copy of this record at a record shop, in perfect condition.

He sees Bertha for who she truly is and that she will despise him. However, this does not stop the narrator from eventually marrying Bertha.

I feel the author could have offered us much more following the death of the lady's maid.While this story is short, it isn't a quick read. You'll want to slow down to capture the emotion in Eliot's writing.This story reminded me of Wuthering Heights. That book is a retelling of a tragic life.

She goes on by blaming him for her f*ck-ups and talk about him not satisfying her sexually. This just makes it obvious that she's a slut and a hoe. I also read a feature on MTV.com about her song and she says that her song is about \\"empowering women to fight back when people try to smear your name\\". That quote ain't nothin but bullsh*t.

The story is absolutely great. I couldn't put the book down. It gives the reader a good look into how settlers and trappers had difficulties settling down and getting accustomed to the new surroundings and wildlife. We see how the lives of new settlers are affected by Indians. Jory Sherman presents his main characters as bold people, willing to explore what lays beyond their camps. He is an excellent author, causing a feeling of closeness to the characters in this book. We feel for Sheila and Davey as they attempt to overcome their problems. We can understand their pains and happiness. I would Suggest that anyone who likes old fashioned, historical settings to read this book. You will not be disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment for a Starrett Product","review":"I have always really liked the quality of Starrett tools, and have a number of their products in my shop. This one was a huge dissapointment, though. The chuck on this tee handle tap wrench is intended only for hand tightening, and seemed pretty sturdy at first glance. However, on the second use, the cap screw that tightens the chuck split, right at the nose. Incredible! No way that should have happened. I returned it to Amazon, and thankfully their customer service came through as usual with an immediate refund. That's why I continue to buy from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"lasted 4 months","review":"I've had this unit for about 4 months and just today had to take it in for service.

(We have twins, so dealing with inserts did not appeal to us :-))However, after trying it for a few times, I have to report that it does not hold moisture as well as Bum Genius diaper with inserts. This one looks attractive, and it is easy to put it on, but it does not hold moisture beyond 3 hours of wear (for 8-mth-old boys). That means we could not use it overnight, while Bum Genious diaper worked just fine overnight. Also, after just 3 hours, it was soaking wet inside and my boys had a bit of rash from it. It starts to leak on the sides too. There are more absorbent AIO diapers out there and at a lower price. This one is $20, and Bum Genius is $16.

I spent a good amount of time at the Twelve in the late seventies and early eighties. It was the best nightclub ever. This documentary did the Twelve no justice at all. Just a bunch of interviews with a handful of people, half of whom could not possibly have been old enough to go to the club when it was at its height--late seventies, very early eighties. I was hoping for pictures of the place, of people dancing and having a great time--anything to allow me to briefly relive one of the most enjoyable periods of my life--but all it was was a bunch of lame interviews and still photographs that went by so fast you couldn't recognize anyone. And, most startling of all: not a word about Dana Jacovidis, quite possibly the best DJ of all time. At least it mentioned Walter (once).

The sound is on the whole aggressively electronic, with brutally programmed drum machines, shouted vocals and a general mood of dislocation. Of course it is an industrial album, but it seems that the group are working against their own creative abilities. That said, there are two notable exceptions, which hint to Coil's subsequent musical development: the first is their cover of \\"Tainted Love\\", already a mega hit for Soft Cell, which is turned into a cathedral of imposing keyboards threatening to suffocate a dehydrated vocal from Jhonn Balance, and the other is \\"The Tenderness Of Wolves\\", a ghostly collaboration with Gavin Friday of Virgin Prunes fame.

I know Aps cameras my not produce the greastest images blown up but I like them. I used my head and while I was there I took a test roll and got them developed at a local store in an hour. I was already uneasy with the half-way decent quality of the pictures then and by the time I went through 7 rolls of film I was really on edge. I got back home and over 60% of my pictures came out dull, underexposed, and just awful. So I took my negative to an additional two other film proccessors and some of my pictures came out better but not by much. I've only been taking pictures for 5 years and I don't claim to know it all, but I really have come to dislike this camera. The only 'strenghs' to the camera are its looks and the LCD glow-type button function.

Granted, there are a lot of nice photographs of consoles and screenshots of games, but the bulk of the book consists of essays from little-known authors, freelance writers, and assorted educators who are (at most) nominally involved with the videogame industry. Some of their opinions are interesting, but most offer little in the way of entertainment or educational value.The book might have been fine as a companion to a museum show (which it apparently was), but as a stand-alone volume it is lacking. Even though there aren't very many books written on the subject of videogames, I can't recommend this one. Game Over, High Score, and The First Quarter are more educational, Supercade has more information and better pictures, and Arcade Fever is more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not worth one's time for the subject it covers.","review":"There are many better texts on video games out there.

Elizabeth's \\"romantic\\" relationship as a young woman was dismal and depressing, and her marriage wasn't much better; Aisling turned to the same type of dismal, loveless relationship as an \\"older\\" woman. This book is promoted as a story about friendship, but what kind of friends enable each other to stay in such hideous relationships without ever encouraging each other to get out and move on to better things? Also, the sudden change in Aisling's husband after they got married was puzzling and unrealistic.

A lovely story about the cards we're dealt, which are not always good ones, and the choices we make as a result of those cards.

Their families are like night and day - whole different life outlooks. The girls' friendship grows over the years and they come together during times of crises and times of celebration.

I kept reading in the hopes that it would turn around at some point. I felt the characters' friendship could have been more developed in the beginning.

If you're going to read Maeve Binchy books, just expect a few things. Anyone who doesn't follow the teachings of the pre-Vatican II Catholic Church is going to come to a bad end. If you are living a life of quiet desparation in a stultifying Irish small town, take a class or start a small project and your life will get instantly better! Light a Penny Candle follows the Binchy rules, but it somehow stands out from her other works. The characters are a bit more real, the story a little more complex. Binchy does have a nice way with the rhythms of language in rural Ireland and suburban England and that is one of the great pleasures of her books. I do enjoy this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A most disappointing book by a great author","review":"The first half of the book is great.

When I had first set the speakers up, I didn't adjust anything and I was blown away...it was amazing.For the price, I don't think you could find a better speaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job Well!","review":"Just a couple of days ago I upgraded my PC speakers with this item that I saw at very reasonable price from Amazon. The improvement is extremely noticeable. I didn't want a window-buster as we have a home theater system in the living room. I just wanted something for the office/den that I could listen to my music downloads on and enjoy a more realistic sound from my flight simulator. This unit more than satisfies both needs. The speakers have a clear quality with more than adequate power. I would recommend to anyone who wants an appropriate speaker system for his/her Windows Media Center not to purchase anything less than this unit. This great little inexpensive item works for me. In addition, I received this from Amazon in only 2 & 1/2 working days after I ordered it. That's pretty fast! I am very, very pleased with the whole deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"impressed","review":"These speakers are a great deal. They have a rich, full sound for $35 speakers. They are stylish and easy to set up. The only improvement would be if they were louder but I guess thats what a little extra cash gets you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get them","review":"$34...that is cheap a bit too cheap right? yes, you are right these speakers need to be at least $80. think about it i would even be happy with a subwoofer for $30. The treble on these satellites are crisp and again ive heard things in my songs that i never once heard before. The subwoofer is a great way to add to the bass; it may be loud but not overwhelming. i use this for my ipod and trust me these are better than the $300 Bose(r) dock. Just get the $5 charger and these speakers and you can create the same fidelity for about $260 cheaper. In fact, my friend asked if these speakers were $270. that's how good they are.Edited: the bass does get somewhat drowning but its nothing that a little tweaking can't fix...still recommended YES. GO BUY THEM IF YOU LIKE MUSIC...classical runs well on it too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic speakers!","review":"What a price! Got the amazon deal, got these for 20 bucks. What a deal!! Sounds absolutely fantastic. A bit too many cables on the speakers, but its behind my desk so it doesn't really matter. Additionally, i havent found the use of the major speaker, other than base... can someone explain that?REally a great buy, totally recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds good, looks not so goo","review":"This set sounds good, but it's not put together very well. The wire casing going into one of the speakers is not connected to the speaker which results in a few exposed wires. I have a feeling that this will get worse after time and eventually the wires will get pulled loose, especially because I have them hooked up to a laptop. Go with a comparable pair from Altec Lansing instead. I have an older (more than 7 years) set of speakers (with subwoofer) from Altec with which I'm extremely happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you to use headphones with this, be warned","review":"For it's price the sound may be descent, but if you want to use headphones for private listening, be advised you are in for a surprise. Turns out, when you plug in the headphones the only sound you get is what comes through your soundcard, and you cannot adjust the volume with the volume control on the speakers. Further, you can only control the volume using your operating systems volume control. So, if your sound card only gives a low volume sound even with it's volume control turned up full that is all the sound you will get, making these speakers useless and a waste of money. I mean, since all I get when I use headphones is the low volume that comes straight from the soundcard, why do I need these speakers? I could have just plugged my headphones straight into my soundcard and saved my money. Kind of interesting that for a company called \\"Logitech\\", they didn't put much \\"logic\\" into this headphone design."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never recieved this item and I think you know this.","review":"There is no tel number or e-mail adress where I can contact you so in a month you finally wrote me.Now please tell me how are we going to solve this problem.I'm really dissapointed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound for the price!","review":"This is the second set of logitech speakers that i've purchased and they are consistently great sounding speakers for a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome speakers!","review":"Speakers produce fantastic sound, great for all types of music. Great bass in the subwoofer. Great speakers for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much bass","review":"Although I considered the dual driver and subwoofer speakers, independently speaking, very good, particularly so for the price. unfortunately, I can't say the same for the set as a whole. I thought the tonal balance between the two to be quite poor. A little bit more mid-range sound might have helped, but the subwoofer produces FAR too much \\"bassy\\" bass. I tried turning the volume on the subwoofer all the way down, separating it from the dual drivers as much as the speaker cables allowed, even rotating the subwoofer away from the normal frontal direction, I still considered the problem rather pronounced. It's too bad, as I expected much better. Particularly so, after reading the (in general) great reviews that it got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Speakers, Big Sound","review":"I got these as part of a new computer build I did. They sit on a fairly cramped computer desk, with the sub woofer on the floor. After reading other reviews, I turned the woofer really low to start with, but that thing still cranks out the bass, so anything with lots of bass sounds really good (especially Unreal Tournament). I've also played some music on it and some of the songs with more treble sound a little tinny, but not too bad. I'm sure if I tweaked the software equalizer it'd be fine. The biggest negative I've seen with these is the headphone jack. I get a lot of static when I use it and the speaker's volume control doesn't control it so I have to use the computer's volume control instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"painfully overdone bass","review":"I did not have high expectations for these speakers, but I thought they would deliver decent sound for the money. I should have read the negative reviews! On the plus side, the speakers sound okay in the mid-upper range (though mid is a little lacking). Also, distortion is not an issue at reasonable volumes.But the bass is ridiculous. It's muddy, and what it lacks in clarity it makes up in volume. Way too much volume. Even at the lowest setting, the bass dominates the music. I've managed to corral it for the most part using an equalizer, but then I have to switch presets every time I listen to music with headphones.I don't hate bass. I have a Hsu VTF-2 subwoofer for my home theater and it rocks the house. But it also knows its place. The sub on the Logitech doesn't.I would give this product one star if it wasn't so easy to use an equalizer. The sound out of the box is simply unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received defective","review":"I normally like the quality of Logitech products, but was disappointed when these speakers arrived defective. The \\"tube\\" inside the woofer unit had fallen off and rattles around inside the enclosure. The enclosure is glued shut, so I can't open it to fix the problem. I didn't need to use these speakers until nearly two months after I received them, and just opened the box today. It's too late to return them.For the price paid, the speakers would sound good if the woofer didn't have the rattle from the loose part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logi(cal choice)-tech","review":"A beautifully designed piece of hardware. A must have for the economically, but bass-response minded ;-)."},{"rating":"2","title":"$36...are you kidding me???","review":"Have no doubts...order this product.I wanted to improve the sound coming from my computer - at a cut-rate price. I ordered this set based on the recommendations of customers and I'm absolutely thrilled. These speakers turned my office into a studio - and the price, what a thrill!I have a Bose Wave Radio w/ CD player in my living room...and the music in my office - played from my compuer - is BETTER than the Bose.Don't fret about \\"too much base\\" that you read in other reviews. I have the woofer at about 3/10 - and I don't generally like much base. This is NOT an issue.Buy it, enjoy it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"No reason to pass up such a deal!","review":"I received the x-230 set yesterday and quickly made the connections to my lap top, and within minutes I had great sound. The sound is just a great wholsome sound there is no echo or tinny sound emmitted from the speakers. The subwoofer also gives off great bass. The set is unbeatable! My friend recently bought the Creative 3500 set and it doesn't have the same quality as the x-230's do. The x-230's are amazing and a must for someone with laptop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent computer Speakers","review":"I love my Logitech x-230 2.1 2-Piece Dual Drive Speakers with Ported Subwoofer. My friends are buying a set too. If you want a non-technical review, then here goes. I was instantly pleased with this set. I also own Ohms, and Advent speakers on other stereo equipment, so I know good sound when I hear it. The set up was very easy, delivery was quick. The price was right! The style of the speakers look very modern and the subwoofer fits comfortable under my new glass computer table. The on/off switch is located easily on the speaker. The sound quality is good for my computer use. I don't blast the neighbors, nor do I make the floor boards move with the base sounds, even though the speakers have the capacity to do so. If you are interested in a good pair of speakers for a computer to listen to your tunes, then I recommend these speakers. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings life to the computer desk","review":"I used to own little crappy Dell speakers that came with the computer stock. I had them for a couple years. I finally decided to muster up some money (I'm a college student, so I'm automatically broke), and decided to invest in some 2.1 speakers, since 5.1 was a little bit more of an investment, and I didn't feel that I was ready for it anyway. Let me tell you... these speakers bring life to the whole room. Your day will be made as soon as you crank these puppies up. And for less than 40 bux... how can that not be a steal??? And don't even let me start on the videogames... haha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speakers for the price","review":"I gave these speakers as a gift to my husband, he has been thrilled with them.

I stayed up all night listening to music and the speakers made it easy to hear every single sound cymbals,drums, etc...can be heard clearly. However, if you try to push it too far the highs can get a little hint of distortion, but for $29.99 I can not complain. I would definitely recommend these speakers. P.S. I did listen to some Altec Lansing and some Klipsch speakers and actually these sound better."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for a dorm room","review":"I went to college with my laptop thinking its speakers would be more than enough to enjoy my music in the dorm... wrong. A lot of people have side speakers to go with their laptops, so I invested in these and they have been nothing but perfect for me.These speakers are a great value, look nice and provide a deep rich sound that fills a good space. When I read the other reviews, I noticed that people were complaining about there being too much bass coming from the subwoofer, but I did not notice that problem. I have played everything from rock to classical on these speakers and none of it suffers from too much bass. Admittedly, the genres of techno and metal tend to REALLY get a nice boost from these.Overall, a great investment for the college student who isn't satisfied with his or her internal computer speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Speakers","review":"These are the best speakers I have ever had and am very pleased with their performance.

At the subwoofer's lowest level, you get WAY too much bass. For any normal adult (say, thirty years or older) THAT is a reason to DISLIKE these speakers. Since I'm over thirty years old, I DISLIKED these speakers: However I gave them to my teenage son, and he seems to like them: See what I mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average speakers for the price","review":"For the price these speakers are decent, but if you are at all particular about the music and sound you listen to, you may not be happy with these. I am constantly adjusting the EQ of the output for each song. The range of the bass is very small--mainly just a boom--not much variance in tone so it tends to overtake the song. I had a hunch that buying the logitech brand for anything else than a mouse would be a mistake, and I think that's what I did. Spend a little more if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech x-230 2.1 3-Piece","review":"We have had this speaker system for over a year now and really like it. It has reat sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible value","review":"These speakers are noticeably inferior to my twenty dollar Sennheiser HD202 headphones in sound quality. Music sounds a tad tinny and muddy. Worst of all, the bass is overwhelming and the knob on the subwoofer seems to be useless. These speakers are so mediocre that I've ceased using them in favor of my headphones. I'm a bit puzzled by all the other positive reviews--perhaps they're authored by shills from Logitech? I'd recommend spending a bit more money on a quality speaker system."},{"rating":"1","title":"the bass is HORRIBLE ... but clear","review":"its a weird situation with these speakers. the speakers sound great, but the bass is non stop. sounds like a getto cruiser on the highway. it is somewhat clean, just too much. you can turn it down all the way, but it is still too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"piece of junk, dang things made in china and it shows it.

They work perfectly and were very easy to set up. The controls are easy to get to and easy to adjust to whatever sound you want. I live with my parents and my room is down stairs so I was worried at first but I got them to a good level of volume and bass. You can get amazing sound quietly for as long as you need or blow your ears out and crank them up to some Crack the Sky or whatever it is you listen to. The price has went down by about 15 dollars since I bought them so I would have to say buy buy buy away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Speakers!!","review":"I had an online gift certificate for Amazon, so I basically paid nothing for this and was a little skeptical but these speakers are the real thing. I am seriously into music and have put up with some crappy tinny speakers until now. The bass is so sweet!!! I like a lot of bass but it is adjustable for those who don't. I am addicted to this system. I hope it performs this well for a long time. I will be using my computer more often for listening to my music. A+++++ Buy these!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set of speakers for the price","review":"These are a great set of speakers for the price.

These ones came out on top, and the price was right, so I bought them. I'm pretty picky about stereo systems in my home and cars, but I didn't want to spend triple digits on my PC speakers. This setup sounds good at just about any volume level. You may want to turn the sub level all the way down, and then play with the EQ on your computer (I use iTunes) to get things dialed in just right. But even without doing that, they sound great right out of the box. I expect to get many more years out of this system."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound for the price","review":"The speakers are great for the price.

The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that the first set died after two days of non-aggressive use.

Fifteen minutes and some RTV had the speakers running as advertised.Nice sound for such an inexpensive set of speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more interference from cell phones","review":"I bought these speakers for two reasons: They were cheap and other reviewers said they didn't get interference from cell phones. All I can say is mission accomplished. I've had these running for almost a week now and despite intentionally leaving my cell phone near them I haven't heard a peep. No more of the jarring noises when I get a text message.In terms of sound, they're not amazing, but they're cheap computer speakers. They're at least as good as you deserve for the price, probably better. I personally thought the subwoofer was a little overpowering at the default level, but there is a control for that and I was able to adjust it to something that sounded more balanced.I knocked off one star because most of the cables are hardwired to the speakers, which I hate."},{"rating":"2","title":"midrange not quite there","review":"Expected a little better mid-range but was able to correct somewhat with Creative Labs software.

The bass is clean and adjustable in volume and the satellites sound just fine to my ears. It is perfect for my daughter who listens to music and plays games. It also looks very hi-tech and matches her black LCD. The volume knob on the right satellite is very easy to get to on her desk. I would recommend this to anyone looking for good stereo sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bassy","review":"These speakers sound far better than my old Altec Lansing ADA-305's and I much prefer these controls with the exception of the sub woofer control which was on one of the satellites on the Altecs. The one serious complaint I have is that the sub woofer can over-ride the rest of the music. I took off only one star because it can be tamed by turning it all the way down and adjusting your equalizer settings. Just adjust the 100Hz range."},{"rating":"2","title":"music so loud, it'll blow your top off","review":"i was so sick of listening to my awesome music through my crappy desktop speakers, so i decided to upgrade. the quality of these speakers is phenomenal, the bass is powerful and the end result is a better experience bother for listening to your music and your gaming experience. these speakers are great for gaming. you can feel the gunsfireand explosions. if you're a bit older and don't like alot of bass, the bass volume on the back of the subwoofer is your best friend. all in all, if your looking to upgrade to quality sound but don't have the space or funds for 5.1 surround speakers, these are topnotch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the money, hope you like bass!","review":"Probably couldn't get much better at this price range. Bass adjustment is located on the subwoofer which is a pain if you like to adjust your bass level for different applications. Moving the bass control beside the volume adjustment knob would be a huge improvement. Overall very good quality when you are in front of the speakers, not as good when you're not.

Certainly not home theater quality but games and the occassional music CD sound pretty good on them. Like many people I just had the cheap speakers that came with my PC before this.

I don't know about paying 99 for them though. Perhaps when it was first released, but I believe this model was replaced by the x240. The only difference is that the x240 has a rocker cradle for iPods. The satellite speakers have decent highs, but don't count on them for mids. And, like all reviews, the bass is definitely kickin! If you live in a apartment or condo, you could be waking the neighbors. Currently I have the bass power at half and when I turn on the speakers its only at 1/4 loud. The only gripe I have is that the speaker wires for the satellites are too short, only about 3-4 ft. So I am unable to get surround.

This \\"Odyssey\\" features similarly constructed lyrics/melodies with obvious musical influences: The Chic/Change sounding \\"Little L\\"; \\"Picture of My Life\\" that borders on the Sergio Mendes-style of Latin pop; The MOR \\"Corner of the Earth\\"; \\"Love Foolosophy\\" that sounds as if it had been time-warped from 1977; and \\"Main Vein,\\" a song that sounds like it may have come from the Norman Whitfield/Isaac Hayes school of songwriting.For those that think that the group's apex was 1997's \\"Traveling Without Moving,\\" this should put that thought to rest. There are many years of great sounds left in the English-based band."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Old Jay K with the New?","review":"I thought this album was pretty good, and it was definitelygenerally happier and funkier than Synkronized. The albumis well put together, safe for a few songs that soundedlike last minute efforts to fill album space.

I wasn't too impressed with \\"Black Crow\\", but the entire CD is not made on one song. The past couple of months hardship seems pretty obvious in the lyrics (esp \\"Little l\\" & \\"Picture of my Life\\"). I think most fans will enjoy ~80% of the album and perhaps forgive him the cheesy 20% in light of all the good times & slick grooves he's given to his fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Ok, heres the deal. I love Jamiroquai but this album was a complete letdown. Yes, it is dancy but thats not why I loved Jamiroquai before. They were about the groove, soul, and the freedom of music. Now all that has been replaced by machines. Where's the didjeridoo? Wheres Stuart Zenders funky bass?

Forget about the great bass lines from their former bassist (Stuart Zender, also co-writer of the most interesting tunes). Since he split up with the band, the lack of new ideas has been dramatic. Instead of keeping the remains of acid jazz/ old school funk alive, the band now dwells in this cheap disco sound which is great fun for a tune, not a whole album. Plus, Jay Kay's attractive although limited vocal range is particularly bad in ballads ( listen to \\"Black Crow\\"and you'll be disappointed by vocals and embarrassed by the lyrics). Do I like them? Yes, they used to be one of my favorite bands, but that was long ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good album, but cold compared to the previous.","review":"This album was better than Synkronized (which doesn't say much),but it's just too shallow for me.

Because of the easy reading format, I read it this weekend. Yes, it is a new realm for Patterson, but I felt he dealt with it (genetic engineering) in a knowledgeable way.

Thumbs up from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"So easy to read it should be required reading for 7th grade","review":"I read this book in one day.

Wait for it to come out in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"James Patterson has been my favorite author since I read Kiss the Girls. Everytime that he writes a new book I buy it. This book would make me think twice before doing that again. Usually a Patterson book is unpredictable. You can't believe who the actual bad guy is at the end of the novel. In When the Wind Blows I correctly guess 95% of what was happening next. The premise for the story was great, but the plot didn't provide the enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise but poorly written","review":"I did enjoy this Dean Koontz-ish story line and I have to admit that I plowed through the book in record time. But I was apalled at the choppy and almost juvenile writing style, if you can call it \\"style\\".

If I were an editor I'd say, \\"Yikes, Jim, you can do better than this!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE disappointment","review":"Cardboard characters and zillions of 2-page chapters that read like a screenplay -- a BAD screenplay. I find it hard to believe that this book was written by James Patterson, who is usually a confident and original writer. The \\"science\\" fiction premise was laughable, the love scenes were ridiculous (particularly from the female perspective), and the plot was riddled with holes.... incredibly predictable. What the #@!*! was Patterson thinking when he wrote this (IF he wrote it, that is)? P.U."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to see Patterson writing with the same great suspense!","review":"James Patterson has shown us that he can write outside of the Alex Cross genre. His simple format remains the same in this novel, and keeps the pages turning. Short chapters are what keeps the reader from being unable to put the book down when it is time to turn the page. His use of imagery for the location of the story was very rich, and the character development of Max was done well. Patterson opened the character of Max slowly, and wasn't finished until the last page. I must also applaud him, once again, for being able to portray a character in the first person narrative. Even though he is not a widowed female vetrenarian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adolescent","review":"What a disappointing book! The characters were shallow, the story was obvious, the language was banal and jargon-y until Patterson threw in some medical lingo (for effect?).Very cliche, with some \\"jokes\\" attributed to characters which were inane at best. When I left the bookstore with this book, the salespeople snickered! I asked whether I should put it back...I wish I had. I bought Cat and Mouse at the same time. I HOPE it's better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is HORRIBLE!","review":"I can't believe his publisher allowed this book to be distributed. I kept waiting for a story, it's really just an outline. There is no character development for any of the characters. Reading the book is about as detailed as someone telling you about a book they have read. I only kept reading it because I could not believe it was that bad. I am returning the book to the store for a refund, and will be very cautious about buying his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I too read an advance copy of When the Wind Blows and was very disappointed both in the concept and the writing. While I applaud Mr. Patterson for refusing to be caught in a \\"genre\\" trap, I felt that the reader was being lured by the promise of a new Alex Cross by the nursery rhyme title. As a suspense novelist, Patterson has few equals, however I wishe he had been wise enough to leave the supernatural-suspense field to Stephen King and Dean Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is pathetic!!!","review":"I've tried this J.P.'s new book again like a sucker, and again, I failed to grap why his books would become so popular. The continued research in his popularity is still a myth to me so far. This book, as his others, is so pretentious, unnatural, contrived, forcefully twisted without proper logic. I have to agree with those who gave this book a minimal ratings. The reason I awarded it with 2 star is for his die-trying pretentious attitude, at least he's always trying to write a book with big-screen mind. What can I say? Once one of an novelist's books was bought by Hollywood, he would fantasize that his next one (or the older ones) would hit again by a Hollywood sucker, so he would start writing screenplays instead of the real thing--a decent novel, all he could create with his imagination is to focus on the overly twisted plots, he would only treat his readers as movie goers and couldn't care less. This book is an insult to a qualified reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!","review":"I have read every book by James Patterson has written and felt that they were all readable. I consider his Alex Cross books to be excellent. His latest, however,When The Wind Blows, is not only HIS worst book, it is one of the worst books I've read in many years.

Do yourself a favor and read ANYTHING else but When The Wind Blows."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dreary parade of tired cliches","review":"A misguided friend gave me an early copy of this genuine Grade A stinker. The writing is so bad you wonder if all the editors at the publishing house didn't take the week off.

Had I taken it out of the library instead of stupidly buying the hardcover, I would have never finished it. A dopey premise, a dopey ending, by what seems to be, a rapidly becoming dopey author.

It carried the same children's verse title as did Kiss the Girls, Cat & Mouse, etc. I fully expected another Alex Cross thriller. If the publisher had not packaged the book in the same manner as other Cross novels, I might not have purchased it. If Patterson was attempting to write a bio-tech thriller, he failed miserably. My impression of the book is a that it is a children's novel that includes sexual attraction, and ultimate consumation between Frannie and Kit. Patterson should have omitted all adult situations, and the publisher should have marketed the book for children instead of counting on the \\"accidental\\" purchasing by Alex Cross fans.

The writing is amateruish with too many loose and open ends. One finds the characters Kit and Frannie hard to relate to.

This book was not up to his usual standards. The premise was interesting but poorly executed. I found the short chapters (126 chapters in a 400 page book!) annoying and distracting. As a veterinarian I was also annoyed by the incorrect descriptions of Frannie's veterinary medicine. You'd think a big author like Patterson or his editor would check the details on an unfamiliar subject. My advice is if you must read this book, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story","review":"The overall idea of the story was interesting. I just think that the way Patterson described certain things lacked intelligence. He kept adding little phrases that would have been better had they been left out.

I liked the short chapters. The plot was completely predictable though, and the book probably should have ended halfway through. I was constantly trying to figure out who the \\"I\\" was that was speaking because it read like a man's point of view and not the heroine, Frannie. If it were not for the very slight touch of romance and the swear words, I would recommend this book to my 11 year old. Having read some of the other reviews, I will choose a different one of Patterson's books (certainly not The Lake House since it is a continuation of When the Wind Blows)and try to figure out how his books have become #1 bestsellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"silliest book I've read in years","review":"What a waste of my time and Patterson's talent.

Conceptually, some of it was attractive, but reality checks along the way simply didn't fit. Yelling at a little girl flying around while Frannie is careening along a road in a car and helicopters above--and being heard by the little girl Max. There were many improbabilities similar to this as well as a few factual errors. The use of isoflurine (isofluorethane) on a bird is very accurate - our two birds were anesthetized with the stuff two days ago, but recovery is very rapid. Also further along, the sudden use of military time when they all meet their parents displayed an obvious ignorance: 0200 is 2:00 a.m. and not 2 p.m. as implied. I will look twice at the next Patterson book before I buy it. I suggest that he return to his tried and true mysteries.

I was looking forward to this book, but I must say, it was an extreme disappointment. The book was very disjointed and completely unrealistic. Most mysteries and thrillers, when discussing things that may seem improbable or are rooted in science provide a background of scientific information that prepares the reader and helps them accept the unlikely or impossible. This does not and in several places, an eye roll or out loud laugh is appropriate. It was poorly written and very disappointing. I would hesitate to buy another one of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please","review":"I appreciate that Patterson did some research on this subject but he goes too far with the idea. Fantasy is ok, but don't try and convience me that it's not. The characters is this book are way too rigid and one dimensional, if I had liked them more maybe I could have gone beyond the premise and enjoyed the book. This was my first Patterson book, and while I might give him one more chance, my advice if your considering this one is try a different one first to see if you like the author because there is no way this is the best he has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of his worst books","review":"I like some of Patterson's books but not all of them. Usually ones I don't like are written with another author but this one was all his -- so I can't blame anyone else. I almost put it down the minute Max sprouted wings and flew. There was no way from the book jacket I knew it was science-fiction. I occasionally read Si-Fi or fantasy books but this one was poorly written and not very believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The modern Peter Pan","review":"What an amazing believable story. We all dream about it...flying! If only it really were possible. A must read for readers of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"Read the book in 4days. Hard to put down. Patterson keeps you guessing.Your Imagination will be on overload guessing the turn of events."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!!!","review":"I've read most of Patterson's books and loved them all! Mr. Patterson needs to stay with what he does best, and leave the science fiction to Koontz. They should changed the title of the book to \\"WHEN THE BOOK BLOWS\\". Fans of Alec Cross should stay away and wait for the next book! Its a shame I have to give it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is more suited to science fiction & fantasy fans.","review":"I have read all of James Patterson's books, and thoroughly enjoyed them. This new one, in my opinion, is more suited to science fiction and fantasy fans. The children gentically engineered to have wings and fly is just a bit far-fetched for my reading taste. Maybe Alex Cross will reappear in a new novel soon, and the flying children will fade into the sunset."},{"rating":"1","title":"This bird won't hunt","review":"Have read every Patterson book and liked every one. This departure from Alex Cross is a mistake. Book has a good idea but did not care for the content - clever but boring if you can believe it. Standard fare of oppressed good guys against insurmountable odds, etc. etc. etc. If you must read this - go to your local library and save the cash. Not much to brag about here."},{"rating":"1","title":"SILLY!!!!","review":"Please, please bring back Alex Cross, his grandmother,and his two kids!!This book was just silly, what were you thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something you would see on \\"The X-files\\"","review":"Did not like the book at all. His other books are all really good and this one was a big dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mediocre Patterson book.","review":"In my opinion, this book did not excite me as much as \\"Kiss the Girls\\" and \\"Jack and Jill\\". It did, however, thrill me more than \\"Along Came a Spider\\" and \\"Cat and Mouse\\". Overall, it was a very good book, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in comparison to other Patterson Books","review":"I have read all of James Patterson's books and this one was a disappointment. I am not, however,a fan of sci-fi type books. This book lacked the suspense and action of Patterson's other books and I found myself continuing to read thinking \\"it has to get better\\". I would not buy a sequel to this book at all. Alex Cross on the other hand - I can hardly wait til he is back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't like the other James Patterson mysteries","review":"The entire concept of \\"cloning\\" bugs me! Also, why mix the species? A human bird? For what reason? James get back to what you know, the missing persons, cops, and killers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing and amateurishly written","review":"Having been hooked by the well-delineated character of Alex Cross, I immediately picked up this book when I first saw it. I am sorry to report that it was disappointing in the extreme! The level of the writing (the \\"style\\", if you will) was evocative of novels written for teens and even pre-teens. I was amazed at the simplicity and redundancy of the writing. I also found Mr. Patterson's \\"trademark\\" of very short chapters merely annoying here. His \\"technique\\" of combining third-person and first-person narrative was also unnecessary and brought only confusion to the proceedings.The book was derivative of Dean Koontz, John Saul and even Fred Mustard Stewart (does anyone else remember him?), but in a \\"Cliff Notes\\" kind of way.Sorry, James. Stick to developing the characters of Cross and his family. Please never write another one like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"This book was such a disappointment after the previous novels from James Patterson. Story lines were not followed through, writing was at an elementary school level. Plot booring. It did not even seem like Patterson wrote this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD! BAD! BAD!","review":"I have read James Pattterson, but this did not feel like one of his books. I wonder who really wrote it? It was an old Dean Koontz story, but not nearly as well written. Save your money or, if you haven't yet, read one of his Alex Cross books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did James Patterson really write this book?","review":"I have read all of James Patterson's books. This one is so unlike any of the others and definitely not up to his standards of writing. It reads like it was written by a juvenile. He should stick with his former style of writing. His Alex Cross novels are the best. I kept wondering why he would write a novel such as this. He is not good at science fiction. I was disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but still good!","review":"I must admit, when I started reading this one, I certainly didn't expect the story that transpired. It is a thriller in the vein of the X-Files more than anything else. And as far as the actual writing is concerned, it is not up to Patterson's usual standards. The writing is very simplistic, and the character development isn't particularily great. So why 4 stars? Despite it's flaws, it is still an interesting and fast paced book. It's kind of like a Schwarzenegger movie - it won't win any awards, but it is stoill a fun, fast ride to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Lame","review":"I was looking for an author I hadn't read as a source for new reading material. I saw Along came a spider and thought I'd found it. The 120+ chapters in this book could have been shortened to 10... tops. I think it was more to fill up paper. I hope his other books are a better read.The plot plausable. Maybe it was a childrens book. It seemed to be written as one. Then maybe I was spoiled having just read John Connelly's and Michael Connelly's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is a negative star rating an option?","review":"This is the first and last Patterson book for me. The fanciful plot never gained any substance or picked up steam. It became painful to read this book. The writing was poor, the characters unbelievable. The suspense, unsuspenseful. I kept thinking to myself that it couldn't get any worse, so I would keep reading. But it did. All the way to the epilogue. \\"So many books, so little time.\\" So please, save your time and pick up a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Blows Alright","review":"This was the first book that I've read by James Patterson. I think that this book could have been better. The story is good but it's just not believable. I was never able to engage with the story. If only he had selected another type of genetic invention... but flying kids? I also felt that the story was too predictable. You just know everything is going to work out. Sorry, I just can't recommend this one. I am willing to give another one of his books a read however. One cannot totally judge ones writing by just one book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Been Named \\"When Children Fly\\"","review":"This book is below Patterson's usual quality and is not worth your time. Book should have been titled \\"When Children Fly\\" since that is the primary focus of the book. Patterson got too caught up in the act of flying vs. a good story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I have to finish it?","review":"Yes, this is a quick read, that is if you can manage to get pass the urge not to finish it. \\"Wind\\" was pretty good until I got half-way through. Then, it turned into a made for TV movie. I've been putting off reading the last 100 pages (which in actuality would only take about 45 minutes to read, tops) just because I've lost all interest in the characters. The book's premise is noble enough, but the way it developed is weak and incredibily unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ill wind","review":"Normally I wouldn't hesitate to praise James Patterson. I have loved all of his books...until this one. But this fantasy was over the top, and just not my cup of tea. I would suggest that now that Mr. Patterson has gotten this fable off his chest, he get right back to doing what he does better than anyone else....the super mystery thriller. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"could do better","review":"Lots of chapters-why? I think he wanted to make the book bigger.The story follows the lives of Frannie and her mysterious lodgerKit who stumble across a load of kids with wings. In this day and age the story can be considered quite plausible and in the way it's told quite readable but at the end of the day it was just another book on the shelf-nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started Good, got Boring, Ended Bad","review":"The build-up of the encounter with the mysterious girl who is the centerpiece of the book was interesting and held my attention very well. But soon after that, the plot development took a downhill turn and kept going... There seemed to be too much focus on the romantic stuff and not enough on the thrilling mystery stuff. I wanted so badly to read more character development with the girl and found her \\"normalcy\\" other than the obvious abnormal things, to be unbelievable. I was disappointed with the entire last half of the book. Written in beach-language, but not even a good summer beach read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Patterson does good again","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It was a welcome difference from the Alex Cross books. Although I truly enjoy those too. But having James Patterson deal with a whole different element was refreshing. I am recommending this book to anyone who like to read out of the ordinary once in a while. This book will keep you engrossed and rushing to turn the page. His writing is terrific. He is truly a talented and gifted writer. He shows he knows how to deal with many aspects of life. Even when dealing with the extraordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revelation","review":"This book \\"When the Wind Blows\\" was very, very good. I am definitely not the reader of my family, and I got into this book. This will be my first book over 200 pages i have finished and that's something to be proud of, from me.I like the short chapters because they keep me in tune with the book. That's one of the reasons I got into the book so well. The characters are very well developed, even the guards at the school. This was another reason I like this book.This is a great read and the start of something great in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Struggle","review":"I am a James Patterson fan. I loved every one of the Alex Cross novels. I've read and enjoyed several in the Women's Murder Club series and I'm becoming a fan of Michael Bennett. This book was a chore. I picked it up and read some, then put it down. I have seldom struggled to get through any novel like this and I am a sci fi fan. I do not recommend this novel at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condition of the book","review":"As soon as the book was opened it began to fall apart at the spine. Since I only paid a penny, guess I can't really complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars here","review":"(No stars at all given for this disaster, but the program doesn't allow that, so I gave it ONE only to submit my review) Having read Patterson before, I was looking forward to this audio book while on a long trip. Yuck. Are you SURE he wrote this? I think any student in ANY high school writing class could have done better: Lengthy exposition. & inner dialogue. Excruciating innocuous details during action scenes. Unbelievably simplistic dialogue. ONE dimensional characters. Cliched & hackneyed plot devises ad nauseum..... It was painful & annoying to listen to, but I was trapped in the car....hoping for SOME improvement....did he not have an editor?????? Yuck. Grade F."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah...","review":"It's unfortunate that the most believable parts of this yarn are the flying children. The plot is trite and obvious, and there's little in the way of surprise.Patterson picked a great topic, but his storytelling is unconvincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the Wind Blows . . .a book to remember for all eternity","review":"Wow! When the Wind Blows by James Patterson is such an exellent novel! I'm in awe of the feeling of compassion that I felt for Max and all the other winged children. Patterson brought me to a part of my brain I had never been before. The breath taking sequence of events left me gripped until the last page. It is one of the few books that I was actually mad that the story was over! I demand a sequel! It was one of the five books I have ever read that I entered another state of mind in which i was so involved in reading the story, that I couldn't hear anything around me, or respond to direct adressings by my fellow classmates and family. I give the book four stars, and three thumbs up. Way to go Patterson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad","review":"This was the first James Patterson book I had read and I couldn't believe how bad it was. I have since gone on to read many others of his books and, fortunately, most of them are better. I kept reading until the end hoping the story line would improve but it didn't. If you really feel the need to read this then try borrowing it from your local library rather than wasting your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The audiobook is great.","review":"The audiobook is very interesting. I stayed up past midnight listening to it. Adults as well as children will enjoy listening to this book. Once the story explains about the girl with wings, you can't help but get caught up in the suspense of what happens to her and the other children.Blair Brown reads with such feeling that she brings me to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very intresting & Thought provoking, A fun book for all ages","review":"James Patterson is my favorite auther and though I would not rate this his best, I would say its very enjoyable and fun. The story moves along at a fair pace and will hold your intrest. However this story seems to be so far out in left field that it seems theres no chance of fact or truth. I suggest it for the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"This was the first Patterson book I read and despite its lightweight contents, I read \\"Along Came A Spider\\", an Alex Cross novel by Patterson, which was a much better book. As noted in my one-line summary, WTWB was okay. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate it a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY RIVETING","review":"Being a first time James Patterson reader, I was surprised to see the pages fly by. Whilst the premise is sci-fi, the terror was real. I felt the book enveloped the reader by drawing them into the many emotions of Frannie and Kit, but feel the ending could have been rounded out a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced, interesting, worth a look!","review":"I had never read a James Patterson book so this was new. I enjoyed it very much and it was much different from my usual reading, of court room or murder mystery. The book flew, couldn't put down. Yes it was far fetched, but almost scarey when you think about what the medical research had already done. Think of it as a little science fiction, with mystery thrown in. A good book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"When a writer leaves his genre to explore new territory...it is always a risk. Sometimes, a risk is worth it. This is not! So far-fetched and awkward, I was uncomfortable reading this book. I find the Alex Cross novels a wonderful read but WHEN THE WIND BLOWS was agony."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Bummer","review":"I have read most of Patterson's books, and have especially enjoyed the character Alex Cross. But this book was different from all the others. This one was not very interesting. In fact it was down right disappointing. I think Patterson went a little too \\"Sci-Fi\\" even for a big \\"Sci-Fi\\" buff like myself. I think the only reason this book may sell is because of Patterson's much more successful past novels. Good luck on the next book Patterson, because this one's a dud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful book!","review":"First, let me state that I have enjoyed Mr. Patterson's series of books based on the fictional Washington DC detective, Alex Cross. On the strength of those prior books I purchased \\"When the Wind Blows\\". Before I was through the first chapter I knew I had made a terrible mistake. The book is a supreme disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go back to Alex Cross","review":"Even with willing suspension of disbelief this was too much. Could have used some serious editing. Flying scenes were inspiring the first few times, but everytime the story lagged, Max started flying. Also, too many loose ends not tied up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Research, research, research!","review":"I didn't find James Patterson's book all that bad. It was a quick read, and despite the convenient, unimaginative ending, the concept was quite intriguing. However, the sole thing which caught my attention was his lack of knowledge of Colorado. I have lived in Colorado my whole life. I have never seen fireflies or moose here. There are no Flatiron Mountains, they are simply the Flatirons. There were plenty of mistakes like this which were indicative of Patterson's simply looking at a map to place his story. If you want a good, authentic storyline, it does take some research into the setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"Patterson: \\"I'm going to take a year off.\\" ...Publisher: \\"Um, well, okay, but we should publish something with your name on it... do you have any unpublished manuscripts we could look at?\\" ...Patterson: \\"Well, I have this little thing I wrote in high school... I handed it in as my senior English project, but the teacher gave me a D on it. She said it was trite, cliched, juvenile and I didn't really have a grasp of the subject I was writing about, namely flying children, genetic engineering and a female perspective.\\" ...Publisher: \\"We'll take it.\\"So maybe this is hypothetical. But it would explain the existence of this amazingly disappointing book. Patterson had better bring Cross back if he wants to keep his fan base active."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took me a whole week!","review":"This book is so predictable! It's not worth the money even if the book goes on sale for 50%off the original store price. It's entertaining for a kid, however, if you are an avid patterson fan, this is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Bring Back Alex Cross! Go Away Flying Children!","review":"I was really disapointed with this book. I loved the Alex Cross Books, so I was delighted to see a new book. WRONG!!!!! Oh well, maybe next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Read","review":"I can't believe I read another one of your books, because I swore after \\"Kiss the Girls\\" I wouldn't pick up another one of your books. (You went too far in that book.) The temptation was too great and I just had to read your new book. I'm glad I did because, I couldn't put it down. It was a good fantasy book and you genuinely felt compassion for the little kids/birds. This was also a refreshing break from the Alex Cross series. I look forward to more creative stories in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book does not compare to the author's other works.","review":"I live to read a new novel by James Patterson. However, I did not enjoy this book anywhere near all the others. I'm just hooked on the Alex Cross series. Sometime it's hard for a fan to switch channels. I can appreciate an author's need and desire to broaden their works. I just expected more from James Patterson. I will continue to read his novel. James Patterson needs to get back to Alex Cross and company. Truly his best works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange....but good","review":"C'mon guys! This is not that bad!Yes, its a little out there, but thats the beauty of writing-there are no limits on a writers imagination. As much as I like the Alex Cross character, it would get boring having the same character in every book. I found the plot of this story very interesting-with characters being able to have superhuman powers-it would make for an interesting movie. Read this book with an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible book.","review":"This is without doubt the worst book I have read in years. A cross between a poor children's book and a romance novel. Hackneyed dialog, poor character development, a stupid plot. Patterson has never been in the mountains for sure. His setting isn't on this part of the planet. I was taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised and disappointed","review":"I've mostly enjoyed all of Patterson's books, but thought they were getting almost too \\"gory\\",so I was looking forward to a different type of book from him. What a shock this book was....I'm really having a difficult time believing he wrote this. In addition to the far-fetched plot,the writing was childish and the dialogue almost laughable.I'll take the gore over this any day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back Alex!","review":"James, you are a superb writer. But, please, do not write anymore books without Alex Cross. WTWB was certainly a departure from the norm. Not a good idea. I was disappointed. I am sure most of your Alex fans were disappointed as well.If ain't broke, don't fix it. I am looking forward to your next book with Alex Cross!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again","review":"The only reason I bought this book: I was at a used book store and found two books I wanted, but learned it woudl be cheaper if I bought four books instead of two.(Go figure.) I finished this book in one night, but I'm not sure how I muddled through. This is one of the most unbelievable books I've ever read. I've done the sci-fi thing with \\"Dune\\" and \\"Stranger In a Strange Land,\\" but I was more inclined to believe in a sand planet and an alien in our midst than these flying children that Patterson presents. The good guys are too good, the bad guys are too bad, and in the end I was hoping for an upset victory for the dark side because I was so tired of the characters. My recommendation: read something else. This doesn't even rise to the level of beach reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy, did this suck.","review":"(...) This was my first Patterson book and it's likely to put me off Patterson forever! I'd give it a negative five stars if possible. What a shoddy, cheap, crappy attempt at churning a novel out as fast as possible. People say they READ it in one night? I think Patterson WROTE it in one night. It was like a story written for a freshman English class. HORRIBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on You, Mr. Patterson","review":"I just finished this book and was so annoyed by it I had to put in my two cents.I've liked James Patterson's other books, but this one is a dud. What did he do, slap this together in a couple of weeks, if that? The topic has the potential to be fascinating, but he doesn't do it justice. The whole story is weak, the characters shallow.I was disappointed and regretted spending the time to finish it. (Just hoping it'd get better or the ending would somehow redeem it.) I'm going to think hard about reading anything he writes in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The very worst!","review":"I have always been a James Patterson fan and thought his books were among the best. However, When The Wind Blows is by far the very worst disjointed book he has ever written. The story weaves back and forth so many times that the reader is left to wonder just where, and what, the story was about. I am being very generous in giving this book ONE STAR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing ruins plot","review":"After the first ten chapters, I had to put this one down. The choppy writing-style (short sentences and paragraphs, constant repetition of words and themes) led me to believe that James Patterson doesn't think too highly of his readers, or their intellect. I had a difficult time getting into the book with so many story/character lines to follow and the narrator changing from first person present to omnipotent. The story may have been worth five stars...if you have the patience to cope with the elementary linguistic skills of the author (or his perceived audience). Some standards should not be compromised."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"When the Winds Blows\\" -Blows","review":"I couldn't believe what I was reading once I was reading it! I was hoping Alex Cross was going to pop out of the woods and save the day (and the novel). But as I got closer to finishing this book, I realized not even Cross could save this atrocity."},{"rating":"1","title":"just obnoxious","review":"Am I the only one who found \\"Maximum\\" the winged girl annoying? The same can be said for Frannie the vet. I was so disappointed with this book; I couldn't wait to get through it just so I could finally be done with it. The subject is a big departure from Patterson's previous bestsellers, and I have to say he did a terrible job with it. I am not the least bit interested in flying children. The obnoxious \\"love affair\\" between Kit and Frannie frankly made me nauseous. How much more unbelievable could this couple be? And how many more references to how Max felt while she was flying could Patterson have made? WHO CARES! This reminds me of Patricia Cornwell and \\"Hornet's Nest\\". Take a pass on this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"An 11-year old girl with wings?? I don't read Patterson for science fiction. I kept reading because I was looking for something positive, but it never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete rip-off. Plot and characters are simple minded.","review":"This book was NOT written in the previous style that author James Patterson writes in. The author should have changed his name to \\"Jane Patterson\\". This book reads like one of those so-called romance novels that women love to read. The plot is unbelievable, simple, stupid. The characters, who are supposed to be very smart people, are totally stupid and completely lacking in common sense. The sheer volume of emotional outpourings from the characters made me sick! This story would appeal to young immature teen-age girls but not to any adult that has any common sense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Egh.....","review":"Although Patterson has never been my favorite author, I have really enjoyed the previous books I've read from him, especially the new Lindsay Boxer ( I believe that's her name) series. Absolutely wonderful. But this book was very poorly written with bad dialogue, uninteresting characters, and a silly story line. This is something I would expect from a young writer just starting out, not one as seasoned as Patterson. Although he had the usual 2-3 page chapters (or less) it was absolutely dreadful getting to the end. Unless you're a compltely devoted Patterson fan, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good one.","review":"What a disappointment this book was. Mr Patterson has always been one of my favorite authors. It was just too far out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!! Absilutely fascinating!!!!","review":"I have read many of James Patterson's books, and I love his wonderful plot twists. The unexpected always happens. This book was no different.\\"When the Wind Blows\\" is absolutely my favorite Patterson book. I have read most of them, and believe me, they have all been excellent. But this one is totally unforgettable. The villains in the novel are as evil and as evasive as Gary Soneji, and the reader will immediately grows to hate them.Our heroes are as likeable as Alex Cross. The reader will readily grow to like them.Patterson once again develops his characters perfectly, and we end up knowing as much about them as we do about Alex Cross and John Sampson.Excellent book James. Keep 'em coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Mr Patterson","review":"What IN THE WORLD made you you write this piece of junk? I guess you just wanted to try something different. Really enjoyed all your other books. But PALEEZE don't try this again. I did finish it, just to see how bad it was. With your short, short chapters I got very good at skipping to the last sentence and knowing everthing about the chapter. This is rally shameful and you know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The premise was interesting, but the story was dragged out.","review":"Compared to Patterson's previous books, this was disappointing. The repetitive description of Max's feelings were irrelevant to the story and arrogant. While the plot was unusual, I did not appreciate chapters being one page."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a book that should never have been published!","review":"If this book had been written by anyone other than a well known author, it would never, never have been published. The characters are unbelievably flat. The premise, while intriguing, is poorly executed. It got one star from me only because there was not a zero star choice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stick to alex cross stories!!","review":"I finished reading this book only because I couldn't believe how outrageous the story was becoming. What a disappointment for fans who were expecting an engrossing story on the level of the Alex Cross series. Is is just me or does this book read like a clone of a Dean Koontz novel? I really thought the authors might have switched names just for kicks. It has all the earmarks of a Koontz novel; an unbelievably handsome and macho hero who is skilled in fighting and a beautiful women who is equally talented. They are set against an evil enemy yet they somehow manage to save the day. Sort of like The Watchers only with a flying girl instead of a thinking dog. Mr. Patterson, stick to what you do best - police thrillers. You are definetely out of your area of expertise."},{"rating":"1","title":"REAL DISSAPOINTMENT FROM PATTERSON","review":"I strongly agree with \\"Reader from W. Brookfield, MA: This was not the James Patternson we know and love so well. I thought the book started well but then is was like a 12 year old wrote it. This man cannot write in the first person!!!!! Stick with Alex Cross stories. I really think I liked Midbight Club the best of all his books but the next few were good. I also buy Patterson's books the minute the come out. I read the dust jacket and if it isn't too off the subjects that I would be interested in, I buy it. I had until now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Idea In Search of A Writer","review":"This book is a huge disappointment given the quality of Patterson's previous thrillers. Although the basic premise is interesting, the execution is poor and lazy. Everything about it is predictable and obvious - cardboard characters and improbable plotlines abound on every page. Venturing into the realm of science/fiction/fantasy, Patterson manages to dredge up nearly every cliche of the genre without any originality or style. It's a quick read - and you get the feeling that Patterson spent less time writing it than you'll spend reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I have to say I was very disappointed in this book. I kept waiting for the old James Patterson style to shine through but it just wasn't there. It used to be that when he wrote a new book I bought it sight unseen - not anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment. The story line too far out .","review":"I look forward to any book by James Patterson. This story line,however, was a bit too far fetched for even my usually vivid imagination. The concept of Genetic engineering has always interested me, but children with wings, REALLY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"James Patterson Lite","review":"The characters and the premise were fine. I just wish that he had added more suspense. I liked the story, but kept waiting for something truly exciting to happen; unfortunately it never did. Certainly worth reading, but not as good as his other books (Cross AND non Cross)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can hardly believe James Patterson wrote this drivel,","review":"Patterson's Alex Cross books are closely plotted with characters that are believable and that the reader cares about, totally unlike this science fantasy that would not even make a tv movie plot. I wonder if Patterson's 14 year old daughter wrote it and Patterson published it under his name just to see if a best selling author could get an otherwise unpublishable book in print. I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Patterson boldly goes where he has not been before","review":"James Patterson boldly goes where he has not been before and it's definitely a mistakes. He unwisely ventures from his familiar dominion of the ever-successful psychological thriller (the Alex Cross series) to this childish genetical \\"thriller\\" (if I may say so, for this book hardly thrills). The book moves quickly with its plot: Each chapter is about two to three pages, as his books always are. The central male character, Kit Harrison, shamelessly copied from Mulder of the X-files, goes in search of a genetic experiment, under specific order from the director of the FBI not to continue investigating the case that was declared closed some years ago.(Sound familiar?) If you read one book this year, read Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six. If you plan to read all the books published this year, leave out this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent,quick,exciting, non-stop action. A great read.","review":"Although not on the caliber of his Alex Cross novels. When The Wind Blows is an excellent read. His writing style is ever changing with each story yet remain the same in it's captivation and ability to totally draw the reader in. I highly recomend it for any Patterson lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. An utter disappointment from a master author.","review":"Unbelievable. James Patterson is one of my favorite authors, and I have read every book. This was one of the worst books I have ever read. Unbelievable that he could have penned it. An utter departure from his last six novels. Alex Cross would be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a BAD Saturday cartoon.","review":"OK.

Please bring back Alex Cross as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Alex Cross when you need him?","review":"I also read an advanced copy of this book and I had to wonder if Mr. Patterson was planning another rewrite or if this was actually the finished product. The story concept intrigued me, but the book itself was a major disapointment. I suggest people re-read \\"Cat & Mouse\\" instead of buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the wind blows kids fly","review":"This book is a bit far fetched to be believable but it is still a good read. If you're after a sensational murder thriller book then you've come to the wrong place as this book isn't that sort of James Patterson novel.This book's about kids with wings, yeah you read right, kids with wings! Of course not everyone is happy for these kids to be out in the real world with their wings so the classic good verses evil Patterson style comes into effect.If you only read Patterson books for the serial killer theme then this book probably is not for you. If you like the fast paced short chapters and anything Patterson writes then you should get this. The Beach House and The Jester are better non detective/serial killer books in my opinion. This is a good read and worthwhile purchase but I would recommend every other Patterson book over this one. Buy this if you've read all the others first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly premise. Contrived characters.","review":"If one suspends reality and imagines a huge secret project being run by medical geniuses in Colorado that is creating children with wings to fly, and astonishing intelligence, and if one buys into the sale of these creatures to foreign (and unfriendly) countries (for who knows what purpose), and adds mysterious deaths, a lonely but independent beautiful, widowed woman vet, with awareness problems about her late husband and current friends, and the mysterious, handsome, stranger with a secret, you have all the elements of an afternoon soap opera. So, if you like soap operas - go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"I just have one question to ask: How does such abominable garbage ever, ever get printed. If this was the first book that Mr. Patterson pitched to a publisher they would laugh him out of the building. This is a book I would use to teach my four year old son how to read. The sentences were absurd being three or four words long. I even quoted some of the lines to my mom and dad and we had quite the laugh. I don't know what his other books are like but this one was horrendous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop it now for the sake of us all","review":"Does this guy have a medical condition that prevents him from writing more than five words without adding a full stop?

I found myself in a situation where I could not wait for the book to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic and DULL!!","review":"This book reads as if the author has found a leaflet on writing thrillers and followed it to the letter. Corny oh so sexy hero, strong yet vulnerable heroine, One dimentional bad guys, its all here. I think that if I read another pathetic, unnecessary, wistful sentence using the word fly, flying or any other variant I would have given the book itself a flying lesson from my window! I accept that it was supposed to be a slightly dreamy and tense thriller, but just having cliffhanger after cliffhanger does not cut it. You have to care about the characters to understand their suffering or fears, and you need to relate to the characters to care about them, and if anyone knows anyone who is anything like the people in this book, then you should probably display them in a museum."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be 0 stars if it were possible...","review":"Horribly disappointing, especially given the past Alex Cross novels. Patterson tried to create a Crichton-esque novel that would \\"push the envelope\\" and present frightening implications for our society. He fell way short, however--I've seen better SF in high school. The plot--a genetically-engineered child who can fly--was simply ridiculous, especially for anyone remotely familiar with biotechnology. The characters were flat and stereotyped, while the writing was simplistic. To add insult to injury, there were lapses in story continuity. If Patterson didn't know better than to publish this, his editor should have. Stick with Alex Cross, Mr. Patterson..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elementary","review":"Shorten the text, add pictures and voila - a children's book. The plot and dialogue were unusually basic - I'm too old for this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"I read the book and enjoyed it while I was reading it, but after it was over I just realized how much time I wasted. I truly hate James Patterson's narrative and writing style. I think his books are aimed at a generation that hates to read. Everyone enjoys his short chapters, but to me they are a cop out. If you put all of the paragraphs together and the chapters were longer, the books would be dime novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book-you must read","review":"I was forced to read it by my mother I have never read any of his works but I have hooked from the first paragragh to the last period i suggest this for people of all ages"},{"rating":"1","title":"very average","review":"This book is very repetitive. Not worth reading, unless you are a fan of the author or the topic ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I have one word for this book: GARBAGE. If I could have chosen no stars, I would have. I liked Kiss the Girls but none of his later books even measured to that. I couldn't get up to page 100 in this one. Pure undeveloped, not thought provoking, shallow trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to James Patterson Usual Standards","review":"I am an avid reader of James Patterson's books. When I've finished one, I always feel sad and can't wait for his next book. I enjoy his ability to surprise me at every turn. \\"When The Wind Blows\\" was a hugh disappointment. The book was far too predictable and too sci-fi for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing story and overly simple language.","review":"I couldn't wait to read the latest Patterson novel. What an unpleasant surprise. I cannot believe this book was written by the same author who wrote Kiss the Girls, etc. In fact, I looked to see if maybe another person co-wrote this book. The language is feminine, as if a woman wrote the book. The sentences are written on a 5th grade level - boring. I finished the book because I was curious to see how it ended. The entire story is too far-fetched. Hopefully Patterson will get back to writing for an adult audience with his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous, Uninteresting...","review":"I couldnt believe this was James Patterson, the writter of so many nail biting tails. Even when i was coming to the end of it, i could just put it down and come back after 1-2 weeks. I thought it must have been one of his older books but alas no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unbearable","review":"I have listened to a lot a lot of really bad books on tape, butthis has to be the WORST. Stock, one-dimensional characters,cliche-filled dialog, far-fetched plot--everything that makes for bad listening/reading. I bought it for a long trip in my car. After a few hours I found it easier to listen to static on my radio than to listen to this.I tried to think of one thing that was not awful (to warrant the single star I was forced to give in this review) about this book and I finally came up with this. The author did a reasonably good job of researching his biology. The science is at least as good as other books of this type and probably about as good as it could be given the far-fetched premise of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his Greatest but entertaining nonetheless","review":"A little far fetched and not as well written as his others but I still read this book in just a couple of days because after all Patterson knows how to keep your interest piqued!! I recommend it, but I can see why some of the reviewers were disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave New World / The X Files","review":"My expectations for this book were modest due to varying on-line reviews I had read before purchasing, but I was pleasantly surprised and entertained, reading the book almost non-stop over a weekend. A brief analysis of what to expect are as follows........................................... Strengths: Topical and well-researched science fiction (shades of \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"The X-Files\\"), Lots of warmth in the story (main characters, leading man & woman, are great). Weaknesses: \\"Bad Guys\\" lack credibility (ala James Bond film megalomaniacs with hired help), Key events/transitions in the middle and late stages of the book are too fast and not believable (full-on killings and destruction). **Summary** Aside from some overdone action-scenes in some parts, the book is full of warmth, fires the imagination, and is guaranteed to sit in the memory banks for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so typical Patterson","review":"I rarely enjoy science-fiction, fantasy-type of stories but this one captivated me from the first page. This book was given to me by a friend and it's been on my bookshelf for quite some time, because I'd heard negative things about it. Once I became desperate for some reading material I resorted to this and it surprised me. I've read most of Patterson's books and enjoyed every one of them but, from what I'd heard, I didn't think this one was going to match up. Contrary to my beliefs, this was one of his best. I think maybe because it is so out of the ordinary, so imaginative, so \\"cutting-edge\\" such a creative storyline it kept me reading and reading....I hope Patterson does more stories like this, I know I'll read them. I think a lot of people will have trouble with this book because they will expect \\"typical\\" James Patterson. I hope they can open up their minds and imaginations and let this work for them. It's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting at first, then you wish there was more!","review":"At first this book was almost too far fetched but once I got into it I couldn't put it down.

Really makes you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the previous novels","review":"I think that people who have read other books from james Patterson will not like very much this novel on a completely new and strange subject.

The ability to go completely out of the box and write about something totally out of his norm! The plot was a little off the wall, but was very entertaining and out of the ordinary. I couldn't put the book down.Bravo! Patterson gets two thumbs up from me on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy turned Nightmare","review":"This is the first (and will be the last)Patterson book I've read. It read like it was written by the 11 year old Max; not a mature Best Selling? author. The over use of words like \\"cool\\" and \\"screw\\" either from the mouths of children or the adult? Dr. Frannie was laughable, when it wasn't surpose to be; and will somebody please explain this dialogue between Kit and Frannie when he tells her \\"You struck me as brave, wise, adventurous, OBSTREPEROUS? (which means clamorous, turbulent, unruly) as hell\\". What, he couldn't find enough adjectives to discribe her?! You may wonder why I bothered to finish this book...I kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't. Sorry Mr. Patterson, YOU BLEW IT with when the wind blows!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not force myself to finish this book.","review":"I really like James Patterson's works and was surprised by the utterly disappointing plot and premise of When the Wind Blows. For the first time in may years I did not (could not) finish the book - it has gone out with the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even rate one full star.","review":"I was truly shocked by how bad this book is. Mr. Patterson evokes no suspense, his characters are one-dimensional, the plot is just plain silly. Perhaps a more talented writer could have done something creative with this premise.The book reads like it was written by a thirteen year old girl for other thirteen year old girls. I suffered through 148 pages hoping the writing would get better, skimmed through a few more pages, and finally decided not to waste any more time trying to be entertained by this piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreck!","review":"What dreck! This is supposed to be the work of \\"America's No. 1 Thriller Writer\\"? What an embarrassment for American readers. The best thing about this novel was that it was such a quick read. I would have thought if someone was going to convince a reader about such a remarkable premise as bio-engineered flying children, the writer would at least make an attempt to do some research and perhaps make some of the plot or characters believable. The plot is riddled with holes and the astoundingly stupid actions by supposedly superior intellects made me want to shriek out loud. The style of writing sounds like the work of an eighth grade student trying to rush his homework and the characters were non-dimensional. I think Mr. Patterson dictated this story while in a coma; thank God I borrowed this book from a library and didn't waste any money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love or Hate","review":"This is the type of novel that you will either be sucked into immediatly or abruptly repelled by. As for me, after reading the first chapter, I was locked in.When the Wind Blows is a very intriguing \\"what-if\\" story that literally blew me away. I enjoyed the different viewpoints that the story offered and how well the characters were painted. The way it was written, the book almost displayed itself to me as if it were on the big screen rather than nestled comfortably in my hands.If you are the type who likes their mysteries wrapped in science-fiction with just the slightest bit of fantasy sneaked in, then you will enjoy this novel. If not, you may find the book, in simplest words, \\"stupid\\" or \\"crappy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"@GMS","review":"This book was an increadible journey of finding out about experamental studies done on a group of children taken from there mother's befor birth.

Fortunately, \\"Cat & Mouse\\" was entertaining. Unfortunately, \\"When The Wind Blows\\" and \\"Hide & Seek\\" fall in the same category -- flat characters, short/choppy chapters, and absurb plots. Perhaps Patterson feels cursed to be attached to a serial character in Alex Cross. He should take greater care of his literary reputation and bookselling draw when taking a detour from Cross. Face it, there are about 100 blank sheets in this book, the type is large and the lines are double spaced. We should expect more in quality, quantity, and value from a constant NY Times Bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad. Really, really bad.","review":"Okay, here's an example of 'suspense' in this book: As she enters a house she thinks, \\"Wait! A trap! But it was too late!\\" That closes the chapter.

Unless he writes something on the lines of his earlier works, I am never going to buy or read his future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of His Time and My Money","review":"I struggled to finish this book and when I had, I wondered why I bothered. It's like he wrote it in his sleep. There were so many loose ends, it's hard to know where to start. For instance, they got to the army base at 1200 hrs then were supposed to meet the General at 0200 hrs. Oh, Really? They waited until 2.00 am to see a guy when they arrived at noon? Where were the editors when they were needed. The science is far-fetched, I should know, I have 2 degrees in biology. The throw away references to current pop idols and fashions should be left to Stephen King - he does it better. For all the misguided people who thought it was a great book, I have an infinitely better choice - \\"The Watchers\\" by Dean Koontz. It's more entertaining and in a way, more believable.James Patterson, please go back to Alex Cross - he's much more believable than these 2-dimensional ones in WTWB."},{"rating":"1","title":"#1 Bestseller not befitting of this novel","review":"I lean toward #1 Bestseller lists, but this novel has changed that for me. A difficult-to-pick-up book once I started it, I found the characters, including the bio-engineered children very uninteresting.

I am looking forward to reading this book whenever I have a break."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wind? Hell; this BOOK blows!","review":"This is by far the worst written book I have ever read. What's wrong with it? Where oh where do I begin?1) The writing is childish at best. The use of the ! is quite often and annoying. Sentences like (\\"The glass crashed to the floor!) gave me the sense that a fourth grader was writing the book.2) The characters are so 1 dimensional it's sad. There was an attempt to create characters that we'd care about, but it just never \\"took off\\" <Pardon the pun>3) The dialogue was so bland and boring that I had trouble finishing the book.4) The \\"chapters\\" are 1-4 pages long, and that seriously affected the pace for me. It seems as if the book were made up as he went along, with little to no thought involved at all.Save your money.This is the 1st Patterson book I've read.

However, the great news for Patterson fans is that this time out he's gone on a new creative reach and come up with the most consistently fascinating and suspenseful story he's ever written -- which is, I fully realize, saying an awful lot. Read it and you'll see: there's true magic in \\"When the Wind Blows\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing for Patterson","review":"This is definitely not at the same level as other works by Patterson. It lacks the sitting on the edge of your seat suspense which is normal for Patterson. The plot was interesting but characters and the writing style were not well developed. It was a decent read and it leaves you wanting to know more about what happens to the characters. Not good but not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner","review":"James Patterson has done a number of overlapping novels around the theme of beautiful genetic hybrid children who fly. His books are often page-turners that engage the reader almost against your will. One is inclined to forgive the loose ends of plot development that he leaves lying around. However, the notion that a large group of renegade genetic manipulators could operate in secret and with impunity from law enforcement (not to mention investigative journalists!) as it kills off its opponents and conducts massive man-hunts for seven flying kids, is a little too much of a reach.Still worth the read, even if you don't buy the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing!","review":"I put this book aside after 50 pages.

Please - if you have not read \\"Along Came A Spider\\" & his books through \\"Cat & Mouse\\". DON'T START WITH THIS ONE! This book lacks the suspense that stimulates natural curiousity and anxiousness when reading one of James Patterson's books. The fictional characters and bland story line leave little to the imagination and allows the reader to predict the ending. Alex Cross & the story lines of serial killers allows the readers imagination to run wild because the plot is of something that happens in todays society and we fear it. You don't know what will happen next. This one is far too predictable and frankly, turning the page is just as satisfying as closing the book.

By far the worst of his extinguished career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but enjoyable....","review":"I enjoyed this novel. It was an easy read and I finished it in just a few days.

Having winged children as the heroes was a nice touch. I look forward to the next Alex Cross novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, badly written","review":"Like all James Patterson's books, this was a good story idea, but poorly executed. Patterson's characters are interesting and his plot lines are clever, but the dialog runs from awkward to silly, and his pacing is often confusing and forced.

The story is too unbelievable; the characters weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are looking for Alex Cross, this book won't cut it.","review":"It is difficult for me to ascertain whether it was the story I didn't like or whether I simply missed Alex Cross. As of late too many authors seem to be \\"jumping on this bandwagon\\" of genetic engineering going haywire coupled with government complicity. The plot was far too predictable. Suffice it to say this is no great work of literature for my taste, but if you just want pure escapism and enjoy Koontz, it rates OK. (And wait until it comes out in paperback.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment!","review":"I bought a copy of this book as soon as I saw it for sale because I've enjoyed all of James Patterson's books in the past. I usually check out customer reviews for new books before I buy them but in this case I didn't feel I needed to because all of his other books have been so good. I don't know how Patterson could have strayed so far with this one, though! It was written as though its reader were a 12-year old. I thought I was reading one of my daughter's \\"Babysitter Club\\" books. It lacked the depth of character that his other books had. I really don't think that he spent much time writing this book as he obviously should have. I know I'll first check out the reviews before I buy another book by James Patterson."},{"rating":"2","title":"He has done it again!!!","review":"He's done it again -- still my favorite author.

So many plot flaws, such poor editing: In Chapter 105 (Chapter 105!!), how does Max know about events that she was not witness to? Why do Kit and Frannie take such stupid risks in the 2nd half of the book, and can anyone believe the \\"auction\\" scene? Dozens more, but I don't want to spoil the plot for those who haven't read it. Also, shouldn't Mr. Patterson (or one of his editors, if they had read the book) know that 2pm is 1400 hours military time, not 0200 hours?

However, Patterson is never one to disappoint. He explores the fine lines of genetic experimentation that many people don't want to think about. This book steps up and takes a swing at the controversial gene swapping that is sweeping over the news.This book is filled with twists, turns & surprises. As a high school biology teacher, I assigned it for extra credit. Incredibly, many of my students read & truly enjoyed the foray into the secret world of government labs.

The writing was amateurish and the characters were cartoons. The winged girl was supposed to be unusually intelligent and yet this was not demonstrated in any way I could see. From reading other reviews I understand that this book is an extreme departure for Patterson and that a lot of his fans are deeply devoted, normally.

Isaac Asimov he's NOT. I can't believe I finished this miserable little story.

This book only confirms my suspcions. When The Wind Blows is a contrived X-Files meets Frankenstein rip-off. The plot concerns a lonely women, whose husband died mysteriously (of course) and the driven FBI agent who is on the case. Oh yea, get this: the agent is a maverick working against the wishes of his superiors. That has never been done before! The book gets off to an insipid chase sequence when two young kids escape from a testing facility. The kids are genetically mutated and have been given wings. Which humans have always needed. Of course the kid ties into the FBI agent's case and so does the woman. It turns out the woman's husband was involved with the testing. Every plot surprise is anything but. I could go on about uninspired dialogue but why don't you just go and read anotheer book. Or wait until another Alex Cross novel is written by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointing Is My Feeling on This Book","review":"I was so disappointed with this book that I could only read half of it.

I was discussing his new book in the library and it was suggested to me to read the library copy first before buying. The better suggestion would have been to not waste my time.

His case follows scientists who are taking away babies from mothers and giving them wings and the abillity to fly.

I love a science fiction angle, but it's nice if some threads can be drawn to reality to make the premise seem plausible.

I've been a big Stephen King fan at times - he lost me during the \\"Insomnia\\" years but has gotten me back with \\"Green Mile\\" and \\"Bag of Bones\\" - so I can suspend my disbelief long enough to buy into the idea of a bird-girl. All the parts of the puzzle were there for me - Patterson just never put them together. It's like he connected all the easy edge pieces (the ones with straight sides) and left everything else in the middle just sitting there. I was left feeling that this book is too thin. The characters have no depth; key scenes went by much too fast and with too little detail; even the epilogue was flat. Its OK for Patterson to move from suspense to science fiction, but in his effort to write compelling science, he forgot to give us good fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointing - go back to Alex Cross","review":"Judging from the reviews, you either love this book or hate it.

True, it is quite interesting and somewhat a departure for the author, but it just doesn't \\"grab\\" you like his other books. Basically, the book is about a scientific experiment conducted that has left two children with wings. A manhunt is conducted in order to \\"put these two children to sleep\\" and somehow, a vet (who is also dealing with her own personal tragedy) stumbles upon this whole issue as well. My personal opinion is that the author tries too hard to grab the attention of the reader, at the expense of the plot. It is not a bad book, just something which falls way short of expectations. I would still recommend \\"Kiss the girls\\" as the best book by the author and would rather give \\"When the wind blows\\" a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson's best to date!","review":"This is the best book to date that James Patterson has written. As much as I love Alex Cross books, When the Wind Blows is extremely well written and equally suspenseful. Renegade FBI agent Kit Harrison (aka Tom Brennan) is the key figure in a complicated plot that seems too surreal to believe. Yet the advances of modern science make one stop to think about the horrific possibilities of this book. This is a first rate read. I read it on a flight from Dallas to Seattle and couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back Alex Cross","review":"I too was also very disappointed in this book. I love James Patterson's books and was expecting something along the line of his previous stuff.

Because the nursery rhyme title is so similar to the Cross series, I expected a Cross story! But boy was I disappointed. This story is just too.... simple.

Not even a fantastic editor could have saved this one. I've read all but two of Patterson's other books. They were, by and large, interesting and gripping novels. THIS novel didn't even seem like it was written by the same author. The writing was very stilted, awkward, and childish. Half the time I had to re-read certain paragraphs, just so I could catch the enormous leaps that the story would take.The story itself was terribly illogical, inconsistent, and made little sense overall. Patterson's use of Hardy-Boys-style \\"cliffhangers\\" at the end of certain chapters was annoying and an insult to the reader's intelligence.The sad thing is, it could have been a GREAT story if it had been written better.\\"Along Came a Spider\\" was good. \\"Kiss the Girls\\" was good. \\"When the Wind Blows\\" is just plain awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"What dreck!","review":"How did the publisher let Patterson get away with marketing this one for adults?

But his simplistic writing style and storytelling are no match for Koontz. His dialog is forced, \\"nerdish\\". He throws in current jargon, but it doesn't sound hip--it's silly. And the exposition...whenever the heros meet face-to-face with turncoat enemies, the adversaries insist on telling their side of the story. It was just laughable that these evil, heartless murderers would take time to confess their deeds. And there are a couple of inconsistencies that make it seem like Patterson is under the gun to turn out a book every year. The most flagrant inconsistency was the misuse of military time at the end of the book.

Jimmy, if you're tired of Cross then introduce a new protagonist (a la DeMille), but please stick to what you know. I love Patterson, and it pains me to say this, but this was one of the silliest books I have ever read (Is it really necessary to make a Fiona Apple allusion?). I hope JP has the sci-fi out of his system for next time, because this genetic tampering X-files stuff isn't going to fly (no pun intended). Come back, Alex!

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem as if James Patterson wrote this book at all. The characters are all flat, text is redundant (how many times do we need to read about the feeling of flying?) and the plot pretty predictable. Very unlike Patterson's other books, with Alex Cross a very real, multi-dimensional character. I guess I will stick to Patterson's Alex Cross books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is what commercial fiction is becoming, kill me now.","review":"This was one of the most idiotic, worst written novels I've ever read. I'm not against fantastic plots, providing the characters and language rise to the challenge of making the fantastic believable, which is certainly not the case here. The characters are cliches. The language wouldn't dazzle a nine-year-old. Even the sex scenes are uninspired. Patterson couldn't have spent more than two weeks writing this. Hopefully he was paid enough to retire and make room for someone with skill and respect for his audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn it now!","review":"This book is such utter rubbish that after reading it you might even want to look at the cover to ensure that you have just read a book by the highly raved author James Patterson and you will be probably surprised that you have. The book gives us a child with wings, an FBI agent who believes in the existence of biological experiments and a woman whose husband was murdered for no reason apparent to her. This combination of characters gives you a book with what must the most ridiculous plot around and the most childish narration you can get. The story is very predictable and not in the least bit exciting. It does get at times so ridiculous that you might want to throw back your head to laugh that you are actually reading a James Patterson novel. Impossible, boring and a downright insult to the intelligence of the human race as whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading Jack & Jill I was looking forward to reading this book, and am extremely disappointed.

Although Patterson found a way to tell this story of genetic alteration and a possible governemet cover-up, the story itself was a bit too far fetched. I did find that his research made the story more believiable, however, all the medical research books in the world could not have made me want to continue reading this story. I did finish it and while I was disappointed with the conclusion, it was understandable to me why he ended it the way he did. To sum up may feelings for the book, I am going to have to give it a thumbs down and not encourage a Patterson groupie like myself to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winged Children - Give Me a Break","review":"This book was among the worst I've read in a long time. I cannot for the life of me figure out why I finished this one. I guess I had hoped it would get better. But it didn't. The plot was predictable; the writing elementary; and if this was supposed to be a medical thriller, it missed the mark completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the genre's worst written books","review":"James Patterson has come up with some decent plots before, but both the plot and the writing in When the Wind Blows are unbearable. A government scheme to create kids who can fly sounds like a bad X-files episode, but the writing is downright atroicious. More than 100 chapters of 1 or 2 pages each, multiple points of view, and some of the stupidest scenarios you could ever see in a horror book. Patterson obviously wanted to come up with a plot that's similar to John Saul's works, but he doesn't pull it off with anywhere near the finesse that Saul does (most of the time.) Complete garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak Entertainment","review":"Reading this book reminds me of those nights when I plopped down in front of the tube and flipped channels until I found some half-witted but vaguely entertaining made-for-tv movie. At the end I felt like I'd just wasted an chunk of my life without receiving any real value.This book might be a real scare story for people who have such a simplistic view of genetics that they find plausible the idea you can shake a bunch of bird DNA together with some human DNA and voila you get a flying girl! But for most of us the basic premise is just going to seem laughable.It's a thin and dopey story populated by cardboard thin characters. Do yourself a favor and find something else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage Is Too Nice A Word For This One!","review":"I wouldn't have liked this even at age 8. I like things that are at least remotely possible. (Tom Sawyer - Huck Finn ?) Or well written, definite fantasy such as Grimm's/Andersen's fairy tales - Wizard of Oz - Alice in Wonderland, et al.When The Wind Blows fails on all counts. It is unforgiveably poorly written as well as being inferior fantasy. Those of you who would have given Patterson no stars, if available, are much too generous. I'm holding out for negative stars.Like the majority of fans of Patterson's, I enjoy his Alex Cross books, as well as The Women's Murder Club books. His other novels, such as The Thomas Berryman Number are O.K.

Yes, I read it in hopes that he would rescue the premise. He didn't. I was even dumb enough to read the tween novel Maximum Ride. I don't reccomend any of the three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did James Patterson REALLY write this?","review":"I can not believe this is a James Patterson book. At first the book was OK. I feel I gave it a sincere chance.(Although it was very predictable) The further I read, the sillier it got.

This is the worst book I've ever read, except for One-Way Propeller Night Coach by John Travolta. And it was close.Seriously, this is a book for a child or a simpleton. It's boring, silly, grating, nauseating, and literally impossible in about 15 different ways. Worst of all, there's now a sequel!Hint for Patterson -- An 80lb girl would need a wingspan of 20 feet wide minimum to fly (and she would look more like a giant deformed bird than a human).

This was plain irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A strange disappointment","review":"I'm a big Patterson fan and was extremely disappointed with When the Wind Blows, although I did get through it very quickly. I found the premise too creepy to start with. And the ending totally simplistic. After 400 pages of not trusting anyone Kit & Frannie go for the \\"Happily ever after ending\\" A bit far fetched. I wish Patterson would bring Alex Cross & family back again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written page turner!","review":"Most of the time when I read the back of a cover and it seems sci-fi, I'm anxious if the author will make the book believable enough to \\"care\\" about the characters - Patterson has done this quite well.The book is a page turner with characters you care about and a while a bit sci-fi, the story is well written where you believe that something like the story in the book can actually happen. Overall, I'd rate the book a solid 8/10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful is all I can say","review":"I was checking out a Maximum Ride book for my daughter and I read that the character was inspired by Max, a girl with wings from When the Wind Blows. It sounded interesting so I picked it up now I wished I hadn't. The characters are so one dimensional, the descriptions are repeated over and over, and the book drags on way too long. I couldn't stand it anymore and just jumped ahead to the end and I didn't miss a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the James Patterson book I wanted to read.","review":"I got a advance readers copy and I was very disappointed. I'm glad I didn't buy this book because a James Patterson book is always on my list and this book is nothing like any of his previous books or anything I would read. I have alot of trouble getting into a book where a bird girl is the main character. Frannie and Kit seemed a afterthought and I found both of them boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I am a huge James Patterson fan, but I have to admit that this one was a true disappointment. From the first page, I could not connect with any of these characters but I continued to read, hoping to develop some interest in them. No thrills or major surprises throughout. I do admire his courage to try something different, but I think he should stick to what he does best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, James, James, James.... Very, very poor......","review":"Being a Patterson fan for many years, all I can say is what a major disappointment. Why authors are allowed to write such dribble on the back of one's success, I'll never ever understand... If I have to pay approx. $25 dollars for classics like \\"Kiss the Girls\\", \\"Jack & Jill\\", and \\"Cat & Mouse\\", then this book is worth $1.99, (if even that).If you do have to go out and buy this book, which you probably will if you have read previous books by James Patterson... Wait until the paperback comes out, and feed it to the nearest goat....."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thriller I've read since the last Michael Crichton","review":"I had heard of James Patterson - friends of mine are huge fans - but his books didn't strike me as my cup of tea. But a friend who works at a bookstore gave me some sort of advance copy of this and said 'trust me; it's fun, uplifting (no pun intended) and you'll be mad at me tomorrow because you'll be up all night.\\" And I was. What a ride! Great characters, great science, an X-Files feel to it, and just a great escape. Two great female lead characters, which is also refreshing, and, well, to say anything else would give too much away. Plan to be at work late the next day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a reach","review":"Okay maybe I don't like science fiction. Which is what this was to me. Kids that can fly....whatever. I know sometimes James Patterson goes out of the crime/mystery that's normal for him. i.e. Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas (which I loved), but this one was just too wierd for me. I was never sold on his world in this book. One good thing is that I read it really fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect 'Flight' of Fancy for a Lazy Afternoon","review":"So, its not great literature! Its a great story! A feat of a 'soaring' imagination! I couldn't stop reading it. Set in Colorado near Boulder, the story moves a lightning fast pace which is hurried along by abbreviated chapters told either from animal doctor Frannie O'Neill's, first person point-of-view or from a third person-point-of-view which highlights the mindset of the other major characters.And is the premise really all that unbelievable? How many baby-boomers out there would do just about anything to reverse the aging process---why not a little gene-splicing to quicken evolution just a tad bit and tip the scales in favor of the human race?All in all whether or not the idea is plausible, it still works as a story--I mean we all loved Peter Pan didn't we?If you have a free afternoon, a bright blue sky, sunscreen and a comfortable lawn chair, check out this book and have a great few hours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time.","review":"I've read nearly all of James Patterson's books and this was the most dissappointing. His others like Jack and Jill, Hide and Seek and Kiss the Girls were a whloe lot better.The word that comes to mind when describing this book is FLUFF. Also, maybe I am too picky but I hate finding gross errors in novels-even if they are fiction. Sorry I don't have the book in front of me to give a page reference, but did it bother anyone else when the book wrapped up in a meeting at 0200 hours on the lawn. That's 2:00 in the morning-not 2:00 in the afternoon!!! And it was very apparent the meeting wasn't being held in the dark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Alex Cross, James","review":"I was very disappointed in this book, and almost didn't finish it! Usually, James Patterson's books are so suspenseful that I can't wait to read on...with this one, I simply kept reading because I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. For those who have never read Patterson before, start with Kiss the Girls, and you'll see why so many fans are dissapointed. Much like Patricia Cornwell's Hornet's Nest, a departure from character that didn't excite."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was more Dean Koontz than James Patterson","review":"I received my copy of this book for Christmas. I couldn't wait to start. The promos about the pages flying by, who knew? When I was finished I wished I hadn't started. I continue to be a fan because I love Patterson and his creation Alex Cross. I can't wait for the next one.

I have not ever read James Patterson so maybe this might not be up to his normal standards but this book is great. I took a real chance getting a hardback book by an author I have never read. I was delighted with the outcome. I am going to go back now and start on his other books. Really people, this book is very entertaining and exciting. It's a great read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Dissapointment","review":"I have been a big fan of James Patterson for several years and several long nights as I raced to the conclusion of another great Alex Cross novel. I have always waited with anticapation for the next novel. However with \\"As The Wind Blows\\", the only thing that I am anticapating is not buying another James Patterson novel anytime soon. This is a children's book at best, but I think that even children would roll their eyes at the plot line much less the character development. Fool me once..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not only the wind that blows","review":"I'm sorry. I like James Patterson novels, that is until I met this one. Mr. Patterson must have written this as his first book and put it away for a rainy day. The diagloge was sophmoric at best, the plot simple and predictable, the characters forgettable. Let's hope Mr. Patterson's next book is back to his orginal style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Different","review":"I read the reviews before I read it. Most of the reviews were negative. Well I have to disagree....yes it was fantasy....maybe not....who knows what the government conceals to the American public.....this could be happening....At first I was waiting for Alex Cross to come into the book...of course he never does. Yes this was different...I enjoyed it very much....fast reading....James Patterson's other novels were starting to get a little too gory for me. I took a chance on this one, and happy I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what is the point","review":"I was disappointed. The book seemed to have so much promise, but when I finished it, I wasn't sure what I had gained. The ending was rushed, and incomplete. The villans were easy to spot, the ending predictable. I expected so much more, given the storyline. Character development was minimal. How could this be on the best seller list?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I'm usually a big fan of Patterson's books (I've read them all), maybe because I find his Alex Cross stories so compelling. But this one was a disappointment. I felt the story was too predictable and the ending was too hokey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Patterson's best...","review":"I have read the majority of James Patterson's works. This was disappointing compared to his others. I have read other authors who can step into the shoes of another gender, but I don't think Patterson pulled it off. Far fetched idea, yes, but that's what fiction is all about. Needed some more polishing before it left his laptop. I will be waiting for his next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the latest James Patterson novel. I found it to be a great read and I could not put it down.

A big part of what I enjoyed about it was getting out of school for two days, but I also discovered that I loved the way that Kentucky puts on a basketball tournament. It's impossible not to get caught up in the excitement from the time you enter Rupp Arena and when I saw this book on the shelf in the bookstore at NKU, it all came flooding back to me. At first I would just sit and read the book right in the store when I found myself with a break between classes, but eventually I broke down and bought a copy of my own.

If you want to get technical, go watch an autobiographical film or documentry. It's upsetting when terrible movies like Lilo and Stitch get such high reviews on rotten tomatoes, for being entertaining and fun, when it failed to live up to heart put into the disney classics, which were filled with brilliant musical scores. And then Pocahontas gets dogged... for no other reason I could find, except for it being historically innacurate...

This is a beautifully written story about the hidden dangers of \\"love\\" or the ideas of \\"love.\\" This book is a very powerful read. Sometimes people show you the way they really are but in your mind you don't want to believe it is true, so you pretend it is not that way. This novel shows that the truth does catch up with you, so you may as well just see things for what they're in the beginning!! This novel is rich with many great lessons as it takes you on an in depth look into the mind's of different characters. Some scenes are quite erotic, but this paints the picture out well for the audience. I would strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Must Read","review":"First, let me tell you that before you even start to read this book you need to go purchase the follow-up Loose Ends.

I wrote Electa Rome Parks several years ago after reading this book to tell her that she needs to work out the movie rights NOW. Main characters would be Sanaa Lathan, Morris Chestnut, and Boris Kodjoe. Need I say more? You will not put this book down.

Youngsters can trim the countryside with flowers and snimals. Next, Strawberry goes to the beach and then she has a picnic.

With wide shoulders and great articulation, he definately looks like a leader. The colors look so good on this Prime, and his chest even opens up to reveal the Matrix of leadership!

What I found out was that pretty much every possible name was in this book. Now there are some pretty horrible names out there, but a lot of the names in this book are common names that have been around for a long, long time. Maybe I should lighten up a bit, but I was a tad offended when I read what the author wrote about my name, my husbands name and my daughter's name (we all have pretty common names). The only name he really didn't have anything bad to say about was David which is good for him seeing it is his name and my father since it's his name too.

If you're looking for a book that explains what intercession is, this is the book for you. It discusses the different types of intercessors, and that there isn't a need to feel bad if you don't feel an unction to pray for EVERYTHING. In fact, it's best to pray for what God put on YOUR heart. It also explains the importance of seeking what is on God's heart and to pray according to that, and not to pray for things to happen the way YOU think is best. This book has revolutionized my prayer life. I've already bought 4 additional books for family members who I know are intercessors as well. They feel similarly about the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative!!!!!!","review":"I have read this book and passed it around to many close friends. If you feel the tug of God on your heart to be an intercessor then you really should read this book. I never knew there were so many different types of intercessors and I found myself in several.

I've played it many times all the way through using different starter decks. You just have to put in an hour or two to get past the introduction and get into the game play. If you expect this to be like the Yu-gi-oh card game, you'll be upset. But if you pretend this is a brand new strategy game that just happens to have Dark Magician, then it will be a lot of fun.Warning - because the rules are complicated at first, younger kids will get frustrated easily. My little brother and sister (ages 7 and 5) have NO desire to play this game. But I play it any chance I can - it's fun having a game where strategy can make up for a weak deck!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good But COULD BE BETTER","review":"When I got this game, i was totally ready. But when I started playing, it was not what I expected. The graphics are okay but when it comes to the overall game, this one is not worth your money.PROS: Good graphics, challenging you get to choose which side you are on.CONS:BORRING, the rules (they are called the perfect rules, talk about corny), the plot, and the setting.Overall if you do like Yu-Gi-Oh, I recommend the SACRED CARDS for GBA, this game is okay at times. You should only get it if you plan on selling it later or if you are an extreme Yu-Gi-Oh fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile","review":"I bought this game just this week and already find myself hooked. But be warned this game is not for those who are easily frustrated. You've probably heard that there are over 680 3-D rendered monsters, and that's true, but this game is all about strategy and outhinking your opponents, knowing what monsters to use in certain situations. During the game you must select a deck with which to duel, and pick wisely because the deck you choose could mean a constant losing streak resulting in constant restarts. The graphics are somewhat on par with those of the Final Fantasy series (it's like a constant summoning of monsters). And in closing this game is right up there with some of the best in terms of strategy in graphics, but don't be fooled it's not as easy as you think"},{"rating":"1","title":"??????????????","review":"i dont know ... it does not work and the first time it didnt even arrive atall. nothing good to say really ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even yugioh","review":"o my gosh. this game is so terrible, i rented it (thank god) just to see what is was like.it has nothing to do with yugioh,your some little model that moves around on a field trying not to get hit.out of ten bieng the best controls: 2, grafx:7 the best thing ab out this game wich is sad, sound:4 and the learning curve is tough.. do not even rent"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Water is Black, and Catches Fire Easily......","review":"Okay, I've never actually played this game.

I traded my friend a few ultra- rare cards for it and I regret that I did (luckily I am going to get them back). It is set in the 1400's and all the charcters have different names( but they prefer to be adressed by their actual name). The grapics are horrible and the card game is nothing like the real one. You can't even put in passwords from the actual card game and everyone are wearing something weird(Kaiba is wearing a white suit with a Blue Eyes head on his arm). It is also NOT for young children. I don't think anyone wants to see a dead Harpie Lady. The intro is also 30 minutes long. In conclusion save $... and spend your money on The Eternal Duelist Soul or Stairway to the Destined Duel.

In the reviews and when i saw the screenshots i thought that the graphics were awsome and i also thought that it was going to be like the trading card with all the rules and all because as we all know that forbidden memories even though it was very realistic it lacked almost every single rule in the game.

I would not wanted to play 50 dollars for such a low quality game. First off this is really not a card game and should not be called one. It is more like checkers and you will find the players very hard to beat. I do not mind a challenge but come on, this is insane. You also start off with weak cards that your opponent can destroy 90 percent of the time. The tutor is well done though so you can learn how to play pretty quickly. I would buy the game if I found it for 15 to 20 bucks but I would not pay 50 dollars for such a game. If you want to play the true card game play Yu-Gi-Oh! The Eternal Duelists Soul for GBA, which in my opinion is the best YGO game out. I would deeply recommend you rent it before buying it.

I bought this game because I thought it would be like the card game but I sure was wrong. The cards are not even the same. They have differnt effects. I tried reading the tutorial but it takes at least an hour to fully read and understand it. My younger brothers couldn't even grasp the information. The story line is really fake also. It's not based on the tv show. It's based on a little bit of history but changing the names of the characters of the past to the characters in the tv show.

It does not stick to the Duel Monsters that die-hard fans love and play. Watching the show is one thing. Playing in official tournaments is other. This doesn't fit into either. Its a mixture between chess and Duel Monsters. If i wanted to play chess, I would play Chessmaster or Battle Chess. Konami dropped the ball this time. The only reason the sales will be high b/c its a Yu-gi-oh game.

I have to warn you though, if you are looking for a game that plays like the actual card game, this is not the answer. In this game you have 4000 LP like the anime series now has. But you play on a chess board. You can only lay down one card per turn (whether that is a monster card or a trap card is up to you). This SEVERELY limits your capabilities for those great combos you've seen in the anime series. You have to move your monsters in position (you can only move them 1 space per turn) before you can attack the opponent's monsters. The graphics seem like they should be a lot better for a PlayStation 2 platform, but nonetheless it is great when compared to the GameBoy Advanced games.Nothing like the actual card game or the anime series.But still a fun game, I was just a little disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother, too much blah, blah, not enough action.","review":"I was very dissapointed in this version and would not recomend this game, especially for young players under 12.

I orginaly purchased it for my 4 and 6 year old as they are big fans of the show, and there is no way that they could play this.Second the story line is horrid. I mean you expect it to follow the show to some extent. Instead your taking a side in the British war of the roses. I mean how many kids that would be playing this game even know what the war of the roses is.Third the difficulty is very high.

In order to attack your opponent's monsters you have to move the card on to the space to attack. Also magic and trap cards can be attacked by monsters. When in regular card games magic and trap cards can only be destroyed by other magic or trap cards. I only give this game one star and thats for the graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Not Great","review":"I thought that this Yu-gi-oh game was pretty good, but don't expect a normal Yu-gi-oh game because it is nothing like all the other games.

And whens these two things collide it isn't pretty. The first problem with its game is the graphics. they are what you would suspect from a PSX and not a PS2. The plot is also another problem, why are we in the 1400s and why can't I play being Kaiba of Yugi. The Final problem, the game is so darn hard, your deck is absoulute weak with very few useful cards and the A.I. is so hard to beat you would almost have a better chance of winning the lottery. In Short, Yugi fans you have been warned rent it first. Anyone else just stay away from this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best game ever","review":"I think it's graphics are the first of it's kind and is just like the tv show.

This author took the Rasputin story and moved it from Russia to the United States and moved the time frame from the early 1900's to the late 1900's.

The first flick Waiting was very good, funny & witty even though it had no plot it worked very well with the funny bone. The original actors in Waiting had the chemistry to play off of one another & delivered the laughs. Still Waiting just was plain flat & boring. Even with some of the original cast members that were in Still Waiting, they did not strike any chemistry with its fellow actors. It would have been nice to continue the original cast at Shenaniganz instead at the Ta Ta's restaurant.

If you've been together for any real length of time, you'll already know the answers to nearly all of these questions.

After ogling the case-art and Limited Edition dvd extra's, i finally brought myself to allow the pleasure of this game into my Xbox. The graphics are amazing, words cannot even describe the scope of what they have acheived at Ubi Montreal. The true sequel to the original Splinter Cell game, and i am blown away. After traipsing through Pandora Tomorrow, Chaos Theory is a welcome change onto a trickier gameplay. With a 15-20 hour storyline (not to mention almost unlimited alterations for re-playability) and the addition of a System Link, Splitscreen, or Xbox Live Co-Op mode, This game has grabbed the golden shelf for my games. I will be playing this for the next few weeks, as much as i can. I would wholeheartedly reccomend this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is gonna rock","review":"This is the best darnn game ever.

Anyone who says otherwise obviously hasn't played the game. Stealth is still the main aspect of the game; you will die if you confront the guards head-to-head. As for giving Sam a knife: every known member of the military is given a knife for a last resort, so NOT giving Sam a knife in the first two games was ridiculous. Hand-to-hand combat? What soldier doesn't know some? And for those who think that alarms have been removed; they haven't. They're just not as much of a headache now because the mission isn't lost when you're spotted three times.So go out an play this and ignore all the nay-sayers who haven't even bothered to play the game.

Forces you to use strategy to win, though is fun from start to finish. Replay value is unlimited. Controls and all weapons are great. Voices used by the characters have and are still great. Alot more than this, but I don't have time for all the detailsCons: I would have to think about this for a while to think of one.Summary: When did we ever go wrong with any Tom Clancy game?

The only show I can compare this to in terms of the sheer unenjoyment I derived it from it, is Zardos (a movie with Sean Connery, awful).I think that what might set this show apart from hand animated cartoons are the computer graphics.

The screen seems \\"jumpy\\". It is almost as if it is anticipating where you are going to go, so when you stop the world stops moving and goes backwards to where you are. I found this to be my main complaint, after a bit, it kind of made me feel ill :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Game!!","review":"this game is really good, you can play it for hours and it doesn't get boring.

Try renting it first. I had to go through a level about 30 times and I'm NOT exaggerating!!![.] But it is fun in the first levels because if you fall in the water, faerie magic will get you to land so you won't lose a life :) DO NOT BUY IT RIGHT AWAY!!![.] I'd recommend it to kids ages 8-16 cause it IS pretty hard and I felt like throwing the game on the floor and setting it on fire.

I shouldn't have. This game is pointless and annoying. Parts of it are too easy, and other parts seem impossible. It doesn't make any sense. I mean, all you have to do is collect all the gems, freeze a few fireflies (which happen to be unrealistically big) and complete some mini-games. It is extremely easy to destroy enemies, because most of them go down with one hit. When you play on the Sheila the kangaroo levels, you die a lot because it's hard to jump on enemies. The Agent 9 levels have prehistoric graphics, and also, the music is never the kind that gets your heart pumping. In Metroid Fusion, for example, it has very scary music when the SA-X (the ultimate enemy) goes by. In Spyro, it always has a happy little tune playing. I advise all gamers to buy something else, and avoid Spyro at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I could barely get through the first few minutes of the game.

You might get stuck at some parts but if you don't give up you will find that that was easy. Like when you are trying to beat Crush and Gulp you just have to dodge the things they through at you and you get them when they fall down and then you go up to them and press the a button and through it at them you have to through the bomb or ice at them like three times then you win! It is a eaaly fun and I guess easy game. If you have played the other games like \\"Spyro Ripto's Revenge\\" them you know that this game is as easy as that one. Well I'm only on the third level.

Even if you don't like Corey Haim, do yourself a favour and don't buy this. It's boring, long, the storyline is stupid and it was made in Canada(that about says it all).

Well, the USDA has taken care of the first two-thirds of this book, and the USSR and North Korea taken care of the final third.But maybe we shouldn't be too hard on Upton.

I soon found that it's three hundred pages thoroughly dwarfed the thousand in Ayn Rand's novel, due to it's dragging and morbid plot. I decided to at least give it one hundred pages for the story to develope, but found that after that trial period, all I really wanted was for Jurgis to die, so that the drudgery would end.

This was my first and probably only attempt at trying to buy something on Amazon.com. I realize it is thru a 3rd party agent you are selling the product. But your organization should be ashamed to allow vendors like this on your website. The book was for a college course, needless to say this purchase attempt was worthless. I can only hope the credit process will charge my account again so I can tell everyone I know this sad story. My review is you should tell everyone up front before actually ordering there is a chance you may have to wait 3 to 4 weeks for an item or it may never come at all.

At Foxconn...completely outsourced), and you have a great backstory to what are still issues being discussed today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Issues Re-Visited","review":"I finally got around to reading this classic. Truly, the Socialist viewpoint Sinclair held at this point in his life, coupled with his dramatic expose of labor conditions at the turn of the 20th. century, makes for interesting reading. I found it fascinating, depressing, and revolting...all feelings I'm sure Sinclair had in mind for his readers. I found the ending a bit \\"sudden,\\" and looked for an epilogue of some sort.

This is Chicago, and America, at the turn of the century. Based on Sinclair's undercover work in the stockyards, most people walk away from the book disgusted at factory meat processing but there are deeper themes here.Anyone who has known poor working families that move from one crisis to another for generations, trapped in ignorance, unable to plant roots, will sympathize with the characters and the story. It is heartbreaking and, although the writing is not masterful, it is simple and clear and compelling.I can't believe it took me so long to get around to this one.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"the worst is a change for the better","review":"When I first began reading this, I was intrigued by the horrific tales of immigrant life in the early 1900s. It became depressing...but at the end you will realize that this book wasn't meant to entertain, but to expose what needed to be exposed. Some say its too morbid or sad, but that's the point. It was so bad and depressing, that it generated the government's involvement in the conditions of the slaughter houses. That's exactly what America needed at the time. ...hail sinclair"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinclair's work hasn't aged well","review":"Obama's victim class would applaud.

And while it may seem that the family depicted herein has an uncanny string of bad luck, the story isn't entirely unbelievable. In history there have been several accounts of injustices on the workers in America, especially immigrants. And there are countless more cases which are unrecorded. It's easy to label this as socialist propoganda, but so what? Any educated person would look at all sides of an issue. As such, there's no excuse for resorting to McCarthyism. The novel does tend to take the working class tragedy a bit to the extreme, however...but, then again, most great works are extreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book teaches you how it was to live & work during the early 1900s.

Although it might have been a little exaggerated, it shows you the reality in which the immigrants had to face during the American Industrial revolution. With all the difficults Jurgis (the main character) had to face, later he finds out about Socialism. Basically Upton Sinclair's purpose, as a mugraker, was to show the great parts of Socialism.

I give this book 2 stars because it is so gruesome. It is a well-written novel and very descriptive but at the same time very disturbing. The book explained about Packing Town in Chicago at the turn of the century and the repulsive way that they slaughtered the pigs and cows. This book upset me in some parts and really got me to think about what I consume, because of the way they described how the animals were slaughtered and how unsafe it was to eat the meat.

Jurgis and his family go through many hardships and soon realize that the American Dream wasn't really what it seemed. The Jungle shows the corruption in the meat-packing industry and in politics as well. This book was interesting and made me want to read on, but the ending dissapointed me.

I was appalled at Sinclair's descriptions of the meat packing plants. If these depictions held any truth, it seems fairly unreasonable that it would take a work of fiction to bring it to the attention of the proper authorities. I am tired of hearing reviews referring to Sinclair's story as the cause for the development of meat standards.

How he frantically decoded the Little Orphan Annie message with his Ovaltine decoder ring, only to discover it was a \\"crummy commercial\\", which is what The Jungle is: a commercial for socialism while distorting history to portray capitalists as fat men in top hats.

The description of the meatpacking plants, however, made my stomach churn. Nonetheless, Upton Sinclair created a historical masterpiece. This book will make you sad; it will make you reflect.

That level of detail is very clearly threaded through the narrative. The publication of this book caused massive changes in the food processing industry. Unfortunately, all of those gains are being eroded by the corporatocracy. This book should be issued to every person who clamors to protect corporations from liability, support GMOs, and outsource our food production to countries with poor oversight. It should be issued to every high school senior, as well. There are gains that were made that we must not lose.The only downside to the story is, to me, at the very end. The protagonist discovers Socialism and the very end of the book is a word salad extolling the virtues of Socialism. It is a jarring finish to an otherwise smooth narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Beginning. Terrible Ending","review":"The Jungle starts out as a compelling story about Jurgis his family and their struggle for the \\"American Dream\\".

My history classes stress the fact that this book exposed the meatpacking industry and eventually led to the development of the FDA. In reading the book, I found the greater story was a man's struggle to keep his family afloat. This book, however, gets four stars because the last three chapters are pure socialist propaganda.

It did. It is such an amazing story, and one with historical value, of the meat-packing industry in the Chicago area. The sympathetic characters add to the harsh and often fatal conditions in the book. The knowledge that the book inspired change in an industry that badly needed change, adds to the purpose and the drive for reading the book. I purchased this book on Kindle, because I wanted to keep it to read again in the future. It is an amazingly sad, yet hopeful story of the lives of the immigrants in a very tough time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"This book is an absolute masterpiece and should be read for years to come.

However, it is an excellent version of the book that can be read by individuals at the middle and high school levels. To teach the lessons and history contained within Sinclair's 400+ page book would be too time-consuming for most school classrooms. With the stark, harsh illustrations and the narrative provided, the reader will still be able to understand the original story and appreciate the plot, no matter what format the book comes in."},{"rating":"2","title":"the jungle.","review":"this book is so fantastic. i read it in high school and it was a true eye opener. great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"meets all the hype","review":"I remember first hearing about this book in my high school american history class. Ever since I had wanted to read it and hadn't yet. Wow it is eye opening and fully met my expectations. It had a good story about a Lithuanian immigrant family that I wasn't expecting. The depth of this is amazing. My only slight problem was that the last chunk of the book was a little preachy about socialism with whole pages being dedicated to speeches by characters in the story. That was a little much for me. (not the socialism just the ranting speeches.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for literature, economic, or history buffs","review":"A depressing account of life during the turn of the century, in all it's gory detail of union bosses and abused labor. It's the sort of story you read if you are trying to understand how certain types of ideas could become popular enough to move the needle on political thought.Poor immigrant Jurgis continues chasing the illusive American dream. Each time, he gets close to achieving a stable happy life, fate deals him a nasty blow.What is probably overlooked in this book, but an intriguingly well woven theme is the plight of women at the turn of the century. I've actually not heard of The Jungle being referred to as feminist literature, but clearly Sinclair is influenced by the movement of the time. The terrible economic situations, the systemic pressures and inability to be self-sustaining depicted by Sinclair can be described as nothing short of brilliantly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Jungle\\" has ups, downs; too long","review":"Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\" starts out interesting enough, describing a wedding feast of Lithuanian immigrants. The description of the meat factories and the working conditions therein are, although gruesome and disturbing, very moving. Most of the novel, however, drags along to an unsatifying conclusion that Sinclair uses, it would seem, to promote his own political agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a chore to read!","review":"Wow this book was a marathon to get through. When Upton Sinclair wrote it he meant it to be an example of how capitalism will corrupt and that socialism should be the preferred social setting. It was a complete misfire though and it only served to expose the disgusting conditions in the meat packing industry which eventually led to the creation of the FDA. Upton Sinclair considered the book a failure. I would have to agree with the reaction at the time. the meat packing scenes were the most memorable the rest was a complete chore to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal.","review":"A word to the wise -- after opening it, the CD stated that certain tracks have either been re-recorded, or are live versions (can't recall which ones).

I understand when \\"life happens to you,\\" how devastating that can be... The only qualm I have with this book is that the author justifies the wrongs she had full control over (infidelity) in her own life by saying she needed the experience in order to grow. The cost was the trust her family had in her. I think the true challenge in her life was to REJECT the offer, no matter how unbelievably attractive, because of integrity and love for those who trusted her. That's the test. A criminal's high may not be achieved any other way than by committing the crime - but where has the respect gone for doing the right thing even though the wrong makes you \\"feel more alive\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"Enough reviews have been written of this book, so I will just add my bit by saying that she started off the book very well, but progressively bored me as I read more and more. I would recommend reading this one up to where she goes on and on about her kids and then stop reading there--I think it was part 3. The book did not really inspire me or open my mind up in any way, but it wasn't bad. Not essential reading in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult times can make you stronger.","review":"While I thought this book was a bit 'mature' and a little 'new-agey', and I don't mean that in a condescending way, it was a great read. It's about people who are on the brink of change and then push their way through it. It is sometimes heartbreaking to read, but can make you stronger. I think most people can get something out of it, if you keep with it throughout the book, as it's a pretty in-debth and long read. All in all, it's a good one. I'd recommend it, along withHow to Break Your Addiction to a Person."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful insights","review":"I read this book after going through a very rough time.

It goes against everything most Christians believe. The book is based on the advice received from a psychic to the author and goes from there. Pure la-la land, new age,-- crystal ball. The author starts out by telling us she was involved with 3 men each named Tom, while still married to her husband. The psychic tells her not to worry about her kids' feelings about breaking up the marriage. It only gets worse from there. Honestly, this is the story of an unstable woman who follows mysticism and it made me shudder the more I read it.I purchased it because I saw the discussion on Oprah on the topic of dealing with emotional pain and enjoyed the comments of some of the guests. I should have stopped there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychic babel","review":"If you want a divorce get this book, if you don't value any thing in your relationship and do not believe in forgiveness get this book by all means.This book is very disturbing if you are in a relationship that needs help, it's all negative in viewing your spouse, a psychic's advice on why you should leave your spouse and seek an affair to find your soul mate. Marriage is not perfect and yes people do grow apart in there daily routines do to distractions, communication is the key. I would not use this book for advice on relationships it throws the children to the curb and incur ages a none loving family value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read","review":"This is one of the best books I have read.

I thought this book was spiritual guidance, enhancement, wisdom. What it is a biography of an affair, divorce, kids... and how those things effected the author, and how she learned and grew from it.

The idea is not that we MUST embrace our evils in order to grow, but that we can use our times of depression,anxiety, or pain to transform us into more open people. I spotted it in Barnes and Noble the other day, bought it, and haven't been able to put it down since. Lesser calls this process of transformation \\"The Phoenix Process.\\" She beautifully illustrates how difficult times really can help us grow by giving us the story of her first marriage and how the pain she endured during it made her better afterward. She also includes stories of others who have gone through their own struggles in life. Broken Open is well written, and interesting from the first page to the last. The stories in it are truly amazing and inspirational.

There is more innovation in these four tracks than most metal bands have in their whole album. Most of the songs you here in later albums but the raw nature of this recording is refreshing, which I find to be one of the best things about metal. Too many bands forget this fact and the moment they reach stardome they get \\"produced\\".

The length of the original \\"On Fire\\" was 6:23, but on this CD it is only 4:21 long.

But his explanations are so clear that almost no background would be required. I have flown through the book, rarely re-reading anything, which says a lot about the author's writing ability. Most economics is dull, boring, and a difficult slog. This book is crisp, on point, and I always just want to finish one more page.Having experience trading options, his thesis rings remarkably true. This is really an eye-opening book as he does a great job explaining the theoretical underpinnings of his thesis. This book was far ahead of its time. Pettis saw the gaping holes in the financial system a decade ago. It really was only a matter of time before the shaky facade came crashing down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Apart from the main idea of this book, which is using the capital structure to reduce wrong-way risk, Pettis also includes an original and unique perspective on how engineering liquidity leads to an initial booms followed by a bust.

Also, there's text about how to go about playing the book, and I can testify personally that if you follow his method, you will quickly learn a lot about the guitar. This is not some hackish \\"we have cataloged every possible combination of notes on the guitar and therefore we are awesome\\" book. This is quality advice and teaching from a real player. I have played guitar for over 15 years, in lots of different environments, including studying classical guitar in college with professionals and touring with death metal bands.

A must read for all, even if you have not read the CWG books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolate for the Soul","review":"I need not go into a long, laborious diatribe extolling the virtues of this book. It is sweetness, joy, divine inspiration and grace in printed form. If you are downtrodden or melancholy; this book will assuredly assuage those feelings. This book argues, quite convincingly I might add; that God by whatever name is the very best friend you'll ever have. Five stars unabashedly!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart moving stories","review":"I am a Neale fan and this is another book from him that I like so much.Unlike other of his CwG series, this is simply a book of touching moments that tells us how God is leading us in our way to the Goal and how ignorant most of us have been to such opportunities. In short, we kept fooling ourselves for too long.You may say those stories are mystified. But could you open yourself to a probability that the stories are really true? And could you also consider that actually you can experience the same; that God is always inviting us to the Kingdom?Do not blindly believe all the words in the book. Open yourself up a bit and see if they were true. By learning of stories of others, you will understand when their moments came and in turn be able to detect yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Have more information","review":"The overall book content is very good but I think the autors were very succinct on projects description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea!","review":"This is such a simple idea, and it works great.

After a couple of weeks to break them in and loosen up the voice coils they sound better than the original set and have no problems handling the power from the factory amp. They are not quite as loud on the low end as the old ones but are much clearer for sure. I feel it safe to say they get down pretty close to the advertised frequency of 28Hz. I would suggest them to anyone looking to replace a factory set on the cheap and still get decent sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing nuts","review":"Everything looks fine except I don't have the nuts for the screws.

Despite the fact that such categories confer intelligibility, Baldwin is acutely aware they need to be resisted. So how to recognize what categories do to make one's humanity visible and at the same time resist them. This central issue is what this novel tries to figure out. It's answers are never comforting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rollins does justice to Baldwin","review":"I'm reviewing the audio version of this novel after having read the unabridged version. Like the reader from Detroit, I was puzzled by some aspects of the audio abridgement (notably the conclusion), but unlike that reader I didn't think it detracted seriously from the flavor of what remained. I had doubts about whether an introspective writer like Baldwin could be a candidate for an audio book, but Howard Rollins made the text come alive. We can only be sorry he didn't record more of Baldwin's books, for Rollins' voice reveals the depth of his understanding of Baldwin's characters and emotions. There's a reason a book is considered a classic, and Rollins makes clear why this book has endured. Perhaps some listeners will be motivated by this recording to seek out and read Baldwin's other novels; if so, treasures await them."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Baldwin's another Country","review":"I found this book good, but less fascinating than Giovanni's Room partly because I am not as interested in the influence of the church in the culture of the Southern black people (with all the contradictions) than I am in the personally compelling identity issues raised by Baldwin in the novel, Giovanni's Room"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"I had my book shipped to me in no time! The quality was superb and overall the service was excellent! No complaints here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aggressive, wide ranging social commentary","review":"The characters, style and tone of the novel are very much 60s and 70s New York. But the issues Baldwin explores in this hard hitting, gritty novel present a piercing, kelidoscopic view of much of contemporary culture - love, friendship, struggling artists grappling with commercialism, homosexuality, gender, race. The characters in this novel are not always appealing, frequently seedy and embroiled in the seemier aspects of urban American life.The tone of the novel is not always easy to handle. It starts with pummelling, aggressive prose and remains that way until the conclusion. The reader is drawn into a broiling stew of difficult social relations and little respite is granted."},{"rating":"2","title":"wrong book","review":"sorry but I purchased the wrong book entitled \\"Another Country\\" I wanted the one about aging which I laterpurchased.

I did not like the way that it glorified homosexuality and made it sound like it was alright! If I had not been forced to read it for a Literature class, I would have put it down somewhere around the 2nd chapter. The book started out with an interesting plot with exciting characters, but by the beginning of the 2nd chapter it began to go down hill. I would never recommend this book to anyone to read. It is a waste of time and is by no means a book that challenges the mind. It only pollutes the mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-saver","review":"I can only echo the praise of several other of the reviewers here. This has always been my favorite of all Baldwin's novels, one that literally saved my life at the time I first read it. My deep empathy with the pain the characters were undergoing (so like what I myself was feeling at the time) and the gratitude I felt for the fact that they were SO eloquent in being able to verbalize that pain made this book an indelible a part of my life. In the years since my first exposure to it, I have read and re-read it innumerable times and it never fails to have a profound effect on me. As close to Dostoyevsky as any American novel has ever come, in my opinion. No distancing irony -- it's a book that believes deeply and asks you to feel deeply (the ultimate crime, it seems, in these post-modern times when you're never supposed to be caught actually CARING about anything). There's no way I could recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Country","review":"I just finished reading Another Country. This book should be required reading for Jr. High or High School students. I was born in 1970 and didn't witness the civil rights movement. Many of my generation feel that racism is not a serious issue anymore. Though this book was written before I was born, some of the same thoughts and ideaology mentioned are still prevalent today. As an African American man, I know that racism still excist today as it did in the 60's. With Blacks, at times, as the perpetrators. This was the case with Ida. A black woman in a relationship with a white man. She new that this man loved her. She loved him, but the racial hatred that she had been exposed to in her life prevented her from seeing anything other than the color of Vilvado's skin.Baldwin was certainly ahead of his time and Another Country is just as timely today as it was in the 60's and 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still relevant today","review":"James Baldwin was a man who was able to capture the essence of so many aspects of life because he actually lived them. Homosexuality, racism, alchoholism, and being an American. Another Country is just as much a reality check for the United States today as it ever was. And reality is very hard for most people to deal with. I had my book club read it and no one could finish it because it was so disturbing to them, all for different reasons. I read it twice.

I am happy with the purchase for $109. It is attractive and is truly non stick. However, from where I stand, it is not really designed for rough handling and very frequent, prolong cooking at very high temperatures. This will erode the nonstick coating inside and strip the outer color. For instance, I do not use it to fry chicken, I use a calphalon pot but will steam fish or vegetables with it. One must be mindful of different times of cookware for different functions. I opined, it is more suited for young professionals, students etc, not for very very regular use.

They sound very good, but the bass is always on. Not overbearing, but it would be nice to set it lower than the lowest setting that is offered. The control on the sub is also very inconveniently placed in the back, next to all the wiring.To connect the speakers to a computer, you are provided with three 1/8\\" jacks for front L/R, rear L/R, and the sub. However, most computers only have a 2-channel sound card, so there is only one audio output. Without an adapter, sound only goes to the front speakers and the sub. You can get an adapter at Radioshack for $6 that has a male 1/8\\" plug to two male RCA plugs, and then use the gaming adapter provided in the box for the speakers.Overall, these speakers are a dramatic improvement over regular computer speakers. They look cool and have a nice sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good budget sound system","review":"The sound quality is the best I have heard in a long time but that is coming from a guy who upgraded from the horrible eMachine speakers they send with a computer. I bought this for my 360 and found my only complaint when I went to set it up.The system itself doesn't support games, they send you a little converter thing for it but all that does is make it so you have a really good speaker system. It doesn't convert it to surround sound. It alright though, I put up with it for a while then decided to set it up to my PC which is where this was meant to be.So unless you attach something that can tell the surround sound system it's surround sound this wont really be anything other then 2 really good speakers and sub.Sorry if this didn't make much sense to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speakers for gaming, but I works for watchign TV","review":"Initally I bought these to play games on my computer, however 5 speakers is overkill on a PC for me.

Indeed, you might find much that will excruciate. Conductor Arthur Nikisch and soprano Elena Gerhardt were musicians of great renown in their day, but their 1911 performance of \\"An die Musik\\" is frankly appalling. Nikisch plays the opening accompaniment quickly, then slows to half speed when Gerhardt enters. What follows, for nearly four minutes, is not so much a tribute to music as a travesty of it. Altogether there is little offered by the early 20th Century generation of singers that I should like young singers of today to hear. Things improve when the 1930s are reached in this survey, especially when the accompanist Gerald Moore appears, but most of these later items can be found in other CD recitals and anthologies.

This movie I really wanted to like -- the two leads are especially handsome, if a little wooden in their deliver. at least they had some chemistry and you like watching them when they're onscreen. The father figure was pretty bad -- his line delivery was completely unrealistic and embarrassing. Same way with most of the other cast. The dialogue was unrealistic and inane.

Although I like those other games, I did not like Metal Gear Solid.In short, it has VERY long movie scenes (I think I had to watch about 20 minutes of video before playing, and the game is constantly pausing to show you other short movies). You feel more out of control of the player than you do in other shooting games (Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, Halo, etc). The result of the movies and the awkward control is that you don't feel engaged as a player.After about a half-day I gave up on this one and returned it.If you like to get caught up in the \\"plot\\" of a shooter videogame, and the action is just an aside, then this is probably a good selection.

Then again, kids today don't have to know how to read to graduate, so I guess I can't expect them to know what a good story line was if it smacked them in the face.

For example: if you walk around a corner and theres an enemy standing gaurd, instead of ambushing them like in other games, your pansy-a$$ character calls his conections and describes what kind of outfit the enemy is wearing,etc. Like in two minutes from now your really gonna care what color pants the guy was wearing!!It seems as if half the game is listening to pointless conversations or watching lame cut scences. Needless to say I returned this game way before it was due back.

Yeah don't play this unless you are looking for a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat skewed","review":"The aim of this book is to provide a short, popular account of Aristotle's philosophy for those that are somewhat acquainted with the history of philosophy. I do recommend the book, but not without qualification. The author needlessly, and perhaps unfairly, attacks Aristotle quite often in the work, which is simply distracting. To the potential buyer: keep in mind that this work was written in 1915 and that the author's criticisms of Aristotle rely on a heavily Platonic bias."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gloves. wish they would last longer","review":"I've purchased many pairs of these gloves for both myself and my husband. They are lightweight and allow you to easily pick up small item, like dropped screws and bolts. I use them for projects around the outside of my house as well as at work where I rack and stack servers. They are a great all purpose glove with good grip which easily can be put on or taken off when needed. I like them also because they have a nice snug fit which you do not get with cheaper gloves.The downside is the fingertips do not not last. The tips are reinforced but the sides between the fingers are plain cloth. They fail where the light cloth meets the synthetic reinforcement. Do not use them for heavy duty gardening like working with concrete block. So yes I will purchase them again. I just wish they lasted longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"def. not vaughan's best","review":"i keep waiting for vaughan to settle in and pick up the pace on his run of ult. x-men, but he seems content to just coast most of the time, or at the worst, phone it in. this is really a shame b/c his other work is usually consistently worthwhile and he could've done so much great work in the ult universe. this book is completely what you'd expect w/ zero surprises except for a little twist at the end. the story and the characterization are completely forgettable (although longshot's powers are still cool), w/ the main exception of dazzler who is great as a sarcastic wisecracking smart alec. i hate to say it but i'm def. going to skip his next ult x-men arc unless i hear rave reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, well... guess the thrill is gone...","review":"I had been enjoying the \\"Ultimate X-Men\\" series pretty well up to this point, but was turned off here by the lackluster plotline and even moreso by the slapdash artwork, which stands in painful contrast to the richly detailed illustration of the earlier volumes. This volume felt a lot like the mass-produced X-books of the late '90s, where there were too many heroes and too many titles, and they all started to melt together into one big kaboom-fest, filled with fetishistically hyper-muscular males and inflatible-doll anorexic female characters. Sadly, the series seems to be taking on that same factory-produced feel, and has lost its freshness and revitalized vigor. Hopefully Marvel can get the book back on track, but I'm not sure I'll still be around to read it when they do. Other, better books clamor for my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart inventive hip hop","review":"This album holds up.

From the first song, Magic Number, it is obvious that this is a special album. What is amazing is how young the members of De La Soul were when it came out in 1989. Singlehandedly changed hip hop. Showed that it was possible to make a disc that was fun and had no tint of anger. Nothing that comes out now is even close in terms of fresh sounds.

I had a friend named Dewey in the Orange County Motorcycle who had an old Indian, 1919 I think, that he rode to Death Valley every year and he kept us updated on the doings of Burt.The movie stays pretty close to real life and Hopkins does his usual good job of protraying a character.Well worth watching...There's a lot of truth, inspiration, and good advice in this movie...And it's fun..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fully Enjoyed the Movie","review":"This movie is a great.If you are looking to get inspired this is the movie.

This is one of his best performances although so far removed from his Hannible creation. A man, his motorcylce, and his dream to drive it to the limits on the Utah salt flats. This is a movie for the whole family although there is a transexual character that is prevalent in the middle of the film. As this is based on a true story, this character is crucial to the story and I don't think it is overdone to much for kids. Use your own judgement here. Overall, I think it is a very good movie and heartwarming story about one man's triumph, uh, I mean, Indian."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World's Fastest Indian","review":"A wonderful heartwarming story for anyone with an interest in racing.

Fun for the whole family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tips for Canadian purchasers","review":"Whatever you do, don't buy the Canadian edition. Why? Roger Donaldson went to a lot of trouble to present his movie properly, and the Canadian edition fails to respect his efforts. He wanted the image matted at 1.78:1; the producers of the Canadian edition have simply ported over the theatrical, 2.35:1 image, thus cutting it off, top and bottom. He also wanted to include a documentary about the real Bert which he himself made in 1970, but the producers of the Canadian edition have decided to save themselves some money and to pay for the rights for that little film, which puts the movie in its personal and historical context. Donaldson is an amazing film-maker, working on the edges of Hollywood, and turning out excellent work, often non-standard but always interesting and engaging. \\"World's Fastest Indian\\" is no exception, and features as well one of Anthony Hopkins' best performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"The world's fastest Indian","review":"I ordered it in English and it came to me in spanish, what a pain.

As one reviewer wrote, it was a delight for the whole family... which member of the family thought it delightful how the fellow waters his lemon tree? Also, the fellow rides more women than motorcycles, (great for the kids). And as a bonus it features a transvestite. Another reviewer wrote it has beautiful scenery, salt and treeless mountains? Even on a film making level the movie was sub par - several scenes could have been deleted and the story line would not have suffered.

In the \\"Extras\\" on the DVD, watch the documentary \\"Burt Munro - Offerings to the God of Speed\\". It captures the character and charisma of such people and is worth more than the whole movie.If I could have put the above aside, the movie might have been a modestly entertaining diversion--yet another insipid variation of the road trip formula. The movie's Burt Monro amiably drifts through his adventure, often propelled by the characters around him (rather than him being an irresistible force). At times I felt that I was watching a variation on \\"Forrest Gump\\" (movie version).The overall tone of this movie is \\"quiet inevitability,\\" a phrase that I never thought would apply to a movie involving riding motorcycles, much less racing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"World's Fastest indian DVD was defective","review":"I ordered World's Fastest Indian for my son's birthday.

Initially barred from participating in the Speed Week time trials, the amiably gruff senior finally gets a shot thanks to respected pro driver Jim Moffett (played by Chris Lawford). Donaldson weaves dramatic details of Munro's journey with plenty of spirited humor and offbeat encounters with boosters, fellow travelers, and even a transvestite motel clerk. Diane Ladd's widow/love interest and Paul Rodriguez's car salesman are especially memorable. Get in the driver's seat with \\"Indian,\\" and enjoy the rickety but exhilarating ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worlds Fastest Indian","review":"Service was good and the picture is excellent.

The storyline is so much better because it is based on an actual expreriance, combining humor, excitement, sensitivity, etc. and a happy ending.

No bad guys. Everyone (at least in the movie) that Burt came across in the US (remember it was the early 60's, a different era unfortunately) were helpful, encouraging, concerned and sympathetic to Burts cause.

I bought it at a trade show. This is a corded model, there is no \\"battery to recharge\\" as the other reveiwer stated. The good news is that it does even thick grass (midwest farm grass) in mulch mode about as fast as I can walk. I've used it for trim work on a 2/3 acre lot, and occasionally the whole front (when my gas lawn tractor needs repair). You have to be mindful of the cord, and I'm not particular to the rear bag. Keeping that in mind, it's a powerful little thing, and is so lightweight that no exertion is required to push at all - takes more energy to move the cord around. With a side discharge, and keeping in mind that it's 13 inch cut path isn't meant for large yards AT ALL, I'd give it 5 stars. As it is, with the durability over the years, and NO maintenance at all, I give it 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea fails to perform over time","review":"We own a Bully electric mower.

The area I have to mow is only 300 sq.ft. so I will make do but for the cost it should be a much better built item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made and works great.","review":"Wow! This mount was everything I needed. Strong, easy to install and not bad looking. I mounted my 23\\" Samsung basically in a corner next to a fireplace and simply swing the arm out for viewing. The mounting plate (200 x 100) fit right on my tv and actually made mounting easier. I would have given it 5 stars except the wire management system, as mentioned in other reviews, leaves a little to be desired. The concept is great, but the holes in the tube are small, and it is difficult to get more than the power cord and a coaxial through the tube. Fortunately for me, this is a third tv and that's all I needed, but I can see the problem if you wanted to hook up more than just your cable/satellite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Update: Amazon made all better (Was: Ordered new, got used, incomplete, damaged)","review":"The item itself appears to be a beefy, well designed mount.

It looks good and helps to hide wires by having the wires pass through the arms. It is a good looking unit that works. The base screws look weak but they will support your TV without coming loose.

The swing mount is very flexible, allowing you to easily adjust for the best viewing angle.After my first purchase and use, I bought two more for members of my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"This product is awesome! It is very stout and well built, heavier than the 22\\" LCD I have mounted to it. It came very well packaged, with hardware that was neatly packed in individual sealed bags. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, though installing it is pretty straight forward. The tension on the swing out arms can be adjusted, as can the tilt up to 15* (though that must be locked in once set). It swings out up to 17\\" from the wall. The finish is clean and blemish free. Although I have nothing but praise for this product, I will say that the included #14X2\\" screws that are included to mount it to the wall would be better replaced by 1/4\\"X3\\" lag screws (which I used as did others). I used some blue thread locker on the set screw used to lock the arm to the plate on the wall, and also on the screws used to mount the arm to the TV. Installation took me about ten minutes. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for money","review":"I bought this mount after reading all the reviews on this site. I have the Vizio 37\\" LCD and it works o.k. with that set, but I wouldn't mount anything bigger than that on this swing arm. While it does hold the unit and I believe it is sturdy enough, I did notice that the bolts in the joints were bending just a little under the weight. I also had to make my own plate to fit the back of the Vizio, since the bolt spacing is much larger than the supplied adapter plate. For the price, this is a hard unit to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV mount out there!","review":"I researched several companies of TV mounts before making this selection. This one is extremely sturdy, goes up in about 1 hour total, very secure to wall, easily rotates in either direction and also up and down. We used it for a 20\\" flat-screen TV for our exercise room. It was mounted 8 inches from the corner wall because that's where a stud was. The TV can swivel in any direction we need. This is a very nice system, better and less expensive than the OmniMount and Peerless brands. Couldn't get the others for 1/2 the price! Best $50 I ever spent! Also very nice to hide the cable and electrical cords!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mount, needs adapter for VESA 200x200","review":"Very solid mount, works exactly as one would expect. The only disappointment is Amazon lists it as VESA 75, 100, and 200 compatible. That's not completely accurate. It does include an adapter plate for VESA 200x100 mounting. It does NOT include VESA 200x200 mounting, however. That requires a separate adapter plate, e.g., UFP-280. I could have saved myself time and frustration had that been clearly shown.Recommended, just be sure you have the mount you need for your television."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Investment","review":"So, I was in tough spot. I had a 23\\" widescreen monitor taking up most of my desk. On one hand, I wanted something functional, but on the other I didn't have a lot to spend.After much research, this little gem popped up. I wasn't familiar with the brand, but the price was right. The way it's screwed into a wall means that you *have to* get through a support stud(Not always the most convenient based on your furniture arrangement), but that's a very small complaint.I can move the arm freely left and right, it stays exactly where I put it every time. Additionally, the connector point to the monitor allows me to rotate the monitor freely up to 360 degrees. Call me a geek, but it's cool to be able to turn my monitor 90 degrees to read comics, etc.I'll be acquiring a secondary monitor soon, and I definitely plan to purchase another one of these for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I shopped around for an articulating arm to hold my 23 inch widescreen Samsung LCD (the white cased one). This worked great and I am very happy with the purchase. My only complaint is the \\"tunnel\\" inside that is to be used for hiding wires from your stereo/wii/etc. is very tight at the entrance and exits and it is difficult to get the wires through. Furthermore, you can only fit like one set of Composite cables in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, cheap screws","review":"I love the arm, especially for the price.

I believe that its probably my second favorite of his next to Exodus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A positive review","review":"This book is a heart-wrenching tour de force that will lift the reader from his seat and into the heart of those who had to suffer through the tragedy of the Holocaust. Uris's hero Cady is bold and irresistable to the reader, and his tireless crusade for justice truly becomes our own. Meanwhile our wrath towards the evil antagonist Kelno is fervent and passionate. A celebration of the fact that human perseverence and human dignity will overcome even an evil like the Holocaust, QBVII stirs the readers soul and taps into our deepest symapthies. Uris' power to transport the reader into his heroes' mind; feeling his thoughts, understanding his shortcomings, and internalizing his tribulations shine like a beacon through the gritty hero Abraham Cady. A classic struggle between the enduring power of good and the manaical perseverance of lies and evil serve as the epic-like backdrop to Uris's ultimate theme- justice will come to those who deserve it..good and bad"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"Very good game.A little challenging,but fun.I love it!

I can't believe I paid $50, for an essentially UNPLAYABLE game!!! I guess next time I won't ask a 9 year old what he thinks of a game! Don't buy this one until Universal comes out with a less buggy version."},{"rating":"1","title":"They can do better than this!","review":"I love spyro,I bought the game before reading the reviews(wich was a big mistake)played it and then my system froze!Yes it is a cool game but it takes so long to load!The graphics on the last games were way better.The game is so short and simple.It only took almost 2 days to finish.So I rushed it back to get my money. Take it from me,I have played some extremely good games but this is not one of them.Do not buy it no matter how cool they say it is.It will freeze up and it took 10 min. just to get from world to world.They can do better than this crud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch!","review":"PLatform gamming at its best. Enter the Dragonfly is tight. There are crazy new things he gets to ride and these beautiful places (a lot of them) he visits. I feel that the new games sometimes don't live up to their original and older counterparts, but I think the creators of ETD did a good job. My favorite will always be the first, Enter the Dragon, but the latest game from Spyro is still top-notch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When it works, it's great...","review":"The graphics are great, when they don't disappear or if the camera doesn't get stuck in a wall. The sound is great, when they don't stack on each other. The levels are challenging when you can 1. not freeze up and 2. get loaded into the right level after saving. The controls are sluggish and if you are used to using the D-pad with Sypro, get over it. It offers nothing in response. The other buttons work most of the time, but it gets annoying when you push the triangle button, you do a head bash and all you wanted to do was center the camera. I'm glad that Universal is offering refund on this badly done game. I'm going to go the Game Cube addition (only after I rent it first.) No one that has reviewed has the same problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh... Decent...","review":"This is kinda a big step down for Spyro. Seriously, this game is quite buggy and glitchy, and pretty darn short, and it really seems unfinished. I absolutely loved the three games on the PlayStation 1, they are great. But now there's this? It doesn't really seem like they put in much effort, seems like they really rushed this game. As a Spyro fan, I own it. But really, if you aren't a Spyro fan, I wouldn't try this game. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it...","review":"me encanta este juego es una de mis favoritos y me trai muchos recuerdos de mi infancia me paso todos los dias jugandolo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many bugs sucked any possible enjoyment from this game","review":"I've been a big fan of the spyro games for many years, and in my opinion, this was the absolute worst game of the entire series. Every single copy that I bought of this game had so many bugs that it sucked out any possible enjoyment I might have gotten from the game. I went through 3 copies, all bought new, of this game and all were so full of bugs and glitches that I returned my copy and finally finished it by renting a copy. When my character wasn't randomly dying for no apparent reason, the gameplay was ok, but honestly, it wasn't worth the frustration. So, if you enjoy your character randomly dying by somehow falling to his death while on solid ground every 5 minutes, then play this game. Otherwise, I wouldn't even bother wasting my time with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want a refund or a revised version...","review":"I was VERY VERY disappointed after purchasing & trying to play this game... The graphics are good, BUT, the game is soooo sluggish & it skips frames badly. I got very frustrated & gave up... A previous reviewer nailed it on the head when they said it didn't even appear that it was tested before it was released... it is that bad...I have & played all the other Spyro games too & I was anticipating & hoping this would be of the previous Insomniac caliber... Alas, I did not have the patience to play it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the Spyro to buy","review":"I really wish I had read the reviews here before I purchased the game. It is NOT at all like the versions we knew from Insomniac games. It is riddled with bugs, awful camera angles, clunky interface and poor controller response. I hate it. Unfortunately I cannot return it cause it's opened, but if there is a Spyro after this, I will be very hesitant to buy it if it is not from Insomniac!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"How sad is this game> Probably the best platformer on the Playstation is now the worst on the PS2. Worse than the 5-year old original technically and it doesn't play as well and full of glitches. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spyro Is Dead","review":"Spyro has long been one of my favorite Playstation games. When I heard about Spyro: Enter the Drangonfly, I could not wait to play it, now I wished I had. Within the first hour of play I realized I was in for a huge let down. The graphics jumped more that Spyro did. Gliches in the scenery included such things as flying though a \\"solid\\" mountain and finding myself in what can only be described as a black hole, and the scenery becoming a blur as you try to run or even when your walking in some areas. The lack of areas to explore was a real dissapointment. Finally, the final fight lasted no more than 2 minutes and with no fun scenes at the end as in all other Spyro games. I must agree with another review I just read on this page. This game seems more like a...knock-off, then the Spyro we all loved once upon a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"In response to the \\"big disappointment\\" review -- you can sleep soundly knowing that you were right in not believing it was from the same team as the other Spyros -- it isn't. The team that did the original 3 Spyros moved on a few years back -- I believe they're the ones responsible for Ratchet and Clank.All else I can say is that you're also right in saying it's a big disappointment -- cruddy framerate, very short, and they stole quite a lot from the first three games. If you look, even the font they use is stolen from the PSone games, and those looked better!I don't know if you'll have much more luck with the gamecube version, but perhaps our favorite little purple dragon won't be a Universally lost cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Basics Are Missing","review":"As a long-time fan of the PS1 versions by Insomniac, I was hopeful that the new developers would have little reason to release anything less than excellent for more capable hardware. Man, am I disappointed.While the worlds are more lush and detailed than the PS1 versions -- as are the characters and effects -- the frame rate can't keep up so it really doesn't matter. No, it's actually worse. I'll take smooth action and responsive controls/camera over lush detail every day. The game has locked up on us three times so far, too, resulting in having to do a lot of stuff over again. It's not as bad as our experiences with Theme Park Roller Coaster for PS2, but it's the only other game that has crashed for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"loyal spyro fan","review":"Terribly disappointing. I've been anxiously awaiting the release of Spyro 4 for months now. It's hard to believe it's from the same makers of the first 3! The graphics are good but that's where it ends. There are MANY flaws. Sound errors, graphic glitches, slow load times, and non-responsive controls just to name a few. Surely, the makers will correct some of these problems and re-release this game later. The game really should be recalled it is so bad. I've been on the Spyro web site and everyone seems to agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the last","review":"I am a big fan of the first three games, but this one is a disapointment.

My grandson and I have enjoyed many hours playing all three Spyro games and when I saw this one I was thrilled and unfortunately did not go online to read the reviews before I bought it. We are very disappointed. The game leaves alot to be desired. Load times are terribly s-l-o-w and the graphics are not up to par. The game has frozen on several ocassions and we have to restart it. We both found Spyro hard to control on the speedways. It is also not very challenging.

Spyro!","review":"Universal has killed our little dragon buddy! This game is SOOOOOO SLOOOOOOW! Spyro has lost his attitude and he is very hard to control. If you want Spryo buy all three of the PS1 games. Cost is the same and you get hours of enjoyable play. If you have a need to spend the 50 bucks, try Insomniac's new game. So much more pleasurable. Rest in peace Spyro..."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too much praise","review":"The play is way too slow, the graphics are the same as the PS1 Spyro games (although I HIGHLY recommend those).

What a disappointment, I read the other bad reviews and decided it really couldn't be that bad, boy was I wrong, it was worse. Low frame-rates, glitchy controls, it just didn't have the same feel as the other Spyros. I set it aside for a few weeks and tried to play it again, it's barely playable at times and incredibly frustrating. Do yourself a favour, buy Ratchet and Clank or Sly Cooper, both are much much better games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game unplayable","review":"I love the Spyro games, but I bought this and returned it because the glitches made it unplayable. Absolutely horrible. Do NOT waste your money. Ratchet and Clank is a terrific substitute though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst spyro Yet","review":"Spyro Enter the dragonfly is the worst out of all its previous games including gameboy advance. it takes forever to load, it is difficult to control spyro, there is a lack of new characters and being able to play as different characters, like in spyro 3. There's only one boss in th entire game, the game is too short - it has only 9 levels, unlike the previous series - over 25 and 4 worlds. Overall, I thought that the game was easy, boring and very uncomfortable, Universal has ruined this game and its rival Crash. This game really suits playstation 1 than PS2, yeah.. the graphics may be well developed, but the comfortability is what counts."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is over","review":"well i am going to admit that i was in to spyro when it came to ps1. whith all 3 games but after playing the demo in \\"Playstation magazine\\". spyro is slow and fat.

Spyro the Dragon 1, 2, and 3 are my favorite games of all time. This game has all of the tasks, but none of the joy of the previous Spyro's. I experienced dozens of bugs and freeze ups during the game. On one level, and entire rooms graphics just disappeared! Big Spyro fans will probably buy the game anyway, but I would suggest renting for a week. The game was mercifully short, but the load times were unbearable.Overall, it feels like they pumped this thing out in time for Christmas without any Quality Assurance. Nevermind that getting a badly put together Spyro game is the saddest Christmas gift ever.If there is any justice, all involved will be fired, or worse yet, be forced to play this mess. Spyro deserves so much more!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy of Spyro. Terrible.","review":"Well, my wife and I have been huge Spyro fans since he first arrived on PS1. We were very excited to discover he was returning for PS2. Playing the game itself, however, led to huge dissappointment. This game is poorly made, with looong load times, graphics that slow down then speed up erratically, making for verey frustrating gameplay, and more than once, the game froze up entirely. I had hoped my copy was simpy screwy, but subsequent copies have proved just as bad. If you truly enjoy Spyro, stick with the first three for PS1, because this game offers nothing. Very dissappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointed by the ending","review":"I don't know about everybody else, but when I play a game, i like to feel rewarded at the end for my hard work. With the other spyro games, you got an extra secret level to play at the end. At end of Enter the Dragonfly, you get nothing. I felt so screwed at the end. I feel like other gamers were right, this game feels unfinished and totally lacked any creativity. A total disappointment. I wish I'd never finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is different.","review":"I loved Spyro on PS1 and I couldn't wait to get a PS2 to play Enter the Dragonfly. Well,I got it on day and I hated the graphics and dialouge. I thought the worlds were coool, but not that much fun. I also didn't like how Spyro looked when her moved. It looked so bad and fake.

This is a PS2 game which makes it different from the playstation games. The graphics are strange and so is the plot. There isn't as much to do in Enter the Dragonfly. I haven't played in awhile so my review isn't crystal clear. There are some neat things about this game though; there's new \\"weapons\\" and characters. Before you totally overlook this game, rent it, see if it's worth you're money to buy it, who knows, you may like it, my disgusting brother did. The down side to that is he has terrible taste! In my opinion he does at least. But all in all it's really not a bad game, so give it a chance first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal","review":"I'm sorry to have to concur with other reviews I've seen here - I only wish I'd read them before I bought the game. I could make a sandwich in the time it takes to load the game, or warp between realms. The graphics and character movement? Choppy & non-responsive, if the game doesn't freeze up in the interim -- it's incredibly annoying. I'm going back to Ripto's Rage so I can recall what drew me to the Spyro arena in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it's really that bad.","review":"Unfortunately, you may have to actually play this game to believe how bad it is, like I did. Please do yourself a favor and rent it to save your sanity. Spyro has lost it's heart, from it's canned, awful dialog, to it's glitchy game play. A tragic end to the trust in the quality of the Spyro games."},{"rating":"1","title":"A short disappointment","review":"I have purchased every Spyro game that has been released... this one is awful. Yea, okay, the premiss is the same, but this is the shortest game I have every played. I dont think I can express my disappointment with this game and the lack of worlds. I mean, after playing it for a few hours one evening I found out that I was already 25% finished. Thats not even close to providing a product worthy of the stiff price. Loading takes _forever_. I mean, every time you change worlds literally takes about 5 minutes. If you are a diehard Spyro fan and just need a fix well, buy it but please don't expect much, or you'll be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not insominac!","review":"I love Insomniac Games (the first three Spyro & Ratchet & Clank) and unfortunately, this game doesn't stack up.

I really hope Vivendi Universal can fix the bugs and recall the game so we can play what could be a fun game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate the new Spyro Game","review":"They have really gotten away from the fun game I started playing years ago. It's turned into some horrible war game that has way too much fighting. What has happened to Sparks?? Does he not help out or is he just a side kick with a lame attempt at humor throughout the game. The game is so dark now, I hate it. My son was playing the game and says that there are scenes taken directly from Gods of War. What a shame. If this is the future of this game, I will consider it my last. Save your money. Does everything, games, have to be about war???"},{"rating":"1","title":"well, it is better than the Legend games..","review":"I really liked the old games, but this one had too many glitches and was too short.. only took me an afternoon to finish it. Only thing I can say good about it is that it's better than the two games they put out after it (a new beginning and eternal night).. I like the old way of wondering around whereever you want and having to figure out lots of little puzzles.. linear playing is just too structured."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST GAME EVER!","review":"When I heard a new spyro game was out, I happily rented it. When I entered it into my PS2, I quickly noticed that this game was not made by Insomniac (My favorite video game creators.) I assumed that I may still like this game. Well, I was 100% wrong! Why? 1) They have Ripto return after you defeated him in the first game. 2) Graphics that make it look like the worlds are made of paper, and 3) The glitches. I then thought, The perfect spyro series has been ruined. So, instead of buying this awful, and stupid game, play the PS1 spyro games. Sadly, this is the worst game I have ever and always will be, other than any PS2 spyro game. Bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happend?? This is a mess!","review":"I own the first 3 Spyros & love them to bits.. this is like a beta-version of a platform game!

I really am just stunned."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Magic is Over","review":"I was a huge fan of Spyro and couldn't wait to get this latest addition, but after playing for a while, I found it to be a huge disappointment. Don't waste your money on this one. The original creators of Spyro were not in on this one and it is so blatantly obvious. Universal Interactive should be ashamed of this attempt at what they call a game. Insomniac originally created Spyro and they did an amazing job. Universal's Spyro has too many glitches and flaws to list, not to mention the game is drastically shorter than the first three. If you want a great game, try Insomniac's latest creation for the PS2, \\"Ratchet and CLank.\\" It is where the latest Spryo should've been with amazing graphics, countless challenges and breathtaking worlds to visit. Spend your money on that one, not Spyro. If you must try Spyro, rent it. You can finish this Spyro before it has to be returned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good news for the spyro jaded","review":"Hey all,I just called the customer service number that came with the game, and they apparently are issuing full refunds for the purchase price of the game now :) Just return the game with a copy of the sales reciept, no questions asked. Also, they said they're working on a replacement cd that will be ready middle of 2003 (though I wonder if that will be enough time to work out all the bugs.Next time, Universal, I hope you can get it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big dissapointment!","review":"I've only been playing for about 6 hours, but I can already tell how awful it is, I can't believe it's from the same team as the other Spyro's. The most annoying problem so far is the very low frame rate, at times it drops below 10 fps, very jerky. That is the real killer. I've also ran across 3 bugs, one time after getting killed after going thru a \\"trial portal\\" I came back to life with the special portal ammo permanently! The graphics are very glitchy, and the sounds effects sound like they were \\"sampled\\" from the original games (in other words, poor, low fidelity copies). I'm considering giving up on the ps2 version and hoping that the gamecube version will at least be playable. The whole things smacks of someone getting a Spyro \\"license\\" and hacking on the code to produce a cheap knock off. I'd be embarassed to have my name in the credits of this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I enter no stars?","review":"Yikes. Could this be any worse? For one, the frame rate is horrible and definitely not nearly on par with the previous three games, which, for the previous reviewer, were made by Insomniac Games, not by the company who produced (or shall we say butchered?) this game.If you're a fan of Insomniac's genius, check out their newest game Ratchet & Clank. This blows even the good Spyro games away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to standards...","review":"-Why only 2 stars:I greedily bought and played this game the day it came out. I wipped through it in one weekend and never picked it up again. It just didn't lure you in like most great games.-Gameplay:You start out in a home world which has 9 other levels you can explore from there. Spyro must explore these levels to rescue dragonflies that are lost. You can drive around vehicles such as submarines, tanks, and UFOs. In addition to breathing fire you have freezing, electric, and bubble breath aswell. The graphics are amazing but they begin to get boring. Everything appears smooth and untouched. Running around and doing your dragon thing becomes routine and once you beat the game there is no reason to get 100% completed except for self praise. There are no bonus levels or special features.-Who should play:I would reccomend this game to a beggining gamer. They might enjoy the simple story line and easy gameplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"big dissapointment","review":"This Spyro game had everyone excited, but when it finally came out, it sucked. The game looks great and it has new features, but that doesn't make up for all the problems with it. It's gameplay is slow, and the storyline is for a 5 year old. With this game, Spyro lost all his attitude. In my point of view, the developers didn't even try on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but, has its faults","review":"When I first played the game, I was extremely disappointed. This game wasn't up to par with the others. Then, I thought I'd play for lack of anything better to do. Once you get into this game and start unlocking levels, it's a lot of fun. I see how they tried to incorporate things from all of the games in this one. The good thing about this game though, is that I didn't particularly hate any of the levels like I did on the other games. The fact that there's different types of breath is also really cool. So to sum up, this game is bad at first but once you get into it, it's as good as the others. The only downside, it's a really short game and it's easy to beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad game!","review":"By the name of the holy lord, I love Spyro. But this game was very terrible. The graphics suck, the screen is glitchy, stupid charachters, and too short! I cannot believe that a series so good could end up with a game soooo bad! My personal favorite would be Spyro the Dragon back then the graphics were great! But this game, for it's time has terrible graphics, crappy camera, and terrible voice acting. If you want real games, check out the other Spyro games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok I Guess","review":"Loved Spyro, in all the previous forms. While the graphics are pretty, they come at the expense of game play. First, the game is EASY! Riptoc's revenge had many tricky puzzles and skill challenges that kept the game interesting for all ages. If any of the bad guys kill you in this game, you probably forgot to hit pause. Also, 45 second loads between screens! And there appear to be at least three bugs in the game, where you are racing the bad guys, and go from fourth, to third, to third, to third... can't win and therefore will not be able to finish the game???All in all, it is intersting to play a new spyro game, but the flaws are colossal. Finish it and break out one of the PS1 games."},{"rating":"1","title":"correction","review":"Actually this isn't from the same team who did the original Spyro games on the PS1.

Hope u are doing well. I just got spyro and it's a pretty decent game. The various environments are pretty dope. There are a lot of them and some are very different, giving the game a variety.

Get Yours!","review":"I highly encourage you to get Spyro Enter The Dragonfly today. The game is dope. There are crazy new features.

I think most will enjoy it, it is playable at any time and by persons of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"We need more games like Spyro-ETD","review":"Hi gamers. The new Spyro game is excellent. I didn't think it would be that great, but it impressed me. Spyro himself is animated well. When his wings move it is very realistic. The makers also created these different and unique worlds for the users to travel through. This is great for people of all ages also. I find that I enjoy playing it and so does my younger brother. Have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best","review":"I really liked this game and believe that it is the best of the other spyro games. Although the game is very similar to Spyro 3 there are some really cool new features that even make it more fun. For example, the ability to climb walls, and the addition of various new types of dragon breath make this game more exciting. There are also a series of mini gmaes throughout the platform which make sure that you do not get bored. There are some minor issues like occasional glitches, but then again what game doesn't have this problem? Overall I gave it 4 stars and I recommend either renting or buying this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"i like the older spyro on ps1","review":"why is rypto in this you kill him on spyro 2 riptos rage well ill just let this one slip after all you kill ripto like 3 times on spyro 2 but the graphics are like vegie tales graphics and riptos mouth was big and his septer looks like a disco ball and dont you think ripto isnt a real evil villan like gnasty gnorc or the wich that looks like a dinosaur i really dont know how spell her name and its hard"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible beyond all reason","review":"This game is a total waste of money. It features horrible graphics, horrible storylines, cheesy characters, and it lacks the challenge that the other Spyro games possess. I beat this game in a mere 45 minutes. There are only 8 or 9 levels, and the main plot to the game is to catch bugs. BUGS! Plus, I beat the final boss Ripto on my first try.

I seriously wouldn't recommend this game. If you've never played any Spyro games I'd recommend the 1st 3. They are REALLY awesome :) but this ps2 game is boring, and the graphics pretty much suck.

I bought it the first day it was released, ran home and popped it in the PS2......Yuck!What happened? If your looking for the old Spyro you won't find him here. Vivendi Universal has totally trashed the Spyro legacy. Anything that can be wrong with a game is in this one. Looks like Vivendi Universal released this game before they even tested it because as far as I'm concerned this game is UNPLAYABLE. Long load times and frame rate problems are just a few of the problems. I played this game for 10 minutes and I could not play it anymore. Don't waste your money. Buy Insomniacs new game Ratchet & Clank. It's 10 bucks cheaper and 1000 times better. FYI - Insomniac was the original developer of Spyro."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Disappointment","review":"Lots of frame rate problems.

The loading time takes forever and there are so many glitches, it makes the game more irritating than fun. It was not as challenging as the previous games and was indeed a great disappointment. It seemed as if they started with a great concept, but rushed the production in order to get it out before the buying season. I definitely do not recommend this Spyro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!!!","review":"I felt really dissapointed with this game!!I loved the others Spyro but the \\"Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly\\" is awful!It just had one world...come on!!!Sorry guys!!!I didnt like it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"load longer than level","review":"The graphics really aren't improved enough to make up for the loading issues, nor are the levels that long. Plus these 5+ minute loading times are there not only when you go to a different world and/or level, but also when you enter a mini-game within a level. This makes leaving and coming back to something more time consuing than doing a part at that very moment because you'll load while leaving the mini-game, then load while leaving the level, and load 2 more times getting back to that mini-game. There are major glitches in the PS2 version, I don't know about any other versions. I've beaten every Spyro game, and this would have otherwise been as good as the others. I'd recommend having a portable game to play during the loads or something else to occupy that time, or not playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freezing...and I don't mean the ice breath.","review":"I waited and waited until the price dropped on this game, but even the $20.00 I paid wasn't worth it. The game is WAY too short, I finished it in 2 days. The previous Spyro games took me much longer (like at least a couple weeks) and were a lot more fun.There's no skateboarding which was disappointing, I really liked that in the last game.But that's not my biggest problem. This game froze almost every time I played and the graphics would just disappear. I had it happen more than once that I would be walking around in an area and the graphics would just disappear. I could still walk, jump, etc, but couldn't see any of the environment. I'd have to restart the system and then the level. ARGH!I can't even go into all my other complaints. Let's just say that compared to the other games in this series this game sucked!

The not-so-happy ending is that I got my money back, but I didn't get my Spyro fix.This game was the reason I bought a PS2 at all. Ah well, Insomniac released a game around the same time called \\"Ratchet and Clank\\" which was as fun as the original Spyro games."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good idea gone badly wrong","review":"Everyone else has said it for me. I like the graphics, there have been a few clever activities but the jerkiness and poor angles of the camera are very distracting. I'm only halfway through the game and it's lost data while saving at least four times--very frustrating to have to complete a whole level again. It's too easy, which is nice for my three year old. It's too short.

I can't believe that I waited two years for this disaster. I've never played a game that had so many bugs in it. Unfortunately, you can't return a game once it's been opened.

The Congressional study just released details a pattern of behavior by China over the past twenty years in which sensitive and nuclear technology were obtained through illegal means by China from the United States. The means varied but included outright theft of nuclear technology. The potential threat posed by China is one that the United States government and policy community must recognize if we are to meet the challenges of China in the upcoming century. While many people might consider realism and balance of power passe, this book makes a strong case for the United States government to reevaluate its relationship with the PRC from top to bottom.

And this is an big understatement. What worries me is the American way of thinking about the world in general. The so called respected journalist/scientest don't give a neutral (or at least a fair and objective) view of the 'conflict'. That's worries me because the Americans in general, are 'easy' believers (just have an open ear of one side of the story). The first thing that I've learned at the university was that every author/teacher has it's own thruth, and it is our job to read at least a couple different views (and be open for it) before we take any conclusions of ourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read.","review":"I tried to keep an open-minded perspective on the arguments made in this book but they're just outrageous. Despite the military flexing along the Taiwan Straits in 1996 (from where most of the arguments and extrapolations in this book are drawn) and the recent verbal jousts during the Presidential elections where the upsart and pro-independence DPP forged ahead, China remains to be a superpower to be reckoned and does what any other superpower would do to edge favorably.

The third person omniscient view made for a drawn out narrative and too much depiction on emotions instead of action. It is very slow paced, almost boring me into submission, however the ending seemed rushed. Good writing, poorly implemented gave meaningless yet influential characters such as Bunny, Alice and Adrian the opportunity to \\"fluff\\" the novel.

The lute is miked way too closely, there's echo added to it, yet birds and crickets chirp annoyingly in the simulated background.

The song selection is much bigger then Konamix's, but it is still a lot like Konamix. It shares certain songs and of course, introduces some new ones. I found the thing with holding the arrows extremely difficult, I am a seasoned DDR player and I failed some normally easy songs because of the stupid hold steps.

No good songs","review":"I will rate this game into three different catigories.Gameplay:Great! Freeze arrows have been introduced and the animation of the arrows on the screen have been greatly improved. Also, the introduction of music videos adds a nice touch. There are three modes of difficulty so everyone can dance at exactly their skill level.Music:Now I know that everyone has different musical tastes but several people have told me that the songs in DDR Max are terrible. I am sorry to say that I have to agree with them. The arrows are really only half of the fun. The music you dance to is the other half.Fun:This game really fun.

It is great for parties and provides hours of fun and entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"this game is a very good game and i got it because i have played it at arcades and my sister also likes it. so far we have only bought the game (without the pads) and it is still fun. we plan on buying metal pads for more responsive controls and it should be a lot of fun. one bad thing about ddr max is the songs. i am a fan of fast moving steps and ddr max has a lot of slower songs. dont get me wrong, the slow songs can be very hard but i would rather play fast ones. if u like slower songs i would definitely recommend it because most of them are slow to moderate speed. even if u only like fast songs i still recommend getting it because it is a very good game and even if u do have to search for a song u like, i still think it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Best of Da Best","review":"This game is the REALIST!

All the best songs are left out and there are so many distracting things dancing in the background that drag your eyes away from the arrows.

Anyone who has player the inported versions would know that they are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty dang fun.......","review":"After reading so many reviews praising ddr max as the best dancing game ever, I got it along with a dance pad and tried it out. At first it was incredibly difficult. I would lose every time. I've definitely gotten a lot better at it, but still can't do alot of the stuff. One of the problems with ddr max is its extreme difficulty level. Even at light mode, it takes a ton of practice just to be able to do those well. Also, there aren't enough good and easy songs to practice on. I like the workout mode, but I wish they could simply have allowed you to pick out a playlist and then let you simply dance without all the interruptions because it destroys the rhythm. But still, it's a great mode of play. Multiplayer is really fun since you can dance with another person. Overall the game is pretty good, but I'd recommend DDRExtreme. It's newer, has more songs, is more balanced, features eyetoy support and everything which makes ddr max and ddrmax 2 relatively obsolete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go out and buy it!","review":"Hey!

No running out of hot water and no need to turn off the water at the taps and re-adjust the temperature when you turn the taps back on.

Instead, the packaging clearly says it's a shut off valve. If water continues to trickle when the valve is in the off position, then you can't claim it to be a shut off valve. Just saying.My 2.5gpm shower head doesn't appear to be designed to work well with this valve. I thought it would be an inexpensive way at reducing the water use further with my shower head.

There isn't a temple in Cedar City, Mormons would not call the Salt Lake Temple the \\"big\\" temple, girls wear their wedding dresses when they are married, fathers don't give a father's blessing ever night and morning--they have family prayer, jell-o is such a cliché, and a return missionary is called an RM not a MSS. The list of her discrepancies goes on and on. I kept reading hoping that she would get past the religion thing and get on with the story but I gave up after 100 or so pages. I am still very annoyed, displeased, irritated, etc... by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I picked this up at the local library in audio-book form. The story has promise at the beginning, but part way through (maybe 1/3?)I had to return it. Mitchard makes the LDS look like some sort of perfect fantasy world. The characters aren't believable because they are so goody-good- it is all too sickening sweet. It seems like an advertisement for the Mormon Church and that really turned me off since I personally consider the church to be a cult. I don't mind learning about the LDS, but reality is better than make believe in this case. The writing is poor and the story is run of the mill- too often the norm for Mitchard. Since there are so many great books out there, I couldn't see wasting my time on one that is lacking in so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cage of Stars","review":"Can't get myself to finish it because I loathe what this poor young girl is feeling and doing. The premeditation and deliberate plan to hurt these two people is horrible. I know of her loss but this is absurd. I won't finish this novel. I'm on page 215 and will go no further I don't want to hear any more of this in my mind. This book I purchased at Amazon and it was a book that was discarded by the Oradell Public Library. I know the area well. Grew up going there regularly. Couldn't believe it when I looked on the back inner cover and saw that. Well I guess someone else felt the same way I do.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great book...","review":"This is the first Mitchard book that I've read and I really enjoyed it. I was somewhat confused by my library's labeling of it as \\"Mystery\\" because I don't think it was a mystery at all but it was heartbreaking and kept my interest. Parts are a little awkward and unbelievable (like the recent post of Miko converting) but overall I couldn't put this down. I think it's mostly about finding peace through tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I'm not sure where to start- from the painfully irrelevant details to the totally unrealistic murder description, this book was a waste of time. The concept of the book sounded good but the execution was terrible. It went on and on about the most unrelated details and when you get to the parts you'd think would be important, they were written in a way that didn't seem realistic in any sense. I understand this is fiction but it appeared the goal of the author was to make you feel like you could be the main character in the book. Instead I found myself cringing with disbelief for most of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This book was just way too unrealistic for me. I got very impatient with it and found the story to be unbelievable and tedious. The main story could have been written in about 3 pages - all the background and detail about the character and her family was just boring. Things in real life just don't \\"fall into place\\" the way they did in the end of this book. I'm all for happy endings as long as they're believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would suggest everyone read this book.","review":"Loved the characters and the story line. Also the religious explanations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"In a story that starts out with a brutal murder, the heroine Ronnie grows from a young girl harboring guilt into a young woman able to come to grips with the past. She is a strong, likeable character who earns the reader's admiration. Completely engrossing, the story is about tragedy, love, forgiveness, and understanding. For me, it was also a very positive view of Mormonism, especially in contrast to Under the Banner of Heaven, which, although it focused on fundamentalist Mormonism, presented a pretty scary look at the religion. (4 1/2 stars)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and dull","review":"I kept waiting for the clever revelation to happen and it just fizzled. It was an okay, though not mind-blowing, story drawn out way too long and then wrapped up with a lame, tidy, sugar-coated, ending. Mitchard took way too long to build up and then seemed to run right over the top of the climax and denoument, barely touching the characters. Would have made a better novelette at half the length."},{"rating":"2","title":"A traumatic emotional struggle","review":"Veronica Swan's two little sisters are murdered while she is babysitting them. Her life and her parents are turned upside-down as they try to deal with their grief while facing the media. Ronnie's parents struggle with their grief for two years but slowly seek to forgive Scott Early. Ronnie does not understand their decision which forces her to move out. She decides to go to California. It is no coincidence that Scott and his wife are now living there. Ronnie pursues her dream of becoming an EMT. She manages to get a job babysitting for Juliet, Scott and Kelly's baby daughter. Ronnie deftly manages to stay connected to her friends from home and make new ones on the job. The case is one that will stay with you for a long time after finishing the last page. Bravo for such a great masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite real","review":"This book started out fairly good, but after the murders it started going downhill fast. It seems the author didn't research the life of a Mormon very well. Nothing related to mormonism was really true. and How many parents send their 16-17 year old girl away to college without going with her to set up an apartment and find out about the school she goes to? The main story was interesting - the supporting roles were too much of a fairly tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Babysitters Club Meets Charles Manson","review":"Without the heinous crime this little novel very well could have been shelved as a young adult title...Ronnie is rtdiculously unrealistic...Scott Early(the grim reaper)very thinly sketched...basketball play by play...cutsie instant messaging...first kisses...not to mention painfully unrealistic college admissions...Yale? Harvard? EMT training at 16? I lost all patience with this by the syrupy ending.More than disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cage of Stars","review":"Jacquelyn Mitchard's new novel is a thought provoking roller coaster of emotions. I didn't want to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Mitchard needs an editor","review":"I loved Deep End of the Ocean, but none of her books since have lived up to it. I now find myself reading her books just for the fun of finding all the mistakes. Mitchard can't keep track of her characters - on page 14 Grandma Swan is still alive, living in Miami, and remembers to send each grandchild a book every Christmas. Sixteen pages later she is in heaven welcoming her murdered grand-daughters. Later, Grandpa gives Ronnie her wedding dress, and we're told Grandma died ten years previous in a car accident. Still, the family managed to visit her when one of the murdered girls was 3. Mitchard even seems to confuse the two murdered girls at times. In The Breakdown Lane, one character is first mentioned as the middle sister and later becomes the oldest. I won't even start on the confusion created with all of the variations and diminutives of characters' names...."},{"rating":"1","title":"She Thinks She can, She Thinks She Can ...","review":"The author thinks she can weave a somewhat accurate depiction of Mormon lifestyle and beliefs into her story, but she can't. Instead, she lays it on thick, sloppy and loose. As an active Mormon, the story didn't flow for me because it just didn't ring true. Although she had some things right, she had just as many wrong. I felt it too distracting and annoying to finish. If she wanted Mormonism to play such a prominent role in the story she should have taken real care to get it right, if credibility is important to her as an author."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's it all about ??","review":"I have read and enjoyed several other books by this author. I found Cage of Stars to be just a mess. I kept reading, I guess, to see where on earth the author was going. Everything was belabored, the dialogue, the themes, etc. There was WAY too much about Mormonism to the point that I wondered if Ms. Mitchard was acting in the role of apologist or what. I found this to be just annoying. The descriptions of the grief of the family were excellent and well done, but the rest of the story parts just seemed excessive and superflous. It was like \\"enough already.\\" The book would have been a better read if had been more condensed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time/money","review":"This story is contrived to the point that it actually started to annoy me. I realize that part of reading fiction is the ability to suspend disbelief, but at points I found myself saying outloud, \\"This is ridiculous.\\" All that might be forgivable if the book was well-written. It isn't. The sentence structure and vocabulary are often awkward and lack the ring of truth. Bottom line -- invest your time and money in a more satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but not her Best.","review":"This book is unlike her others. What troubled me most was the voice it was in. At times she has the narrator talk directly to the reader, which I hate, but then she shifts into a more fictional memoir format. The narrator is at times unbelievably immature or mature for her age (depending on the situation).I did however, read this book in two sittings. It read quickly and had some interesting information on Mormon lifestyle, attempting to eradicate some of the old stereotypes, and the subplots, while they weren't developed overly well, were interesting enough to keep me going.I think I'd truly give this 3 1/2 stars, but I rounded up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than nothing. . .maybe","review":"This book was very well-organized and is a much more convenient ready-reference than the six SHRM Learning System module books.Unfortunately, this book and CD set were very poorly edited. The text and included CD contain numerous typos and erroneous answers (obviously from sloppy copying and pasting), which impeded learning and studying many of the concepts necessary to pass the PHR exam. Also, the exam alerts were not at all representative of actual PHR exam material (based on my exam experience as of 15JUN06). Though I did pass the PHR, this book was more of a hindrance than a help.This book and CD set should have been an excellent resource, but the weaknesses created by the lack of attention to detail in editing greatly outweigh its strengths, rendering it an overall disappointment. I would not recommend this book to anyone preparing for the PHR exam. At best, it might serve as a supplement HR reference, as long as you can overlook the numerous errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning tool!","review":"This book is a great learning tool it gives you the right information that is needed to prepare for the PHR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpfull","review":"I just took and passed the PHR and I would say that this book is not relevant to the exam I just took. The practice test contained many questions that focused on material that I never saw on the exam or saw one or two questions about. The book is more of a poorly written General HR Management textbook and not a good test prep tool at all. If you are looking for a relevant useful prep tool look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Fluff","review":"This book is not an exam prep. It surprises me that the publisher even gets away as describing it as an exam prep. The problem is that the book contains entirely too much \\"fluff\\" and not enough specific instruction on exactly what is needed for the exam. For example, in chapter 7 under \\"Exam Alert\\" it gives a list of terms and names needed for the exam, but DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE DEFINITIONS! This book may be somewhat useful as a reference guide for HR generalists to use on the job, but it is by no means a useful study guide for the PHR exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to pass your PHR....don't get this!","review":"It doesn't have the in depth core information needed to pass solely on this book. It is a good supplement to the SHRM materials, but not a substitute. It omitted a lot of info that's on the PHR test."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IT IS NOT HELPFUL!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I used this book as my only tool for taking the PHR exam. That was a BIG mistake. This book is horrible. It maybe helped me MISTAKES in the practice test in the book and MANY MISTAKES in the CD_rom with practice test on it. The book also differs from their own CD_rom. There test question are very situational and specific where the actually PHR Exam is more generic and has very few situational questions. The sample test questions in this book and CD_rom are very precise with lots of information so it is easier to decide what the best answer is. The PHR exam is not. I just took the test and I don't' want anyone else to waste their time using this book as a study tool like I did. Look elsewhere for help. Go straight to HRCI and SHRM for your help. This book isn't worth the money. Spend the extra money and go thru HRCI or SHRM."},{"rating":"1","title":"PHR Exam Prep: Professional in Human Resources (Exam Cram)","review":"\\"Cram\\" is the key word here. Buy the book if you have no time to prepare for the PHR and are making a last ditch effort to pass. This book is not very effective for learning the 6 key study sections needed to pass the PHR in and by itself. For those people who cannot afford SHRM preparation materials ($500+), perhaps this book can be better than no preparation at all. I seriously doubt I would have passed the PHR if I had relied on this material alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent study guide","review":"Decent practice exam on the CD, although several practive exams would have beed ideal, but overall good book.

Poor organization of subjects, incomplete definitions, typos, etc. The author jumps from one concept to another, without any effort to provide a thorough and logical progression.

I haven't taken the exam yet but I feel confident about the information I have obtained.LIKES: comprehensive information on every aspect of HR and \\"exam alerts\\" that provides areas that will definately be on the exam.DISLIKES: There are SO many mistakes in the book which include typos and misprints. For example, the \\"exam review questions\\" at the end of Chapter 4 show answers to questions that are not related to the question. Definately a misprint on the publisher's part.

This movie is so boring I almost felled to sleep on it. The movie is taken place in a office with Demetria and her husband talking to a counseler about their marriage.

It Was Pretty Good","review":"If I had to give this movie a grade it would be a C+ primarily because there was character development issues my opinion. The lead female character really irked the heck out of me and I felt we (the audience) never really got a chance to see what her core issues were that made her so angry. She just came across as a really foul-mouth, ungrateful, nag who couldn't recognize a good think if it bit her in the face. I also think the director could have cut out at least 30 minutes of the movie at varying points without losing continuity of the story line; 2hrs is way too long. On a positive note the issues they dealt with in this film was very real and were dealt with in a real manner. And although this movie would fall in the category of \\"low budget\\" I thought it was done well enough to make one forget that. I can understand why some people would really like this movie.

The phrase, \\"fasle traitor,\\" is meant to exemplify Riel'sBraz has done an excellent job of collected many diverse documents, including illustrations whose presence enliven this volume. He also lays out the various \\"Riels\\": traitor, lunatic, visionary, cultural mediator, and so forth.

Unlike his other works with clearer central themes, this book is a collection of essays loosely bound by the notion that God exists nearly anywhere, anytime in the world history and our personal ones, from prisons, collapse of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe, non violence protests of Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., to the love of the anonymous who help other humans blah blah blah.To those christians and even non christians who had not read any other Yancey book, this can be a comfortable start to know one of the most important christian writer of our time. However, for somebody like me who had tasted his heavenly fruit and become one of his fans, this book would seem a little bit repetitive of his more famous works like \\"What's so amazing about grace\\" and \\"Where is God when it hurts\\", and thus unable to satisfy one's enhanced spiritual appetite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yancey-Finding God","review":"Well written, with a down home type of style that is common to most of Yancey's work.

Most people would affirm their belief in God but are not quite sure if God is still hanging around. Philip Yancey provides a wake up call for those who suffer from such spiritual malaise. As a Christian journalist, he has found God in places where we would never expect. God is very much in the world working through men and women in reconciling them to him and one another.This wonderful collection of essays provide us with a close up view of God's presence in our world. They also deal with those issues which confront our faith and enables us to respond in a spiritual and intelligent manner to those who question us.Divided in six parts, Yancey shows us God without looking, in the workplace, in the headlines and yes even in the institution called the church.

I wish it was a 2GB however. It also lacks an internal clock, thus disallowing use of time-sensitive audio-book downloads from the library (they didn't note this in the write-up on it). Other than that - it's good for what it is and a whole lot easier than toting a CD Player around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality for the price","review":"This is my first player and did not want to spend the kind of money that an I-Pod costs. I bought this based on other reviews and was pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. No directions come with the player but Sandisk does have an on-line operation manual for the 200 series that is comprehensive and answered all my questions. I am impressed with the sound quality of the earphones that come with the player. However, if you have small ear canals as I do, they won't fit comfortably or stay in well.

They take you to many places musically: hard rock (Imitaion), straight rock (Give), breezy pop (Lilly), southern rock (Down), latin rock (Casa), boogie (Woolly), gritty (Sausage), etc. The album is a collection of their more recent live editions. This one is very much unlike other Panic records in that it is very song oriented and lacks a true musical theme (other than changing it up). As always, the muscianship is tops and lyrics are true and meaningful without being preachy. If you enjoy rhythm-driven rock where each instrument and vocal blends in and out to create complex structure you will enjoy the Panic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you get the bonus live CD","review":"The version of this album that I bought contained an unadvertised bonus live CD. I don't know if all versions of this album have this bonus live CD. There is another version of this album that does specifically list the extra live disc. You should get that one instead of this one to be sure you get the live CD.The live CD is 26 minutes long and is a pretty good representation of how good the group sounds in concert. The music is fantastic, except for a horrible piano solo in the middle of track 3. When used as a rhythm instrument, the keyboards do add some depth to the songs. But, the keyboard solos can be pathetic. This one is on a par with Chopsticks.The studio album is fairly typical, some great songs and some bad ones.

Personally, I can't wait for more WSP live albums (and DTTB does come with a great bonus disk of live tracks), but I've yet to be disappointed by a WSP studio effort. Only drawback is that the studio albums leave you craving a jam. On the whole, another tremendous effort. So glad that someone out there is still committed to making great music.

All he does is ...on the whole album, not to mention their live performances. Well I guess I'll have to give them some credit. Widespread is probably the best cover band ever to have played. I knew they couldn't produce a completely original album. The had to stick a least one cover song on there. If you like listening to 15 min. uncreative, unoriginal, uninspiring jams then this is the band for you.

There are also many test simulators available online, which have proven to be very helpful in preparing for the exam. The questions at the end of the chapters in this book are not in any way similar to the actual test questions, so while a good review of the material, they are in no way a good prep for the actual exam.

There is nothing about it that rings true - it's truly a work of fiction, if I may be so bold to use that word. It is so badly written, words cannot describe its plethora of misspellings, poor grammar, and incomprehensible, verbose prose.

She married the priest she met at retreats and college classes; they adopted stray dogs and a baby from another country.

I give her a lot of credit for telling the truth and for the humerous side of her life as well. I forgive the few typos in the book and found it a really interesting book and unique in its format.

Their subsequent releases also include some top freestyle material (You are the one, Give your love to me, & the melancholy touching Louder than love). Please note the version of Tears may fall is not the original mix but a remix (which I find less powerful than the original). I'd recommend a release of TKA's 12\\" freestyle mixes of all their freestyle hits on CD - their extended mixes include some pumping hard beats and great edits"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky Adventure","review":"Wishbone is a lovable ,talking, pooch full of stories.

And he specifically celebrated the things that today, we are trying to painfully wean ourselves from. For example, he exulted over the fact that \\"I will live 30 miles in one direction from the office, while my secretary will live 30 miles in the other direction from the office, and together, we will consume enough gasoline and rubber for tires that we will keep several people busy producing them.\\" OK, so that's not an exact quote because it's been several years since I read the book, but that's the essence. Look it up, and others like it, and you'll discover that this guy's ideas are responsible for greater destruction of western urbanism than World War II. Seriously.

The music surrounds and envelops the listener, but remains very cold and distant. Several tracks follow the same mold - a series of chords that is repeated, and at each repetition you hear new electronic sounds, building and building throughout the piece, then fading out at track's end. I like it, but it makes some of the music a little predictable. Frozen East, Ashes, and Beacon are standouts. The rest of the CD holds up as well, but I wonder if this could have been distilled to 1 CD. It's still worth it.As you listen, your mind will conjure up images of bright sun and cold, cold ice.

The story was poorly coordinated. Some earlier narrated issues, which were revived over and over again instigated boredom.Also, the adventurers made no effort in detailing how a typical day in Iran looks like, instead they were exacerbating on how they took (unfair) adventage of their host's hospitality and trust.In a nutshell, this is not the book to look for, if your interest is to know more about the Iranian culture. It is just a piece of volatile fun (for those thatit will amuse).Not something that I would recommend with enthusiasm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nonsense","review":"The Amazon review says \\"she dons a black cloak, scarf, and chador (the full body covering required by Shiite Islam)\\". I don't think so. This is nonsense. If you have a chador (the all-encompassing unstructured garment that most westerners can't manage) you don't need a black cloak and scarf as well; you're covered. If not, you do need a cloak (black unnecessary) and scarf. You don't need purdah...the title is a slander. (Purdah refers to covering your face and/or being required to stay indoors so your face is not seen. The word literally means 'curtain'. This is NOT required in Iran, and on our own trip we saw women going everywhere, talking easily to foreign men like myself, and generally living a freer life than in any other Muslim country.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Iran from inside a chador","review":"Iran is such a closed society that any glimpse inside it is especially fascintating. Alison Wearing has done a great service by allowing us to meet the real people of Iran, whose kindess, hospitality, craziness, and so forth show them to be as human as one would suspect. Especially interesting are individual Iranians' feelings, pro and con, about the Islamic revolution, and the author's experience of their culture and observations about it: After months of wearing the restrictive and horribly uncomfortable clothing required of Iranian women, she finds she is not immediately ready to remove it after leaving.

Could. Not. Put. It. Down. I felt like I was on an Iranian journey right along with Ms. Wearing - could hear, taste, touch, smell, and see Iran through her rich words. The portraits she paints of each person she meets on the journey left an indelible print in my mind. This book has made me want to travel myself and to see parts of the world that are not traditionally well-traveled by Westerners. I could not recommend this book more highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"She Didn't \\"Get\\" It","review":"Alison Wearing attempts to present an ancient and complicated culture from the perspective of a five month visit. Wearing hejab is not all that is necessary to not offend. I lived in Iran for two years and was amazed at her lack of sensitivity to the culture. She never lost her Western eyes, nor realized that often she was an object of fun to her hosts. I hope that those who read this book realize that there are many better on the subject. Iranians are a complex people, not the clowns of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, No","review":"When I first saw this book I thought it would be a delightful travel monlogue with a lot of good writting, new sights and sounds and a fresh perspective into a country that has long mystified me. What I got for my money was a dull political diatribe against the western world. Granted Iran has received plenty of bad press but this author seemed determined to drum that point home at every opportunity. I found her attitude that all of the folks she met were good and loving people who she should trust with her life to be very distrubing. She showed an amazing lack of commen sense and put herself into life-threatening siutations (playing cards with a drug dealer!) with out any thought of the consequences.

I am lucky I escaped with scalp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I had been really looking forward to reading this book. I was sorely disappointed. I found Ms. Wearing's descriptions of her travels to be confused and highly repetitive. I actually found myself wondering if she was even telling truthful accounts. I also felt her behavior at certain points was out of line (jumping in the water in her chador) and disrespectful of Iranian culture. The cycle in this book is as follows: arrive at town, meet new person, take advantage of their hospitality, recall lengthy dialogues about Iranian revolution. I gathered very little information about Iran other than that its people are kind and generous, even to this seemingly undeserving Canadian tourist. I do look forward to reading more books on traveling in Iran, but hopefully better than this lousy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done, Ms. Wearing","review":"This is a very good book about a Westerner's experience in the mystery called Iran. Even though Ms. Wearing proves to be a rather naive and not-so-sensitive tourist towards the culutures and sentiments of Iranians, she has a sincere and refreshing view.The fact that Ms. Wearing focuses on people only and does not discuss any details about the rich history, culture, monuments and places that make Iran so unique and draw thousands of tourists every year was a bit disappointing. However, I consider this as Ms. Wearing's personal intention and idea and respect her for this particular decision.It should be noted, however, that she mostly interacts with small-town Iranian citizens who are a world different than almost one-third of the population living in big cities with a very different lifestyle. Being a \\"big city\\" Iranian myself, I felt something missing there.Ms. Wearing has a great sense of humor and proves to be an amusing storyteller.

I like them a lot. I cook quite often, and this set has held up really well so far. I have not had any warping issues, or flaking from the non- stick coating. They are super easy to clean too. I do wish that the set came with some deeper skillet pans, but other than that, I am quite satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Brand","review":"They sell it as T-fal but there is no single word on the box that says T-fal.

After a few months, I noticed some chipping of the teflon coating. This was very surprising given how little I used them, and how I always used soft utensils while cooking. As of last week, Mar 2010, I had to throw the entire set away since these \\"chips\\" have become huge tears in the teflon up to 1-inch in diameter that reveal the aluminum underneath.I only purchased this set because I had good experience with Mirro products in the past, and ironically, the one saucepan I have left from that last (good) set still has its teflon coating intact. Mirro product quality must have gone through some significant drop since then.DO NOT purchase this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"It is NOT T-fal. GetaGrip is a Wearever/Mirro product. Do a web search for GetaGrip 10 piece set and you will see.

If you want REAL T-fal, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not last","review":"I received this set as a gift four years ago, and am still using it until I decide which stainless steel set to invest in. I have no metal utensils and have handwashed all my dishes for the past eight years; however, the non-stick coating began to come off the smaller pots about two years ago -- one has no Teflon whatsoever at this point -- and they are now all in various stages of 'Teflon-shed.' The cookware isn't terrible, but I expected to use them for longer than four years. The likelihood that the peeling Teflon will be considered evidence of 'abuse' on my part and not a 'manufacturer's defect,' plus the cost of shipping it all back to Wearever, prevents me from returning this set under warranty. Purchase this set if you don't mind upgrading within a year or two to something more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"The cookwear advertised was T-Fal.

I had looked at many Tag watches before and the reason I ordered this one is because I couldn't get it in the store. When it arrived, I was only disappointed because it is the MINI LINK women's model - but having only seen it online I thought it was the larger ladies model. I thought it was the same size as the Formula 1 with the triple row of diamonds-bezel, but it's definitely not. This watch is delicate and small. Don't get me wrong - the watch is very beautiful and my Amazon experience was great. The price is also dramatically lower than the stores I dealt with. However, the watch is just too small.

I had missed being able to play my old, worn out album for many years, and was thrilled when it became available on his site. I now have a teenager, who fell in love with it from the moment I unwrapped the CD and played it. They all take me back to a time, place, and state of mind that is good to revisit from time to time. \\"Landscape\\" and \\"We\\" are my favorites, but there isn't a tune that I don't like. \\"Anello\\" is fun, L'Ballad is epic - it goes on and on.

They are soft and pull all of the moisture (and other stuff) out of my horn. They do not scratch and they have a little springy-ness to them that helps get them through tight turns. However I expected to receive all the parts shown in the photo. Clearly shown are two pull through swabs and a valve brush stick. One swab is for most tubing while the smaller swab is for the narrower lead pipe. The smaller swab is absolutely essential for a cornet and very handy for a trumpet.

This was the first pair to disappoint.First, the color of the leather as received is much duller and browner than the somewhat orange sheen that shows in the pic.Second, they lack the signature comfort of previous pairs of Eccos I have enjoyed, although that may be due to the fact it's a loafer and not my more typical Helsinki or Seattle slip-ons.The stitching is also more pronounced than the photo shows and than is typical for a loafer, making them look more casual than you'd expect.Finally, the latex sole at the front is already starting to show the first signs of separation of the shoe. So this pair do not appear to be nearly as durable as other Eccos.Sorry to be a party-pooper amidst these other glowing reviews, but this is my honest opinion, and in this case I think you get what you pay for, i.e. a cheaper Ecco offering is in fact cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brody Text Review","review":"Needed this book for the LSUS Master's Program in Human Services Administration.

Not only does it boast such luminaries as Thad Jones and Snooky Young in their last years with the band but it also includes several seldom-heard items from the band's book, most notably great ballad features for tenor saxophonist Eric Dixon and trumpeter Sonny Cohn.

Only 2002 works for the 360. 2003 doesn't work, but for some reason the xbox website says they both work.I love this game, even though I can only play 2002. The only gripe I have with KOF 2002 is the graphics. And it's probably because of the 360's backwards compatibility, but on the 360 when you play the game, you can clearly see grid lines on pretty much every character. I don't know if that's how it is the original xbox, but that's how it looks on the 360. It's more noticeable on some characters than others.

More serene numbers such as 'Spanish Heart', featuring Bernard Sumner on vocals, and another single release in 'Ooops', also featuring a guest vocalist in Bjork, demonstrated a different side to the hardcore energy of earlier releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great listening","review":"This CD grows on me every time I listen to it.

When this strike happened I was overseas and the event escaped my notice until just now. I do remember the absolute poverty of the coal camps but they were no worse than lumber camps or the homes of many who worked for neither. During my youth the third most profitable industry was moonshine, now its pot. My Dad owned a small independent mine for a period but was forced out of business by union miners who threatened his leased truckers to the point that they refused to transport his coal over Pine Mountain to the railroad. Life has not progressed in Harlan County today as it has in other parts of the US; in fact, during my last visit I thought that it was worse than when I was a child helping Dad at his mine (early 1950s.) However, I still was moved by this film as much as I have ever beeen moved by a movie. Well worth watching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harlan County is TRUE","review":"Growing up as a \\"coal miner's daughter\\" in Ky myself I can assure you this is spot-on accurate. Mining in a KY small town is often the only means to successfully support your family. My father worked in a union mine and after as a \\"company man\\" but even union strikes were frightening and often violent as so much was at stake. We were often shipped off to another town for safety while my dad would guard the house. This was in the mid 70's as well.I admire the accurate depiction of the people in this documentary. I expected them to be depicted as sterotypical uneducated southern rednecks and what I saw were wise, passionate and well-spoken (albeit with a southern drawl!) The WOMEN were amazing and fearless. Would love to see a followup to what has happened to the town and the people 30+ years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best documentarys ever","review":"Granted, very few documentary filmmakers are blessed enough to have such colorful characters who almost seem to be better suited to a melodrama, but the (real-life) cast is just one of the great things about this movie.It reminds us of a time when workers, although having little formal education, knew about class struggle. Some of the women in this film are astounding in their will to help the men working in the mines achieve their contract. Of all the characters in the film, Bessie and Lois may be two of the most admirable people I've ever seen.You also learn about right-wing paranoia in the form of Basil Collins, who ascribes any instance of workers attempting to better their living situation as \\"communism.\\" Sound familiar?Finally, I should add that the music in this film is incredible. You can buy the soundtrack, too, and I recommend that you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had always despised unions until I saw this movie","review":"As they say in Appalachia, boys and girls- it don't get more realer than this... these people are tougher than woodpecker lips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harlan County, U.S.A.","review":"Filmed between 1973 and 1974, Kopple's groundbreaking work gets up close and personal with the downtrodden rural miners, who are deprived of fair wages and insurance, and forced to shop at the company store. As her roving, restless camera makes plain, Eastover operates in collusion with the Harlan police, who look the other way when its representatives start taking pot shots at miners (and Kopple herself). Few documentaries today have the immediacy, intensity, or militant appeal of this Oscar-winning film, an edge-of-your-seat tribute to a courageous group of hard hats and their families. \\"Harlan County, USA\\" is real-life drama of the highest order."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAWRENCE JONES - LAY THE LEAD TO THEM","review":"Independent Cyber-Punk/Industrial Rock act THE S1ND1CATE named a song after the miner who lost his life in Harlan County.

People outside of this area don't realize that the miners and their families lived in coal camps that were managed by the mines or even about the stores where families could go to buy items with \\"mine money\\". What is not correct is the term \\"Bloody Harlan\\". Harlan County actually got that nickname during the civil war since half of the county is Union and the other is Yankee.I am from Harlan County and have read multiple books/ talked with people about its history.

None of the characters are either logically developed or consistent and, other than the main protagonist, the Lady Silence of the title, none are particularly likeable - certainly the Regency world would have been better off if the brother had been made the male lead, and the \`hero\` had been buried in Spain rather than returning to England to alternately abuse and bully the heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"A complete waste of time; tediously melodramatic.

It is amazing to me that this incredible talent has not been signed by a major label. What strikes me about this CD, and all of Eve's other work is the passion and the heart which are so evident in the music, and particularly in Eve's voice. You get the feeling that she is living every song. There are blistering roadhouse rock and roll songs that almost force your feet to get moving as well as ballads that will soothe you and tug at your heart. The range of Eve and her band is amazing as they pull both off and everything in between with wonderful results. This was the first of her CD's that I purchased, but after being hooked on the first listen, I have since purchased all of her studio work that I can find. Do yourself and everyone else a favor...give Eve a listen, tell your friends about her and support this great talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crowd Pleaser....and a Toe Tapper","review":"Long Road Home, Eve's follow up to Out On a Wire (see review) proves this lady is here to stay.

Some of my favorites are: Long Road Home, What I Mean To Say....my fave, Just 3 Words, The Lucky OnePlay this one with the volume up..and the top down, if you so desire....it will guarantee to get you toes tapping.When is a major label gonna sign this woman?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There; Done That","review":"You know how people say, \\"Stop me if you've heard this one before.\\"?

I should have listened to myself. This is a collection of really awful covers of Brian Eno songs. I can't express how disappointing this cd was. The cover of \\"3rd Uncle\\" was barely recognizable as the Eno song, which in itself isn't especially a bad thing, considering that Eno's music is about creativity and strangeness, but to completely rip it apart and sloppily throw it back together again as was done on this disc is just sad. The cover of \\"Somber Reptiles\\" is pretty bad too. Most of the other covers are just forgettable. Do yourself a favor and listen to the originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"As an Eno fan anything that comes up with his name on it, either as a composer/performer or as a \\"tributee\\" catches my attention.

While it is from a Baptist perspective, Hammett's ecclesiology is solid, informative and encouraging and should be read by more than just Baptists. It helped me piece together aspects of the Christian life such as communion, baptism and church leadership that are not talked about as much as the more popular theological topics such as predestination/free will, etc. It also briefly engages with issues concerning the emergent church as well as the differences between megachurches, house churches and every kind of church in between. This book might not be for everyone but it is a very helpful read if you are interested in these subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tool for church leaders","review":"I read this book as part of Hammett's theology class at Southeastern Seminary in 2008. I've found that now in my second pastorate I'm going back to the shelf for it -- not just for the occasional reference, but to train my people in how church works and how to respond to contemporary church models and movements. The subtitle is a clearer description of the contents. Hammett is thoughtful, fair, and even-handed but analyzes critically those contemporary church models such as emerging and multi-site churches against Biblical and traditional guidance. I wish he had included a chapter explaining how ecclesiology had developed throughout church history. Nonetheless, here is not just a good read on ecclesiology, but a tool that leaders can use to teach their congregations why we are what we are today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on the Church","review":"This is a great book.

The ultra cheap cables are standard, and offer standard data transfer rates. In my case, I needed the high speed (HDMI 1.3 compatible) cable, which all new hdtv's and blueray players utilize. These cables have 4-5 times more data throughput than the standard cable, which is required to take advantage of HDMI 1.3's new improved features, and therefore cost a bit more, but still much cheaper than the same type of cables you find in retail stores.Just be aware of what you're buying!....and check the specs on this cable...it's a 1.3 high bandwidth cable! Great deal.http://www.cablestogo.com/product.asp?cat%5Fid=3603&sku;=40315"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cable","review":"I bought the Velocity series of HDMI cable off of a recommendation from a friend who works in the Audio Visual field and I couldn't be happier with this purchase.

After reading over 100 positive reviews about Cables To Go I decided to go for it, especially with such a cheap price.As soon as I plugged in the cables, my HD viewing experience was enhanced! ESPN HD is amazing and it feels like I'm right there in the Sports Center Studio. I can't wait for football season.I highly recommend these cables for the viewer who is not crazy about finding the perfect HD picture, but still cares about quality and overall picture. They work great in my opinion.

The \\"Cables To Go\\" 40315 2 meter cable is thin and much lighter than the RCA cable. Initially I liked the 40315 cable as I have an articulating mount, and it moved more freely while positioning the TV than the RCA cable which tended to get hung up because it was thicker and heavier. Problem now with 40315 cable is that if I move the TV while the TV is on, the HDMI connection between the cable box and the TV gets cut off. Somewhere within the 40315 cable it shorts or disconnects.Leads me to think that this is a cheaply constructed cable. Being skinny like it is may mean it comes from cheap material, and if this company skimps on materials it may also skimp on insuring quality construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality cable cheap price","review":"This cable works fine and costs much less than in store equivalents.I used it to hook up my Up DVD to my Sony 1080 LCD tv."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, save some dough!","review":"My brother has very expensive HDMI Cables.

(Obviously, I hadn't changed anything.) Some technical discussion forums pointed to the HDMI cable as potential root cause.So I bought a more expensive cable (Belkin) and replaced the one between DVD player and receiver.

I eventually called the manufacturer to complain about the quality of their tv's (cuz who wants to spend over a grand for crap) and the customer service rep asked what type of cables I was using, HDMI cables duh. He said I may want to replace them to try and correct the problem. I bought a $30 cable from Walmart (Philips brand), low and behold, fixed. I have to buy another for the dvd player.

Then, just by switching cables from my DVD (Phoenix) my signal was fixed and worked perfectly for the last month.

To make sure I was getting all that my system had to offer, I purchased the Mediabridge HDMI cables (also from Amazon.com) that were clearly rated at the above standards. To be fair, I realy didn't notice much of a difference in image quality. However, for a few dollars more, the mediabridge cables appear to be more sturdy and of a higher build quality.

Cable worked perfectly. Image quality is noticeably better through the HDMI than using component video connections. As many other reviewers have stated, the signal being carried by HDMI cables is all digital, and thus not even remotely as susceptible to signal loss or interference over relatively short cable runs as analog signals can be. For this reason, you absolutely do not need the $100+ cables sold at the brick and mortar big-box stores.

No need for fancy gold plated ends and super fancy shielding to protect against signal loss. It's just Ones and Zeros. The signal is either their or it's not. Don't be fooled by those who have made a fortune off of the analog cable business. The rules that guide analog signals don't realy apply to digital.

It seems that at this point in his career, Waters needs to move on. His bad writing now seems contrived to imitate his early low-rent successes. You really can't go home again, but I believe with bigger budgets and presumably improved skills, Waters could still do wonderful, satiracle movies about Baltimore--and places like it. But \\"Pecker\\" seems to be the work of a lazy artist too willing to rest on his laurels. Too bad. There are some funny moments, but overall, the movie drags and sustains no momentum.

I did however, really appreciate the director's commentary available on the DVD, where he discussed the film locations and the stories behind the scenes.

There were pictures of nude girls on a few of the pages. Although it says it is for Teen on the back cover- Young kids are reading these books. My nephews, who are teens, think these books are for young kids. Most teens are not interested in reading them. Which shows that these books although labeled for teens have a young child audience.

Like one reviewer said, Staub takes a lot of stuff from both items out of context. If you want a more sound book I would recommend \\"The Gospel According to Star Wars\\" by John C. McDowell. It was one of the best books I have read concerning Star Wars and religion and was a major source form my thesis. His arguments are much more sound, and he presents it in a much better way.

If you're not a Christian, you'll see through it. If you are a Christian, you're better off just watching the movies and reading the books with an open heart.Maybe, someday, someone who knows and loves Star Wars AND knows and loves Christ will write a book. That day has not yet come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book should have just be named Christian Wisdom","review":"The name of the book is misleading. The author simply has a Star Wars quote at the beginning of each chapter, followed by a Bible quote. The author goes on to proclaim the Lord of the Force (aka GOD) is the reason for everything. So give in to the will of the Lord of the Force. There is very little in the way of Star Wars here. The author makes some remarks about how Luke and Jesus has similar paths. Then goes on to compare Luke, Han and Leia to Jesus and his disciples. This book just should have been calledChristian Wisdom : By the way I like Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible","review":"This is a self help book, not a book discussing Christian themes in the Star Wars movies.

Well, after 60 pages or so, I have got the feeling that the Staub is trying to wrap Jedi in Christian cloth and failing at that. The author speaks of the difficulty in leading a Christian life. But, I say that any religious life (be it Christian, Islam or otherwise) is hard because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional.I am convinced that Yoda is a Zen master; the Force is derived from Tao, not God as interpreted by the orthodox religion(I am purposefully leaving out Christian Mysticism, which is another beast altogether.).

This book is refreshing in its analysis and narrative,, and sometimes startles the reader with its razor- sharp insights. The Eastern Front during WW1 is often given second place, if any place at all, in histories of WW1. This book will cause any reader who has relied on \\"Dr Zhivago\\" and Marxist nonsense for an interpretation of the events in Eastern Europe between 1914 and 1917 to do a \\"volte face\\". Aside from content and style, the book is well worth reading just to receive instruction in thinking from Professor Stone. This is the kind of professor you wish you'd had for all of your university classes. I finished this book hoping that PRofessor Stone would apply his interests to many other areas of history, such as the American Civil War and WW2."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant and enjoyable.","review":"This book is not recommended for readers seeking a straightforward account of the battles of the eastern front. While stone does depict these events the narrative is typically concerned with several different minutae of both the russian army and its relation to society at large. Stone looks at various aspects of the campaign and makes persuasive arguments to debunk various notions and myths which surround general accounts. The analysis is brilliant and gives the reader indepth evocative information about the chosen facets he wishes to illumnate. And that is the whole point. If one is well read in this area it serves as a cornerstone in their already voluminous library on the era.

The stunning cinematography combines with a lovely, subtle tale with nicely crafted allusions to Spain's then-recent civil war and Fascist victory to form a (sadly obscure) masterpiece.Victor Erice's depictions of childhood are also spot-on.

The whole entire time that I watched it, I was creeped out and felt very eerie. I do think, however, that the movie did a wonderful job in portraying just how violent and horrific Franco's Spain was at the time of the Spanish Civil War and the effects that it had the Spaniards. This movie was full of symbolism and deep meanings that I knew were there, but couldn't quite understand, but that is probably because I'm only 16 years old and not able to comprehend some of lives' truths very deeply. Though the cinematography and acting was EXCELLENT, the movie as a whole left me feeling very unsettled and disturbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to the hype","review":"How many times have I seen this movie? And now that I own it and have watched it again, my opinion of it has come down considerably. Too long a preface to the main moment, the appearance of the wounded soldier.

It communicates the idea that punk was a fad that happened from 1975-1979 and then ended when the truth is that the punk culture is still alive and thriving today. Bands like the Dropkick Murphys, Dirty Water, Bouncing Souls, and many many lesser-known bands in your local scenes are still out there and performing the music, living the life, and keeping the scene alive in the original punk spirit.

It's so Pistols heavy it about topples off my coffee table. Not that I really have one. It's always great to see the Pistols, but how many pages do the Clash get? About 2.

Some of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like the Sex Pistols...","review":"As other reviews have asserted, this book is heavy on Sex Pistols and associated content from the British Punk scene. However, it completely ignores vast amounts of punk history by ignoring what was going on with Punk music in other parts of the world.Other than a few pages about the Ramones it largely ignores the growth and vitality of the American Punk scene. No Black Flag, no Minor Threat, no Dead Kennedys, no Bad Religion. Further it does not even address other hugely influential British bands like Conflict and Crass.My advice: save your money. If you want to understand punk look for more definitive and interesting records of punk likeThe Philosophy of Punk: More Than NoiseorHardcore California: A History of Punk and New Wave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Definitive","review":"There were some good things here. Great pictures and some interesting historical information I wasn't previously aware of. However, the amount of attention given to the Ramones/Sex Pistols is way over the top. I was expecting a comprehensive review of the life and times of Punk in the mid-late 70's. In the end what I got was a biography of 2 bands and Malcom McLaren with fairly brief (comparitavely) impersonal descriptions of other icons of the time. Additionally the collaborators of this book leave the reader the impression that there were only 2 places in the world (New York and London) that were producing anything worth writing about.Worth the buy?

It could have been so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitive Recycling of a Revolution more like...","review":"I thought this book looked great when I first got my hands on it but the more I looked at the less impressed I was. If you've read any of the more popular books about the early punk scene, ie. Please Kill Me, England's Dreaming , Vacant.. then you'll already have read most of the quotes in this book. There are some great pics in there which I hadn't seen before but so many of them have been published many times before. There are quite a few errors in the original text as well..(like calling The Clash's second album \\"Thanks for Giving Us Enough Rope\\"'!!!.. made me laugh!).

I'll keep it for those few new pics)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot","review":"I just finished reading this from my local library. As much as I love Mind over Matter and Robert Klein, this really isn't a funny book. Maybe he didn't intend it to be, but with a title like that I thought it would be a lot more entertaining instead of blandly anecdotal. It's really just one tale after another about women he slept with, in too much detail, or girls he fantasized about- again, too much information. And the book ends abruptly before covering any of his success in the 70's, his political comedy, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmoric ... and Soporific","review":"A coming of age story that emphasizes Klein's teenage and early adult sexual adventures and fantasies, without the depth or insight of Portnoy's Complaint.

Not to say that he wasn't funny when he tries, it's just that Klein rarely makes even the attempt at humor throughout this overly detailed book. The most interesting parts, not surprisingly, deal with the development of his talent and career, but that constitutes a relatively small portion of the book, the lion's share having to do with his sexual development. This book was a big disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major letdown","review":"Robert Klein is one of my favorite comedians and I had heard good things about this book.

OK, so maybe my expectations were that this would be a humorous look at Klein's life. This book is more of a chronological look at Klein's upbringing with some interesting observations about a boy in New York in the 1950s. But, who cares? Klein does not bring much to the party; this could have been so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still in love with Robert Klein","review":"Robert Klein and I are both children of the fifties and I have been a fan of his since he first began to gain recognition. I have seen him in person and on TV and , I don't know, he just makes me laugh. When I read the book I could just hear his voice and often sat there laughing out loud.

The book is vulgar and for the most part is all about Klein's sex life. Have you ever seen one of those Comedy Central videos that feature a really vulgar comic? When the camera pans to the audience showing people laughing their heads off at some disgusting joke, I am stunned that they find it funny. (I usually turn the video off at that point.) Maybe these are the people who enjoy reading a book like Klein's. It seems like everyone is writing a memoir these days.

So, I figured his memoir, \\"The Amorous Busboy of Decatur Avenue\\" would be: a) funny and 2) about sex, which it was. What I didn't expect was that many of Klein's reminiscences about coming of age in the 50's, his Animal Housean college years and his early days as an actor and comic to also be heartfeld and poignant. Although times have changed, people of all generations can relate to the intial angst and uncertainty of wading, diving or, in Klein's case, dipping a cautious toe into the turbulent sea of sexual relationships.

Lewis's classic Chronicles of Narnia will delight in the author who fascinated and influenced Lewis in his own writing. MacDonald never writes to condescend, and thus he entertains all who read.

Both of their mothers died while they were teens; both of them were sent away--Cath to her grandparent's house, Georgia to the sanitarium; both of them had troubled marriages.One thing I would suggest to everyone who reads this book is to pay attention to the diary entries. There is something eerie, in my view, with the way the weather is described. I don't know if it is really the weather, or if Georgia was commenting on something else.It is interesting to realize how misconceptions about what someone is saying and going through can drastically affect your life.

I thought the story started out slow and I wasn't sure where the story was going. The story surprisingly jumped back and forth from Georgia, the grandmother, to Cath, her granddaughter. I kept reading and was drawn into the personal lives of these two women. The book is an excellent read if you are savvy with emotions and introspective to life's complicated and mysterious circumstances. The details of Georgia's life are delicately sewn together throughout the entire book. The entwinement between the sanitarium and the bank account opened my heart and eyes to realize the weaving of my own present life. The book sends a message that love does prevail. The World Below read like a true story when learning about Cath's and Georgia's personal challenges and the decisions they were faced with. I look forward to reading more of Sue Miller's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great read","review":"This isn't a great read. The story feels static. Nothing much happens. The narrator (Cath) goes on and on about her life now, her two failed marriages, her children (who are not well-developed characters), and her desire to learn more about her grandmother. The grandmother's story, unfortunately, isn't any more interesting. I kept waiting for the climax, the epithany, something, anything, to break up the monotony of the narrative, but it never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"Sue Miller seems to have written this when she was preoccupied with something else. Her imagination isn't put to work here, and the book is not up to her best writing. The novel isn't terrible, but it seems to be a half-hearted or failed effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing hystorical fiction","review":"This story was deep. Catherine goes on a journey through her grandmother's diaries, getting a picture of life in New England in 1910 and how it helps her perceive her own life in the present day. It was nice that she doesn't tie up the direction of the story, but rather leaves it to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah's Book Club, here I come","review":"This book was an awful introspective of a woman looking for her past and her future and her grandmother's past - all at the same time. It was one of those generation jumping books that can never pick a time or place. Don't read it, trust me, it's just not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ONE OF MILLER'S BEST!","review":"I usually enjoy Sue Miller's books, but not this one. Why? The plot was weak, lacked originality and the story itself was rather drawn out. It expressed lots of feelings and words, but at the same time, the story lacked action. We have read similar scenarios before where a family member dies, a divorce takes place causing one to return to their painful roots of childhood, and on, and on, and on. This book was no exception, it followed that same path and the author spent more time dwelling about the heartaches, pains and trauma of her past rather than focusing on any upbeat, positive drama. Many readers will probably say they enjoyed the book, but for me, it was just too much of the same old song and dance we read about so often these days; it lacked creativity and originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magellan= false advertising=spend more $$$","review":"Was the BIGGEST waste of money was told the GPS Gold (219.99)had topo built-in.

It would sometimes not recognize the data CD in my DVD/CDR drive. I found that rebooting the computer would fix the problem most of the time. I kept using the software because it is very good and very easy to use. However, a couple of days ago, the software refused to run at all - not even the splash screen. Magellan support was no help.

But is that really a solution? It's more like a kludge. The software has issues and Magellan doesn't want to admit it.The Magellan web site hints that version 2.0 of DirectRoute won't run on all DVD drives, but they don't provide a solution.I asked if they would upgrade me to version 3.0 and they said no.This software was essentially a waste of money for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product!

You keep this goofy review but delete mine?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishful Thinking","review":"This book is nothing more than speculation and an author reading his own fantasies into what he would like to see Jesus representing. There is not a bit of conclusive evidence throughout this book that substantiates his claims.Also I noticed that there were several other reviews of this book that were very critical of it. It seems they were deleted. How convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled me once!","review":"In the early 70's I read this book to support my atheism. I considered myself an existential atheist and this book gave me a way to deny the resurrection which then eliminates Christianity completely. If Jesus did not rise from the dead then nothing he said is worth remembering. And He certainly would not be worth following. So this book was my support for my unbelief. I considered it well written and very convincing. Then in 1976 I became a follower of Jesus. I read the Bible. One only needs one read through the Gospels to realize how completely implausible this book is. Read any article written about crucifixion and the 'swoon theory' becomes laughable. So if you are not a Christian this is a good, well written novel - enjoy it. But if you want to truly investigate the claims of Jesus you will quickly see that the book is a work of fiction and the life of Jesus is the Truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old story","review":"The author dismisses the importance of Mary Magdalena in the life of Jesus, and the religious movement that later becomes Christianity; it is the same old story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Passover Plot--40th Anniversary","review":"I wanted to read this as an after read of McCray's Betrayed series.

It's very gay, but that doesn't bother me at all, because underneath it all is sheer, barebones humanity. It takes place immediately after the riots in Los Angeles in the early 90s, which I remember although I was young. The relationship between Tim and Pete is so honest and yet not, so complete and yet not, and their sexual communion is both painful and loving to read. I never thought I'd say this about a book, but this book by a dead writer (I believe he died of AIDs) is the best book I have ever read.

He beat the thing down and kept going. Really cool to see this stuff rather than just hear it. And, Lee Morgan is the most under-rated, under-appreciated jazz trumpeter. He is absolutely incredible.

I'm giving it one more month, but if I get another batch that appears to have sent to me via 1923 then I'm off to the nearest Target to beg with the Food Department Manager to increase their selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try many, pick favorite","review":"Not every flavor variety is for everyone.

I envied Reed--the way beauty seemed to gravitate toward him (male and female). Beyond my envy, I appreciated the way Reed was able to capture on film the gentle beauty of his subjects. These are honest, clear portraits without pretense: sexy, strong, youthful--but nonetheless unassuming and approachable. Reed's talent for photography is as natural as the men he photographs"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOTES FOR THE COLLECTOR OF MALE EROTICA","review":"Beautiful photobook by Reed Massengill. Black and white photos lovingly created by a great artist. Massengill writes in his notes for the book that he is not a \\"professional\\" photographer, and that may be why this photobook is so refreshingly original and magnificent. Massengill concentrates on displaying the beauty of the male form, every line and curve, with attention to detail and devoted respect for his models.

Now the BADDEST thing in it is The Black Beauty. Man, is that one HELL of a vehicle. ......FAST!!! None of that speed up the camera stuff thats in earlier serials. Thoses sharp, SHARP turns I wish I can do.Never mind it did,nt all those rockets and scaners or even a phone in it. It was all so very cool. Hey, what do you expect for the 1940 ,s ???? I also was surprised to see Kato use a Karate chop now and then in this one. Way before Bruce Lee was ever concieved. Very good .

In the two serials included in this set, Britt Reid/The Green Hornet takes out one criminal syndicate after another. Very good representation of serials of this era. Lots of action, fights, explosions, near misses, gun play, but not in the graphic style portrayed today. Quality DVD presentation. Our family loves old classic tv and movies and this one did not disappoint. If you are not familiar with serials of the B & W era, you should be aware that there are some repetitive car scenes, but you have to remember when these came out people went to see them at the theater a week apart-not one right after the other as we now can with a DVD.

I agree there are a few editorial errors, and some just barely out of date information, but 95%% of this book is valuable information, with out of the way dining options, that would seldom be found on the internet, and small shops who also do not find their way to the internet or printed guidebooks.

You CANNOT learn it from a book. The technique involves communication of a kinesthetic sense from the teacher to the student through hands-on learning. With that said, this book is a valuable resource to a serious student who already has, or would like to find a teacher. The sections on body-mapping are particularly useful, and can be applied even if one is not studying the Alexander technique.Body mapping is a practice predicated on the concept that we have concepts of our bodies, body maps, that do not accurately reflect our anatomy. Consequently, when we try to move, we often try to move in ways that we are not constructed to move. By changing our maps of our bodies to accurately reflect our anatomy, we can move and exist in the world with much greater efficiency and ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does more than just point you to a teacher","review":"This is the first book I ordered regarding the alexander technique and I have found it to be very useful. I am generally put off by books that only scratch the surface and give you only enough to make you want to contact a teacher - which seems to be the hidden agenda by all of these books published by alexander teachers - but this book does more. Some of the content is a bit fluffy, but a great deal is very useful and can give you the opportunity to get a start on your own. With a simple change to how to carry your head as described in the book - I have already seen a significant reduction in my back pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"It was unclear that this item was an early, non-professional copy of the book, and that its binding was actually just about to fall apart.

Some of the biggest names on the European underground trance and rave scene make their mark here. Artists like Claustrophobia (Claus Larson; yeah!) and Synergy are quite generous in dishing out the beat: everything's terrifically trance. Ranging from ambient laced house beat to almost caotic trance riffs, all three albums are made to please. As one of the better explorations into rave music I've heard, \\"This is Rave\\" is highly recommended. This is definitely a set for anyone interested in taking a trip through rave culture and music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Rave","review":"I foolishly assumed that this set would be filled with the type of things that you would actually find at a rave but I was wrong.

For swing fans, it's a \\"must see.\\"Tony Horowitz[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish it was in color","review":"Interesting picture based on the life of Gene Krupa. Sal Mineo is the lead and he's got the timing down, his drumming matches the sound track. It's the only other show I've seen Susan Kohner in besides Imitation of Life. James Darren gets to play a more mature young man as Gene's best friend Eddie Sirota than he plays as Moondoggie. Susan Oliver is good as the bad girl who leads Gene astray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sal's Face and O'Day's Singing Best Features of this Flick","review":"Hackneyed, boring, predictable. I'm a bit surprised by the positive reviews of this lame flick. Sal's acting rings false, but the guy sure had charisma and looks. Particulary his well-shaped mouth. I actually found his \\"drumming\\" far more convincing than his singing, though he moves so quickly, who can say whether he's hitting the snare or the cymbal at the same moment you're hearing those sounds? Anita O'day's too-brief moment in this film was a tragic lapse of judgement on the part of all involved with the making of this movie. She is the most authentic thing going for this film. Why they kept her in the background in her only scene is a mystery--the woman emanates jazz and her own unique brand of sex appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable rockhopper penguin toy!!","review":"My son ABSOLUTELY loves this penguin toy!

Can't imagine anyone but us remembers this movie unless they had the same funny memory that keeps getting a laugh every few years.It came used and was VERY affordable, so I was able to pre-view it. While the DVD was excellent in condition, the video quality is poor, and the story is extremely slow. More documentary than anything, and not terribly engaging.

The folks out there are rather proud of their legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better half a Legend than no Legend at all.....","review":"I'll avoid covering the merits of this classic as they are featured elsewhere on this page.

And the photo on the cover of the DVD was the one I cut out of the newspaper and placed on our kitchen wall for months. The movie freaked me out as a kid and each time I see Boggy Creek on a Florida map it reminds of that movie - it also made me wonder if anyone else remembered that movie. I guess they did"},{"rating":"1","title":"boggy creek - snoozefest","review":"Don't know where all these good ratings and reviews are coming from but I've been duped! Boggy Creek is a very boring and nearly unwatchable movie from the 1970's that does nothing to build the suspense, mood or atmosphere that would be related to the mystery of Bigfoot sightings. The whole film is made even worse by the happy sounding bluegrass, hillbilly music and a \\"Wild America\\" style narrator, who sounds like he's announcing the arrival of a healthy litter of playful wolf pups rather than presenting something ominous. The one or two actual good scenes of a lurking Bigfoot are ruined by the music. Had to fast forward though most of the movie, it will never enter my DVD player again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"QUESTION??","review":"IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, DIDN'T THIS MOVIE HAVE A MOTHER BEAST SEARCHING FOR HER BABY THAT HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED AND CAGED BY THE LOCALS???

On the \\"Bass in the Planet Mix\\" we are given a treat from someone who is truly a standout in their field, Magic Mike. The other tracks are dry and out of touch with the traditional Planet Rock feel we are used to. I believe that Magic Mike almost takes the song to another level. 808 probably doesn't have any business touching this song nor do any of the other artists who serve up their humble offerings here. Of course, we are given the original version on the first track but outside of that the only other reason to buy this disc is Magic Mike's cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop!

Dick was a genius. He wrote 6-8 masterpieces, which should be required reading for anyone with some interest in science fiction.However, he also wrote some plain awful novels in order to make a living. In general, the books he wrote in the 1950s are his worst with Vulcan's Hammer being his worst published novel ever (in my opinion). The story is flimsy and dull...one of Dick's biographers (Lawrence Sutin) also cites it as probably being his worst book.I'm only writing this review because I just can't believe the number of positive reviews for this book. If \\"Man in the High Castle\\", which is probably Dick's best work, deserves 5 stars... then by that scale, Vulcan's hammer deserves a 0.5.The fact that this book was even reprinted is a shame...a real waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"These applicators are great!!! I love them b/c you not only avoid spraying tire dressing on your car- it also keeps your hands clean! I highly recommend these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's better on the market","review":"I do not like the design of these particular brand tire swipes. The reason being is, you may be fine with the curve in the applicator if you have smaller tires. However, if your vehicle has larger tires, these swipes are more of a burden than a helpful resource. It slowed me down considerably as I found they required more pressure to distribute the gel evenly across the surface of the tire. Another drawback to this also means due to the pressure required and \\"drag\\" across the tire that these \\"break down\\" much quicker than others i've used. I own my own automotive detailing business and while the concept of the swipe as a product is excellent, I would lean more towards a uniformed surface foam applicator as they save time and have better overall distribution of the tire gel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I found this book a waste of time.

The writer also allows the reader to see into the pain of the soul and how one can go so far the wrong way and how real love can bring the person out of their pain. This story is also very interesting and exciting as it shares about a love romance between the writer and Jimi Hendrix. This book is filled with romance, adventure, from pain and suffering to healing and joy.

The problem is not that I don't know how to read a pattern. The problem is that at least 3 of her patterns are wrong.

In addition to the lack of \\"hip\\" ness, almost all the pattern examples are done in browns, tans, and orange colors making them even more unappealing and looking like something from the 70s.

The story is multi-layered, complex, and absolutely fascinating. While we've all seen the premise before - cops and robbers, The Wire moves well beyond any stereotypes to show us the human beings who play these roles. Particularly interesting in this season is in-depth look we get into the modern labor movement. Sound dull? - far from it. One of the central charaters is Sobotka, a labor leader, who comes to represent the tragedy of the modern working man in America- the loss of the dignity we once had from doing hard, honest work. A warning - this series requires patience to really appreciate the complex story told. Take the time, it is worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"How is it possible?","review":"Season 1 of The Wire was a stunning bit of non-tv. Intricate storytelling, fine acting, great dialogue. Putting that final 13th episode down I was sure that I had just finished watching an unsurpasable achievement; an honesty in storytelling that is often reserved for the hardest hitting documentaries. And then I opened up the green case of Season 2. The first episode went by, and I must admit I was ever-so-slightly disappointed. \\"Nutty\\" was demoted, heck, everyone was demoted or stepped on in some fashion. My beloved Barksdales had been smashed apart. And then episode 2, 3, 4, 5 hits and wow! The docks provide a whole new array of characters, both likable and detestable. The storyline starts to really weave, the mosaic starts to take shape, and the second season roles by and one ups the first in its complexity and careful integration of the first season.

They are truly the best American TV I've ever seen. These are brutally honest depictions of the issues that confront all urban Americans in the 21st century. The characters are portrayed as flawed, complex, and vulnerable human beings, whether they are the \\"good guys\\" or the \\"bad guys\\".I was a criminal prosecutor in one of the largest DA offices in the nation, and this series is right on the money when it comes to depicting the layers of politics, self-interest, waste, and incompetence that make up our criminal justice system.I cannot recommend this series strongly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"The show is phenomenal!

Everyone always talks about how realistic and multifaceted The Wire is, and this season adds a very interesting dimension in looking at the dying stevedore union. The guys in the stevedore union are all great characters: they get drunk before and after work and consistently steal cargo, yet you can't help but feel some sympathy for them, as the economic decline of Baltimore and its port casts a very dark shadow over their way of life.The guys from Avon Barksdale's crew are back as well, but the real highlight repeat appearance from season one is Omar, the drug-dealer robber.

I don't expect much out of canned food, but at least a spicy Millennium old Mexican soup could have more than a monotone, bland flavor and the texture of beans and franks, with unrecognizable hunks of pork and what was once hominy corn. Just figure out how to make it and cook it yourself, unless you're just a Pozole addict and far from home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I buy both this and the chicken variety at a local super discount grocery on a regular basis.

It started bugging me so much I underlined every single one and sure enough, almost every page had one grammatical error.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Suspense!","review":"Monsoon Mystic was very enjoyable, entertaining and easy reading!It truly captured the mysticism that the West feels about India and made the plot that much more full of suspense and adventure.

Bought these with hopes of repeating cure. No luck, zero effect, two bottles later. Walmart resumed selling tablets a few weeks ago. Things not 100% cured, but moving in the right direction.

Now, it's every once in awhile (maybe once a week). We would like to get them on a better diet (I was told to feed them a higher quality food w/meat as the first ingredient) and feed them separately so there is no competition and inhaling their food.

I watched it by myself at first and cried the entire time. Then I shared it with the children at our church during a youth shut in and parents and children alike cried the entire time. I was amazed at how the children were so into the movie and how so many wanted to purchase a copy so they could have it at home. It made them first appreciate the fact that they were born healthy and second that it's okay to be different and that being a Christian is really cool. Two thumbs up to the creator of Johnny. The movie touches old and young alike. I dare not say what the ending is because I want others to purchase the movie and experience the Amazing \\"JOHNNY\\" for themselves.

After 3 weeks I still hadn't recieved my product. After calling APC they informed me that the shipper never sent the product and I would have to wait another 10 days to get my product. Their customer service was terrible and provided no help to me. I cancelled the order and found the same exact product on Amazon for less money and I didn't even have to return the old unit. I received my product from Amazon in 2 days with free shipping and less cost then buying direct from APC.

I found the beeping when the UPS is providing power to be annoying, but you need to install the Windows control software in order to turn it off - the supplied MacOS software doesn't allow you to do that. I really like the USB interface provided to the computer, and I found that MacOS already has built-in support for UPSes that works with the BR900, so there's really reason to install the supplied MacOS software at all. In a desktop Mac, MacOS treats the UPS just like the built-in battery in a Powerbook laptop, which makes sense. The only other thing I don't like is the power supply in my iMac buzzes when the UPS is operational. It must be generating AC with square waves rather than sine waves, which is what you get from the power company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frequent Power Outages Are No Longer A Problem","review":"The APC BR900 is a superb solution for critical computers that are in an area that experiences frequent power outages, such as ours.

If and when it comes time to replace the batteries, the access plate is easy to operate, anyone will be able to do it with ease.

I was hoping to combine the fun of a mystery with the interesting facts of the art trade. I found none. The story is extremely boring, badly written, and there is more supspense in opening a jar of jam than in this entire book. The characters are predictable, the action slow. Was this book published without an editor ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Good God - I hated this book. I pride myself on always completing a novel, regardless of my level of enjoyment, but at three quarters of the way through I had to put this book down. It was so boring and dull. If you have insomnia then this book is for you because you'll choose sleep over continuing to read. Whereas Dan Brown's, DaVinci Code is fast paced, glossy and easy to follow along, this book is rough hewn, painfully unexciting and almost impossible to follow. The clues between the connections in the artwork and the mystery trail are so obtuse that they are not worth one's time in trying to unravel. Overall a very unsatisfying read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great read after 10 years! Want it for Kindle.","review":"I bought Landscape of Lies more than ten years ago and still pull it out to read or to lend to friends. You have to be a bit interested in research and church history to find that side of the story exciting. If you are more used to action stories, then this type of book would seem slow. But I found the whole concept brilliant! I was intrigued to follow the search for the treasure and learned a great many things. The fact that you needed to view the painting as a map, and that it should be followed backwards, was a great surprise to me. It is just one of those books which stay in your mind, like Katherine Neville's The Eight, also a book with some history and searching for treasure. Try it. You might be surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vegas series","review":"I chose to read the Vegas series by Fern Michaels by mere coincidence.

At age 6, she had to wear a bun for her first dance recital, and I had to find a way to keep down all her \\"wispies\\" (the short, thin, loose strands of hair that aren't long enough to be pulled back into the bun and end up falling all around the face). This product works beautifully! It dispenses kind of like a glue stick, and I apply the thinnest possible amount very lightly, directly to my daughter's hair. Then I use a fine comb and my hand to spread the product, comb the wispies back, and flatten them down. Voila! Perfect results.This product works way better than hairspray, which, in my experience, besides never having a strong enough hold, has the added disadvantage of leaving hair uncomfortably stiff."},{"rating":"2","title":"K.

There are at least two books that might have prompted it: one is essentially a copy of the source code ('Apache Server Commentary'), and the other is a copy of the documentation on the Web site (I have a copy, but can't remember the title). I can assure you that 'Apache Server Unleashed' is neither of these; it contains hundreds of pages of technical custom-written text that appear nowhere else.

To drag in the super-natural, as the author did, made a good story but was unnesessary. The times and the charactrs ALONE were magicalenough. But please - don't get me wrong - the story stands by itself.

My unit was on the other side of the line than the SAS (behind enemy lines), and I expected to read about scud hunting, special ops mayhem, and outwitting the Iraqi military. Instead, the few pages of patrolling and fire-fights don't make up for the excrutiatingly slow story after the guys are caught.

Not only was Mr Phillips not to blame, but he is also not in a position to defend himself, having died during said mission.A book that garnered far more success than it deserved, this is another example of undeserved success. Stephen X should be ashamed of himself for putting out this heap of lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what it seems","review":"It's not that it's badly written, it's that it seems to promise the glamour of explosions and such.Let me summarize this book:SAS men prepare, fly into Iraq, hunker down, get spotted, run around, shoot some people, get caught, get the snot beat out of them, go home.It's not their fault, and I'm not speaking about their personal performance in the real world, but there's no part of their mission they accomplished.

The author who actually was there and experienced all what occured, or a man who knows nothing about it, but got his information second hand? I know who I believe. Do you really think that this mission would go down in 'regimental history' and part of 'SAS legend' if it was all embelished. I think not. Let's not forget that all of McNab's books are screened by the Ministry Of Defence due to the content of his books. Do you think that they would allow him to include information in a true story that was untrue?The book is a gripping and breathtaking 'true' story of super human strength and endurance! Read it! I would also recommend reading Immediate Action for a greater insight into the Author. After doing so you might realise that he doesn't seem like a man who would stretch the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of guts","review":"Some people have criticized this book as fiction, and claim that McNabb made this story up or exaggerated or what ever. I guess you'll have to be the judge.This is the story of a 8 man squad dropped behind enemy lines in the first Gulf War that were part of the great SCUD hunt. Things did not go well for these guys. Of the eight, 3 were killed, 4 captured and 1 made it to freedom.This is a pretty intense story, and from what we now know of Saddam's Murder Inc. inside Iraq and the continued blood thirsty killers still on the loose, there is a loud dollop of truth coming out of this book.To say I enjoyed the story is misleading. These soldiers went through the ringer. I don't get the Rambo comparison here.

There were no firefights, they did not leave a trail of 250 dead Iraqi's (indeed they were chased away by 3 old men with a 50 year old rifle) They killed no-one. The shepherd boy states that he never saw the men and therefore could not have compromised their position.Accept this book as the pure fiction that it is and it is an entertaining yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant story that has me on guard here in afghanistan","review":"I read this book about 9 months ago before I went on deployment.

Absolutely a recommended read for anyone interested in military or what the military has to go through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money elsewhere!","review":"I enjoyed it until i read the reviews and heard people saying thay McNab lied about half the story. How people can call their operation a succes lacks basic intelligence. 7 People either dead or captured is not a succses. They failed to complete all of their objectives which is a complete disaster. The fact that these are suposedly the premier elite unit of the world yet they were compromised by a young boy and then chased by three old men which McNab then lied about and said they killed 250 Iraqis and blew up some APCs. Also some people were saying in the reviews that people were guillible is a stupid thing to say because they had no way of knowing if the story was true or not. Id suggest buying \\" The Real Bravo Two Zero\\" first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story about the SAS in the gulf war...Too bad its fake.","review":"Yes your heard me. I havn't read this book, but I *have* read \\"Eye of the Storm\\" by Peter Ratcliffe. Peter says that in this book, alot of the stuff is made up. For example, according to McNab if the dogs approached the patrol, he and his men would use their \\"fighting knives\\" to kill the creature.As Ratcliffe writes, he says that no man in his right mind would attack the dogs anywhere in the middle east because they are probably rabid, and the chances of anyone killing a dog with a knife is very slight indeed.That and the fact the only knives the SAS carry on them are \\"clasp knives\\" which is apparantly the same as a swiss army knife.You can read it, but don't take it seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have any interest in Special Operations read this","review":"As a former US Special Forces soldier, I read this book realizing that special operation isn't much different the world over. Given almost impossible missions, over-loaded with gear a pack mule couldn't carry, and dumped behind enemy lines with only a vague plan for exfiltration. An American team from 5th Special Forces Group ran into the same situation as McNab's team and barely escaped with their lives. A couple of books I would recommend for entertainment, even though they're fiction, are Bob Mayer's series on special forces. He's a former green beret also and his stories are very close to the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story of Tremendous Courage!!","review":"All I can say is once I started reading the book I could not put it down. Bravo Two Zero is assigned to go behind Iraqi lines and destroy the Scuds of Saddam. Unfortunately they are dropped in an area heavily populated by civilians and military units. The ordeal that they endure is a tribute to human endurance and courage. I admired McNab for his decision making in situations you cannot even fathom. I also liked the writing style McNab used as it is very \\"matter of fact\\". You will also learn a lot about the culture of the SAS units which was also very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read all year","review":"Andy McNab is a born storyteller and he has a great, real-life story to tell of his experiences as an SAS officer dropped into Iraq and subsequently captured after a chase across the desert. Read his other book \\"Immediate Action\\" next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a pass on this book","review":"This book is interesting, but not for the firefights, for the insight into what it takes to survive behind enemy lines.To me \\"Black Hawk Down\\" and \\"Band of Brothers\\" were a hundred times better.As it turns out, much of the book is plain bull----. For books telling stories of soldiers behind enemy lines, some of the SEALs and LRRPs book are much better.These are my opinions as a former infantry grunt"},{"rating":"1","title":"mainly good fiction!","review":"Yes, a lot of the book is based on fact but Mc Nab makes himself out to be a rambo for the sake of a good read! 250 iraqis killed, eh? Neat fiction.I'm amazed so many people are gullible enough to believe the guy. Read, 'The real bravo two zero' for an unbiased, accurate account of the mission if you're interested. Personaly,I think the author does his former regiment a massive disservice, and sullies the name of those who died, in order to make himself into some kind of 'hero.'Funny how the 'heroics' in his book aren't included in his offical debrief. The man is a joke among the SAS.How can the guy get away with it!? Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the best......","review":"......war story I've ever read. Ranks right up there with \\"From Here to Eternity\\", \\"Devils in Baggy Pants\\", and a few of the others on the \\"Best\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and Riveting!","review":"Andy McNab's book shows that man's inhumanity toward man continues unchecked. The ill treatment that he and his colleges were shown by the Iraqis proves once again that man is cruel. As a combat veteran of the Vietnam War, I usually don't read books about either of the Iraqi wars, but found this book to be an exception worth making. The author gives the reader plenty of taut action supported by detailed technical information. The reader also comes away with an appreciation of British military slang!"},{"rating":"2","title":"page turner","review":"page turner, do not know what is going to happen next. starts slow, but picks up as soon as he enters iraq."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Stuff","review":"This book was given to me as a birthday present and it was certainly a very sobering read. A mission behind enemy lines goes pear shaped from the get go and our highly specialised SAS team is straight into a fight for their lives.The bulk of the book is around the capture and subsequent torture over a long period and you have to wonder just how much the human body can endure. Andy witnesses and experiences incredible brutality at the hands of his captors and loses close friends.If you want to read something that is a small snapshot of a greater scenario, still true to life but not bogged down in any politics of the situation, then give this a go. But I hope you have a strong stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Of The Black, And Into The Light","review":"Here is a small pinhloe into the secret operations of the SAS, well done by Mr. McNab. The book is absolutely spellbinding, and puts you there in the drivers seat of raids done behind enemy lines. For soldiers in the know like myself, the incredible rigors of our realistic training come to light in the desparate mission to escape--and THEN survive. This is very important for those who have never been in the military should know. As an ex-member of the Long Range Recon Patrol, I tip my hat to all the SAS, and SBS people I've been lucky to come in contact with. It's about time a modern war story like this was revealed to the public, and told well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannibal returns","review":"Anthony Hopkins' character of Ted Crawford in this film is reminiscent of his Hannibal Lecter character in previous films where he plays a devious individual who believes that he can get away with the murder of his unfaithful wife. Ryan Gosling does a good job portraying his opposite in this film, state attorney Willy Beachum who accepts the assignment believing that it is a slam dunk with a confession that later gets thrown out in court. Crawford could have accepted his good fortune and departed, but he continues to taunt Beachum and this leads to the ending of the film, which I will not reveal here. The movie moves along well and was entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good mystery","review":"If you like Anthony Hopkins & like to solve mysteries, then this is for you. The pace wasn't always as fast as i generally like, but once into the story line, it was intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong movie, engaging and well-written thriller, one of the year's best","review":"A taut and well constructed thriller with great scenes of one-ups-manship between gosling and hopkins. The competing sub-plots of one man's rise vs. another's fall maintains the dramatic tension. The romantic aside also hits the right points as it doesn't attempt to dominate the main tension of legal and office political manuevers. Good supporting performances, well edited and driven, and one of the year's most solid films."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had a Fractured screenplay....","review":"This was among the worst movies in a long time. Sir Anthony acts like he is playing Hannabel Light in his character, the actor playing the lawyer is way over the top and comes out as phooney, and the story gets mired in \\"they can't find the gun\\", which drags on too long. The ending where the case is solved comes out as a huge rewrite they did in the story at the last moment. It runs too long and ultimately there is really no one to like in this movie, it runs more like an infomerical then a film, making New Line one of the worst movie companies today, making the most defective films around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Paint Drying","review":"Sir Anthony Hopkins is brilliant. Ryan Gosling is gorgeous and believable. I love both of these actors, but...\\"Fracture\\" didn't work, but went on and on and on...like paint drying, like something that could have been said and done and over with in 1/2 an hour.After a while, one just doesn't care. After 1 Hour, I was ready to scream, \\"So what!\\" And after that... well the characters, content, dialouge, everything---was like something you just wanted to END.The problem was...these actors were much bigger than the movie, but in closing, they couldn't even make it worthwhile or less painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"glue on surface","review":"it had glue or some adhesive on itit jammed in my playeri had to take to a shop to get it extracted $$$ more than i paid for the product from GOHASTINGS...FRACTURE WITH ANTHONY HOPKINSWILL BE LEERY OF THAT DEALER WHEN BUYING A USED DVD DISC IN FUTURE..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lawyers: don't watch this movie.","review":"If you are a lawyer, please don't watch this movie, it'll drive you nuts a la \\"The Devil's Advocate\\"1. Ryan Gosling is playing a phenomenally talented D.A. Who takes a job at a big law firm (only Hollywood thinks those Biglaw firm jobs are hard to get and desirable to working anywhere else in law; please), and who then on day one sleeps with a Partner. Okaaaay. Oh, and apparently those lawyers never work, they just go to fancy parties. Riiiiight.2. He's such a fantastic D.A., but he can't win a murder case without the murder weapon? Really?? It's an airtight case with or without the weapon and confession. And (without spoiling the ending) he has to look up a law that every lawyer, not to mention every viewer of legal thrillers, is 100% aware of?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Engaging, Thoughtful Movie","review":"This movie has 2 things going for it: Excellent performances from Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling and some truly fine writing--the plotting is tense and exciting and the dialog is crisp and intelligent.This one's a keeper. You'll want to watch it again as soon as you've forgotten the main plot twists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie!","review":"My mom recommended watching this. We enjoyed it....great actors and the ending was pretty Awesome. If you're thinking of watching it...it's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I'm writing this after just watching this movie twice. It is difficult to figure out parts of it the first time around. I like for things to be subtle, but I think the director needed a little bit heavier hand in some spots. (I don't want to spoil it, so I won't go into this).I rarely, rarely see a film I would recommend and I liked this one. It's intelligent in its content and really, really well filmed and well directed. I was afraid it would be too gruesome and I was reluctant to watch it, but it's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done, go Ryan & Anthony!","review":"Hopkins & Gosling were great. This movie was an unexpected delight. It's about time a real thriller like this came out. I loved what they did with the wife's lover. And I liked the ending. I didn't find it predictable. Very good movie, and good acting. If you watch with an open mind, you will really enjoy the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Nap of my LIFE","review":"Okay how to start this review....I watched this because I like Anthony Hopkins. He to me is a good on edge actor. Any who.... I started watching this and fell asleep within 20 minutes of the movie. This movie is god awful boring. I am so happy I did NOT pay $8 to see this theaters and went to see Blades of Glory. (Which I also fell asleep during) lol. I really think from what I have see of Fracture. Watched once Fell asleep during the start. Than I picked it up in the middle. I think this movie just sucked."},{"rating":"2","title":"This psychological thriller held our attention -here's why","review":"First of all, the movie starts off with a murder and you know who the murderer is. So it isn't a suspense story as much as a psychological thriller, the type that pits two very strong personalities against one another (played by Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling).Each is a control freak and each is ambitious. The whole thrill of this movie is watching the characters, seeing how they develop and change and wondering how this will all play out.Looking at the reviews that others have written for this movie, it is clear that people tended to love or hate this movie -and I think I understand why. For one thing, you KNOW what happened -and why -almost from the start. But I happen to like character-driven movies and this one is definitely in that vein. Yes, Hopkins does seem to recreate his Hannibel Lechter personalty (or hints of it) but that worked out fine in this instance."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],O={key:0},W={key:1};function B(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(x,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-c58b89a9"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/67.md","filePath":"glossary/67.md"}'),P={name:"glossary/67.md"},L=Object.assign(P,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{R as __pageData,L as default};
