From the first song, (The Blood and Tears), he has you enthralled with his imaculate handling of his guitar. A must have for all guitar finatics, whether it be metal or classical.

His tribute to Frank Zappa is favorable, yet his now infamous #7 track (You know, the one that is supposed to be his most passionate and beautifully played?) reflected a talented man going through the motions. Sorry Steve, this album is full of licks I've heard from you many times before. Oh, by the way, you need to ditch the vocals. Jeff Beck can't sing either, but at least he was smart enough to \\"shut up and play his guitar\\". You have the talent to become the greatest guitarist ever, now get to work and take your music forward. If someone wants to hear quality Steve Vai, they should try Passion and Warfare, the first half and last song on the second half of Fire Garden, and Alien Love Secrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baffling...with few gems.","review":"First, I'm a big fan of Steve's music. But this recording makes very little sense. The first five songs range from good to great. Then the last eight songs range from bad to confusing to dreadful. I can't understand how such a fantastic musician, with such great feeling, and depth of emotion can create such a mess. He has the skills!! I have most of Steve's recordings, and this stands out as a near disaster. Mostly disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Disguise Lack of Ideas Behind Technical Wizardry","review":"The opener \\"Blood & Tears\\" is a moving, brilliant piece of music altering between delicate Indian vocals and Steve's masterful chops and - extraordinary enough - restrained play. \\"I'll Be Around\\" catches some of the atmosphere of \\"Sex&Religion\\" album. It has a pleasant tune but would be performed better by a guy like Devin Townsend on vocals instead of Steve. The rest of the tracks is stuffed with futile gimmicks making it a boasting demontration in musical craftmanship ending in itself. Vai becomes a slave of his own musical talent. Playing at least a dozen different chords in two seconds is no proof for making good rock music. Sorry, Stevie, try again once more. I know you can do MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Vai I remember - more electronic beeps than electric guitar","review":"I loved Vai's work twenty years ago, so I decided to pick up a newer album of his to see how it was. Vai had a way of making a guitar really sing in some melody but he could also rip out the metal type jams when he had to. This album seems not like any guitar album I have heard. It is a strange, ambient and oriental type of sound that again, does not sound like a guitar, or Vai himself was even around. Maybe it is just an experimental kind of album, but goodness what happened to some structure? This is not even noodling, some of this is like someone left the answering machine on and then let their five-year-old pound on multiple levels of xylophones with sticks. Some may think this is a masterpiece but my opinion is that it is an experimental album that tries to hard to come up with innovative sounds. In the meantime, where is the guitar?"},{"rating":"1","title":"zappa clone","review":"I loved Passion & Warfare, it didn't leave my CD player for months!

Este hombre ya no tiene ideas. Las mismas escalas, los mismos arpegios, los mismos efectos. En definitiva, mas de lo mismo. Atras quedaron los tiempos del Passion and Warfare, una pena. Ya no aporta nada, que hay del fresco Steve Vai, de sus tiempos con David Lee Roth. Demasiado mayor supongo. La voz es horrible ?por que demonios canta el? ?acaso no tiene dinero para pagar un buen vocalista?

He learned from Joe, what else can you say...The only thing is that Steve Vai fails to show what he can really do on his c.d.s. I hope that he will take a lesson from his mentor and finally put out a c.d. with a great song on every track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable Garbage from the Eccentric Guitar Virtuoso","review":"I bought this album hoping to hear Vai show off his considerable guitar skills like what I had heard in \\"Fire Garden\\" or \\"Passion and Warfare.\\" This album is nothing like those two. There has always been some wacko stuff on all of Vai's albums, but here it dominates the entire album (too many psychedelic drugs with Zappa's band). There are no real rockers here except for \\"Here I Am,\\" which is pretty good and the best song of the album. Vai should have done better though. Even his two tributes to Zappa and Stevie Ray Vaughn aren't any good. Not recommended for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO GOOD","review":"He needs to come up with music that is able to communicate different fans age. Since I strated listening to him after he broke up with white snake, I realized that his music is devoted to very narrow range of listenrs (mostly very young people). Whenevr he tries to come up with new idea for his music, it turns out to be immature. Yes, there are some very beautiful piesces of art in each album but not before you have to listen to some junk.I think I need to stop listening to his music for some years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of CD shelf space","review":"I picked up this album hoping to hear inspiring/powerfull/uplifting guitar playing to the standards that Hendrix, Jimmy Page, and Clapton have set. Instead what I found was a guy who runs down major scales and masks them with various guitar effects. give me a break this music is awfull. All you Vai and Satriani fans need to get your ears checked for those that think this is great music. Granted, techinically Vai is great at blazing through the fretboard and running down the scales with amazing precision but, that in no way qualifies him to be a great guitar player...Rythem and Harmony are no where to be found in this CD and judging by what I heard so far, it is my opinion that Vai lacks the musical sense to achieve that. Thats why you rarely see his music get radio play on rock stations..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Vai's best!","review":"I have to say that this is definitely a great album. It was worth the wait. This album is like a mixture of all previous ones. The instrumentals are excellent, specially \\"Frank\\" and the always treasured #7 track \\"Windows to the Soul\\". Steve sings on five tracks, and I can say that his singing is a lot better from Fire Garden, although I enjoy the instrumentals a lot more. For new Vai listeners, buy this one and Passion & Warfare, if you like those then buy Alien Love Secrets and Fire Garden. For long time Vai fans, you will certainly love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Vai-esque. A new Kaleydoscope of guitar sounds!","review":"Well, one would usually think that a former spandex-rockstar-guitarrist turned soloist in his late thirties would stick to the mainstream... Yes and no. Yes, you can find Vai's inspiration Zappa on some of the tunes (his voice even sounds similar). Yes, you can find the typical Vai \\"let play ALL notes at the same time on a guitar. So what's new? Welcome, Steve, on the World music wagon! But instead of straying to far away of his terrain he actually enhances the typical rock song with slight touches of percussion and, obviously on the first track, indian chant. He got lucky this time, because trying to please all fans hanging to just one of his former CDs should find enough good material here to make it worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Vai The Ultra Zone","review":"Steve Vai did a excellent job with this album. Most instrumental albums are just showcases for the musician to show his chops, but in this case Vai wrote the music wonderfully. This is an enjoyable album for non-guitar fans too. All the notes are played with feeling and emotion. There is also a two great tribute songs, FRANK which is a tribute to the late Frank Zappa is a beutiful ballad. Then JIBBOOM which is a song inspire from SCUTTLE BUTTIN by STEVIE RAY VAUGHN. Windows to the soul is a masterpiece which I thought was the best song of 1999. Steve Vai is a combination of technique, emotion, and creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again!","review":"Have we not been down this road before?

Every tune is not just an inspiration to those who know the technicalities of great guitar playing, but also examples of how music can actually transcend us into a spiritual journey. Steve was definitely born with a guitar in his hands! I must disagree with some of your reviews which knock his vocal tracks - sure, they are not the shining stars on this album, but hey, I enjoy listening to what verbal messages this idol has to offer, and with 70 minutes of music, what's wrong with a few of his opinions? And of course the #7 Track, the crying guitar extravaganza is as brilliant as ever, this time delivered in an 11/8 time signature, again not something to please everyone (some think the song has a skip in it, but indeed it is \\"skipping\\" a beat).

It kind of reminds me of a heavy, futuristic-sounding Frank Zappa in some respects, and is perhaps Steve's most rhythmically complex work to date. And there are all kinds of interesting time signatures for you progressive rock types. I would highly recommend this album to anyone looking for something different - and beware for that matter, for a lot of people seem to have problems digesting this one because it is certainly different from anything Steve has done before. I would say this is tied with Passion and Warfare for my favorite Steve Vai albums. But then again, Fire Garden and Alien Love Secrets are great too... Bottom line? This is some really powerful stuff that represents one of Steve's most innovative and ambitious works to date IMHO. Pick it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Vai NEVER Disappoints...","review":"Thank You Steve for consistently pushing yourself to the limit. To anyone reading... I have never once been disappointed by a Vai recording. Vai is what happens when a man uses his gift to it's fullest potential and allows no limits, no boundaries.

And the title track...all I have to say is \\"ahhhhh...The Ultra Zone\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment :(","review":"I'll start by saying I'm a Steve Vai fan and have been that since Sex & Religion and especially since Fire Garden. After the excellent FG I really expected a lot from this album, but I was more or less disappointed. I must question the same thing that was already brought up in an earlier review: Has Steve ran out of ideas? In my opinion The Ultra Zone is mostly a bland and a dull album. Most of the songs on Fire Garden (as well as on Sex & Religion) were strong, emotional and beautiful. I really can't say the same about this one even though I'd really love to. I really hope Steve does better with his next attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"A turn for the worse, Steve!","review":"I am a long-standing Steve Vai fan but I too, like Matthew from PA, have a \\"Love/Hate\\" relationship with his music. OK,OK...we all know of Steve's technical wizardry! However, compositionally, The Ultra Zone doesn't even come close to what Passion and Fire gave us. Sorry Steve...this one's a miss, but hey, I'll keep waiting for the best that's yet to come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"This album was a big disappointment for me. Vai is at his best in the instrumental mode. There is something wrong with any song he write containing lyrics. He can't sing (although he's a better singer than Satch), and he can't write lyrics (they come out silly, sappy, and sounding like a teenager wrote them). This all leads me to wonder where he gets the encouragement to keep singing, or worse, have someone else sing his stupid songs. The opening track of this album almost made not listen to the rest of the album. It's terrible, and there are a few others later on that just plain stink. Now, I love Vai's instrumental songs. They're beautiful. I will definitely make sure to hear each new album before I buy it. I wish I hadn't bought this one. If you want a Vai album, get Passion and Warfare, or maybe Fire Garden (though he sings a few tracks on this one too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plug it in steve!","review":"Why does \\"the Vaister\\" use smurffs as backing vocals on \\"lucky charms\\", i think it shows that Vai wants to be ever so creative - and he is, but on a guitar.

No doubt about that. WHen I say this, I don't mean their songs are the best or the most exciting (just listen to AC/DC, for example, or Ramones, or Motorhead or others around - with just three chords they produced songs that will always be in metal and rock history - Vai have not achieved that) I just mean that he can express anything his mind figures out, because his skills aloud him to do so.

The main character, Ellen, is a forgettable and nearly unlikable sort. She's a hermit and it comes out in that she doesn't even want to let the reader into her life. Peter, the supposed hero of this tale, is private security hired to protect our cloistered ex skating star from a stalker and comes off as a stalker himself.The bad guy in this book is a pathetic little jerk who's just begging to be ground into the carpet. Add in an even weaker story line about an IVF clinic that hires weirdos, and you can see that this book, like Ellen, is headed for anything but greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Skating?","review":"Gee, for a book supposedly about a skater, there sure isn't much skating in it. In fact there isn't any. As for the skating community being upset over issues being raised... What issues? Where? If the book spent any time talking about eating disorders, the harsh life a skater has, skating injuries, the dangers of skating without a helmet, skaters with drug problems, skaters sexually abused by their coaches (all very real and important issues that I would welcome in a book), I must have missed it. Did the author write another secret book that exposed problems in the figure skating world? This book was about a celebrity (who incidently was a skater in another life) being stalked. And if you've read one book about a celebrity stalker, you've read them all. This one wasn't even a particulary well-written one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you know anything about skating?","review":"Patrick Lynch doesn't, unfortunately. People seem to love this book or hate it, count me under the ranks of those who hate it. In fact, everyone I know who's read this travesty of fiction hates it. The one thing all the people I know have in common is that we are all skating fans. We all know something about skating... and you would think that a man about to write a novel about a famous skater would consult a *skating* expert? Not Patrick Lynch... all his thank-yous are to medical experts, crime experts and such. He obviously doesn't think one needs to know anything about skating to write a book about a skater. He goes on to prove that ably. Figure of Eight could have as easily been about any famous person: an actress, a musician. Normally, that would indicate a strong, universal story. Not in this case.If you're a skating fan, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts slowly, then becomes a \\"can't put down\\" book","review":"I nearly put this one down and am SO glad I didn't, as the original story, plot twists and action were a notch above the usual suspense or thriller type novel. Be forewarned, however, that you need to get through the first 4 chapters before this one weaves its spell (or at least, I did). I prefer books with strong characters and this book does have compelling characters but the reader doesn't meet them immediately and I felt there were too many pages of background, information that could have been shortened and presented more tightly.

The good thing is it protects it from falls, I have dropped mine three times. The bad thing is that it fell because of the ridiculously flimsy belt clip. The belt clip is both cheap and not very strong and the last time it fell the clip assembly exploded. As I would not trust a $500 gadget hanging on the thing after it repeatedly failed, I didn't really care at that point and just removed it. The case is fine in that it protects the IPod and has an easily removable / swing open door for the disc control. It does get very dirty, however, as the material is extremely tacky and picks up everything from lint to good ole' dirt so that you need to clean it regularly. Other than that I would not have any complaints, I just cannot recommend the case as for $30 I expected the clip to actually be functional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea - Bad Design","review":"I was delighted with my ToughSkin for all of two hours. That's how long it took for the belt clip to break, rendering my new purchase worthless to me.The ToughSkin itself is rugged; I loved it. I should have waited before buying it, though ... on my last visit to an Apple dealership, they had a bin full of *just the ToughSkins,* for sale at a discount. When I asked about these, I was told, \\"The belt clips break, and customers bring the ToughSkins back.\\"I should note I'm very careful with my IPod and accessories. I'm not rough on them. The clip just fell apart while I was walking down the street. Given other comments about the flimsy clips, this is clearly a design issue that Speck Products needs to address."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Case","review":"This case is rubber, and has a similar feel to that of a bicycle tire (although maybe a little bit softer). Once you get the ipod into the rubber case, you then pop in the screen cover and click wheel cover. The screen cover and click wheel cover are hard plastic, and the click wheel cover swings open downward. The case fits very snugly, and is visually appealing. It's kind of a pain to get it in and out of the case, but it's not too bad. I wouldn't take it out in the rain, because the top and bottom of the ipod are not fully covered. It should provide good protection against bumps and scratching. It fits my ipod 60 gb perfectly. It feels like I'm holding a little rectangular tire, and it looks rugged. It's not sleek or shiny, so it's not for everybody.

It just bounces around. I can toss it into a bag with other stuff and junk and not worry about scratchs, or more serious damage, from bumping around with my other \\"toys\\". The cover over the control wheel is easy to open and close and I like the wheel protected. It's a little difficult to sych up with iTUNES because you have to take the ToughSkin off to get the iPOD in the cradle.

I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"iPod peace of mind in a Tough Skin","review":"I'm very happy that my iPod is now safe and cozy inside my Speck Tough Skin! This product does what it says it will do and looks cool doing it. Great color options too! The rubber seems thicker than other protective skins that I've looked at. The belt clip works fine and stayed attached to my hip (I tried it like that at work for a day), but I prefer not to carry it like that. The clip is identical to the detachable, universal type that is used on many cell phone clips/covers. I didn't buy the $40 upright iPod dock (why would you?!) so I don't know if you could use it with this thick skin. I doubt it. The controls and dock are easy to get to and the solid cover on my precious click wheel really protects and is easy to flip open. I still wouldn't recommend dropping it though. It is a Tough Skin, but not THAT tough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"Of the various iPod cases I've tried I found this one to be the worst.

This CD is a little different then most of his other works with added synthesizers for a modern touch, yet still holding on to his classic fast acoustic piano work. The drumming is more present with this CD, with a drummer & a percussionist, while not over powering the other great musicians. This CD has a quintet of piano, synthesizer, bass, drummer & percussionist, which is an interesting union. This is modern Jazz that still holds onto the mainstream.

I asked Lexar to replace (swapping out so that I could still have a USB drive even offered my credit card to enable a warranty cross-shipment type arrangement) but all they wanted to do was have me send it in and wait 2-4 weeks for a replacement. This was unacceptable to me so I returned the Lightning drive for a full refund.Until they improve the quality control on their manufacturing process I would stay away from this product.

The screaming kids in shorts and tank tops (Miguel starts out in a suit, tie and long sleeved shirt and dresses down from there) clearly adore him. But he does only two numbers with Mariachi. The single cuts from the video shown on Mexican television include Mariachi, and they are good. Unfortunately, they are not representative of the performance overall. In the rest of the video, Miguel is good enough, but the backup music is average, too much of the same. Miguel gives the audience plenty of his intentional green-eyed loco look, and it's fun to watch the guy whose job it is to hold Miguel on stage as he reaches out to the audience.

My first one seemed fine until DST when I found out it did not adjust \\"atomically\\" as advertised, but just used the calendar. I could have set that manually if it had allowed me to choose a time zone east of Boston. After extensive email activity, LaCrosse sent me another one. It truly noticed something changed on the correct DST date - it turned wildly for more than 24 hours. Eventually I pulled the battery to stop that. After letting any residual charge leak out for a week, I hoped it would reset, but it never did.

His outdoor temperature monitor broke after a year and mine broke after 6 months. For Christmas this year I bought him a new one and the external temperature only reads if the temperature is above 35 degrees. Since we live in central Ohio that means he won't be able to know the external temp until March rolls around. And he will only be able to use it if the product lasts those 3 months.

The outdoor temperature sensor works as advertised, and constantly updates every few seconds or so-and seems accurate. The one thing I don't like is that the moon phase seems to be \\"backwards\\" as in if the picture is all black, that actually indicates a full moon, and when its all \\"white\\" it's actually a new moon.

For several years, I've had a slightly different model with wood accent panels instead of brushed aluminum and when the remote temperature sensor is working, it's quite useful. I've gone through several remote sensors, however, at $16 plus shipping apiece, and the clock seems to be unable to pick up the signal from the sensors in many cases even when the sensor is less than 10' away in line of sight through a window. Then the sensors stop working altogether for no good reason. Not optimal performance. The unit is well designed, lovely to look at it, but its remote temperature sensor and the corresponding receiver in the main unit are shabbily manufactured and unreliable. Anyone interested in a remote temperature sensor would be well advised to look for a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as advertised.","review":"This clock doesn't do what it's supposed to do.

When cleaning out his home after his death, my husband and I decided to take the clock back to our house as a constant reminder of him. Like my father-in-law, I grew to adore all the functions this clock displayed. This past week the clock's face appeared blank. I never realized how attached to its precision and functions I had become. Did my research and as usual ended up purchasing two different La Crosse models directly from Amazon. The nicer looking one graces the original clock's position while the simpler one went to the second floor of our house. Shortly after all the batteries were inserted both clocks set themselves perfectly. Could life be any easier?

That makes the moon phase, automatic daylight savings time reset and other features useless. The outdoor temperature sensor worked fine but stops at 109 degrees, OK if you live in North Dakota but not so helpful in Phoenix, Dallas or Las Vegas. The clock is EXTREMELY difficult to program without the atomic signal. It also shows P.M. hours in military time. There is no backlight, not even an option for temporary illumination.

More than a dozen of Top 10 hits, songs written for and covered by other musicians and groups, and to this day, one of the few artists who can still sell-out arenas across the country. So with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominations just out today. One has to ask, why Neil Diamond is not already in the Hall of Fame? Since his first LP came out in 1963, he has theoretically been \\"eligible\\" for induction since 1988. And I don't want to hear that he's not \\"rock and roll\\" enough ... but \\"jazz legend\\" Miles Davis is? This is one of the biggest travesties going down!

Jesus didn't converse with demons, He simply rebuked them and said \\"be quiet and come out of him/her\\". He did not communicate with demons \\"for what communion has light with darkness.\\" Prov. 16:27 says \\"an ungodly man digs up evil, and it is on his lips like a burning fire\\", that's what's being done in these kinds of books. Naming and talking to demons is sorcery (calling forth evil spirits; incantations to evil spirits; communing with evil spirits). 2 Cor. 6:15 says \\"And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?\\" There's much more in the Bible about this kind of foolishness. I'd suggest spending some quality time reading the Bible and putting on the full armor of God, instead of reading books by these self-styled deliverers, it could be dangerous to someone attempting this.

We do have authority over demons! Praise God!One thing I found puzzling though, is that Prince states that Christians can be demonized... but that satan cannot follow you through the waters of baptism. Yet he mentions instances where Christians who have been baptised with the Holy Spirit (which I thought came AFTER water baptism) have been demonized. Is this because these Christians have not been water baptised?

And with this second installment in the series, we have more of the duo's adventures and philosophies.

Also, we get to see a bit more philosophical discussions between the six-year old and his stuffed tiger.

I gave them a shot, and now every time I try a different brand or gauge I keep coming back to these.I use the John Pearse 700M on my Gibson J200. They capture the bluesy tones just right if I'm playing technically, the crisp/warm tones if I'm fingerpicking, and they provide a great rhythmic backdrop for a backup folk guitar. Dynamically, they allow for my guitar to be big and beefy or soft and tender.The only drawback that I have is that these strings tend to go dead quickly. Since that is in large part my fault for having oily skin that corrodes and deadens any string, I should really give this string 4 and a half stars; but they don't give that as an option.I have been very satisfied, and changing the strings frequently has just become a part of my routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"He sounds like Justin Timberlake in this CD rather than his personal style. I agree with much that has been written here and I tend to think that this CD was catered for US charts. I'm not impressed with it and I also think his voice sounds much better in his native tongue of Turkish. This english CD sounds like it's going to be his only one. It's not bad but it's NOT Tarkan.

As a Turkish-American, I have been listening to Tarkan since I was about 16 (I am 30 now) and I absolutely adore his music. I was SO looking forward to this album- we have been saying that Americans would LOVE his style. This album, however, does not show his style and that \\"je ne sais quoi\\" that makes him a Euro-mega star. It sounds like a poor imitation of Britany Spears, N'Sync or Spice Girls circa 1999. Actually, I believe that some of his stuff resembles Wham from the early 80s, and again, not a flattering, fun Wham but a sad, poor imitation Wham. This album is the pits- American Customers, PLEASE oh PLEASE don't buy this, but please do buy \\"Kuzu Kuzu\\" or \\"Sikidim\\" or one of his other, older Turkish albums. Those are fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a lot of flava","review":"I agree with Ay from New Jersey. I, too, am a huge fan of Tarkan, and was looking forward to this album. For me it turned out to be a bit of a bust. Here and there we get glimpses of his Turkish genius, but for the most part, \\"Come Closer\\" sounds like every other R&B Lite album out there. I was expecting a much more creative blend of East and West. It is unfortunate that the Pussycat Dolls' \\"Buttons\\" has more impact than much of the material on this album. It almost seems as if Tarkan were writing music to cater to \\"American\\" tastes, rather than writing from the heart. If this is the case, then Tarkan, be true to yourself. Your fans love your creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of disappointment...","review":"I have all of Tarkan's CD'S and I love them.

In an age with so many ill-designed, poorly made, and cheap items on the market, it's a pleasant surprise to purchase a product that works so well.

It is easy to see how much tea leaf is in (I have a black infuser, and it is hard to see since the tea leaf's color is blended into the background). It is also easy to clean since the mesh is small enough to avoid the leaf stuck.This is a great product, but I found a couple of turn-offs.First, the sticker attached to the bottom of the item when I received made me trouble to peel. I wasted 30 minutes just to peel the useless sticker. I recommend using hair dryer to warm up to peel the sticker. If you still fail to peel it clean, use scotch tape to catch all the paper sticker.Second, it is thin enough to make a dent easy.

First, this infuser was shipped to me without proper casing and indeed I noticed some bumps which weren't too bad however they were certainly noticeable in close inspection.Second, if you look closely at how they melded this stainless steel infuser, you will see why I say this was cheaply made. It was just amateurishly done even I can do better.Third, they put some kind of stick at the bottom of the infuser and frankly, I spent 20 minutes trying to get it off completely. And of course I ended up with very scratched infuser bottom. I don't know what kind of glue it was but it stuck to infuser bottom and simply refused to scrape off.I would recommend future buyers to stay away from this product.

For those that need a little extra help, I put colored dots on the three sides of the pencil and matching dots on the children's fingers.I myself like the feel of the pencil and I used them throughout graduate school for note-taking and hand written projects. I still use them any time I need to write in pencil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bulky for little hands","review":"I had hoped to find a pencil built more like the triangle grippers. This pencil is bulky and the \\"edges\\" are too rounded to really force the proper grip and provide the ergo comfort for my 6-year-old's hand to keep it relaxed enough for a worksheet's worth of writing. They came unsharpened, so I had to sharpen one to test it on her. I'll see if Amazon will accept it as a return because I don't want to be stuck with 36 of these.

I don't have cable or Satellite (yet), but the salesman through in an RCA HDTV Antenna for free, and I can pick up the local HD channels and they look unbelievable. This TV also has an option that changes the screen color due to the light level in the room (Day: Dynamic, Day: Normal, and Night).

The last few albums have been extremely spotty, and this one even more so. Sure, there's always a terrific single or two. And the remixes on the bonus disc are thumpy in all the right places. But they seem incapable of pulling off an entire album of arresting and memorable moments. Nothing here begs for repeated listens, and that is what ultimately flaws this collection.

I just can't stand to listen to how bad his whining has gotten.I will be seeing them in concert next month and I am hoping that they don't sing too many songs from this CD.

I had to search through 3 stores for it but I eventually got it...definitely worth it to me! If you are a PSB fan, I don't think you will be disappointed.

My main question is: Neil, where are the melodies? The great choruses? It sounds as if they're trying to go in a Depeche Mode mode, mostly dreary, slow, and somber. I'm afraid nothing on it really grabbed me other than \\"I'm With Stupid\\", and even that more for the lyrics that the tune itself. I instantly loved past albums such as \\"Behavior\\", \\"Very\\", and \\"Nightlife\\", but my first impression of \\"Fundamental\\"?; I'm underwhelmed. Disc two, with the remixes and such, is OK for your next rave party, but is the new version of Dusty Springfield's PSB production \\"In Private\\" really necessary? Even with its high-energy bounce, neither Neil Tennant nor Elton John makes one forget Dusty's incredible vocal on the original.

This album is produced by Trevor Horn, who is well known for his great 1980s productions like Frankie goes to Hollywood's \\"Relax\\" and when listening to FUNDAMENTAL I feel like being back in the day. The album is not retro sounding as such but I feel that the melodies and hooklines are a bit dated sometimes and yet it has a flavour that leaves me wanting more. Anne Dudley, famous for beign part of another 80s act \\"The Art of Noise\\" helps on different tracks as well and in total I'd say FUNDAMENTAL is a strong PSB album.

It is however mentioned in the later Oz books as Frank liked to keep everyone happy and what better way than to have all his characters live in Oz?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun read","review":"This is a review of the free Kindle edition. 1,738 locations and no illustrations.It's a fun story as our young star hears stories about mermaids from her older mentor, and the mermaids show up to set the matter straight.Well written, with more adult risk to it then I would have expected. I was disappointed when the mermaids refer to the lobster servants as slaves at one point, but it was written about 100 years ago.Well worth downloading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely inferior to the Oz books","review":"This book is a real let down after reading all the Oz Books. It doesn't have anywhere near the sparkle and pop of Baum's other series and seems much more like a list of what-could-be sightings than a worthwhile story. That's truly a shame because I was hoping to \\"keep the magic alive\\" (as it were) for my young children after finishing all the Oz books.The story line is simple - Trot and Cap'n Bill (both migrated to Oz after a few more books) are temporarily transformed into a mermaid & merman for undersea adventures. They get captured by an evil wizard and eventually freed. The drawback is that the sea offers less of a chance for Oz's remarkable imagination since he has to work with observable items and make them seem fantastical. He just doesn't have as much room to work with as he does in Oz, which offers boundless opportunities for his near-endless imagination.Maybe a Baum completist would enjoy this more, but it wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Moronic Sappy Waste of Time.

The music is grand - makes you want to move & dance - but if you get lost before things are really started, there's no point. In this program, the split second Simmons starts to say what we are going to do, he and everyone is doing it. By the time he stops explaining, he's right into another move!!!

At all. I like Neil Diamond's music because normally it is upbeat and optimistic. The songs on this album (except for Delirious Love with Brian Wilson, which is the one song I liked) are all depressing. And the minimalist arrangements just add to the dreariness. Where is the percussion? Where are the strings? Where is the Neil I used to know and love?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun time","review":"This is a really fun video - the Sharpe genre is very entertaining and gives an intersting insight into a soldier's life during the Napoleonic era and beyond. This adventure, set in India at the time of the East India company, is like an old fashioned romp. The bad guys are really bad (lucious Toby Stephens!) and the good guys are great (salt of the earth Sean Bean). The main story is wonderfully set in a fortress in India; the scenery in majestic. The short about the making of the movie and the outtakes complement the movie wonderfully. Highly recommended for a cozy evening in front of the television!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Sharpe Story","review":"Just as all the other BBC Sharpe movies this one is of the same high quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharpe is Back","review":"A great addition to the Sharpe Series of DVDs and Books.

Its great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Sean Bean--how can you resist?","review":"Yes, he's starting to look a bit older in this one(!) but we DO love Sharpe, so how can we resist? A few years ago I bought my husband the whole DVD series that came in a set of 15 inside a small wooden crate--he loved it. Now it's great to have another one to watch. I don't know, will Sean make more--maybe Sharpe can go into Parlament or something? :) Or maybe he should come to America and see how he can teach us pesky Americans how to shoot! Kidding aside, you will like this one too if you have been a fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is that all there is...","review":"An interesting add-on to the original 14 Sharpes. Bernard Cornwell's books go on and on but the series seemed wrapped-up at \\"Sharpe's Waterloo\\". This is a nicely-done (more-or-less) costume drama in the Sharpe's milieu. Either Britain's Channel 4 was hoping for a new series or Sean Bean needed some fast cash. Either way, it was a decent hour plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"sharpes challenge","review":"I am a long time fan of both Sean Bean and the Richard Sharpe series.I already have the rest of the Sharpe series and while I have rented this latest entry and enjoyed it very much, I have yet to buy it.

This lack of extras is my only point of dissatifaction with the rest of the series. Like the author. Bermard Cornwell, I hear Sean Bean and his great Sheffield accent in my head when reading his books in the series. I am going to hold out and hope we get the special edition on this side of the Atlantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition to the Series","review":"This latest episode in the Sharpe adventures was much anticipated and mostly met expectations. The budget was obviously smaller than a theatrical release and that was apparent in production values but the story was good and the actors seemed to fall back into their roles very easily. It was impressive that the crew was able to film in India. Do we believe Richard Sharpe turned down a beautiful woman? Hmmmmm....that was the real challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharpe's Challenge","review":"It was good to see Sean Bean revive his role as Richard Sharpe, but I am not sure if it was aging, or him not fighting in Europe or visualizing him in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" but it seems as those he has lost his charisma as a British soldier in the Napoleonic era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete production","review":"Only first half or less of a story, ending in a cliff hanger and trailers for additional episodes not produced, not even listed in IMDB much less included on the dvd -- or any other dvd.

The earlier Sharpe episodes had plenty of violence but not nearly as graphic as this one. I think it is much too sad that we are fed this type of over-the-top violence in what could be thrilling mysteries and adventure stories. There were such horrid scenes that came up so fast that I didn't have time to look away. I wouldn't want my children to see something like this. I felt strongly enough about it that I had to write my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is nice to see Sharpe again.","review":"By now I have bough all 14 old episodes and two of the new ones when Sharpe is older.

People either love him or hate him. But I find it curious that readers who deride his work and find his writing style not to their taste keep reading him. I read one Ruby Jean Jensen novel, for example, didn't care for it, and never read anything by her again.From my point of view, Mr. Little's characterizations are spot on. I find his people and their internal lives, their ruminations, very believable. Having recently lost my father to cancer, I also found the portions of THE WALKING that deal with Miles and his father extremely well done and quite affecting. Mr. Little not only has an incredible imagination but he is also able to create characters with whom I, at least, can empathize. I believe him to be one of the top three horror authors currently writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly the horror event of the year -- very average","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author and was sorely disappointed. After reading all the other reviews, however, it appears that this was probably not the author's best effort. Usually, I can easily lose myself in a good, creepy read, but I found that I just could not suspend disbelief enough to get into it. I didn't think the characters were developed that well, there were a couple red herring plot lines (what was the purpose of introducing the 'X-files type' FBI agent?) and everything came together too neatly and conveniently in the end. This would be a good story to relay over a campfire, but I couldn't recommend this book to the serious, critical reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great suspense novel, overall","review":"A great story throughout, which is usually the case with the author's work. His story of dead people walking and the creation of a witch's town is captivating and held my attention from the first page. Then ending was a bit rushed, and seemed a tad weak, but didn't take anything from the story overall. I've enjoyed two other stories from the author, and hope to read others when I get the opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"May Be Not This Time","review":"Like most of my deisires in a grocery store the decision to purchase The Walking was made in less than ten seconds. The aftermath of that decision is still quite unclear, thus far.I did like Little's spooky story plot and especially Isabella's mistique but I do think she ( as a character ) was not developed enough. The ending really disappointed me as it was totally not original and entirely predictable.The more I think about the story the more questions I have. Someone please enlighten me what in the world was the purpose of the dead dwarf in the cave surrounded by the dolls? And how can such a strong creature as Isabella that had managed to exist for centuries and had become stronger with each new fatality, is so easily defeated at the end in a matter of less than a couple of pages ?Anyways.... next time I am in a grocery store and I am thinking of buying a book solely on its coloful covers I might have to say to myself \\" May be not this time \\".Cheers"},{"rating":"1","title":"P.S.--","review":"One more thing (sorry to have left this out), I would like to resoundingly agree with an earlier reviewer, for their remarks about the book's muddled anti-Christian sentiment. It was shallow at best, ignorant at worst. And yet he has his lead character joyfully celebrating Christmas... bizarre. Heck, in the first seventy pages, the author manages to demonstrate an astounding lack of research and understanding on the issues of Christianity, Halloween, and even witchcraft. The book was an offensive mess, philosophically.Thank you, and good night. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a waste of time.","review":"I bought this book on an impulse at an airport, because the cover has quotes from Stephen King and Dean Koontz, saying how great it is. What a disappointment. The most glaring negative is the characters. They are all so phoney, predictable, and with all the depth of a pizza box. How can you get into a story when you don't give a damn about any of the characters?Skip this one, unless you are reeeeeaaally bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"One of Bentley's best ideas...and sadly it comes out in the worst possible fashion. The idea for the story is great and it promised to be an outstanding read, but unfortunately, Bentley wastes all of it's potential by supplying it with bland, uninspiring characters that seem as if they were conceived by a 8 year old. The characters thusly come across as completely unbelievable and ridiculous, and as a result you won't care whether they live or die - all you hope for is that they die in an extremely graphic way, and of course Bentley supplies that better than almost anybody else in the business.The conclusion is so utterly laughable you'll find yourself wondering why you even bothered reading the last 50 pages or so, and the \\"supernatural terror\\" controlling the whole situationc comes across as more of a \\"supernatural joke\\". Anti-climatic, boring and poorly thought out. Unless you're reading specifically for the gore element, you'll be sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty chilling","review":"I have to admit, sometimes I think ol' Bently gets a little too far out into left field. However, I really enjoyed this book. It starts out strong, and although the ending was a little too wild, the rest of the book makes up for it. I would definitely reccomend this book for people who enjoy supernatural suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking, walking, walking...","review":"Brief plot synopsis: Some of the dead are walking, and the father of the book's protagonist is one of them. Miles must figure out why his father and the others are walking and what the connection between the walkers is....The prologue completely creeped me out. Then, most of the rest of the book was also pretty creepy and a really smooth read. And then the book just kind of ended, and the epilogue was cheesy. I felt really let down, to the point where it was hard not to think about it...Despite the ending, I still feel that this book is worth recommending, but it is not one that I will keep on my shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrriiinnnggg!","review":"This has to be a first in my experience--a new and novel idea so totally ruined by cardboard characters and muddy plotting that I had to force myself to finish the book.The idea of a community of witches that is ruined by the prescence of an evil character sounds different and promising enough that I was looking forward to the book. However, the characters were so washed out, so thin and self absorbed, that I barely finished. By the end, I could care less what actually happened to any of the protagonists, I just wanted to see the culmination of the original idea.The plot was plodding and distracted. Even the ending, while not necessarily predictable, was totally unoriginal and seemed slapped together just to finish the book. This guy is a hack--don't buy the book, unless you love King at his worst (ala \\"It\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...","review":"Put simply, this book is terrible. The characters lack depth, the story is too preposterous to be believed, and the flashbacks only add to the suffering. The basic premise--the dead start rising and walking around--is brilliant, but instead of focusing on that gem of a story, Little throws in witches and curses and all other manner of nonsense. Go re-read a classic King novel instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"I love just about anything zombie related. But this was a huge let down. The book started out good with a nice bit of imagery but then it just got boring- Stephen King boring. If you like Stephen King or Dean Koontz or you've been stuck in an outhouse in Arkansas for a dozen or so years- you'll probably like this book. But then again, you probably get your books at those spinning racks at truck stops. Like I said the openinng images were pretty good and the idea of a corpse walking around the bottom of a lake for years was good. But now your thinking \\"holy cow ma! a corpse walking around the bottom of a lake for years!?!?!?\\" and I got your expectations up..... well, sorry about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Walking Stopped Dead In It's Tracks","review":"I loved the begginning.. it was great, but the ending was rather lame. I think the author ran out of gas. I had many questions, and was trying to piece together loose ends. I was rather dissapointed. I have read other works by Mr. Little and have liked those... so I was surprised by the lack of an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately disappointing","review":"While sporadically exciting this book proved to be a disappointment. It started well but went progressively downhill. The plot became less believable and the characters more cardboard as the story went on. There were a few plot branches which went nowhere and there was a definite contrived feeling to the latter half of the book. Having said that, there was a kernel of a good story here and the book worked best for me when the action took place in the village. The story was far too disjointed, however, to engender any sympathy for the characters and the paper-thin characterisation led to little sympathy for those 'taken out'. Also, the ending was a real disappointment. It was hard to believe that it took more than 300 pages to reach such a feeble finale."},{"rating":"1","title":"fair","review":"i like bentley little but this was one of his worst. it got worse as the story went along. a real letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool and realistic","review":"it is cool and realistic, if dragon can be realistic at all.

Now and Zen provides the worst experience I've had with customer service in over 5 years. What could have been an excellent product is really just junk. Yes they look nice but as alarm clocks they are horrible. But even if you are getting them for just looks if you ever have a problem with them, you will most likely end up with pure frustration.

I thought it was so obvious, I just KNEW that there was going to be a \\"double reverse\\" with Adam coming out on top. No such luck.The \\"play as a film\\" approach didn't work for me, as I felt the acting was somewhat stiff in places, especially the Phillip character.Overall, just OK. LaBute's done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretchedly dull...","review":"& flat & woodenly acted & pretentious & boring as hell. An imitation of an imitation of a derivative of something...but lord knows what."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie with Rachel Weisz giving a great performance.","review":"Neil LaBute's is back in fine form with a story that even rivals his previous classic In the Company of Man. Rachel Weisz is superb as a strange and crazy art student who wants to remake Paul RuddInto the image of the perfect man. With all of Neil LaBute's plays, expect the unexpected. Rachel is stunning as Evelyn, and her performance makes this film as special as it is. Paul Rudd is great as well as Adam, plus Gretchen Mol and Fred Weller are great as Jenny and Phillip. Neil LaBute not only out does himself this time, but with Rachel Weisz's help makes a modern classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite Rachel and a mirror to take a look","review":"Labute made a good work in the direction of the ascendent Rachel Weisz and the funny and good partner Rudd. All of the characters involve in this film are so regular, like many others moralist in our world. This kind of cruelty is so common in many places with our current modern lives. All the staff understand this and show us regular people in regular situations with regular and raw ends. Noone like the sweettest Weisz to show us the cruelty between loving people that we live every day.My wife still hate the movie, she can't believed that people like them exist but she know very well where to found them. Good movie to hate and remember in some crucial ocasions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great satire made by a great performance by Rachel Weisz","review":"Fantastic satire about the minefield of relationships that really makes you think about the people around you. Rachel Weisz proves once again to be the best versatile actress we have around with a powerful performance that seduces as well as scares the willies out of you. She makes this film hands down with her talent and she will have you talking with your partner well after the film is over. The rest of the cast is just as great with Paul Rudd giving a great transformation on screen from geek to hunk. This was one of the best films that I have seen in a long time, and I hope Rachel Weisz and director Neil LaBute work together again."},{"rating":"2","title":"**CRUEL INTENTIONS**","review":"A surprise ending puts everything into prospective with \\"The Shape of Things\\", ..add a standout performance by Rachel Weisz and you've got yourself a very satisfying movie. I know I'm jumping on the bandwagon by praising Rachel Weisz for her superior performance, but she is worth all the hoopla. Even if you end up disliking the movie, you can't say anything bad about her performance. The fact is, you really don't realize how great her work here is until the ending. Sure she's good through-out the whole film, but in the end you'll say.. Oh my God! I compare this movie to CRUEL INTENTIONS.. not because I think they're alike, because they are not. It's more like CRUEL INTENTIONS would have been a perfect title for this film. If you've seen it you know why I think that. If you haven't seen it, check it out and you'll find out why. BOTTOMLINE: A good film w/ even better performances and a unexpected finale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets where it was going","review":"Weisz holds this together. It gets too talky at times but is nicely shot and paced pretty well. The ending is a nice nasty surprise. A little too bitchy for my taste but it does what it sets out to do, with a fair bit of aplomb and style.Solid comedy of modern manners full of acerbic edginess, brought from stage to screen pretty decently."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOVIE FALLS FLAT...and Yes, I am a man and \\"got it.\\"","review":"Wow, I have to disagree with the majority of the reviewers of this sorry excuse for entertainment. I thought that story was full of potential: a beautiful woman proving she can manipulate a man, particularly a vulnerable man. There was no doubt that an attractive woman is capable of such actions, and there are plenty of men more than willing to be taken advantage of. What I waited over one hour for was to try to understand why would a woman want to make these changes. The explanation at the end did not seem believable at all. I was more than a little disappointed! At least the movie I LIKE TO PLAY GAMES (also about a beautiful and controlling woman) made some sense even though it was a sleazy movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain dumb...shock value isn't always a good goal","review":"No synopsis needed. The movie aims to shock, and it doesn't even do that well. If it was meant to open the mind then it didn't achieve that goal either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine cruelty","review":"Gretchen Mol and Paul Rudd star in \\"The Shape of Things\\". Mol plays a college student who takes her obsession with art over the edge. While correcting a \\"fake art\\" sculpture in a museum, she meets one of the employees, played by Paul Rudd. One is popular, one isn't due to appearances. The two begin dating. Their relationship turns intense very quickly as the guy quickly changes his looks. Many more people start finding him highly attractive. Many intensities erupt time by time.The producer, the director, and the writer creatively film this movie. Everyone gives their unique outlooks. Paul Rudd acts his role wonderfully. The one complaint is that the screenplay often stretches certain scenes too long. This causes numerous unnecessary repetative scenes. Besides this, \\"The Shape of Things\\" is enjoyable viewing for the audience. Many shocking scenes keep everyone watching closely until the shocking end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I want to give it negative stars but it won't let me. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Movies like this make me go back to the video store and rent another movie hoping that it will cure this illness I feel from watching it. How did this movie get made? I would have gone into detail about what I didnt like about this movie but then I wouldnt have been able to say how much it sucked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly self indulgent","review":"This film is utterly self indulgent. There are plenty of things about the film that are fine, up until the end. I won't spoil what actually happens at the end for those who want to watch (although I certainly recommend against it). It is at the end of the movie, however, that the writer/director stopped make, well, I don't know, choices, I guess. It is as if LaBute got to the end and had to find a way to put the conceit behind this movie on film, and just stuttered to a halt. The substance of the conceit is interesting enough, and probably could have been execute well. But, instead, we get this self indulgent clunker. I actually tuned into this because I liked other films by Neil LaBute, but - wow! - I'll think twice in the future. On the other hand, maybe I'm being too harsh: After all, since the movie ends with the presentation of a graduate thesis project, maybe the director intended to make the end of his film look as much like one as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiler Alert","review":"Warning don't read further if you don't want to know the big reveal.So we find out the main twist is that a semi attractive girl can manipulate an unattractive man over the course of a fake relationship. Is anyone shocked by this? Woman can manipulate men with sex, what was I supposed learn by sitting through all this?The scenes drag out way too long. The acting is timid at best. I'm never rooting for any character through the whole film so you don't get sucked into to any of this. You just watch distantly as the movie ticks toward a sucky end.The DVD extras are sub par. The tour of campus is a total joke. I started listening to the commentary and its basically the crew talking about the music selections and patting themselves on the back about how awesome they are. I don't want to listen to these guys smelling each others farts. Ugh please stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"super snoozefest","review":"This is beyond slow and boring. It takes relationship flicks to a whole other level of stupid. Honestly, I started to fast forward and just stopped on Grechen Mol's scenes. Paul Rudd dials it in.

I've used Family Tree Maker 9 for a while and bought the upgrade to Family Tree Maker 2005. When I installed this new version I kept getting errors using my file from the old version.

Even though I have attended charismatic churches where \\"prophesies\\" are not uncommon, I felt disturbed by the author's presumption. I must remind myself of the fact that the one common element in every Christian cult throughout the centuries has been the introduction, in addition to the Bible, of other authoritative literature presuming to speak on behalf of God. Another troubling aspect of the book is the anti-intellectual stance it takes with references not to rely upon reason. A warning flag should go up in everyone's head when this type of appeal is made.

I'll be replacing them with some LED night lights that have ambient light sensors in the future. All in all, I'm sure these would be suitable for some things like bathrooms and narrow hallways - they just don't work well in larger areas like an open kitchen or areas where the power sockets are not in the ideal location (since they really need to be in the perfect spot to make use of their low light output)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice lights","review":"I picked these up so my 5 year old would have some lights around the house at night and not be scared when she woke at night.They give off a nice glow, but not too bright and don't get hot to the touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well enough","review":"Works well enough for my purpose despite the negative reviews on here.

I was aware when I bought them that they wouldn't produce a lot of light--you don't want a lot of light from a night light. But these produce practically none. I had one in my bath room next to the light switch, and it was enough light that I could figure out where to put my hand to flip on the main bathroom lights (which of course are blindingly bright at 4 AM) but it wasn't enough light to allow me to avoid having to flip on the light.

If you're looking for something to make sure you're not tripping over toys or animals in the hallway these are not the nightlights you're looking for. If you just want to make sure you aren't running into walls or just want a dim glow, these are perfect.

When I first saw this film on IFC years ago I immediately called IFC the next day and asked how to obtain a copy. I was instructed it was only available from Japan. So I bought a region-free DVD player and bought the DVD from Japan and it was worth every dime. Now I'm looking forward to the special features in this US release.

Well, for those who can handle it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Lynch but still....","review":"Buddy Boy is a good movie. I have just seen it for the first time after a long wait.

I'm sure that Ms. St. James wasn't so young that she didn't realize what she was getting into!I just think that it's sad and this book did nothing, but turn a memory of a romance (affair or not) into something that the public didn't need to know about!Thanks...I'm done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How one girl's affair in college haunted her","review":"I was looking forward to reading about the woman the book \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" was possibly based on. When Robert Waller was a young, married graduate student, he had an affair with whom I feel was a naive underage college student. Jana St. James wants us to believe her love affair with Mr. Waller was like no love ever before. Sorry, Jana. You had an affair with a married man, and it ended because he had obligations to his WIFE. What did you expect? For him to leave his pregnant wife and start a new life with a young, naive college girl? I don't think so. Also, the affair -- the \\"earthshattering\\" love she experienced is exactly the same as any other \\"first love\\", no more special or different, except that it was with a married man, and Robert Waller is just a man who has talents such as writing and signing. He is no more special than you or me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"Nothing special at all. Just a lot of long, boring details about what sounded like the world's most boring affair.

I have read it twice but confess that I am sitting down again. This has to be the 'Matrix' of the 1800's as it certainly turns conventional thinking on its head...The introduction by Clive Wilmer is extremely enlightening as it provides a background against which the book can be thoroughly enjoyed. This book cleared a lot of doubts I had for a long time on many things and I must say raised twice as many questions about what I thought right :-)Ruskin has been praised by many people as being the vioce of truth.

Had she read it, I'm sure her heart would have skipped a beat and she would have headed for a confessional fast. This is a dark, disjointed novel which should supposedly please fans of time travel but it doesn't. The main character ages year by year in each chapter, traveling from one depressing historical setting to another. Particularly unsettling is the chapter where he slaughters a whole Vietnamese village. Interspersed are passages on his growing sexual awakening--growing homosexual awakening, I might add: here I was reading this stuff at 12!

In fact, they aren't even there. This CD took out everything that amkes Sigur R��s Sigur R��s. The beauty of the voice is not there. Instead, there is an electronic voice, making very annoying statements of \\"Baba Ti Ki DI DO.\\" over and over again.Also, there is not instrumentals here. It is 20 minutes of the same sound. The same keyboard line is played over and over again and becomes very monotonous. I lvoe Sigur R��s, but this CD is just a horrible waste of money. As soon as I popped it in, I knew I had made a mistake. Don't buy this, and pray to God that Sigur R��s goes back to what makes them unique and amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not bad....","review":"This is pretty good for an EP. I'm glad I didn't spend way too much on this though.

It was a project for Split sides and nothing else, the band has already said the new album will have lots of vocals, maybe even in english, so we know this isnt permenant. If it's beautiful music i dont care who is making it and where they have been, and that is what this is, if i want Untitled then I'll listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical box of love","review":"Between waiitng for Sigur Ros' next album and enjoying their last, this is indeed a welcoming news for fans of the Icelandic band. The three instrumental tracks are seamless here. You'd be forgiven for thinking that there's only one track.There's no overlayered production or much electronica infusion here, just some simple percussion, music box and bell sounds, which all worked perfectly to showcase the emotive and dramatic soundscape the band has always been known for. Track 1 Ba Ba benefits most from the whimisical bells and comes across as a very beautiful piece of music that comes right out of the music box. Think of it as good as Bjork's Frosti from Vespertine. It's that good.This CD single brings us a little closer to the next full album from Sigur Ros and I know they won't disappoint. And once again, kudos to Geffen for taking a chance with a small indie band like them.

It captures the essence of the movie and Rocky's return to the streets. Some good hip-hop tunes, such as Keep It Up, but the real reason to buy it is The Measure Of A Man by Elton John.

Even Rocky IV managed to impress with Vince DiCola's \\"War\\" and John Cafferty's \\"Hearts On Fire\\".Rocky V has...MC Hammer.That by itself wouldn't be too terrible, except for the fact that Bill Conti's music for this Rocky film is overlooked completely by the producers of this soundtrack. The one redeeming musical moment in the film was when a rearranged Rocky's theme blares during the final moments of the streetfight with Tommy Gunn.The CD does not have that track on here, eschewing it to make room for another MC Hammer song.

Terrance Stamp is great but you need to see all three in this series - 1. Cold War Killers 2. The Alamut Ambush 3. Deadly Recurits. Why they never packaged them as a series is crazy but they are a great find for those who like cold war espionage."},{"rating":"1","title":"an appaling copy","review":"This is a thoroughly old-fashioned film derived from the Anthony Price novel of the same title, which was, goodness knows, complicated enough to sort out. The film does not entirely succeed in clarifying the plot, even with a good cast working hard at it. It would be an enjoyable experience nonetheless, were it not that the Osiris Entertainment copy is quite appalling. The visuals are garish, badly reproduced, the color sometimes going a liverish dark brown or pink and completely blotting out expressions on faces. As for the soundtrack, it is practically inaudible so that an already complex plot is made virtually incomprehensible by the low level audio. Swathes of low-key conversation are impossible to decipher. Avoid buying this product at all costs. The production is a disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!","review":"I Love this toy! I love fully posable action figures with powers that mimic the super hero's powers, like a superman action figure that can fly with a remote control. This spiderman includes a retractable \\"zip-line\\" in his right arm. this interferes with the movment of the arm and so there is no elbow. The string it self is pretty short (6\\") and not effective. Also includes a cool painted bendy web that looks long but needs to be longer, maybe even strechy or sticky. It's supposed to wrap up bad guys, but you need the whole thing todo that. The head, legs and arm have very good articulation but no abdominal movement beacause of the zip-line.I am afraid of the left forearm breaking off side-ways. The coloring is good but I wish they could just make a super action figure with all of the movement, long web and magnetic palms/feet that don't interfere with making a fist. All in all, good toy, but I'd rather have the fully posable spidy w/ wall mountable set, but I couldn't find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rea Deal","review":"Having grown up in France and eaten more than my fair share of couscous, I can tell you that this is the real stuff from North Africa - right down to the brand names.

Personally, I was able to edit and create movies on my computer with no problem, using the free software that came with my computer (Sony VAIO, 3 years old). So I guess maybe I was lucky, but I have had a very good experience with this camera. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the picture quality on my movies isn't the greatest.

I even tried it hooked up to another computer this time with no results.I found a piece of paper tucked in the instructions saying that you must turn off your PC and camera, connect in a certain order and then turn them on or else the camera may be damaged.

The whole thing is about as plausible as a televangelist - if you enjoyed Jim and Tammy Fae's PTL Club, you'll love this video. If you have any taste at all, you'll run screaming.

I am 3 corks shy of having enough to start the project, but will report back later when it's complete.My only complaint, and it's very minor and not really the fault of the trivet (trivet!) is that it's a bit larger than I expected. it's 9x11 - where as I think it would work better if it was a bit smaller.. maybe 6x6. Just being nit-picky. They probably make a smaller trivet (trivet!) and I overlooked it.We love to put hot things on it. Sometimes I just make large pots of hot water so I can put them on the trivet (trivet!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice product, but strange size","review":"The products (I ordered 2) arrived on the last day of the range of days given for delivery. I was just glad to have it in time to give for a gift. We set about putting the corks in together - both trivets were in good shape and exactly the same size. The problem is that the corks do not fit as they look in the picture. We will have to cut corks in half horizontally so that there isn't a big gap on one side of the trivit. It's hard to explain, it's just turning out to be a little more difficult than I thought it would be and won't look as \\"clean\\" as the picture, but all in all, I'm excited."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too large","review":"Love the product itself.

During a recent trip to Italy, I got the idea from a local restaurant to save our wine corks. The corks were displayed in an oversized glass when we returned home, but they just seemed to be taking up space. With the Wine Cork Trivet, they serve a valuable purpose whenever we entertain and it's also easy to see the many different types of wines.

I would add to him that this book does not refect China in the least. For example, the author refers to the \\"best hotel in Shanghai\\" as being Jing Jiang, whatever that is (the best is the Portman Ritz Carlton and has been for years). Despite what the author says, one would never find \\"100 cigarette butts and 3 used condoms\\" under the bed of the finest hotel in Shanghai, nor would a \\"Room Boy\\" enter without knocking every 5 minutes.This entire book says nothing about China today, so with a weak plot, silly characters, British words in the mouths of Americans, there is really no reason to waste time on it, like I unfortunately did."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Parenting Books Out There","review":"This is probably the best parenting book I've ever read, and I've read a lot of them.

The Sweet's give you steps and tips to achieve this goal especially when you're feeling overwhelmed with everything \\"out there\\" that can get in the way of your parenting plan.I just hope they can put together an audio book so I can get my husband, a non-reader, to \\"read\\" it.I've only read the book once so far, but plan to read it again, and again when I need some help."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of the series.","review":"I've read all of the Joe Gunther mysteries except for Occam's Razor and The Skeleton's Knee. This one if my favorite. It is the most tense and fastest paced out of the bunch. It is also very eerie in that we don't know or see the criminals except when they strike at one part of the state or the other. We only hear sketchy details about the criminal's lives as Joe's squadron does their research and deduction. The criminals in this case are Asian gang kingpins. Since we don't see them at work, we are spared stereotypes or other such gaffes. Instead, we get to sense the frustration that goes into investigating highly mobile, nationally networked, very sub-rosa criminals. Despite all the investigations, the story moves very fast. My only complaint is the ending is not satisfactory - it's almost comic bookish given the dose of reality throughout the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Characters","review":"There were too many characters to keep track of. I could not keep track of who was who. Archer Mayor is a good author but this one disappointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Master Artist With Words","review":"All of Archer Mayor's books have a gripping story line. Although the stories are first class, the pictures drawn with words as the story unfolds are the best that I have ever encountered. The magnificent metaphors can create, in less than one sentence, images that may take other authors pages. Although each book is independent in and of itself, I enjoy reading the stories in sequence. There is a steady progression in character development and interpersonal relationships as we go from story to story.If you are a mystery fan, I am sure that you will enjoy the entire series as much as I have. If you are a student taking a course in creative writing, I don't think that you will find a better word artist than Archer Mayor."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written","review":"Good plot and continuing good character development tightly written. Joe Gunther is a likeable and believable character. Rural New England setting gives a glimpse of that part of our country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Have enjoyed the series, until now. This book was not good - Gunther's hometown Brattleboro finds itself in the middle of an Asian gang takeover. The close knit community will not talk to the police and any ability to stop the violence seems remote. Some inquiries to other departments finds an increase in Asian gang activity across the state.Joe and Les Spinney (from a previous book) become US Marshalls forming a task force of federal, state and local jurisdictions. But the book doesn't work - on any level. The writing is frustratingly dull, the characters are hard to keep track of and no one would care about them. The story is just not interesting.I finished the book because I find the series interesting and did not want to miss any bridge material to the next installment. If the series continues this way, I will not continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating writing style","review":"Disappointing, Long winded, disjointed script. Reduce the excessively long description of the geographical areas visited by Gunther and the book would be about a quarter of its size.In book # 5 of the Gunther series \\"The Fruit of the Poisonous Tree\\" it seemed that Archer Mayor was running out of ideas and this book reinforces my view. In previous books I liked the simplicity and uncomplicated style of the writing that, while there was plenty of embellishment, still allowed the plot to come through. This is not a book that can be read every night before retiring without losing the story line but rather it has to be read in one or two sessions. Unfortunately the general story line is not gripping enough for that.I cannot award even one star to this book.With so many books in the series I may try one more in the hope that Mayor's style improves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Archer Mayor as usual","review":"I have read any number of the Joe Gunther series and have enjoyed them all.

The video itself is muddy. The menus are extremely sub par (no 'Play All' and so on), many skips and break ups and so on... For the price you would think it would on a technical level be as good as the tapes but it barely is. It is sad that companies KNOW people are going to buy it anyway, so they half-ass it anyway (farscape series dvds comes to mind)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Buffy, but video quality is poor.","review":"I'll let everyone else point out how great this series (and DVD) is, and then I'll agree with them. But there's one thing you should know before you buy the U.S. release: the quality of the video is not what you've come to expect from DVD. There are a lot of DVD video artifacts: grainy picture, slightly posterized color, ghosted and haloed objects, indistinct dark scenes, and jittery image detail.And as if poor encoding wasn't enough, one of the discs was physically defective! It locked up in two different players, and upon visual inspection, it looked as though the layers of the disc were improperly bonded.I'm exchanging this set, in the hopes that this its replacement won't have this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing ever!!... Changed My Life","review":"this is the best t show ever watch im pretty sure I've watched every episode at least three times in the past 6 months.. and i mean every episode of Buffy all together..So my favorite episode is probably the Nightmares episode. This deals with all of the Scoobie gangs nightmares and how the deal with them, Xander's being showing up to class in only his underwear. While this episode is funny, it lets us take an inside look into the characters we know and love. one of the best episodes in my opinion.My second favorite has got to be out of mind,out of sight dealing with mysterious happening s revolving around Cordelia and her group. it lets Buffy and Cordelia work together, and lets us see wht this \\"ghost\\" is feeling and why this hashappened to her.overall this is a great season and is a great watch for anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start to a very addictive TV show!","review":"I was 12 when I first saw buffy and wasn't impressed because I hated any show on WB like 7th Heaven and Dawson's Creek.Fast forward 5 years later, I kept hearing how great Buffy was and people kept encouraging me to watch it again. I bought the DVD set and I was immediately impressed!The show may be very campy for the genre they are tackling but what it lacked of budget went into the writing and castingThis show does something that is very hard with any shows on: It made a otherwise more scary genre seem funny, cool, sad, and entertainingI suggest watching the episode \\"prophecy Girl\\" It's by far the best episode of that season and set-up every other season finale for the show.This is definitely a great season, but season 2 and the rest build upon the foundation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Buffy!","review":"I loved to watch Buffy in high school and I recently purchased this and found it just as enjoyable!

And believe me, they just get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The show is five-stars, the DVD is awful!","review":"I agree how great a show this is. My problem is with the poor quality of the DVD and its features: the video quality is just grainy, the sound is mediocre, and the extras are shallow. For a show with a dedicated fan base I would expect, first of all, top-rate video quality followed by commentary on each episode, outtakes, screen tests, etc. It just seems like more money was put into the packaging and the marketing than the quality contained on the DVDs.For the next seasons' release, I'll wait and see what the fan reaction to the quality and content is before laying my money down."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY A DIFFERENT SET","review":"Great show, terrible quality on this DVD.

This is a great season but not my favorite, 6 was my personal fave. But this one rocked to! Buffy came to sunnydale, hoping not to come across vamps and other forces of darkness wen she meets Giles, her watcher. And she meets Willow and Xander, who becomes her new best friends. along the way they find out shes the Slayer and help her out. Buffy finally meets the love of her dreams...

Buffy is just a teen wh*re who is put in the shoes of a superhero and does it horribly. Every character on this show is sarcastic and annoying and they're all the same, plus they all fight the same corny way, even the mindless zombies in that one episode. Anyone who likes this pathetic show should be slain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, nice , nice","review":"The beginning of one of the best shows on television right now. This is where it began.It's fun to watch the Scooby gang bumble around, not only trying to figure out what evil lurks behind every corner but to watch SMG, Alyson, Brendan, etc... try and find their characters. You get a taste though of the great dialogue to come and the Bittersweetness of knowing where these characters will be in 5 years.Makes sure and turn on Joss Whedon's great commentary. The comments that got me where the whole Xander vs. the Skateboard thing.A great Collection. to bad it's going to be June/July before we see another set. It's also sad it took so long to get released here. UK fans have had this set for months already. Anyway, it's worth every nickel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start...","review":"The first season of Buffy was definitely an exercise in bringing Buffy into her own. If you pay attention, a great deal changes with nearly every character between episode 1 and episode 12. Buffy starts off a little more airhead-y (and closer to the big screen Buffy) but she eventually moves towards the quick-witted punning slayer we've come to know. Angel starts out a little more cocky than you may remember - and a little less soulful. Its a good thing that Joss Whedon decided to make Angel a bit more sensitive than he started out, otherwise I'm not sure the Buffy-Angel romance would have worked. The differences in Xander and Willow are a bit less striking, but they're there. Buffy is a great show. It started off as a great show and only got better from there. Highlights of the first season include Xander turning into a hyena (one of my personal favorites) and Buffy's first death at the hands of the Master."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Awesome Start to an Awesome Series!","review":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer:Season One is only 12 episodes, but just those 12 episodes blow you away! Joss Whedon has created an awesome series in Buffy, and this is one of the best of the seasons! This season includes knockout episodes like \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\", \\"The Witch\\" and \\"Angel\\". Buffy:Season One is a MUST for all true Buffy fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy","review":"I loved this show when it was on television.

I even go to sleep with them playing on my TV and when I wake up in the morning I start watching them again. I just love all of the episode's and extra features. It rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my god... I got this early and...","review":"I had to go to class. I came back to my dorm room and sat down and watched it. The clarity and color on the DVD set is amazing! Region 1 doesn't have the problem as the other regions. Plus, Joss Whedon's commentary is not only funny but enlightening! There are soo many things that you learn that are not anywhere on the 'net! Plus, there's a little insert that tells you Season 2 (a 6 DVD set) is coming out June 2002! I can't wait for Season 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start.","review":"With \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", you need to place things in perspective. I watched as many episodes as time would allow at each sitting and always seemed to be wanting more. Even after watching the whole set, I want to see what happens next.\\"Buffy\\" is all about growing up. Though the stories are very fantastic(as in Science Fiction/Fantasy), the issues dealt with are very real. From peer-pressure to dating to parent/child relationships, this is a very interesting view of teen life.All good fiction is really brought about by the relationships explored, and though there are a certain number of internal inconsistencies (What year was the lead character born? What class is she in? etc.) the first season is very good fiction.If there is a weakness in the set, it is the extras. I didn't look for easter eggs, but the extras gave very little information and I found Mr. Whedon's commentaries added very little, if anything, to the set's overall value."},{"rating":"2","title":"More commentary!!!","review":"Obviously, the episodes are wonderful. I wouldn't have ordered this DVD set if they weren't. But after being \\"spoiled\\" by Joss Whedon's commentary on the first 2 episodes, I could barely watch the rest. His behind-the-scenes stories were wonderful! Hopefully the next set will feature even more of these commentaries.Now, if we can just get to seasons 3 & 4, where the series really shone. I can't wait!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"buffy;season one rocks","review":"It was exciting seeing sarah do her thing at such a much younger age for the begining of such a terrifying series with''the master'' to contend with-it was fun owning the dvd collection,the production quality is excellent you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"I hear lots of complaints about the picture quality, these are good quality dvd's, yes it could be better, but given it was shot on 16mm, its a very good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"cuts mar the feel","review":"The show is great and having all the first season episodes in one place is even better. Unfortunately, if I could have taped all the episodes myself and edited out the commercials, I would have the same thing. There is no fluidity. The cuts where commercials would be does not enhance the watching experience. This would be much more worth the time and money if these were the uncut first episodes. I still can't wait till June to get Season 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this as good as it gets?","review":"Being very late to the DVD game, I wanted to be choosy about my first purchases. I wanted to repay the \\"Buffy\\" crew for years of great TV, and made Season One my first DVD(s).The show was broadcast on a grainy UHF station, and I thought I would be thrilled by the qualiity picture. Well, I was stunned alright.I now miss that grainy picture I was used to. At least the \\"fuzz\\" moves with the characters. On this DVD it just lingers there, distracting me, slightly, from the action.And the shadows are a little cartoonish looking.Unless I read very convincing reviews praising the picture quality of later seasons' DVD's, I'll wait a few years to buy any more of this series, when digital transfer technology has improved. I assume \\"Angel\\" DVD's will be similar.From now on, I'll only read professional reviews, like Sound & Vision magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Episodes Are Great, Extras Aren't","review":"I love this show, and was thrilled when they began putting the seasons on DVD, but there is a HUGE problem. I can't get to any of the extras on the DVD, like photos and scripts. I have the correct button on my DVD remote, but when I push it, I get a black circle with a line through it on the screen. It doesn't work. Same goes for Season 2 DVDs, and the same thing happened with \\"Angel,\\" Season 1. This is a HUGE technical problem, one which I wrote to the company about, but got no response. For shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST SHOW ON TV!

And you just gotta' keep buying stuff like this. Coming from the father of a family who all watch buffy together (now there's got to be some sort of generation gap fixer here),this is a great buy...even without the extras. I gotta say I've owned all of first series and second series on DVD for quiet some time now and sure season two is better but season one is magical- and you can tell your at the beginning of something big!And some news to make you weep...in three weeks I'll be going to buy all of season three on DVD ('cause thats when it comes out in Australia).Lets all hope nothing stupid happens to the show with the big network move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy and Slim Set: what could be better?","review":"It probably goes without saying that anyone buying a Buffy DVD has a quirky sense of humor, and a love of adventure tales. For me, it was one of the best tv series ever created and had the best final episode of any show.What i want to mention are the slim set packs. They are marvelous. Not only do they take up less room and use fewer resources, but they prevent the DVDs from sliding around much if they become dislodged in shipping so they don't get scratched. I love DVDs but it is annoying that the larger packaging provides no protection for sliding DVDs, so I have to figure that someone associated with Buffy made yet another great choice, this one not about scripting, casting, or action choreography, but about the mundane but so important aspect of how to box the DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show, DVD a huge disappointment","review":"This review is not about the show itself which, on its own merits, deserves five stars. However, the reason I purchased the DVD was because I expected the picture and sound quality to be excellent, or at least an improvement on the TV broadcast.Imagine my disappointment when I found the picture to be grainy and pixellated - like a poorly ripped, low bitrate MPEG - and the sound, muffled and flat. To add insult to injury, the picture and sound quality of the (non-Buffy-related) Fox advert at the beginning of disc three was, in stark contrast, outstanding.It is disrespectful, and a disservice to the loyal fans of such a first-rate show, for Fox to release such an embarrassingly mediocre product (and, frankly, a shameless cash-in).I don't know if the original, more expensive, DVD release is any better, but I would advise anyone thinking of buying the new release to look elsewhere, including VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy - Coming of Age","review":"The story of Buffy is basically teenage girl coming of age and having to deal with her divorced parents, a new high school, making friends and oh yeah vampires. In all the shows you have that sci-fi element but if you look closer you see there is an underlining story that you need to pay attention to. In one of the shows you see the importance of a good mother daughter relationship and long before high school violence became broadcast news Buffy was trying to show us how important it is to not treat people like they are invisible. Buffy is a great show that just can't be defined. One minute you fear for Buffy's life and the next you are laughing. If you haven't gotten into Buffy yet then there is nothing better than starting at the beginning! I'm sure that the quality of the show will make you a die hard Buffy fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!","review":"I am a major Buffy fan, so this was a must for me. The only thing that I was disappointed in was that it didn't have very many extra features for a DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must Buy","review":"For anyone interested in Finding out just what BTVS is All about they should get the First Season DVDs. To be able to go back to the first season and watch all the old episodes and see where it all begins is a great joy. Plus knowing what happens to each character after the first season makes each episode funnier and more enjoyable. I definitely recommend getting the First season DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Can Compare To Buffy","review":"This is a great buy for any die hard fan or newbie who wants to join in watching the world's greatest show. Many people cannot get past the corny title, and don't give it a chance, but Buffy is the best drama/comedy/horror show out there. The material is funny and deep at the same time. Each episode/demon metaphorically represents a problem teenagers sometimes face. From parents who try to relive their own lives through you \\"the witch,\\" to being attracted to a teacher \\"teacher's pet,\\" and feeling completely alone- whether you are surrounded by people orno one knows you exist, \\"out of mind, out of sight.\\" i highly recommend this show to EVERYONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy Season 1","review":"This is a must have if you love Buffy. This picks up where the movie left off. It also introduces everyone so you get to see how everyone came to know that Buffy was the Slayer. The only down point was that the budget was kinda low so there are some really cheesy moments. But other than that it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's True It's Finall Here !","review":"Finally the box set we've all been waiting for.I think thatthis first season set the standard for the rest of the seasons to come.This first season deals with everything with vampires tohyenas.Plus you get episodes that aren't on the vhs version which only contains 6 episodes for the 1st 3 seasons.Buffy has been the best show on t.v. for 5 years and still going.Every year Joss Whedon has fresh new ideas to make this show so great.If you're a first time Buffy fan you have to get this DVDset.It's the best!I just can't wait for the next seasons to come out.Hope that'll be soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Buffy","review":"Most fellow fans probably wouldn't agree, but to me the First Season of Buffy is the greatest. Don't be fooled by the lack of \\"depth\\" in comparison to latter seasons: season one's light-hearted wittiness was Buffy's greatest charm. And season one has plenty of depth and darkness - Gellar's \\"I'm sixteen years old, I don't want to die\\" speech in \\"Prophecy Girl\\" is one of the most emotional moments in the show. The bubble-gum coating - the \\"campiness\\" - makes Season One all the better.I'm a fan of the earlier seasons (1-3), so Season One may not appeal to those who prefer the latter seasons. Still, I recommend this to any Buffy fan, or anyone who loves their dramas offbeat and witty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show, Poor Quality DVD","review":"It's Buffy, so the show is great. However, the DVD is not very sharp. It's more like VHS quality. Also, the sound transfer for the dialog is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Series","review":"I bought this several years ago, and this review reminder popped up at the perfect time! I am currently rewatching the series with my daughters, and they LOVE it! I was sure they would, but didn't realize just how much they would get attached to the characters. I remember watching this on tv in middle and high school, and not being able to get enough. This series has a great \\"girl power\\" theme, and is SO MUCH BETTER than some of the vampire trash that's out now! THIS is how vampires are supposed to be...not sparkly and stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CANCELED SHOWS FIRST DISMAL SEASON","review":"Put this show on any real network and it would have been canceled after the first few episodes. The fact it wasnt was the only reason it lasted. THe network had nothing else to put on so it kept this terrible thing. The network eventually got tired of it being so bad and canceled it. Then another network did the same thing. When its bad it bad. Thats the truth and the fact of it all. Cancelled because it was soooo bad ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible season","review":"Worst season of the series, followed by season 4. Horrible dialog, horrible acting, horrible plot. Everything is so generic, and cliche, it's unreal. Cordelia's character cannot be popilar in real world, she is just too abnoxious and superficial. Xander is plane annoying from start to finish at the end of season 7. However Willow is adorable and Giles is hot. Buffy's character is not a hero type at all. Sarah Michelle Gellar was obviously very wrong for this role, Faith's character later in the series is much more believable than hers. All of her fighting moves are awkward, and her lines are cliche, she just doesn't stike you as a vampire slayer. She is too little and too cheerleader type for this role. But of course she has to defeat the main villain with superhuman strength and magic who's been planning the apocalypse throughout the entire season in 3 minutes and still be on time for a high school dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible show and a even worse beginning","review":"This show was canceled Twice. Enough said about how awful it was. Then they put the pathetic show on even more patheric discs.The quality is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst season ever","review":"I am a HUGE Buffy fan, but I hated this season. I am a Spuffy fan, and there was no Spike. Even if I wasn't a Spike or Spuffy fan, though, I still would have hated this season. There was hardly any continuing plot, except for the short scenes with Angel, leading up to their two kisses. It was very boring, with another random theme each episode, and I would have to say the only episode I liked was \\"Prophecy Girl\\". If you want to watch this season, order it from the library or buy it used, but don't waste good money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy Rocks","review":"This is such a great season and I love BTVS. Such a great show. It has plenty of action and some very shocking scenes. Buffy is a unique show and it makes you start caring for the characters right away. Giles truly needs to get his act in order. Buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure that she is on your side.","review":"Well, I am not a 'die hard' fan of Buffy, but close. I wasn't introduced to the show until the second season, so I bought the first season to see what I missed.It makes things in later seasons make more sense when the characters are making past references. :) The plots are good, my only gripe is that it doesn't have all of my favorite characters during the first season. But it certainly makes a great intro to the second season (which I hope they release soon).All in all it was pretty darn good for being a first season. I gave it 4 stars because I enjoyed it. You don't get much other than the 12 episodes though. There isn't too many extras on it.. so don't get your heart set on that. They have a few scripts from episodes though.It's a must have for you Buffy Fans. So get it while it's hot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Five star show, one star DVD","review":"I too was unlucky enough to receive a defective set. The third disk is completely unwatchable--it will not run for more than five minutes without skipping or freezing. I've asked around and found that several people have had similar problems and that it is a manufacturing error. Fox needs to fix this NOW. I have taped the entire series run and still, I would gladly buy every DVD set they release for the higher quality and durability. If I'm going to keep getting poor quality products, however, I'm not going to bother.Also, there are typos in the cast/character bios. It doesn't feel like a lot of effort went into creating this product. Which is a shame, since to show is so fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong beginning.","review":"While the episodes range from fun camp to just plain cheese, the first season of BTVS was a great setup for the greatness that would come.Storylines range from evil robots to hyena people to serious storylines like the growing relationship between Buffy and Angel that would set up the fantastic second season.While corny at times, every episode is pure fun to watch and the Scooby Gang are as loveable as ever.The greatness was yet to come, but this was a strong opening act to the stories that were to come on Buffy.Buy it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change the way people looked at Tv","review":"Season One of Buffy captured the interest of its viewer within the first few episodes.

These rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer- the Complete First Season on DVD","review":"This is a must for all Buffy fans!! Even if you are not a fan yet, if you buy this I guarantee you will get hooked. It's addicting and once I finsished all the episodes I was anxious to get my hands on the second one. It's the beginning of a phenominal series that which has now lasted 6 seasons. Joss Whedon's remarkable and creative ideas are at work in this great thrilling expreience of the dark forces and the unknown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off to a great start","review":"Many folks don't highly rate this season. I can understand why - the production values aren't quite there yet, the fight scenes are all staged in the dark, and the music sounds like it comes from a Casio keyboard - but the characters and the basic premise are intact, and there are a lot of fun episodes along the way. Plus, much setup happens here for later seasons.Important / great episodes: Welcome to the Hellmouth / The Harvest (2-part pilot); The Witch; Angel; Puppet Show; Nightmares; Out of Sight, Out of Mind; and Prophecy Girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"The first season brings back a lot of memories--I remember watching it when it first came out on TV. ^-^ Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The TV Show to trump alll TV shows.","review":"Buffy is amazing TV. Period. Regardless of how you feel about supernatural subjects, this show transcends it all and creates a new culture. It has shaped an entire generation and continues to do so today. Why? There's witty banter, friendship, and characters you actually care about. Did I mention witty banter? Go watch. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer; The first season","review":"Buffy is one of the best series on television today. It incorporates the normalicy of everyday life where everything is not black and white, The creator Joss has put together a very good series. It is the classic good vs. evil but with exceptional writing and acting. The only bad thing about the cd collection is that you are not able to play all the episodes on the cd at one time. You can only watch one episode then you have to select another episode on disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy too dark","review":"I am a BtVS fanatic so when I heard that the first season was going to be released on DVD I was ecstatic. All of the episodes were as awesome as I remembered and the ones that I hadn't seen yet were exciting. So why did I give it only four stars? Some scences at night were shot so badly that you can practically not even see what's going on. It was never like that in the later seasons and I don't remember having it happen in this season when it was on TV. I don't know if it was just shot this way or what. But basically that's the only problem with this DVD so I recommend that if you are a fan of the show to pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For Buffy Fans","review":"I haven't seen the first season of Buffy untill I got it on DVD but this is a great thing to add to your Buffy collection if you have one.

It has great episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great show","review":"'Buffy' is one of those shows that I like and would watch casually, but knew that I wouldn't really get into it until they started showing reruns. Although it isn't as good as later seasons, I was able to get a friend interested in the show with these episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Buffy season","review":"If you're new to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, don't mind this season. It has a lot of unconnected and unnecessary monster-of-the-week episodes that you just want them to end. A lot of people think BtVS is a horrible show after watching this season. Only important episodes are, Welcome to the Hellmouth, The Harvest, Angel and Prophecy Girl. Also, Witch introduces the character Amy and I Robot... You Jane introduces Jenny so you need to watch them to. But know that, this series is a lot better than this. 5.5/10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the dream of the collective.","review":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer, has transformed the conventional hero myth from a depiction of a brawny, dominating loner to a more complex portrayal of a discerning and developing champion of the people. The popularity of certain mythic images and stories imparted by television signifies collective tendencies and needs. Female superhero images in media provide a heroic portrayal of women and herald the recognition of expressions and contributions of femininity. In addition this television series is a modern myth that portrays the development of and relationships to powerful femininity.Having said that--in addition this series is a lot of fun and enjoyable to watch!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful DVD Set","review":"This set is a must for anyone who wants to get into the amazing show that is Buffy The Vampire Slayer. This is where it all started. The triangle relationships, the high school on a hellmouth. It's funny, it's quirky, it's about friendship and about growing up. The stage of the hellmouth proves very effective. The Scooby gang is wonderful, espiecally Sarah Michelle Geller and Allyson Hannigan. The group is wonderful. The set is especially great for setting up the wonderful second season.Great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"What can I say?

By the way, the season 2 DVDs feature a cooler menu system and more extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overlooked show!","review":"Got the first season on dvd when it came out, but only recently got around to watching it. Me and my wife were pleasantly suprised at the quality of this show. I had seen the movie and maybe one or two episodes but we got through the first season within a week and are now currently enjoying the spectacular second season.Great packaging and price. Good video/audio quality and some pretty neat special features. I liked Joss Whedons commentary on the first two episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yea, the show is old. Get over it.","review":"It looks like an old grainy vhs tape, but I think that's what they had to work with back then. Great show, and this is the founding season which picks up after the old movie. If you are a true fan, you won't pay any mind. It's kinda like watching an old black and white movie. After a wile, you don't even realize that it is not in color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Joss Whedon...you are truly great","review":"It's been years since I watched this show and I have to say that it is, even years later, very fun and witty. With all the reality nonsense that is on television, you owe it to yourself to take some time to watch this creative offering. As an adult watching the show, there are some deep concepts that I completely missed as a teen. For a show that was geared to teens, Whedon did not sacrifice dialogue. For girls that are teenagers now, I think Buffy's portrayl as a strong woman is inspiring. If you just don't think you can stand watching a show about a bunch of kids contending with high school and demons, vampires, and witches, another great option created by Whedon is Firefly. You can find the first episode here:Serenity [HD]"},{"rating":"2","title":"About darn time.....","review":"It's about time that the Buffy fans in the US have a chance to own this DVD set. I just recieved mine today in the mail ... and am thorougly satisfied. The quality is excellent and the way it is packaged is great too. And best yet, Season 2 comes out in June 2002! But for any fan out there, even those who may own the Season 1 VHS set, this is a must buy. Mainly cause it is the ENTIRE first season. Anyway, if you are even the tinyest bit a Buffy fan, then you must order this now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Series to Watch","review":"Buffy is a great heroine who gives somewhat of a cheery prospect to this series. She's funny, and at times, sarcastic. Which makes the series not only a drama, but a comedy. Williow is the shy bookworm, who is Buffy's best friend. Xander loves Buffy, and shows it frequently throughout the first series. Giles is the mysterious librarian-who is also Buffy's Watcher. Angel is Buffy's love, who has secrets of his own. This is a series which I try to watch religiously. I reccomend it to everyone, no matter how old or young, for this is a spectacluar series.P.S.-the DVD is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy is the greatest slayer!","review":"This show is so well done, campy and full of style, we started with season 1 and will watch all of the seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this show go beyond this ?","review":"This show is awful.

Now thats a fact that speaks volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buffy The Vampire Slayer: Season 1","review":"The TV show itself is amazing...and I was quite excited to buy the first season. Only to find out that \\"Very Good\\" quality actually means pretty beat up box set and that \\"All three discs of season one\\" means you will be getting disc two and two copies of disc three..meaning no disc one. Luckily I was refunded...and they were very courtesy and I received my money back very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too corny for me to ignore","review":"I find this show to be fairly good in total, but I find the first season to be absolutely awful. I only find a couple of the episodes to be not so bad, but the rest are simply horrendous. Not only do they have poor stories and directing, but they also can't even make a descent fight scene. Season 1 has almost nothing going for it. I just find it miraculous that after this the program was given a second season, which is a good thing since they managed to pull it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUFFY-SO NOT THE PART","review":"As annoying as I find Sarah Michelle Gellar (like she could really fight vampires with her cheap kicks, that's why she died so fast in Scream 2) I believe this is a good show. Season 1,3 and 4 were all great, but I'm just not a hyper fanatic of the series like some fans, I do like it alot, however. The show has fights, drama, cat fights, jokes (tacky ones) and great season finales. Season 1 is definately worth the price tag-12 great episodes! It was a mid-season replacement which is why there aren't 22 episodes like most others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A buffy addict's dream come true","review":"I admit it, I'm addicted to Buffy the Vampire Slayer series. The first season on DVD does not disappoint. The 3 disc set comes in a nice sturdy folding case along with a guide that briefly describes each episode. According to a small card that comes with the DVD set, the second season is expected to be out June 2002. If you enjoy Buffy the Vampire Slayer series this DVD collection is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gift of description","review":"Girardi has an uncanny knack for creating time and place and truly delivering a reader there. The Venice that he describes in this novel is eerie, damp, and timeless. It is the Venice of 1,000 years ago and the Venice of today. He evokes the longing and the lustiness that such a beautiful and mysterious place can bring and weaves a passionate and sensual love story that compells you to read on. The main character in the novel is certainly one with whom we can oddly enough all sympathize with and one that we are eager to follow.

Jack is forced to reevaluate his life, in the long run for the better. You also realize differences in culture when he goes to visit his father in Arizona. He realizes Arizona has no real past, Venice lives in it. The book ends with Jack being a much better rounded person. This isn't to say there were problems. 1. Predictable story with Caterina. He describes her and her crowd as pale. When she wont see him in daylight, you think vampire. (Then again, nothing was mentioned about fangs, biting and stakes through the heart). 2. After all, the whole thing could have been a hallucination. Like seeing the Vaparetto 13 (which wasn't there). Maybe it was all meant to teach him a lesson, like Scrooge in Christmas Carol.

I enjoy random events in movies (The Lost Highway for example), but this movie was random half the time, and the other half it tried to tell a story.

The first side I made the mistake of removing the tool before inserting the extra spacer and putting in the new bushing. This tool will bend your trailing arm enough that the tool will not go on the same trailing arm bushing very easily at all. Once knowing this it went better on the other side.

Roger Reynolds \\"Mind Models\\" from the 70s generates more excitement and shows more relevance to today's scene than Rochberg's stuffy, self-referential musings. This book is destined to collect dust at university libraries, only to be read by those who want to read something that confirms their views, as evidenced by William Bolcom's introduction.If you must read, ask yourself this question: On what basis should we take Rochberg seriously?

The image featured here does not really do justice to this product.I recently bought (rather got it as a gift from my wife) a 60 GB IPOD photo, and was looking for a good case to protect this rather expensive gift. After doing my research on the internet, I settled on this one, although the only concern I had was about the looks. The images on the internet made the IPOD look ugly! I guess the protection factor outweighed the looks, so I got this anyway and I am glad that I did! The IPOD does look a little bulkier, however, this case does not look as bad as it is shown in the images. In fact the ipod looks better, not to mention the excellent protection it provides.If you want to protect your investment, I would suggest you go for this product.

I wear my Ipod when I work in my yard and I liked having a thick rubber case for protection. My current case had yellowed and the clip had begun to rust. However, although the new case was the same thick rubber as I was accustomed to, the case was not the same. The window opening for the screen was too small. Also, the cover for the wheel looked silly and would get in the way during normal use - it would have to be opened any time you want to use the wheel. That's not very functional when your Ipod is clipped to your waist. Since I got a good price and I would have to pay for shipping if I returned the case, I decided to use the new clip to replace the rusted one on my old case and threw the rest of the new case in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I put this cover on immediately after I opened my iPod after reading how easy they are to scratch.

I found that the upright position is a little too upright (and not easy for a little one to fall asleep and stay asleep). This may be typical of a booster (I can't compare - this was our first). However, once we figured out how to get it safely and comfortably in the reclined position, we were much happier w/it. The cup holders are a bit stiff, making it very difficult for my son (and myself) to open and close as needed.

This seat was such a great relief. We took our first long car ride - 4 hours and he loved it! The head rest held his head while he slept, the arm rest was at just the perfect height, and the mesh seating was ultra cool, no sweaty bottom! The cup holders are the same as the backless version and easily tuck away when not in use. He never once complained about being uncomfortable in this seat. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a booster that can be used on long car rides. The bonus was that it reclines if the seat it sits in reclines.

One race is highly psionic, the other is terribly close-minded. One is golden-skinned, the other pale. One is a free-thinking society, the other rules by a strict and secretive nobility. The female protagonist, having witnessed her parents' horrible death at a tender age, is unleashed as a psionic secret-agent against the other side, where she wanders throughout the universe looking for a mate who can survive her mental and physical powers.

The best I can probably do is elaborate a bit more on the similarities of these two novels-(In Conquest Born & Dune). One of the most powerful similarities is the sense of history that both authors create in their novels. This sense of history and tradition is what directs the events and shapes the destiny of the two races involved-the Braxi and the Azea. The two main characters are also shaped by their histories, and Ms. Friedman uses their history to add depth and complexity to their actions.

If you are not a fan of the synth sound, then what are you even doing listening to a band consisting of only two people and a bunch of keyboards! Their song writing prowess in my opinion was unmatched at the time and has been a large factor in their longevity. The way they matched the vocals to the complexities in their programming is pure genius and I have been absolutely inspired by their ingenuity. Keyboard was the best medium for their music. I just dont picture the songs having the depth that they did in a rock atmosphere. It is too bad Rob Fisher passed away; I think in today's music arena, he would have blown everyone away. Some of my favorite songs are: No Flowers Please, Emotion in Motion, Burning Bridges, Promises Promises, and A Very Hard Act to Follow (which unfortunately is not included on this album)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"This is prime Byrds material. It is only fair, in my opinion, to judge this work in view of the fact that it was produced in 1966. But that being said, I think it can for the most part stand alongside music released several years later by other groups such as Crosby's later collaboration: CSNY. Sure, CSNY had tighter harmonies and more overall sophistication, but the difference between CSNY and The Byrds here is not all that huge. Core to this album is the amazing triplet of songs: Eight Miles High, Hey Joe, and Captain Soul. Eight Miles High is solid. Crosby puts forward piercing, emotional vocals on Hey Joe.

American Dad has really tried to make itself a bit better as it grows, and this season shows it. I'm not going to argue that its shakespeare, or the best comedy going, but I give credit where credit is due. This volume made me laugh constantly, and unlike most american dad episodes, they didn't feel quite so disposable. If you're a fan of american dad, its a no brainer, get it, you'll love it.

The only shows that I really like to watch any more on FOX was Futurama and it was canceled and then there was King of the Hill and it is being canceled. Oh well, after I stop watching American Dad I will stop watching FOX altogether. Which is not such a bad thing? Almost all shows on FOX are garbage anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solar Mate Centurion is hit and miss","review":"I bought 3 of these units. The motion detection sensor is not very effective and I would classify this unit as a utility light and certainly not a security light. Of the three I bought, 1 failed within one month.Update: It would be almost impossible to NOT correctly to set up this light. This light is junk, the battery needs a good 10 hour , strong sunlit area to work. If you live in the desert, this might work for you. I even sacrificed one light to bind two of ther solar panels together trying to get enough power for the battery to be operational. Very limited improvement.Do your self a favor and pass on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blind as a bat - horrible product","review":"I bought this product a few days ago to put up in my back yard. Setup was easy and the unit appeared to work in 'test' mode by waving my hand in front of it. Left it for a couple days and tried another motion test. NOTHING!!! This unit appeared to be dead. I set the sensitivity to 'Max' and still NOTHING!! It couldn't have detected a Mac truck in my back yard. I recharged it and still nothing. I took it down in frustration and sent it back. In my experience with this product, its not worth the money and aggreviation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I bought two of these lights. Charged them as instructed. Easy to install. After two days one unit was completely dead. I tried charging it again. It held the charge for about 1 day and then it was dead again. Contacted the company's customer service and had to buy a new battery. It still wouldn't hold a charge. Threw it in the trash. Horrible product and would not recommend. The second unit still works, but just barely and it buzzes real loud. Buy the Zenith solar unit instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try but needs to sense motion all the time!","review":"We bought this as a simple solution to provide lighting in an trash can area around our home so we weren't too concerned about its appearance. Thinking that solar might be a good idea, we thought it was worth a go. The item is pretty easy to install. You basically charge the battery overnight and then go about finding a place to screw it into the wall. It worked fine for about a week or so and then nothing. We recharged the battery out of concern that perhaps there was not enough sunlight and tested the light successfully but when it comes time to detecting motion, the thing is blind as a bat now. Not worth the money, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is not waterproof & Solar Masters does not care","review":"I bought two of these outdoor lights, took them by plane to my place in Chile, and put them outdoors to charge for three days before testing, as per the directions. One of them was fried before I started to use it and the other stays on constantly unless you manually turn it off due to water entering the electronics. I called the manufacturer and told them what had happened, even offering to pay for new sealed electronics units, since the light and battery and sensor portions were still fine. They refused to help me, saying that the parts were made in Malaysia and they couldn't get just the electronics module and that my warranty was expired. So, I am out $200 plus shipping charges to Chile, and now I need to buy and install another product. Everyone should know not to buy Solar Masters' products."},{"rating":"1","title":"how long will it work?","review":"The product worked somewhat as advertised at first but work rarely now. I charged the light as intructed and mounted. I had problems with the testing but it seemed to work so I left it now I don't think I can do anything except trash it. The warranty is 30 days from the manufacturer. I'm waiting to hear from them but don't expect much... I would not buy this. I also agree the light is pretty dim, but if in a dark secluded area it would be OK, only if it worked....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't last a year.","review":"I bought six Solar Centurians to place around my garden in an attempt to keep deer from eating everything.They one by one started failing after two months.

It took them forever to send the replacement. Got it and it worked well for a few weeks. Now the motion sensor work only when it feels like or it comes on and instantly goes dull and starts a struggling sireen sound, even though the sireen is off. The motion sensor is the worst part of this device and there seem not to be a replacement just for the motion sensor portion of the device. Customer service is not good from this company either.

It was as if I were the main character transported back in time to the Neanderthal and experiencing their daily existence and survival.

Nothing can replace dojo training, however, the videos can add value to your training. This video is good for people who are looking for that extra edge. I have bought a lot of videos over the past several months and many are horrible! This one is worth the money.Word of Caution: be carful with the videos that you buy. I strongly believe that some of the reviewers are the producers of the videos they are recommending. They know that they have produced a bad video, but they will write a good review to get your money. Fortnately, this is not the case with the current video. Good look!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best dubs ever","review":"Dub is created by mixing down a multi-track recording for a second time, dropping out most of the vocal line and playing with the drums, bass and other instrumental tracks. Scientist favored the use of echo and other distortion techniques. The result strips most of the soul and integrity of an original reggae song, but leaves in its place music of ghostly, other wordly power, which can grip on a whole new emotional level. The analogy of the X-Ray has been used as a descriptor. And the idea of dub as musical caricature is cleverly portrayed in the frequent use of comics as cover art. This record, along with Black Uhuru's Dub Factor, Raiders of the Lost Dub, Augustus Pablo's ...Rockers Uptown and a handful of others, is an exemplar of the style. If you like it, you can collect enough dub to fill your record or CD shelves. It is an example of a largely lost minor-musical art form that peaked in the mid 1980s."},{"rating":"2","title":"likes it","review":"My husband really like this hat. He has it on every day.

I was to develop questions for her after reading this, but I have found that most of my questions have been answered by the book. Those questions were about communion, baptism,and what would be expected of me partaking of this faith. The book also reveals those parts of the methodist churches (historic traditions),as seen through the eyes of John Wesley the founder of the methodist movement.

Some people are talking about the fit being a little large on top. I found this to be true as well, but not in a large oversized way. Just a slightly loose way, which suited me well as I don't like being too constricted while I sleep. I'm not sure why people are saying that the material or stitching is scratchy.

To protect against rain, you had better be sure and keep the hood on tight. Otherwise, the fuzzy fabric lining the hood gets drenched. But put the hood on and your hair is going to stand on end for the rest of the day because of the static the lining creates. Leave the hood off and it looks pretty unflattering as it doesn't hang neatly against your back. Wish I had passed on this one.Also, both jackets run a bit small.

It was issued by my unit and it was compact enough. However, mere hours into the job it became painfully obvious that the amount of vocabulary listed was so limited as to not be of much use as a reliable resource for advanced-level translating/interpreting. I do recall, however, that the people who spoke Thai at the basic/beginner level seemed quite happy with the dictionary's content. Therefore, I would only recommend this dictionary for someone who intends to visit Thailand briefly and does not intend to pursue Thai language study beyond the beginner level. I would even submit that if one can wait until one arrives in-country, there are many similarly priced pocket dictionaries in bookstores all over Thailand that are much more comprehensive in content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the space - and it is a tiny dictionary!","review":"This is perhaps the worst example of a dictionary I have seen.

It's easy to read, they have a simple romanization scheme for helping you pronounce the thai words, and it has the words in thai writing (great for when you're using the book talking to a Thai-only speaker.) Don't expect this dictionary to be that useful for your deeper studies though. Oh yea, best of all, they don't use that stupid rominization that puts \\"r\\"'s everywhere.

The contributions of the people who adapted the show are rather mediocre.David Benioff and D.B. Weiss just are not very good script writers. The budget is borderline inadequate--each major character wears the same outfit throughout the entire first season. The short length of each season means a lot of what makes the books great gets cut.So why did I give this 5 stars?

The time it takes to load, the flaws in the menues, the freezings it produces in the player, makes me believe that the programmers who coded the Java portions of the BD were either drunk or trying to reinvent the wheel getting out of codings standards completely.

I was excited to have the opportunity to view the 1st season series of a novel I had just completed, having accidentallystumbled upon the novel itself. The TV program was as advertised and provided a unique perspective of the story I had spent a great deal of effort trying to understand with the varied characters of peculiar name and commonly revised story lines.

So glad that I did too! I've read the entire series through twice, and this show is probably one of the best adaptations of a book series to TV/movie/visual media I have ever experienced. That being said, it's probably not for everyone. My girlfriend and her roommate cannot stand this show, and I don't press it on them. But, if you do enjoy this show, or if you enjoyed the books and have not seen the show yet, do yourself a favor and watch it! The Blu-Ray version has the amazing quality as is expected, which is awesome for this series with the incredible scenery and cinematography. I've only gotten around to watching the actual episodes, and haven't seen much of the extras or commentaries, but I can't remember ever being one who enjoyed extras or commentaries.TL;DR - Excellent show, great product! (see what I did there?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this show!","review":"Although I am not that big of a fan of medieval type of films or tv shows, I simply fell in love with this series. The first episode was ok, and was a bit too complex for me at first. A few days later, I gave it another try, and I couldn't stop watching after that. I really got involved with the characters, especially, and the story as well. It's like a roller coaster ride, it plays so well with your emotions.This is not your conventional TV show where you kinda know what is going to happen next. This show keeps you on your toes, and you cannot predict what's going to happen next. Also the attention to the detail of the costumes, scenery, and even plot really makes this show into something special.If I could recommend any show in the world, I would recommend anyone to watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game of Thrones","review":"This show is pretty sweet.

It's one thing if it is ACTUALLY a scene from the book, but when you just throw it in there to push your gay agenda then you've lost all your credibility. Yeah, there are rumors about those characters being gay, but that's all they are, rumors. That scene wasn't in the book and it shouldn't have been in the show. I was considering buying this blu-ray, but not anymore. You lost business today HBO. Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"20% interesting...","review":"80% plodding waste of time.

I ponied up the extra buck to watch it in HD, sat back, and prepared to be amazed. Well, I guess I was amazed, but not in the way I expected. This episode falls amazingly short of its potential. There are plenty of elements to grab and hold attention: characters facing tough choices, boys coming of age, a young girl more suited for combat than cross-stitching, mysterious and outrageously evil enemies, etc... I mean, sure those are old stand-bys, and maybe a bit trite, but they work. Production and casting are also quite good. But things quickly go from promising to pathetic. Gratuitous nudity, coarse sexual content, scenes demeaning to women, and foul language, all of which turn my first (and last) episode into a real dirt sandwich. Wish I had my money and time back. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be a tad \\"cleaner\\"","review":"There was WAY too much gratuitous nudity, sex, and even horrid incest; yuck. Is it really not possible nowadays to tone that aspect down just a tad? It really got tiresome and icky to the point that I had to stop watching the show after the first time.

I couldn't wait to watch it brought to visual life, and was hoping it would be adapted as well as Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies. But I've watched a couple of episodes, and I just don't like it. Confusing direction, uninspiring acting, with only tiny glimmers of the strength of GRRM's writing coming through. I suspect it would be difficult for an intelligent viewer to understand (or care about) the paper-thin characters portrayed in these videos without having read the books. There's a really good story in the books, buy those instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate the instant video","review":"The show is great- some of the best TV I have ever seen- but I have had nothing but trouble with streaming the video. It works on one laptop, but not the other- why not? It is a mystery.

Buy the dvds instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"An adolescent's wet dream.","review":"I watched the first 3 episodes of season 1, looking forward to finding a new, quality series to become engrossed in. I loved Lord of the Rings as well as other good fantasy and science fiction. I just could find nothing about this series worth watching. It's a bunch of dysfunctional royal families, with stereotypical overbearing kings, conniving queens and evil princes, vying for power and willing to do anything to get it. I see no love, no compassion, no spirituality whatsoever; darkness after darkness upon darkness is just plain boring and unimaginative. I also found the sexuality to be totally and completely presented from an adolescent male's perspective; again, boring and unimaginative (not to mention demeaning and objectifying toward women)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game of Thrones 1","review":"Daughter LOVES these books and am getting this as a birth day gift.

I've read the first few books in the series and was intrigued by the thought of watching the show. Unfortunately, in creating the show they have focused more on porn than on actually writing a good screen play or having quality acting.

HBO stayed very true to the books and so far have not turned it into the explosive vomit that True Blood has evolved into which started out as one of the greatest series ever. The sheer egos of some writers (and those who allowed True Blood to be destroyed)is beyond my comprehension. They had a near perfect product and had ruined it by taking the series in directions that are ridiculous and cartoonish (and not in a good way).The magnificance of Game of Thrones makes me once again have faith that HBO can do it right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good books, excellent TV series","review":"This is one of the most well-made shows I have seen. I enjoyed the first book in Martin's series when I read it a few years ago, but I enjoyed this season of the HBO series much more.

I have no clue what the heck the 10min stories were about, I kept falling asleep, lol.Seems like this show is for kids 18+ (twilight with gore scenes).

Well allow me to save you the trouble- the good guy and the underdog loses every single time. Evil prevails- constantly and unrealistically. If that's the kind of stuff your into go for it. The choices the characters make are so unrealistic and stupid it's hard to feel sympathy for them.

I think it is a great series, excellent production values, and great acting. Definitely worth a watch, especially on a format where you can instantly re-watch an episode. A lot of the inner plot points (and character names) are hard to figure out on first watch. The menu navigation is HORRIBLE. First, why would you need 5 discs for 10 hours of show?

Thanks to HBO for such a great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful production!","review":"I had heard great things from my friends who saw the series on HBO. I bought it for my husband's birthday; he's enjoying the series very much. Fabulous casting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I had heard a lot about Game of Thrones, so I decided to watch it. It was pretty entertaining and I'm glad I watched it. When the second season becomes available I will watch that. If you have an interest in \\"sword and sorcery\\" I would recommend you watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I've read the books and i felt the show was faithful to the source material yet making changes necesary for the change of format to the small screen. Perhaps it's only flaw is too much blatant \\"sexposition\\" or the use of nudity and sex too often when it probably was not necesary. Yes the story has a lot of sex in it but at times it does seem a little over the top in this.That said it does not take away from it be a great story that was very well done and very enjoyable.The Blu Ray special features do a good job of giving you an indepth look into a very intricate world. For those that have not read the books it can add layers and more understanding to the viewing and for those who have not read the book in a while it can remind you some things you may have forgoten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Series!!","review":"After watching two episodes of this on rental, I was totally hooked and knew I needed to own it! Amazon shipped it to me super fast, which was a great relief. I received it within a few days (Thanks Amazon!!)I should say I usually do not get so excited over television (even HBO) but this series is really different and remarkable. It is sort of like Lord of the Rings meets Sopranos meets Arthurian legends, plus Barbarian warfare, evil scheming, romance, wolves, forests, ancient gods, and phenomenal cinematography all rolled into one. This series is violent and explicit -- NOT for children. But don't write it off as just blood and sex -- there are touching scenes of friendship, much loyalty and compassion, deep human relationships. VERY well acted.The story is slow moving and slowly revealed, full of surprises and intrigue. Be alert! You will like to watch it more than once. The special features are excellent also. A great buy and a must for all fans of fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Una serie magistral","review":"Una serie magistral, con interpretaciones magistrales, ambientaci��n magistral, adaptaci��n del primer libro magistral, no tiene una sola pega.

Same reason Jericho and countless others were canceled. Stupid decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"Boring is all i have to say. I wouldn't believe all the great reviews. The series just baits you along at the very end of each episode.One reviewer stated this \\"There are assassination plots, vigilante justice, court intrigue, various sexual escapades, vicious barbarism, unseen monstrosities, plenty of wolves, family drama, and a dragon egg or two.\\" I didn't see any plots, vigilante justice, court intrigue, I have to admit the sexual escapades are true but they are homosexual lol!!!!! boooo! and yes exactly right UNSEEN monstrosities,and what wolves????!!! I think there are a total of five wolves and one is killed lol, family drama is true it's like watching young and the restless lol! and a dragon egg or two, there are 3 and worth nothing, there stone! lol what a joke of a series.

When going into this I was expecting something that involved more sword fights and bravado than thought with some intense action. While it is intense, the action involves words, not swords. I honestly never thought that I could enjoy watching people talk to each other so much.It was about halfway through that I realized I was watching a dreaded 'soap opera', and I loved it.If you like compelling characters with complex relations between one another, political intrigue, medieval fantasy, legitimately (but easily spoiled) twists all rolled into a single masterpiece...Then what is there more to say. Watch it You dolt."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!","review":"l bought this for my parents as a Xmas present.

Updated by blu-ray driver just before inserting the discs and nothing happens. Takes about 20 minutes to get to a black screen with a menu at the top. Drop to the Episodes and they won't load. What a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the DVDs or Blu-Rays, not episodes!","review":"Like other reviewers, I have just wasted time and money purchasing the first 9 episodes of Season 1 only to find the finale missing. The episodes have been great, but there is no value to buying episodes a la carte, when one can't purchase the final one. To buy the DVD set now, would cost as much as buying all of the episodes again. What a rip off!! Shame on you, HBO! If you want to see this series, get the DVDs or Blu-Rays!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Subpar Streaming","review":"The show is great, but don't stream from Amazon -- terrible. I bought one HD and one regular. The HD was quite good but the regular video was worse than bad; the picture was actually very blurry in many shots, especially the beautiful long shots. BTW, I stream videos all the time via my Roku through Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon and have NEVER seen such a bad quality picture. I'm sure the quality of the video is by design, to encourage viewers to get frustrated and buy the HD. I'll be watching the rest of the show on itunes... You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality of \\"standard\\" instant video","review":"Streamed video looks like a bootlegged copy.I have enjoyed the book I really would like to watch this show, but do not want to spoil first experience by watching crappy pixelated low resolution copy of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with your movie delivery system!!!!!!","review":"Your movies are still coming unstable, randomly blurry, with many stops.

I wish I could be as favorable in my review. The story is very slow moving and drawn out to the point of near boredom. The sound quality is poor with the many low volume personal conversations requiring higher volume to be understood which yields uncomfortable level for most scenes. The all very British language is often difficult to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke","review":"I gave it a star rating. The reason why is that the case was damaged.

I am glad I did. If you make it to episode 2, then you are hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"how could it be bad?","review":"it's based on an absolutely gripping series of novels. All the major plot points are there. Some points that are very important in subsequent books are highlighted even more in the TV show than they were in the book.

The characters are very good at acting out their part. There are many twist and turns and that make it a very exciting show. I think it is not suitable for young children due to the sexual language and nudity. Otherwise I would recommend it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"game of thrones","review":"Wasn't sure if I'd like this so I'll touch on some things I was thinking before i bought this.Level of fantasy elements: Good fantasy world for the characters, more of a medieval environment.Action: Good fighting/duels in a few episodes, not really any epic battles between armies.It was good I will say that! Loved the characters which is more than you can say for a lot of movies today.And looks amazing on bluray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I love the series, but wish they could/would show more of the major battles.

There are some details that were not too much to my liking, but then, you have to compress things for public viewing; otherwise it would be about 20 hours long. This version has Blu-Ray only, no DVD or Digital download, which is just fine for me, since it carries the complete guide. This feature is an absolute plus!!! (Get it if you can) It connects characters with locations and histories; it has little clips on all these, voiced by the actors in character! (The one by Viserys was chilling.)One last thing.Tyrion, Tyrion, rah rah rah!

Rather a lot of violence and nudity, but for all that the plot is thick, the drama exciting, and the characters convincing. The quality of this video is relatively high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Audio and Video Quality","review":"The audio and video quality is outstanding.

I don't do much tv watching but was bored one day and decided to try the series. Great drama and very true to the books. At least so far. HBO has irritated the hell out of most fans by not allowing people such as myself to buy the next seasons. I think they'll live to regret that!But as far as Amazon live streaming and related issues, as usual Amazon is on target. No compliants!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Game of Thrones","review":"The generation that was raised on fantasy books grew up and are creating their own books and movies!

Can't wait for season two to come out on amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"good episode streaming worked perfectly","review":"I had missed an episode some how when watching rented blue rays so it was convenient to stream this episode from amazon. The streaming worked great to my xbox360. Initially a little bit confusing navigating to it using the xbox ap but I figured it out and was happy with the results. Not as pretty as the blue ray but good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to understand","review":"I watched the first episode and found it too confusing. I know lots of people love it, but I felt that they threw too many characters at the viewer too quickly and they didn't provide enough explanation of the action to understand what was going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't get it","review":"I had read reviews of Thrones before I rented it. I thought it would be more my cup o' tea but....as the Hispanic housekeeper in Family Guy says: \\"no.......no........ees not good...noooooo\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Love fantasy; hated this","review":"I've always loved fantasy, and I thought I'd love this, but I hated it. It's all politics and no adventure. Every character says exactly what they're thinking except when lying to set up a power play. And virtually every conversation involves one character insulting another by referencing the fact that he or she is a dwarf, eunuch, whore, bastard, or foreigner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violence","review":"The show itself is of the highest quality but its so violent it just lacks all humanity and since everyone dies there is nothing to follow"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Previews on tv led me to beleive this was a midevil story of intrigue with lots of sword play. I paid too much for the one episode I watched. Sorry, but since I didn't enjoy the first viewing experience I will not be watching any more of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"game of thrones","review":"A fantastic view. the story is increadiable.

However, after paying good money for the DVD I was upset to find that I was forced to watch commercials for HBO's other series' at the beginning of the disks. I expect commercials for free content, but after paying for a box set I expect to be able to skip the junk and just play the show. Three and a half minutes of garbage at the beginning really ruined the mood for me. Forcing people to view commercials on a purchased DVD is a good way to persuade fans to download torrents instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps this is why people pirate movies","review":"So I love the series, I absolutely do. That's why I figured I would by the blu ray and support it. However, the blu ray arrived at my house (kudos to Amazon for helping with a minor issue there by the way) and its unplayable on my computer. Turns out the DRM requires a HDCP monitor and a digital connection. Now I understand yes piracy is a large issue, but when you make it impossible for people who actually buy the product to use it, that may be a good reason why that way has become a LOT more popular.So the TL:DRDon't purchase this, the DRM is terrible and there is a possibility doing the right thing can come back to haunt you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray Media Edition Is Seriously Flawed","review":"The poor rating that I've given this item is in no way reflective of the HBO Series: Game Of Thrones! The series is fantastic, and as a huge fan of George R. R. Martin's works, I'm thoroughly pleased with what HBO has done with this series!The Blu-Ray edition, however, will make you feel Ned Stark's pain as you spend extremely long periods of time waiting for menus and episodes to launch. I've often ejected discs from my OPPO BDP-83SE Blu-Ray player, thinking that it had crashed, after trying to launch an episode from the main menu. Menus are so slow to respond to input, that I often end up deep within a menu that I had no intention of navigating. I've become accustumed to the lengthy boot times of some Blu-Ray titles, but nothing compares to the discs included in this package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great if I could watch it...","review":"As many others have stated, this review does not reflect the series but rather the media it comes on.

The locations , costumes, acting is all top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"Game of Thrones is an excellent tv series, the acting is above average and the story is very entertaining and fast paced, without lacking depth.If you liked the book version, the story in season one follows the exact same events, but sometimes it cuts short on some parts. This is pretty obvious considering HBO has condensed a 1000 pages book in just 10 episodes, and it has no real impact on the watchability of the series.I take one star away for the limited downloads you get with amazon instant video, it doesn't make a lot of sense since the price tag is in line with the DVD version.Looking forward to getting the 2nd season as soon as available."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"If you like medieval stuff, this is defenatly for you!

Wow, what a mistake it was buying this PORN FLICK. Had I know I never would have bought it. There are 20 to 25 porn scenes in season one. Yes, frontal nude shots of men and woman. Yes, numerous copulation scenes. Fornication, prostirution, men with men in an intimate scene. Woman with woman. Discusions of adults with children. Good lord, why is this not rated X.

Yes, it is an HBO program, and yes there are large amounts of sex, violence, and some language, but life isn't always as clean, neat, and proper as some of us would like to imagine. I feel as though Game of Thrones has captured George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire brilliantly; a story which touches on every emotion one could have thought possible in a series. Don't let the few bad reviews keep you from witnessing cinematic gold. If you are uncomfortable with sex (and I don't mean a little bit), violence, and language, then steer clear. But if you are willing to take the entire series as the sum of its parts, then I can honestly say that you are in for a ride that you won't soon forget. Bravo HBO, for adapting this story so craftily and thoughtfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved these books","review":"I loved the books. I'm hoping the tv show is half as good.

Enjoyed every minute of the shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"He said, she stabbed","review":"Some of this is a bit corny, but thats how we like our fantasy/political/social commentary movies about incest, monsters and medieval magic. If you notice, they always introduce a new female character with a nude scene. I think thats in HBO's contract or something. Besides that silliness, this series really shows off great story writing/telling along with great acting from a wide cast of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic story, but will not be buying the 2nd season","review":"I think the series was faithful in bringing the book to life. I am currently reading the books. Now when I read the books, I can better visualize the vastness and characters.The story is so intricate, that it would have taken several seasons to capture every detail that was in just book one. Season one condensed it to just the one season. While I understand and am aware that it is a bloody story, I do think that some of the blood was overdone. During the joust scene someone was was stabbed in the throat. I do not have a problem seeing it happen, but to keep the camera focused on the pumping blood seemed a bit gratuitous.Some of the sex scenes were slightly gratuitous. I would have enjoyed watching this with my teenage son if it were not for the graphic sex/nudity. I try to not be a prude, but I cannot watch soft porn with my teenager. It is just too uncomfortable for both of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speedy","review":"I got my Game of Thrones (used) fairly quickly in the mail. To my disappointment the first DVD was scratched.

This followed the book about 99% of the time. Loved it. I know they couldn't cover everything that the book does but they put the main points across quite well.

It is an epic series along the order of The Lord of the Rings series and/or The Harry Potter series, with the exception that in this one, very little magic is used. It is a brutal, unforgiving show, mirroring the time, the landscape and the people it portrays. Do not get attached to any character, as it seems none are so essential they cannot be killed off, suddenly and without warning.You will come to care for these people in spite of yourself, and you may even find yourself questioning right and wrong at times, as you watch the characters fight for their lives and their loves. It is a gritty hard-core portrayal of a dark and hard society. The Game of Thrones brings its characters to life through a raw and unforgiving lens. It's difficult to watch at times, but even more difficult to look away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follows the book very well.","review":"I really liked this first episode. I've read the book and I feel they really captured each characters look, and personality. Some things were left out, but I think that's the case with any book that becomes a film or tv show. I would recommend reading the books as well as watching the show. Then you won't miss anything. Sometimes there were detail that were so tiny in the show, you wouldn't understand their meaning unless you read the book. All in all, great first episode. I'm so glad they turned this into a show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV series ever!","review":"Simply said, Buy it! Great value for a great series.

Since I like the knights, queens, kings, etc... themes, I went ahead and bought Season 1. WOW!! Beyond my expectations.

I would have had a better time if I had stabbed myself in the eye five times and tried to bandage it with a soldering iron. If you are looking for a reason to kill yourself, Sonic Impact is the movie for you. Not only was there no Sonic Impact, there was no impact at all. Terrible plot and horrible character development, add to a low budget thriller that I would use to punish my children if they were to pee on the kitchen floor. Ice T was by far the best actor in this movie. If that doesn't give you an impression of its quality, then you probably can't read or write. If you enjoyed Chill Factor, Dante's Peak, or Canadian suspense movies... this movie is for you. I am dumber from seeing this movie.

Pretty good, overall, though the jewelry depicted and values were misleading. Much of the jewelry was mid-range, fairly common stuff with the usual over-inflated book values.The other flaw was the small typeface. It seems like the publisher was trying to save on pages and reading the text was tough going for my older eyes.

After eleven months of being used pretty much only on weekends, it's developed two cracks in the plastic beaker, one about an inch and a half long and the other about 3/4 of an inch long. The beaker itself is also heavily scratched and discolored. I've hand-washed the press; it has never gone in a dishwasher.On the plus side, the coffee from it tasted great. I'm going to buy another French press, but this time, it'll be a glass one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bodium Unbreakable works well.","review":"After two broken glass presses I decided to try something else. The Bodium Brazil works great. The strainer at the pouring spout is an improvement over the glass model I had.

To my taste it is an improvement being smoother and less bitter using the same coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"This press pot sucks!","review":"I have been using a press pot for more than 15 years. It is still good and I only replaced the plunger parts once in all that time.This press pot sucks compared to the glass beaker Bodums I own. The bottom is melting and I never use boiling water. The whole thing is leaning to one side. This one is only 3 weeks old!The plastic plunger makes it very difficult to press down the grinds. I also noticed I have more than the usual amount of sludge in my cup.I recommend getting a glass Brazil or Kenya pot. Or, if you want a better looking pot get the Chambord but forget the plastic one unless you want to take it camping or something like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agrees with Buyer Beware warning","review":"I had the same experience as an earlier reviewer in that the press cracked and leaked. We asked Bodum for a replacement to this \\"unbreakable\\" coffee press, but they declined stating that the term \\"unbreakable\\" is meant as a marketing gimmic, and that we weren't meant to think the beaker would not break even under normal use. We never dropped the press. Also, the plunger itself was difficult to press, especially compared with other Bodum models and different brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough little coffee press!","review":"I bought one of these several years ago to use while camping. Meanwhile, I have broken 3-4 glass carafes....while knocking coffee grounds out at work, in the dishwasher, and on the countertop. So, I decided to replace the one broken at work with one of these! I still use one the same size made of glass at home, but I will probably replace it (when it is eventually broken) with one of the plastic ones. The plastic version is quicker/easier to clean, and the coffee tastes just as good! I also prefer the plastic top...since the chrome top eventually gets rust spots inside anyway. And, the glass carafes are just too fragile for the less careful folks I live with..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid lid design.","review":"The design of the lid is such that you have to tilt the filter to get it into the carafe.

We did end up loving having our coffee made this way, but the press broke after only 1 week. We followed the directions very carefully and made sure not to use fine ground coffee. The plastic screw cap for the press pieces wasn't well made and the threads stripped.

I found it very difficult to find a new press anywhere but the local starbucks, and since i didnt want glass I went online. This Bodum 8 Cup press seems to have an unbreakable carafe alright, the way the handle is attached seems to be abit off though. It seems to be pretty loosley or haphhazardly attached at the top end of the press. If anything breaks eventually it will be this. This one has been making a press a day, 5 days a week for about 2-3 months.

It's been a workhorse and seems to have plenty of life left in it. Cordless convenience, no need for AC nearby, etc., etc. - it's addicting if you build much at all. But the 24 volt saw is a huge step up. I got a chance to play with one at a manufacturor's demo show. The 24 volt model is a huge improvement over the 18 volt. This baby goes through dimensional lumber with ease. Blade pinch doesn't bother it nearly as much as it does the 18 volt model. The 6 extra volts is probably part of the advantage, but I bet the extra cutting teeth matter even more. This is an expensive tool, so if you're not going to use it fairly often, say once or twice a month, you might want to stick with an AC saw.

If they keep the price this high I'll just have to wait until it goes down.I wonder if they really thought this through. They would sell a far higher number of sets at a lower price and still make a ton of money since they recovered their original cost in syndication and with the VHS tapes.

Each disk has an approximately 1 1/2 hour story cut from two episodes of the series as aired.Nevertheless this is an outstanding series.

Not only are the movies entertaining and educational, but the accompanying documentaries provide valuable factual information about the time period. For example, there are documentaries on T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia), Giacomo Puccini, Henri Petain, Charles DeGaulle, etc. One caveat, however, is that some of the movies do contain some violent scenes as well as some scenes with sexual content. If parents do a good job of monitoring for these scenes, the material in the movies and documentaries will provide great history lessons for young adults.

BUT, they aren't made the same. These puzzles (Sea Life, Safari, and Pets) are NOT painted. They simply have stickers slapped on the front. The sides and underneath are completely unfinished. As a result, after my toddler playing with them for only 6 weeks, they are starting to peel apart. The first PAINTED puzzle is 2 years old, and still in GREAT shape.

I have a number of Melissa & Doug puzzles that are painted on ALL sides. The older puzzles are made of real wood and feel much nicer than this pressed board crap. They are also cut to the image where the newer puzzles are mere outlines, haphazardly thrown together. I would have promptly returned this puzzle, but my 19 month old son really loves puzzles and saw this and the other 2 puzzles as they were coming out of the box. I cannot believe that these cost the same amount or more than the other puzzles we own, yet they are of such an inferior quality that I cannot believe the are trying to pawn it off as the same thing they used to sale.

I'ver been using this method of training for 2 years now, and let me tell you, it's a godsend. My horses trust me, are more responsive, handle new situations easily, and work well with all people, not just their trainer. If you have a problem with his methods, you're doing somthing wrong. I've trained over 40 horses in this manor and never have I once had a problem. Maybe the book in itself is a lie, who knows, I personally don't care. If someone is so obsessed with wether it's true or not, you need to get a life. If you get anything out of reading it, it should be that gentlness and trust are what make an equine relationship.

That may explain some of my bitter dissapointment as it was far from a hands-on, how-to training book.

By the time he took credit for \\"discovering\\" slant-load trailering, there was no getting me back. His methods, for the most part, are sound, just not new. Ever heard of Tom Dorrance? John Lyons?

Shortly thereafter it came to my attention that the author's claims may be mostly fiction. Certainly, it has been proven beyond any doubt that the author did not invent what he calls \\"join up\\" and it appears very likely that he learned the procedure from his father who may actually have been a very kind and humane man. There was an expose about the book in Horse & Rider magazine, Feb. 1999, and Time magazine and the San Francisco Examiner also published articles that cast suspicion on the truthfulness of this book. The author's aunt and cousin have published a book that offers alternate testimonies, Horse Whispers & Lies.I would also like to point out that horsemen have always looked for more effective and safer ways to train horses and that we did NOT all beat on our horses until the author showed us the error of our ways.

Otherwise, it is a poorly written, stilted autobiography that probably contains less truth than fiction.I have worked with horses for 17 years, and what little horse information is found in the book is illogical to me. Yes, there are some interesting insights to be found, but only if you're in the very unlikely situation of being suddenly presented with a 4 year old horse who is completely untrained and who you MUST ride TODAY. Given any other situation, there are much better philosophies of training that will make the horse happier and saner, and will keep the rider/trainer safer.After having struggled through this awful book, I am completely stumped as to what other people have found worthwhile in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This only got 1 star because they didn't have 0.","review":"Research this man before spending.

Competent trainers have been quietly training horses for the last century. John Rarey, author of \\"The Rarey Method of Horse Training\\", was doing this sort of thing around the turn of the century.

As a result I have been working with young thoroughbred horses on a Stud here in New Zealand using Monty's Join Up & Follow Up methods with great success.

I never felt so close to someone because of his emotional ties to horses. I had a similar back ground of child abuse and the horses taught me to survive.

In my opinion, there are so many outright lies & imaginary events that I went to the Salinas Californian archives at the Stienbeck Library in Salinas, California to check events, dates & references in Monty's book. Dates, times & names of persons important to the story are all wrong. He was recieving awards at horse shows at the time that he was supposed to be in Nevada on his great quest to interpret the behavior of mustangs. His dates of the rodeos were one month off (late). It goes on & on. Too many people mentioned in the book have denied involvement with him & his \\"horse tales\\". It reads like a collage of a schizophrenic day dreamer. A ridiculous money maker.

While the methods do work, it's mostly because they've worked for hundreds of years before Roberts came around. He just happens to be taking all of the credit for it. He admitted years ago in an article to Horse & Rider that most of the story part of his book was falsified -- he never studied wild horses as a 13-year-old, he never lived off of cheap diet drinks just so that he could afford to work with horses. It's a cute story, but it's not true! He used it simple to help his wallet. The only difference between Monty Roberts, and John Lyons, Pat Parelli, and all of the other trainers is that Roberts goes out of his way to dream up ideas to make himself more marketable. Of all of the pages in this book, the only ones that are worth the paper they're printed on would be the ones that explain the methods, and even those are not necessarily his own.

Many of the separate readings put into perspective the moral and ethical teachings of past and present, and apply them to an increasingly earth-responsible perspective. Furthoremore, an obvious effort by the authors to draw similarities amoung themselves into a cohesive statement of ecological responsibility succeeds without compromising differences in each perspective. My only critisism is the inconsistency in citation style that leads to insufficient detailing of sources for certain facts used to support important positions.

It was such a wonderful deal! It is so beautiful and well made! I can't believe I ever even considered paying >$300 for other sets that I didn't even care for as much as this adorable underwater scene! The octopus is what caught my eye, as it looks so playful and innocent! I joke with my husband that he is really an Australian blue ringed octopus with some of the most deadly venom known to man! HA! I can't wait until I can share my passion for scuba diving with my baby, due in September. Until then, I can share stories with him/her about all of octopi and sea turtles that I have seen in real life (while doing my best Jacques Cousteau impression, of course!).

To my surprise, I quickly realized that the \\"author\\" chose not to deal with the subject at all and the book consists only of pictures. While its easy enough for a parent to make up a story using the illustrations, there are so many other books out there that have illustrations AND pictures that I would suggest spending your money elsewhere.

Many of the other books on the market are either very negative or have way too much biological information about babies and where they come from. The negativity of all the other books, I think, puts the idea of jealously in the heads of young children. My son doesn't feel jealous or left out as of yet and I don't want him to start thinking that way. Also, the biological information would be great for school aged kids, but he's not even 3 and doesn't ask, so I feel no need to explain the 'birds and bees' to him at this point. Since there are no words he tells me what he thinks is going on in each picture and I can guide him with what information I feel is appropriate for his age. Perfect book for any soon to be big brother/sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"This book is GREAT because it HAS NO WORDS! I was able to make up my own story using familiar words and names for things and my son now retells the story to me. He is very excited to be getting his own baby soon.

Simple things like \\"Will the baby like this?\\" under a picture of a toy, and \\"Was this mine? Will it still fit?\\" under a picture of the older sibling holding up some newborn sized PJs.It's a simple introduction to the concept that there is a baby on the way and life will be different.While if I had to guess I'd say the toddler pictured was a boy, it's relatively gender neutral so it totally works for our daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for Little Ones!","review":"This book was one of the ones I selected for my grandson.

The only thing that kept me going was hoping that all the setup would eventually end the the later books might better. The only reason I was interested in that is because of my love for the story of the elves of Krynn.The writing in this book was subpar. The characters were shallow and the points of view that kept shifting from one paragraph to the next was diconcerting. Even the well established characters such as Gilthas and Kerianseray did not absorb me as they have in previous books. Not to mention the nomads and khurs, who were abominably boring.The ending started to pick up some pace but since I never really cared for most of the characters I felt it was too little to late. However, I'll keep reading because I want to see what happens to the elves of Krynn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"I am currently reading the second in this trilogy which is even better but this was certainly a good beginning with characters that were well developed."},{"rating":"2","title":"good story","review":"I liked this story of the Elves and their search for a new homeland. the story was engrossing and I truely felt for their plight.

These songs reflect a true desire to worship the Lord above all and have a deeper relationship with him. You will be inspired and touched by the lyrics and moved by the melodies.

The different artists all have different styles that makes the CD a diverse and enjoyable one. But they all have one thing in common: they are praising the Lord. This album's music is just awesome. The tunes are cathcy and fun. But more importantly, they are praising God. Every single time I put this CD into the player, I find myself brought to a stop by the music and just in awe of God. There's songs for when you're down (\\"Trading My Sorrows\\") and there's songs for when you're happy (\\"The Happy Song\\").

I own several spinning dvds (Spinervals, MUCH BETTER WORKOUT) and thought I'd try a different brand. What a disappointment! Basically, all it does is take you on a gradual incline from a tension of around 2, to a tension of around 10. Mostly in the saddle. BORING. No sprints, no jumps, no tempo work, NO VARIETY. Save your money, or get a Spinervals dvd. You'll be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spinning Basics","review":"This dvd offers strictly the basics. It is not a workout dvd in the sense that one would think from the way it looks.

Simply basics."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate the music","review":"What I dislike about this and several of the other Spinning DVDs is the music. It's distracting and causes me to have a reduced pace of work and less energy. I find good music to be very energizing, but enduring this music during the routine makes for a much less enjoyable experience. When I take Spinning classes at the gym the instructors often use House Music and uptempo Rap or Pop mixes and other contemporary music that creates a feeling that time is flying by because you're having so much fun. When I hear that really good beat and especially if it is accompanied by motivating lyrics, I feel as though I just got a charge of energy and I'm in the groove - performing at my highest level and enjoying every second of it. As opposed to the music on these DVD's which makes it seem like time is dragging on."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheese and a waste of money","review":"From a hetero-guy's perspective, this dvd is lame for a number of reasons:1) only one workout2) the instructors an odd-ball3) the bikes in the video use a technology that is not readily available (i.e., spin-bike computers that display how fast your peddling etc)4) I prefer to look at women when I'm working out"},{"rating":"1","title":"not reliable","review":"This was great for about a week.

Joe 90 does display a mellow type of music but I love all kinds of music! I think Seafried, the lead singer has wonderful lyrics that search for truth and give advice along the way. When I listen to this C.D. I feel touched by it because they seem unique to some degree, they also show curiousity, and Joe 90 gives lyrics that show a wanting to know more about life and to be cautious where you go in life. I recommend this to any one who wants to try a rare artist and likes to just chill out to music that has a calm style.My favorite songs are(in no order):1. Gone2. Stop3. Cars Go Bye4. When You Arrive5. Angels Got AwayAlso, the couple of songs that were also on, \\"Dream This\\" have a slight different sound that I was amazed that I liked too.

What a brilliant portrait of Jack Smith, told with wit and love, although I'm sure he wasn't easy to love! Smith was the finest artist of the 20th C. and it is tragic that he refused to promote himself like others did. However, his failure to pursue fame and fortune (he was vehemently anti-capitalist) adds to his mystique and ensures his fame will grow over the years. His visual sense is beyond compare -- the colors and shapes (e.g, pink gowns and lilies amid jungle greenery) are unforgettable. His feud with Jonas Mekas is funny and sad.The editing here is superb. This film is a must for any fan of Jack Smith or the underground films and theater of the 1960's. Smith's influence will never not be felt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Academy M3A1Stuart Tank kit.","review":"This will be my 5th build of the Academy line of the M3 tank.

Instead, the filmmakers use the live soundmix that the audience heard. Alan White's drums are down too low, and Eric Clapton's fine lead guitar wanders in and out of audibility.This disc is disappointing. Hopefully, someday, we'll get a DVD of this show with audio that does justice to the performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Everybody Loves Dar\\"","review":"Should have called this one \\"Everybody Loves Dar\\". What was an occasional tendency in the first book, and a trend in the second and third efforts, has come to full and damaging fruition in the fourth Dar & Kerry story in the series. The chorus of admiration for Dar Roberts has grown to deafening proportions in Red Sky. As well it should, since every character but Dar sings that particular one note song endlessly. Ms. Good seems to have lost the measure of her two main characters and most sadly of all, the tenor of their relationship, to this apparently irresistable need to puff every aspect of Dar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't stand on laurals","review":"Obviously attempting to stand on previous publications, Miss Good has a flop with this drivel.

Now, however, on second reading, I struggle to give it a 2. Basically I just don't like the characters. The only male, John, is wishy washy - has faced a failing marriage for years and yet has done nothing about it - and the only action here is to find a confidant and turn them into an affair. His wife is appalling, unrealistically negative - does she have no redeeming features? Then there is Geneva - another struggling female despite her smart-alec, erudite appearance, with two awful daughters - arethey supposed to be clever too. And the one redeeming female spoils her copybook by being bowled over in her friendship by sex - as if that is all that can turn a female from a friend to someone with love in them!

(And some are made by those who later became big!)But, as far as budget, yeah, this one's low. As far as humor, the funniest thing about the story was the fact that at the fire dept. dance or whatever it was, all the dishes on the buffet table were a variation on the theme of lime jello.

Rather, Top of the Food Chain (the movie's real title, which still appears on the film itself) is an eccentric, amusing exercise in absurdity. As such, it's not for everybody, but who wants to see movies that ARE for everybody? (I know, plenty of people.) The director, John Paizs, is an associate of Guy Maddin, so if you like Maddin's films, you may like this.

After this i did buy Burn Out, which is a brilliant follow up to Rusty. That really is a great Punk album, just like Rusty, but with Wake Up Screaming they really missed the mark. I really hope they get their act together and make another great punk album like they used to make. Oh and that new guitarist Greg Otowa (or something) he's nowhere near as good as Jackson (i think, im not good with names)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WAKE UP SCREAMING!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a pretty average cd. Alot of the songs sound the same but there are some great tracks. All and all it's alright and I'll definately buy their new one. Buy this if you like MxPx, The Undecided, or Nofx. If you hate the cd you have to love the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album Is A Friggin Mess.","review":"I love melodic punk music. I have been listening to it for over five years. I bought this album because my friend's band used to play shows with these guys. When this album hit they were suddenly too cool to play shows with the bands they once were seen with. Why? I have no idea, because this album is SO BAD! I played through it twice, thinking that there must have been something I had missed, some great overpowering message, or some shining moment of talent. NOTHING! It is a cold, dead collection of uselessly melodramatic tweaks. I was so disappointed I almost cried. Then I fed the cd to my dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I bought this cd on a hunch, something I don't usually like to do but I had heard so many good things about Slick Shoes. Well, I listened to it all the way through, and hated it. I continue to listen to it about every 2 weeks hoping that one of these times, it will grow on me, but the exact opposite is happening. This band seems to have talent, including decent vocals and guitar fills. Unfortunately, it sounds like someone took a great pop punk album and ripped out every single catchy hook from every song. Song after song sounds like one big long bridge between a catchy chorus, but the refrain never comes because it doesn't exist. Lucky for me, when I bought this album I also bought Homecoming by Craig's Brother (AWESOME ALBUM! ), saving my transaction from going down as the most disappointing purchase ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"Well, I really do like this cd, but I think they could have done much better on it. They lost some of the up-beat style, either that or maybe it seems that way cause of the new guitarist. It seems that maybe they got slower, and lowered their chords some. And also, i think mr. vocalist is trying to actually lower his voice and sing now, and that takes out some of the punk-rock \\"punch\\" that you'd expect. Oh yes, they still sound good, but some songs--such as #1 and #4--just dont have the sound they used to. But anyways...if you are a first time buyer, go for it, its a great cd.--But for hardcore fans of Slick Shoes, be wary, you may be disappointed, probably not but there's always the possibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME C.D.!","review":"The new Slick Shoes c.d.\\"WAKE UP SCREAMING\\" is AWESOME! They have really matured since their other albums. The other C.D.s are good but this one is ALOT better...they have bold Christian lyrics with great tunes. They have more of a Blink 182 sound now(happy punk rock) and thats good! So if you like the old Slick Shoes music or if you like punk rock...GET THIS C.D.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It really isn't good, dispite the 4-star Amazon rating","review":"I have every Slick Shoes album except for the self titled EP. Thank god I started with Rusty and Burn Out and not this or I wouldn't have bought another SS album. All songs suffer from the same thing: they aren't consistent. A song may start out fine but then descends into what seems to be random drumming, monotenous singing and drab lyrics (never a strong point of SS)I did listen to it for quite a while and on different occasions, 'cuz maybe I just wasn't ready for this \\"new\\" direction SS was going, but to this day I still very much dislike the album. The follow up Self-titled album was a step in the right direction, but still not that great.

It's the kind of cookware that you could put on the table and serve from. However, there is something wrong with this skillets thermostat. It will not keep the temperature you select. It starts off with the correct temperature but as you keep frying, the skillet gets cooler and cooler and by the time the thermostat kicks in, the skillet is so cold that the food stops cooking. No matter what temperature you set it at, it cannot keep the temperature you choose. I have had this skillet replaced twice from Cuisinart and all three of the skillets did the same thing. Cuisinart refuses to replace it with another model and will not give me my money back. I bought this product from Amazon.com.

They had me return the skillet ($15 - my cost) and sent a new one ($10 - my cost). Received the new skillet today. Yep, it is as noisy as the last one. Does it work? Yes. Is it annoying? Yes. And I had to pay an additional $25 to find out it is just the way it is designed. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when new BUT...","review":"I bought this skillet a year ago to replace a 20+ year old Farberware. I thought the nonstick feature would be nice. Worked well for the first 9 months or so, but then the temperature control started going until I could no longer cook anything unless I set it below 250 degrees. The last few times I have used it (no matter what I cook) the nonstick surface smokes so badly I have to air out the house. I tried it one more time this morning (for scrambled eggs) and the smoke was noxious.

The pan heated to the correct temperature, but then turned off and stayed off, as the pan cooled down to nearly room temperature. Eventually it turned back on, but the erratic temperature would make cooking impossible. Being an optimist, I exchanged the pan (thanks, Amazon, for such great customer service!) for an identical one. And when I say identical, I really mean it, because it had the exact same behavior - the thermostat comes on, the pan heats to what seems the right temp, and then turns off until the pan is well below the boiling point of water. Useless. So regretfully I returned the second unit - I say regretfully because in other aspects (appearence, size, sturdiness) it's a nice pan. I might add that the second unit was also very noisy for a device with no moving parts - making a loud hum, something like a bad neon light, when it was heating."},{"rating":"1","title":"With Lady said not a Good Product","review":"I too use my Electric Fry Pan almost every night. I bought this one and it looks nice, easy to clean BUT as the other reviewer said after about 6 months the heating element goes haywire.

It states dishwasher safe, I do not even use the dishwasher clean by hand to avoid water on the plug in and still same problem. While it looks nice it is only good for occasional use and only will last about 5-6 months, then even setting it on warm cooks full blast. Everything burns.

If it's not new, then I have no way to gauge how much life could be left in the non-stick coating. Pleased with Amazon's return process.

I wanted a good, electric skillet and chose Cuisinart because of their reputation making higher quality cookware. (Or so I thought).

I went ahead and added my meat and soon could tell my first suspicions were corrrect. My meat was barely cooking and NO, I did not crowd the skillet. It was then I noticed that one side of the skillet was barely hot. By this time I had raised the temperature to 400. The food surely should have been cooking by then.

It is attractive, seemingly well-built, cleaned up easily and did a great job cooking.Then, after three years of use (not real frequent use - maybe once a week on average, if not less), the thermostat stopped working. Like some other negative reviewers here, I discovered that all of a sudden it started cooking everything on the highest possible temperature, no matter what temperature I dialed in on the thermostat.Given the cost of this unit compared to most others on the market, I would have thought it would last longer than (coincidentally) it's warranty period (i.e., 3 years).

We turned the thermostat up to 450 and it finally worked, but it just isn't performing like we expected, especially in light of the cost. Since there are other reviews with concerns of the temperature control, we're going back to the cheaper model. The non-stick coating does work very well and the handles stayed cool to the touch.

That includes the power saw, drill driver and saws all. I am impressed with the tools but the batteries suck. the original batteries lasted two years with constant use as I have my own contracting business. After the batteries failed I sent them to BatteryPackRebuilders.com, even though I am sure they do a good rebuilding job the batteries only last about a year but it's less than half the price of a new battery. Being in the construction business it's a real pain to be sending batteries back for rebuilding. If you're in the construction business you have to have at least double the 24 volt batteries you need because half are always out being rebuilt. I would really like to see Dewalt come out with a lithium ion battery replacement for the 24 volt line of tools as the cordless tools are awesome except for the original batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts and fiction merge to create beautiful looking garbage.","review":"The illustrations in this book are wonderful.

This picture-book biography presents the major events of his life with Demi's characteristically beautiful illustrations. For the purpose of nurturing a Christian worldview, this book may be problematic. Gandhi's human greatness was inseparable from his Hindu faith, and the text is infused with a Hindu view of reality, along with quotes from the Bhagavad Vita. Young children will probably be unable to separate the spiritual aspects of the story from the qualities that earned Ghandi's reputation as a \\"Great Soul.\\" Our family will have to wait until a later, more sophisticated age to introduce this important human figure to our children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Updating","review":"No disrespect to the author who has contributed much to the study of military history but this book is a good example of how time catches up with one. See my reviews of the new indepth five volume set on the German Army.With a few exceptions all of the volumes numbered under one hundred in this series on modern twentieth century forces have become outdated. The publisher's original emphasis on stuffing a broad scope of basic information in a standard format for the benefit of wargamers and military miniature makers has now changed to studies of particular campaigns and finite periods of selected unit activities and dress for study in the detailed depth they deserve. This volume is just too simplistic to be of much use to the general reader and very little to the specialist almost twenty years on."},{"rating":"2","title":"tasty & healthy","review":"I enjoy the Breadshop Granolas because they are not too sweet nor hard.

The user interface is not intuitively obvious but after using the device and referring to the User Manual a few times, I really like its abilities. It has never failed to lead me to my destination and quickly recalculates new routes when I choose a different route than suggested. The maps are a little outdated (2004?) and I am trying to find out how to get updated maps, if possible. Overall, I am very happy with the GPS device but it was a little frustrating at first figuring out how to use it. Having purchased mine for only $199, I'm not complaining. I believe I got a lot for the money. The only major drawback I have is that you can't use the MP3 player at the same time as the GPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but...","review":"Pros: Nice hardware / form factor design.Cons: Allows you to enter contacts, but no routing from those contacts; inaccurate maps (even in areas that haven't changed in decades); thin POI database; device time not set by GPS; silly keyboard interface (why should I have to cycle through three keyboards just to enter a numerical address?); inaccurate ETA/ETR calculations; navigation lost when travelling on region boundaries; inaccurate touch-screen registration on some menu entries; turn notification at the exact point of the turn (couldn't it give a little more notice based on current velocity?)... There are more.Other Thoughts: I bought this in July 2005, because I liked the physical design and I fly a lot, needing to carry a GPS with me. If you need a GPS that fits nicely in your laptop bag when you travel, *and* you're willing to put up with a junk UI, this is your device.

First, the PSP does not sit correctly in the base. It is loose and will easily fall out disconnecting itself from the speaker plug. Second, none of the play/pause/forward/backward buttons worked. Neither did the remote. Neither did the volume buttons on the remote. No sound came out with the base switched in CHARGE or 4AAAA mode. I did get sound when in DC mode.

Klikner and Smith validate the claim of Black separatist groups such as the Nation of Islam that the Black man is considered a citizen during wartime and tax time. Their analyzing of race relations during The American Revolution, The Civil War, World War II, and The Cold War show that the status of African-Americans was changed by each war. However the nation took 2 steps back when the attitudes of the White majority changed during hard economic times and developed a reluctance to expand the social revolution that was spurred by the war. The book offers a challenge to all who desire racial and economic equality to continue a unfinished social revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Da Truth!","review":"I haven't heard the whole album yet but on the strength of the few joints I heard so far this joint is fire.

The recurring characters didn't ring true and some were missing altogether (like the Sheriffs wife Maureen).

The ending feels increasingly rushed, which holds no satisfaction for the reader. Without spoiling the plot for those unfortunate enough to read it, this book is a great read... until you reach about 2/3 of the way through. The book falls apart. Mr. Bain starts using characters that were only slightly introduced earlier in the book and characters that he had invested quite a bit of time in, page-wise, suddenly leave. Reality takes a header out the window by the last few pages and the murderer(s) never get final justice... which is probably the most necessary component to a murder mystery, imho.I highly recommend Fletcher & Bain's first novel, Gin & Daggers, as an example of a very good Murder, She Wrote book."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"I relearned the lesson that you get what you pay for.

Focussing on those candidates who were well known in Washington, Woodward manages to miss any chance to discuss the surge and collapse of the Forbes campaign, give no adequate discussion of Perot and runs out of steam by the time his account reaches the party conventions. For an overseas reader, there is no insight into why Clinton was able to keep the Dole-Kemp campaign in his pocket for the whole of 95-96, nor any structure to Woodward's approach beyond chronology. Ultimately, this reader was forced to draw the conclusion that Woodward had got himself a contract to write the book, but was insufficiently interested in the material to do more than retype his notebooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAIT AND LISTEN!","review":"I was so surprised when open up the package and found this little tiny book in a box.

Until that point, Rodney keeps it moving with his ever-sharp one-liners. Despite looking and sounding his 78 years of age when he made MY FIVE WIVES, time had not robbed the great funnyman of his gift.MY FIVE WIVES loses steam as it stumbles to a conclusion. Instead of keeping Dangerfield and his jokes the center of attention, the film concentrates on its \\"plot,\\" which concerns a land swindle and organized crime. Despite a supporting cast including comedians John Byner and Andrew Dice Clay, there's not enough funny stuff going on when Rodney's not on screen.In one MY FIVE WIVES scene, Dangerfield and the five young women he's married wear thong bathing suits. I'll give Rodney credit for doing a semi-nude scene at his age. Come to think of it, two of his wives don't look so hot from behind in those swimsuits, either, and they can't blame age."},{"rating":"1","title":"underwhelming and forgettable","review":"I have been a fan of Rodney's for twenty years.

Of course others may choose to leave it on and avoid this, I just don't like advertising on products I buy. Too soon to comment on reliability but do not anticipate any problem given the reputation of Cuisinart and the apparent quality construction of this applicance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Kirkus thinks","review":"It's interesting that after such a bad review as the one above that Trocheck went on to write six or seven more of these. It has its problems (like finding the body with no effort on the part of the PI) but it's workmanlike enough.The usual amusing blunders when outsiders try to write about Mormons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful cozy mystery","review":"Every Crooked Nanny introduces Callahan Garrity, a former Atlanta cop and the current owner of The House Mouse cleaning business. She's also a part-time private investigator.Callahan is asked to investigate when the nanny of a former classmate goes missing, taking confidential business papers and other valuables with her. What really makes the story (and the entire series) is the wonderful cast of characters: her feisty mother Edna Mae and the House Mice, especially the hilarious duo of Baby and Sister. Callahan herself is especially likable: she struggles with her weight, she's gutsy without being rash and is far more credible than most female sleuths.It's also wonderfully evocative of the South, I can spot the iced tea and cornbread from here. Put your feet up and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the language is really unnecessary!","review":"this book is a great mystery and really the only problem I have with it and the writer is the crude language. I really don't think you need all that language just to sound authentic. Most people read to get away from real life. You don't have to have so much of that in the books as well. This is the only reason why I could not, in good conscience, give the book more than 2 stars. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks wit, suffers from a boring plot","review":"I read this book because I was looking for a well-written, humorous mystery with a female sleuth. I was sorely disappointed however because the only thing funny about the book was the author's horrible research about the LDS church, which lacked accuracy and authenticity to point that it was almost silly. The novel doesn't really clear up misconceptions about the faith as much as it propagates them. The plot was also slow moving and repetitive. Most of the characters were not very memorable or even likable. If you want to read something with an engaging, humorous plot stick to Janet Evanovich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light mystery/suspense","review":"Former cop, now cleaning service business owner Callahan, runs into crime when she takes on a cleaning job at a former classmate's ritzy home.

It looks kind of weird, thats probably because its in the everchanging style of the british boxes. This video will have the same director, narrator, music, and activities like Steamies vs. Diesels. I'm okay with that so long as they release normal videos with the music we love, no activities, and all of the characters. It looks like we should expect two normal videos and two wacked out videos like Steamies vs. Diesels per year. Thats okay, but HIT is a weird company.

Catholics who want to know more about their faith should seek books written by Catholic writers. To pursue this book as a means of understanding your Catholic faith will only damage your understanding and weaken a faith that obviously is yearning for truth and understanding. Try some of Scott Hahn's books first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Catholics","review":"It is a great book that every Catholic should read. I came from a very Catholic family. One of my uncles is a Priest and as you can imagine my family was very Catholic, trying to obey all the regulations as best as we could. This book shows you what the Catholic Church teaches you and what the bible teaches. It's not about evangelicals against Catholics or Catholics against evangelicals. It's about knowing what the bible teaches and exhorting us to follow Jesus. It doesn't matter what church you go to. Of course assuming that you go to one that teaches you correctly, because the bible teaches us to be careful because many false teaches, false prophets and false Christ would rise up and deceive us. That's why this is a great book because it helps us check to make sure we are learning correct doctrine."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You're Looking For Bible Truth...","review":"and/or intellectual stimulation, DO NOT buy this book.

The book tells how the mother dolphin has a baby. First the baby dolphin's tail comes out. Then his head comes out too. Then it tells how a baby dolphin is protected by its family.

It tells a balanced view of those years, also describing the cold war and racial tensions of the time. If you were there and want to be taken back, or weren't there, but want to know what that decade was like, this is a swell, neato, keen book.

Don't let this brevity fool you, as Rachel excels in using the unwritten word as skillfully as she does the written.Reflecting on a multitude or topics, she calls on readers to add their thoughts to hers. Each poem or thought can be interpreted differently by individual readers, and that brings a sense of participation as you explore the pages of this wonderful book.Because of the format, you can read in short spurts or immerse yourself for hours. BUT, either way...don't rush. Take the time to read and re-read each part of the whole and you'll be delighted at the jewels of wisdom found within.Rachel's work has the freshness that comes with writing from the heart and soul, not the pocketbook.

The book is very thorough and rigorous I'm sure, but the explanations are terrible. Everyone I've talked to in my class agrees that it's extremely difficult to learn from if you don't already know complex analysis, bbecause the definitions and order of treatment are very unintuitive. Example: residue at a is defined as the number R that makes f-R/(z-a) the derivative of a single-valued analytic function in 0<|z-a|<delta; why didn't he even mention that it's the coefficient of 1/(z-a) in the Taylor expansion? And he didn't even give any examples of specific residues. I ended up using a mathematical methods for physics book; it was the only way I could develop any kind of intuition for the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved Complex Analyis--hated Ahlfors' Complex Muddle","review":"Ahlfors may know his material but he is apparently unable to communicate it to his audience. Exercises and theory were often only vaguely related. Virtually no examples are worked anywhere in the text, which means that the gulf between theory and application was rarely crossed.The only value I see for this book is as a review for someone who is already well versed in the subject matter. For the person learning it for the first time, the text is nearly unusable. Other, more clear texts make complex analysis interesting and approachable. This text is too terse, obtuse and vague to use as a guide to complex analysis proofs and theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated text","review":"Don't know how this book achieved 'classic' status. Concur with other reviewers that there are too few worked examples. Furthermore the explanations are often obscure and confusing, for example complex integration. I would never use it as a first text. And now that there are a plethora of good advanced treatments, I wouldn't use it as a second text either. One might recommend Conway, Remmert or the real classic by Hille.

Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"$143?!?!","review":"This is a classic complex analysis text, a pleasure to read and covering all the usual topics. The prerequisites are modest; ideally, one will be familiar with the material in Rudin's \\"Princples of Mathematical Analysis,\\" but a good, mathematically oriented calculus course (Spivak's \\"Calculus\\" is beautiful) is quite sufficient.That said, the price tag is ridiculous. It was bad enough at $90 (judging by previous reviewers, that was back in the ancient days of 2001). The last edition of this book is dated 1979. It's used in graduate courses all around the world. That means that used copies are not hard to come by.For $143, one can buy a used copy of Ahlfors, and *new* copies of Conway's and Needham's complex analysis books, and still have pocket change left.

There are five games, each varying in skill level, and each with advancing levels. Simple to set up, just plug it in, turn it on, and your off. He even enjoys watching me play as I try to make it through all the levels--however, I still have yet to do so. What's good about this game, is even when you \\"run out of men\\", it does not start you back at at the first level. It allows you to start at the last level you completed (unless you turn the game off). The games are also quite funny, and the designers should be commended.There is another game I did not see on this site I would HIGHLY recommend. It's the game for Blue's Clues.

Excellent buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but too small for the LeapPad","review":"After lugging around books and cartridges in a Ziploc bag, I thought this bag would be the perfect answer for my daughter's LeapPad. It is a great concept, but the bag we received is just a bit too small to hold the LeapPad comfortably; the flaps barely close and my 5yo can't get the toy out on her own, the fit is so snug. It has been very frustrating to her (and all of us) that she can't manage on her own. An extra inch is all I ask!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A must have for the Leap Pad","review":"Before I invested in this backback, we were having problems keeping up with the cartridges that come with each Leap Pad book. This solved that and made it much easier to have everything you need when it's time to hit the road. It's very durable, but not VERY padded for protection, so I wouldn't drop it. If you own more than 3 or 4 Leap Pad books, make this investment!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leappad Backpack","review":"You can't go wrong with this purchase if you own a Leappad. It is very comfrontable and it holds up to at least 8 books and cartiges. Its a good way to travel with the leappad because it keeps everything stored in separate compartments making it easy to find what is needed without the risk of losing someting."},{"rating":"2","title":"LeapPad backpack only holds 4 cartridges and books","review":"We love the backpack, but not only is it too small for more than four sets, but if full, is hard to carry. We have to find somewhere else to store the rest, like a zipper plastic bag, so if 4 or less is all the books you have, it's a better deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed someplace to store everything!","review":"This backpack is perfect for my son to store his leappad, books and cartridges. I had been wanting someplace for a long time because the cartridges kept getting misplaced or the books kept getting ruined by our crawling infant. Now everything can be put in one place and kept safe and nice. It holds plenty of books and although it has slots for 4 cartridges, you could easily double them up to hold 8. A great find."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love their Blue & Green LeapPad Backpacks-and so do I!","review":"I purchased a backpack for each of my two children and they love them! They were so excited to have something to put their LeapPad, LeapPad books, and cartridges into for safe keeping. They love the little pockets made especially for the cartridges. My three year old boy loved that the backpack actually fit him and wasn't too big. My six year old daughter loved that it was adjustable and just the right size for her, too. This was an excellent purchase-I recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LEAP PAD BACKPACK","review":"IT IS NICE TO HAVE SOMEWHERE TO STORE THE BOOKS AND CARTRIDGES, BUT YOU COULD USE MORE SLOTS.

My 5 year old was given the Leap Pad Learning System while my 2 year old was given the Imagination Desk Learning System. They also each received a backpack to keep their things organized. Again, what a great gift, until I tried to put the Imagination Desk Learning System in the backpack. It doesn't fit!!! My 5 year old got all packed up with no problem, while my 2 year old sat there frustrated because his backpack didn't work. I cannot believe you would market an item that so blantantly just doesn't work.I love all of your products, but wish you would design a backpack to fit all of your systems. My little guy is really bummed that he doesn't have a matching \\"special\\" backpack for his system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware.

I am returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a bit more padding to be perfect.","review":"My 5yr old got the LeapPad writing system for Xmas, and we also needed a way for him to be responsible for his own \\"laptop computer\\". Pockets are large and wuite roomy to carry extra books & cartridges, and the two color options (boy vs. girl) is a nice touch.The nylon fabric seems quite durable, similar to soft-sided suitcases. Will probably clean off easily too. The nylon seems strong enough to be able to hold its shape under \\"little boy\\" use for a while.I wish it had some padding so that when my son wears it, he doesn't have such a hard object banging him on the back. He tends to run a lot. I'm sure he won't even notice all that stuff flopping around behind him, but it's something that wouldn't have been that difficult to incorporate into the design (I believe the Backpack I had some padding)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Protection for Leap Pad","review":"I just recently purchased a Leap Pad and was very pleased to see the Leap Pad BackPack available again. However, I'm very disappointed with it and intend on taking it back. This backpack provides no protection for the the leap pad. There is no padding whatsoever. I finally found a messenger bag with padding that will, at least, provide some protection for the Leap Pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep it all together","review":"We bought this backpack for the leap pad and I'm so glad.

We've added a set of headphones (ah, peace and quiet!) so we can't fit as many books in. Space for 4 cartridges, but you could always drop more in the main compartment. The straps adjust well and my 4 year old can carry it on her back with no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cage Ever","review":"This by far the best hamster cage for the money.

Best cage for the money and its cool for your hammie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes good coffee, but doesn't always work well","review":"We bought this coffeemaker because it seemed cool in the way that it brews the coffee.Cons:1. Takes a very long time (1 hour) to heat the water using the Sterno heating unit. Even on a stovetop, it takes at least 35 minutes.2. The biggest problem is that the steam leaks around the rubber stopper. You have to press down on the top bowl to keep a good seal for the steam and water to rise to mix into the coffee grounds.Pro:The coffee was very tasty and full bodied."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Cool\\" Factor","review":"I've had mine for over a year and although a little hard to \\"clean\\", it makes fantastic coffee. The \\"cool factor\\" of the \\"glass and vacuum process\\" and the \\"end taste\\" of the coffee makes it all worth the hassel. A \\"vacuum pot\\" being \\"old technology\\", is still one of the best ways to make \\"perfect\\" coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underated series","review":"Generator Gawl has all the makings of a great series. It is a perfect blend of comedy, drama, romence, action, and intrigue. Most of all though you began to care more and more about the characters involved. In Generator Gawl Vol. 3 Secrets and Lies, the viewer learns more and more about Gawl and his friends, plus there is some great forshadowing. Overall this volume got me looking forward to the fourth and finall Generator Gawl, Out of Time. My only complaint is if your an avid animation fan you need to buy the DVD because the diffenrence between the dubbed version and subtitle version is vast. Instead of changing a line here and there, the people who did the dubbed version pretty much changed all the dialogue. One can watch both the dubbed and the subtitle and feel like its totally 2 diffent movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daddy Takes Us Skating","review":"end was not that good might be ok for a small child as you need to make your own endding"},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic PV-GS12 DVC camcorder","review":"I have been very disappointed by this digital camcoder. The movie picture quality was poor, worse than my old 8mm camcoder. I could not determine the still picture quality because the USB cable was not include, although it was supposed to be included. Advertisements stated it was easy to download to your PC, but there is no software included and none is available (as far as I can determine). Panasonic has been of no help, not even acknowledging a problem. Avoid this camcoder, I was not able to return the camera because I opened the box, and I can not get any help from Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"First MiniDV and very unimpressed","review":"Puchased this from Circut City at an open box buy of $330. Let me just say do your research on review sites and only pick the best rated ones. Video quality is very grainy. Indoors with the LED light is very choppy and takes forever to auto-focus in. The zoom is great for reaching out and touching someone. That's the only reason I gave it two stars. I wouldn't say I'd stay away from Panasonic's. But if I was to purchase one, it would probably be there 3 MegaPixel one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not buy Panasonic again!!!!!!","review":"Come on Panasonic, you say in your advertisement that the DV Camera can be used as a Webcam and images can also be transferred through the USB port. OK, I realized that the USB cable was extra (not happy about that), but to not supply a software driver in the box or on your website. You got to be kidding!!!!!I once considered Panasonic as a premier brand but will look elsewhere for future purchases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DV Camera","review":"I've been happy with every aspect of this camera except for one: The night shot mode isn't an infared type deal like some other cameras where the pictures gets that greenish tint but you dont loose frame rates. The night-shot on this camera (MagicPix) turns the shutter speed WAY down so the video becomes very choppy, even with a tripod. The build in LED light works in gain mode, but only for short distances.Otherwise this camera is great. It hooked right up to my firewire card and Adobe Premiere already had drivers built in for it. the Video and sound quality are excellent, the size of the camera is great, and the features are very straightforward. Plus, if tweaking settings to your liking is your thing, the instruction booklet is very easy to follow. So, if you are going to be doing a lot of VERY low light recording, like I figured that I would, you might want to look at how other brands' night modes perform. Otherwise, this is a great camera for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"That's About Enough","review":"I'm a fan of LaBute's. I loved \\"In the Company of Men,\\" \\"Your Friends and Neighbors,\\" and thought \\"Fat Pig\\" was pretty darn good. But this latest play seems a retread--and a dull one at that. This interracial love triangle with its unreliable narrator is too clever by half.I'm not the kind of reader who thinks we must \\"like\\" the characters but don't we have to find them interesting, at least? How about a rewrite, Neil. Did a little deeper and stop relying on the \\"surprise\\" ending to make it all work. You're becoming the M.

The cast metal design is very attractive and looks as substantial as the Dualit. I'm not sure if it will last into the 22nd century like the Dualit, but who cares?

It's the best book out of all of them because it has clearer reviews of the material that is on the test. For example in the math section;remember no calculator can be used; so it goes over how to do very specifically all the problems that one will have probably become used to doing on a calculator. This book more than the rest prepares you for what is on the test. It's written very cleverly as well.

Even though it has the Idiots Guide label on it, I did find it very confusing at times. I am an Aerospace Engineer (which doesn't mean I'm not an idiot, but lends credibility to me, I hope) and I was frustrated by many parts of this book. Many terms are used without explanation. Terms such as \\"securities\\", \\"dividends\\", and \\"liability\\". I have a general idea of what these terms mean, but the book gave no explanation what so ever before using them. Also, the risk assessment quiz was very poorly worded and difficult to understand.Overall, I would not recommend this book.

I was radiating for at least two days. It seems as if Colin Channer had a road map into my dreams and wrote them with his pen. I bought the book while at a conference in another State. After reading the first few pages I was hocked for a week, and that's after a 70 hour work week, and two days at the gym. Colin Channer you didn't over do yourself because anything else would have been fatal to your readers (me). I have never read a romance novel that was so close to home (Jamaica) and I am glad that I did. This re-assures the fact that Jamaica has a lot more to offer besides music and food.

I was on a quest to find new fiction written by black males when I saw \\"Waiting In Vain\\" on the shelf. The character development was awesome. I was inspired by the depth of the relationship between Fire and Sylvia although they had not known each other very long. Although some of the characters lived 'tragic lives' the love and commitment demonstrated was paramount.Fire's relationship with others gave testimony to the fact that you cannot save others and when you look in the mirror, you are looking at the person most responsible for your peace of mind. A must read. I have loaned it to family and friends and recommend it every chance I get. As a matter of fact, I have read it several times and probable will again. I anxiously await Colin Channer's next novel out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Colin!

I found the book to be a good read, but not always an easy read because it made me think about the relationships in my life. I have read a ton of romance novels and few have dealt with the psychological impact of love. Fire and Sylvia were excellent characters and I wondered if Sylvia would remain tied to her materialistic world. I loved reading about the relationships in this book, they were all tied together in some fashion and we got a chance to see how each relationship changed another. Fire is like no other man I have ever encountered in a romance book, he is a black man who is comfortable in his own skin. And even though he is wealthy and famous, he does not feel as if the money or fame makes him who he is. Colin, I must give you kudos for such great writing. I am waiting for you next book. Take your time and make it good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, timely love story from a man with heart!!","review":"As a professional African American female of West Indian parents I really enjoyed the book. First of all it is great to see a man of West Indian descent write a love story that is sensual and so natural. Reading Waiting in Vain brought back many memorizes of growing up in New York in a West Indian household. I hope everyone appreciates the richest of Carribbean culture and that more people of West Indian descent start writing like Colin. I loved it and I recommend it to everyone both males and females. I would say that males have responded just as well to it as females.

It was an insight into the art world I have not really been exposed to. I was just upset with the corny way the book ended. Up until the end, I liked it, but I guess there are only a few ways to end love stories...The book was very sexual, sometimes unbelievably so. Namely, the part when sylvia gets off on the phone in her office, and she is making all that commotion-come on!! I did not like how they only hooked up once, and then at the end of the story they just get back together, after it seems a year from their one night stand, I just could not feel that. I was impressed with the depth the author showed in the fraternal relationships. He showed a true understanding of friendships. I liked the way he showed the fragility and vulnerability of relations with friends. To me, that was what the book was really about-friendships, and for that, it was worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAPTIVATING","review":"Waiting In Vain is not just another novel, not just another \\"must read\\"... it is a story that creates a generous imagination; it disturbs, excites, inspires, motivates and it resonates.Waiting In Vain is, quite simply, a truly captivating experience that any intelligent reader must indulge in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true-to-life love story","review":"Colin Channer has a unique way with words.

I am looking for more from this author, and I hope to see a sequel to Waiting in Vain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting in Vain","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Waiting in Vain\\" to the point that I read it twice, which is something I have never done. The main male character Fire was so sensual, sensitive, erotic, giving, centered, and intellectual that I wanted to will him into existence. I wanted to be in the company of someone so flirtatious and passionate. A man smart enough to know that you much touch a woman's soul and make love to her mentally in order to gain the great rewards of having her surrender herself to you physically and totally. Fire knows that the biggest sex organ is the brain and by stimulating that you can reach ectasy unimaginable. The electricity between Fire and Sylvia sizzles. The dialog between the characters was so great that I will borrow them for personal flirtations. I definitely learned a few things. This is not fluff; it's a well written novel with characters of depth and their romantic entanglements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting in vain","review":"A SUPERB DUBUT!

Magnificent!","review":"There aren't enough words to describe the joy and pleasure I experienced while reading this book. The characters were so vivid and real, unlike the usual \\"girlfriend/boyfriend\\" dramas that I had simply grown tired of. Colin Channer showed us our good and bad selves, using such grit and finesse you are amazed that this is his first novel. His approach to the entire \\"class\\" issue was EXCELLENT, prompting us to take a closer look at the real reasons behind our existing relationships (professional and social) and the values they ultimately reflect. Bravo, Colin, and don't let us \\"wait in vain\\" for your next masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful","review":"Waiting In Vain is filled with the lust, torment, openness, and fright, of falling in love in a complex world.Simultaneously soothing and provoking, Waiting In Vain wrings your heart as you remember the cruelties of love. But just as the price of love becomes too high, you are eased into its rewards. Through a fusion of English and Patois, Channer pushes through practicalities into passion. Your soul is calmed and pulled into believing in the power of the first look and the first touch. You dwell longingly sucking on mangoes, laughing at the skanking on the sidewalk, and finally breathing when the boat comes in. For those who think passion is overrated this book is not for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Waiting in Vain is an excellent book. I was able to relate to all of the characters and developed an understanding and compansion for each one. Fire is a fine example of a strong, sincere man. My only wish is that there would be a continuation of Fire and Slyvia, they are perfect for each other. I would also like to wish much more success to Colin Channer on all of his next project, I will be looking forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW--Jamaica Here I come!","review":"What a wonderful book! Mr. Channer's descriptions of Jamaica, Brooklyn and England are beautiful. I loved all the characters--all human with flaws. Yes, even Fire had flaws. He was insecure. The Jamaican dialect was difficult at first, but after a while it just flowed. I can't wait for the next novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnifi'c!","review":"Aside from the obvious brilliance and vibrance of the author's style, this book goes beyond the typical love story. The reader is compelled to grow through vicarious experience as the embodiment of each character.Channer is indeed the bomb! This book is more profound than meets the eye. The majestic and whimsical aura suggests an undefinable strength in culture while simultaneously reminding us of the importance of character.This book is overflowing with twists of love, beauty, culture, morality, character, politics, passion, enchantment and social phenomena (almost social realism)!Get it! Read it! Live it! Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant writing style!","review":"How elegantly put. This is a page turner. This author really has a way with words. Great job! Another page turner is In-Law Drama. Happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting in Vain","review":"A wonderful book, such beautiful writing. Colin made me feel like I knew these characters; they practically jumped off the pages. A must read for people interested in reading stories about Caribbean people,written from our perspective. The Jamaican setting took me back to the past, making me re-live some of my childhood experiences. The use of authentic patois added to the rich flavor of the story. Yet it is quite contempory, depicting many of the experiences of West Indian immigrants to the UK and USA. I couldnt put it down and I cant wait for his next book. Irie, Colin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Channer's language is at once lush and livid.","review":"I picked Waiting in Vain at the local Wal-Mart while waiting for my roommate to thumb through the latest issue of Cosmo. From the cover I judged it to be just another Arabesque-like romance. Surprise!! It was not!! In fact, it has been a while since I read a book with such voluptuous language, so full and ripe that it nearly dribbled down the page, like one of Fire's mango's.Channer's language is at once lush and livid. His characters explode off the page only to score themselves indelibly on the brain. And why? Because we've all loved like Fire, we've all been as lost as Sylvia, and we've all needed as much understanding as Ian. I've never been to Jamaica, but as I read I feel her rhythms, I smell the fresh earth, and my palate is filled with rich spices that I have never tasted. Being of partial Jamaican descent, Waiting In Vain makes me long for the home I've never known.Thank you Colin Channer for such a beautiful depiction of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most well written book I have read in a long time!","review":"This book made me remember how beautiful the English language can be when the words are so well put together. Mr. Channer's use of metaphors was astounding and made me look at the simple things in life in ways I would have never thought. I went through the entire gamut of emotions possible reading the lives of his characters. As a woman, I look forward to having a man loving me as honestly, freely, and unconditionally as Fire loved. As an avid reader, I can't wait until Mr. Channer blesses us with another novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real Jamaican treat","review":"A book definitely worth reading. Colin Channer tells the story of two talented young people who are destined to meet and despite how difficult the situation appears, are able to connect . It goes from there full of drama and intrigue...a very captivating and sensual story. We learn about their lives and the lives of the people who surround them. I thoroughly enjoyed it from the start to the finish and was very inspired by the characters of Fire and Sylvia. Thank you Channer for this wonderful Jamaican work and may you continue to write so well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superbly written,incredibly sensuous reading experience.","review":"Waiting In Vain by Colin Channer makes an awesome and welcome entry into the new unchartered landscape of true romance. His poetic nature of storytelling brings vivid images to both the mind and spirit. The Caribbean-born author and characters speak to an aspect of our culture that is typically not heard. Caribbean-Americans are usually lumped into the greater African-American experience when in actuality we bring an entirely different flavor and dynamic to it. This novel has given our culture a resounding voice. I was captured by the intensity of Sylvia and Fire's relationship, so much so that I could not put this book down until it was finished. The storyline is complex and engaging in it's simple message of love. Love gave life to their desperate search to find happiness within themselves and each other. This novel was a journey to self-discovery and a find that was definitely worth waiting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falling In Love and Lust - - Yard Style","review":"The prologue alone is enough to entice any reader to submit their souls to Colin's brilliant, erotic and even risque images. One is taken on a journey to places we thought we knew, and meet people that we swore that we have met. It is only in the afterglow that one realizes that the vision was influenced by an honest, mature and romantic storyteller. Colin redefines this style of literature, producing a novel that hardcore yardies can stand up and fire two shots for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting In Vain","review":"What an incredible novel! Adrian Heath a.k.a. \\"Fire\\" is the epitome of man! The name Fire is quite appropriate for this character because of the desires and emotions the he stirs in one's soul. Ian's character puts me in mind of a character from James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room. The supporting characters were equally enjoyable. Getting a male perspective on love is always something worth one's time. We need more male writers like Mr. Channer. Keep up the good work! I hope you're working on another book. Write on Brother, Write on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No longer Waiting","review":"I immensely enjoyed Colin Channer's book. There was so much sensivity in the book I still find it hard to believe that he is indeed a man. I have read books by men about love, and was very disappointed. The books that I read by otherr men about love just did not touch my heart. Colin speaks to the heart girls, so read this one. I fell in love with the lead character--A BLACK MAN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No words can describe...","review":"the way I fell in love with this book. If you ever wanted to travel to England, Brooklyn and Jamaica, read this book, Colin will bring you there. If you've ever experienced love, lust, confusion, pain, read this book because you will have no problem connecting with the characters. Waiting in Vain is the real deal. I've read it once and tonight, I'll start to read it again. Mr. Channer deserves a standing ovation for this piece of art. He is so explict, so detailed, the words jump right off the page and paint a picture for you that is so clear, you will wonder if you've been there before. Waiting in Vain is just an amazing book, and Colin is an amazing writer, but like I said before, no words can describe how I feel about this book, but I'm sure you'll feel the same way after you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting In Vain","review":"I think that this is a gritty, charming, intelligent and, really very powerfully written first novel.Using the backdrop of London, Jamaica, Cuba and New York, the book focuses realistically, on the day-to-day trials and tribulations of ordinary people's lives.Colin channer has given his characters such depth to their personalities which is expressed, colourfully, through the use of poetic language, analogy and metaphor in depicting the way in which they interact with each other. Sometimes positively, and sometimes, with devastating results.The reader is allowed to access the main character's, Fire, psyche which is expertly done through 'streams of consciousness, reminiscent of Virginia Woolf's highly acclaimed novel Mrs Dalloway.I did feel that it lingered a little to long, for my liking, in coming to a conclusion - but, that said - it was certainly an ending worth waiting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL, MAGNIFICENT, A MUST READ. I WOULD READ IT AGAIN.","review":"From the beginning, to the end, I was swept away. I've never been to Jamaica but after reading this magnificent book, I felt like I've been there and back. What a great love story with mischief and intrigue all wound up into one. I think Oprah should include this book in her book club. I absolutely loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Have Read","review":"Waiting in Vain was a one night read for me! I have never read a novel with characters that were so real and easy to identify with. Colin dispells a lot of myths about men being afraid to feel and show emotions with his character Fire. It was a very refreshing read! Real romance and real life. A very good read! Buy the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this one","review":"I'm an avid reader. And this book, I really didn't enjoy. I actually didn't finish it. I just couldn't get into it. I bought it cause I read the reviews that were in here, and I totally disagree with everyone that gave it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIFFERENT KIND OF READING EXPERIENCE","review":"Fire was an incredible character. I was truly turned on by his intelligence, passion, humbleness and sense of respect for women. I felt that this novel was more about the quality of a man and less about his relationships with women. That which really pulled at my heart strings was his relationship with Ian. I saw this as the major relationship in the novel, with his relationship with Sylvia and Blanche being secondary. The interaction between these two friends who grew up together and had their own issues with each other was a compelling part of the novel.I also enjoyed the fact that the main character was someone other than an African American. The Jamaica history, ritual and culture gave the novel a very unique twist. To that extent, for those of us who associate Jamaica only with Bob Marley, it was a cultural experience as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affair of the Heart: Burned by Fire","review":"Your heart has never soared until a man calls you \\"sweet girl\\" and means it... until he writes you a letter from the tropics and invites you to wine him..

The novel reveals the gentle and loving side that exists in all men, but is often hidden because of societal conditioning and threats to manhood both real and imagined.The characters are well developed and reach from the pages to touch the heart of the reader.A must read for anyone who loves good literature with an erotic flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"waiting in vain is right!!!","review":"ugh!

It is a beautiful piece of literature that one cannot afford to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest fiction wver written!","review":"This story tells the tale of old friendship and new love.

A great find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Island Theme","review":"Sensual, erotic, sweet, romantic. These words come to mind when I think of this book. I travelled with Fire to New York, London and Jamaica and enjoyed every moment of the trip! This novel had just enough humour and passion to keep me enthralled! The characters were so true to life. The patois brought a smile to my face. I look forward to reading Colin Channer's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Spectacular First Novel","review":"Excellent writing, vivid descriptions with continuing suspense that held you from page to page......\\"Waiting in Vain\\" held and caressed my mind, body and soul while taking me on a beautiful journey of home(Jamaica). This book was able to tackle both social and relationship issues in a very entertaining way. Nothing beats a great book than the suspense ending that was created in the scene with \\"Fire\\" going out to sea.......Waiting in Vain has all the components for a best-seller, and hopefully we can look forward to the movie and the second book soon.

The latest issue, Volume XX, is a total disaster: it's entirely the kind of machine-stamped, workshop-generated, topicless, \\"unique\\" in setting but mindless in execution, trendy garbage. There is nothing of literary value here although the poem \\"Lapse\\" is amusing. I hope Concho River Review gets off the MFA trip it is on and resumes printing material that is actually critical of the assumptions we make, conveys learning instead of emotional sure bets, and has something at all to say, because right now this is a wasteland of zero value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satified customer","review":"I had ordered this machine as a gift for my niece.

My 6 months baby enjoys it every time he rides. It makes him busy for 20-30 minutes at max. However, I think it could be improved in certain points:1) Its rotation mechanism is a little bit weak. Many times the chair stops to rotate, or it pups out2) When it is put on a hard floor, the activity station can be pulled by a baby all around the roomOtherwise it is a great fun for the baby and the sibling"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Feelings","review":"There are things I love and things I hate about this toy. The concept is lots of fun, and when my twins hit about 8mos, they were running around it like mad. Like another reviewer noted, it is very lightweight and they easily drag it across the floor. I also tried taken the removable seat off when the twins started standing, but it is so lightweight and top heavy that if they try to pull up on it it falls over, so I put the seat back on for stability. One big problem I had with it is that there is a toy where the kid pulls a string and it pulls back in making a piece spin around. This was actually one of the first toys my son was able to interact with, but a few weeks ago, he got it wrapped around his finger and the string was pulling in so tight I had a hard time getting his rapidly turning purple finger out. Bad idea for little guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"needs some space, but tons of fun!","review":"we own a slightly different model than the one shown, but we love this product! our 9 month old walks in circles around the table, playing at all the stations. the piano gets most of the attention, which is ok with us because the music is better than most infant toys. it is a space hog, and you have to keep in mind it extends your kiddo's reach quite a bit. i'm also pretty sure he will be able to drag it across the wood floor shortly, although he hasn't done this yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE LOVE THIS PRODUCT","review":"Our daughter, who is 10 months old, has so much fun with this activity station.

It looks great, but what you can't tell from the picture is that the toys and table are a far reach from the seat. My son couldn't even get close to reaching the toys and just got frustrated. We ended up with a different entertainer/walker.

My daughter got bored with the toys on the table pretty quickly though and now after just a few minutes, is ready to get out. She (6 months) likes the piano part but some of the other toys are either boring or too hard to use (there's one that you can push things down and they squeek, but she doesn't have the upper body strength to do this)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy are PAINTED! Not good esp if baby has teeth","review":"At first my twin daughters enjoyed this enter esp. walking around part. One day I discovered my girls had scraped some paint off the toys with their teeth. I didn't know the toys were even painted until then or I would not have allowed this toy in my home at all! Thought it was colore dplastic integrated into the toy like many other activity centers. I don't care if the paint is \\"safe\\" - who wants their tiny baby to ingest paint and why would a baby toy be painted. BOO hiss to Bright starts for this terrible design, like we parents don't have enough worries in raising babies in a safe environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!!!!!","review":"I have used this since my daughter was little, little. Mine has slightly different toys then the ones pictured. At first, she sat in it and looked around then before I knew it she was running around in circles! I wanted a walker but was afraid of her getting hurt. This is a walker within itself - so no need to worry about stairs - the child can spin around in the seat and the seat spins around the base. My daughter is 15 months now and still uses this. We removed the seat as soon as she was standing & mobile and now it works as an activity table. I put her afternoon snack and drink in the snack tray and she goes right over to get it. The piano has so many different options and she still loves the songs (I like them too!) She will stand beside the table and dance. It is a larger sized entertainment center but well worth the space and once the seat is gone it's really not bad! The price may seem like a lot at first but the extra few dollars you spend are worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"it was very easy to put together but my 7 month old isnt very entertained by the table he wants to get out of it after less than 5 monutes and I only had this toy for a week.

He loved it. He would run in circles and laugh his head off. He would watch cartoons in it and be able to move. He could not stand to be tied down in a chair or any type of bouncy thing, this gave him the independence to \\"move as he wanted\\" He is now 22 months old and I gave this to my aunt who does daycare. She said it is the best thing she has ever had. When my son goes over my aunts for daycare and this is out, he will still play with it and try to climb in it. He could drag it around himself after a few months, he is a big boy, but I do not feel they should be left alone anyway, so you just need to \\"pull\\" them back in place. He loved the music buttons, and there are also holders for snacks too. BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"My 8 month old son loves this exersaucer.

We've had it for about 2 months, my son is now 8 months old, and it's his favorite place to sit and play. Lot's of things to keep the little one busy, ours especially likes the combination mini-piano, animal sounds, and music portion. It did take him a few weeks of sitting in it to figure out how to get around but, once he learned, he just goes in circles. The seat itself turns 180 degrees so he's able to turn around if he wants to. As for putting it together, takes about 30 - 45 minutes. This is the first review I've written on something that we bought our little one, thought I should pass on our experience with it which, so far, has been great.

The base is hollow, light and thin, constucted of 2 seperate pieces that you use 2 screws to hold together, which makes me think that he will either push himself and the whole thingover, or he will soon be dragging it around the house. So my point for this toy not being worth 10 dollars let alone $75. The selling point of this toy is that your child is supposed to be able to move freely from station to station 360 degrees and play with the multiple toys on top. The problem is where the swivel attatches to the base. Being that the base is made of two pieces of plastic, when your child trys to rotate around the base, he gets hung up on the seams where the 2 pieces of the base are screwed together, leaving him stuck and immobile, making the toy no better than a Bumbo with a tray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Toy","review":"My 6 month old daughter loves this toy!

I liked the scent and it seemed to be free of many chemicals. However, I noticed that it was not a good enough cleanser to remove makeup. So if you decide to buy this product you will need to use a toner if you want to make sure your skin is really clean. I used this product for 2.5 weeks, with the Komenuka Bijin Facial lotion. The results: The cleanser did not clean well enough to remove makeup and the lotion was so moisture rich that in the 2.5 weeks of using these products together made my skin break out all over.

I'm guessing the rice powder this cleanser consists of is magic in a pack.One bad thing is that if you wet the actual package the powder is in you'll get screwed. My only complaint is the kind of annoying packaging, however it does come in useful when traveling.You could just open all the cleanser packaging (30) and put them in a class, tall, tube, similar to a salt and pepper shaker and then use that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"luxurious feel but too drying for everyday use IMHO","review":"The first time I used this powder my face felt so silky. However after a few 1X daily uses it was drying my skin too much. So now I have to relegate it to weekend only use.I wish they would put the powder in some sort of dispenser because the packet getswet in the shower and it's a little awkward to save.

Also, when Darcy was shot and fell through the mirror into the 20th century, and Julian called 911, he was told by the dispatcher that Redemption didn't have an ambulance. But later when Keighly and Francine were returning there from LA Francine said what a great paramedic team Redemption had.Huh?

Flamingo's feathers, fresh squeezed orange juice. Absolutely no gem is more appropriate -or affordable- to celebrate the season.A cluster of crystals drops a folded fan of coral from a sturdy, gold-plated post that hasn't bend or chipped in the nearly year I've owned these.

His image, frame, development and talent is so 'lukewarm' and bland. In this flick, the story content is very shallow and seem like nonsense, without proper development. The fight scenes and choreography is a -2, plus the guy fighting Chang Yi is stupid looking and untalented. I love Chang Yi, but not in this flick.

For example, he claims that the advocates apply human qualities to animals, and yet for Swan, bobcats, vultures and kestrels are \\"omens,\\" sent just for his benefit. In addition, he desperately tries to align himself with Native American culture, in the hopes that it will bring him some credibility among the largely non-hunting public...His statements about vegetarians (they're more prone to yeast infections? They lose their toenails? )are so fallacious, they're amusing.

I purchased it because I am an avid Deanna Durbin fan and want anything available with Durbin.

There is a newly released CD of the movie soundtrack which includes more of the music and that CD is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maltin was right","review":"For once, movie critic Leonard Maltin was on target when he called this black and white musical from 1948 disappointing. It is, in the extreme. Durbin is getting a bit too heavy to place innocent young girls any more. (This is among her last films.) Vincent Price is a parody of himself playing Boss Tweed (who in reality weighed 325). The dance sequences are alarmingly cheap and uninspired. And the music is just plain bad. The film was based on a play, and some of the music was omitted. Why? In short, Universal has done it again: a very mediocre film that wastes the great talents of Deanna Durbin and Dick Haymes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product but they shipped the wrong one","review":"Happy with the product its absolutely awesome!!!

Each video is filmed almost as if it were a mini art-house film, with the exception of the first ones (they look as if his father, Vicente, was behind the camera!)And for Mr. Larsen from Norway that asked if any concert tapes or dvds were available, the answer is yes. I obtained 2 excellent concert tapes of Alejandro.....one is a concert in Santo Domingo.....the other from Vi?a del Mar in Chile......both show up occasionally on ebay. There also is a dvd/vcd of Alejandro and Vicente from 'Lazos Invencibles' concert in Ecuador. I also bought that one on ebay.....but that may be available elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an evolution!","review":"First off, I love this DVD. It is a great compilation of Alejandro's videos that allows the viewer to literally watch him evolve from a skinny drink of water, singing mostly traditonal ranchero songs, into a self-assured, sexy, cross-over pop singer who has obviously spent time both in a gym and in a recording studio, training his body and his voice to their peak performances. He's a joy to watch and a greater joy to listen to. His emotion is always right out there, lending a depth and honesty to the lyrics of every song. Mini-movies with exceptional \\"soundtracks\\" is the best description of this DVD...it's one you'll watch again and again. The inclusion of his live rendition of \\"Abrazame\\" is another real treat.No cerveza or wine necessary to accompany the viewing of this DVD, everything you'll need is right there on the disc.....provided courtesy of Alejandro Fernandez!

All that makes it a Pern novel are the setting and the dragonriders. I couldn't tell where it fell chronologically, and the idea of the Shunned seems unfitting for Pern. the story jumps around and I had trouble keeping the characters straight.

Nor do the voices of the co-writers blend well. The narrative is bland, and while the mute Harper boy is an intriguing concept, the whole story is cardboard, like BAD fanfic.

Everytime I see a new Pern book with todd McCafrey's name on it, I cringe. I read it in the store first. If I like half the story, then I will buy it. This story is ridiculous. A mute harper? harpers are supposed to teach through song. How does a mute harper do this, through sign language? The \\"Shunned\\" reminds me of the \\"others\\" in Lost.

I was mildly disappointed by Dragon's Kin and EXTREMELY disappointed at Dragon's Blood. I am 32 years old and I have been reading Pern adventures for over 20 years. There is no feeling or heart in Todd's books. Everything is so perfunctory. I feel like I'm going through a checklist from a bad screenplay. Children die. Check. Fire lizards die. Check. People die. Check. Character development is so lacking that the reader could really care less when something \\"significant\\" occurs.The saddest thing is that this doesn't seem like Anne's Pern at all. It's not consistent with what I know of it. Obscure, irrelevant, extreme events occur for the sake of pushing the story. Nothing about it seems natural. Nothing about it flows. If Todd had writer's block during the creation of this book, it's obvious by the stinted, stilted storying telling. Maybe he should stick to computer science."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I have read every Pern book written, most of them several times, and I am sorry I wasted my time reading this one even once.

The characters were not well devleoped, the timelines became confused. What a mess!Better would have been to create multiple books with overlapping characters and better develop the story lines. Anne has certainly done it before and it has worked really well.While it is in my collection, I doubt I will read it very often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragons Fire [ The Dragonriders Pern]","review":"Liked this story a lot. if you are a Fan of the Pern Novels you want to read this installment. You can see the influence of Todd in the later books of the series and in this one. The story is a little darker a little more gritty. This story helps fill in after the great plague. Covers other things that were lost during the plague. Overall another great story of the Dragonriders of Pern"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Glad to see I'm not the only one who can't stand this book. There is nothing to redeem the inferior writing, fractured plot, inconsitancies (a dragon changed color! OMG, hire an editor, for crimminy's sake!), and completely undeveloped characters. Weyerleaders act like petulant children, showing the worst characterists of previous \\"real\\" McCaffery characters. The main character is alternately distrusted, then suddenly trusted, then shot at, then trusted again, for little apparent reason. And firestone plain old does not kill dragons--ask a real writer, Todd. You stink."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth reading","review":"While several people have said bad things about this book I really enjoyed it. Todd's style isn't quite the same as his mother's and that may be the reason for some of the negative reviews. But he brings some fresh ideas and I, for one, love that."},{"rating":"1","title":"a pale shadow of Anne McCaffrey","review":"Fans of Anne McCaffrey's Pern series will want to give a pass this attempt by her son to repeat her success. It is a lackluster telling of what could have been an excellent tale. Todd McCaffrey has none of his mother's talent for involving the reader in the tale or character development. The characters lack depth and the story line jumps and jerks rather than gliding from chapter to chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passing the baton but not the talent","review":"I have to say that I'm truely disappointed in Todd McCaffrey's writing, and this book in particular. It makes no sense and seems to be about 15 wildly different stories all crammed together with no thought to comprehensibility. I'm a long time Pern and McCaffrey fan, and I'm truely shocked that she even let this out the door, much less on the shelves. I've read better fanfic. I'm just glad I checked it out from the library rather than automatically buying it. I think I'm planning on just skipping anything else of Todd's because this was so terrible. I even almost didn't finish it but held out hope that it would somehow all come together in the end. Didn't happen. So I recommend, Don't waste your time. Get some Robin Hobb or something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragonfireout","review":"This book has nearly quenched my desire to read any more of the dragon series. The three young male characters seem to have interchangeable personalities. The story seems to meander without any real focus. We have a much overused reuse of the arrogant wyerleader theme. The bad guy vs one of the young male characters is poorly detailed and repetitive. I've read the 9th pass books and all of the ones prior to this one except Dragoneye and so far this is the worst one I've encountered. If you're trying to read all of the series, then I guess you'll read this one, but don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continues to diverge from Anne McCaffrey's world","review":"Todd McCaffrey's version of Pern continues to depart from the world his mother created - full of Mary Sues, Gary Stus, and political correctness. Todd's books are more like an extensive fan-fiction world, allowing for things that his mother permitted in fan fiction, but would never have allowed in her own written world.I purchased and read three of Todd McCaffrey's books in this extended universe Pern series, but will not consider them part of canon Pern, and will not be purchasing any more of Todd's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I've read most of the other reviews and the negative ones really say it all for me. Todd is not his mother (regretfully) and I truly wonder where his mother was while he was writing this disjointed and sad story? Perhaps she's not comfortable editing his work. In any case, unless Todd develops better writing skills the Pern saga will end. Thread couldn't defeat Pern but Todd just might do the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragon's Fire (The Dragonriders of Pern)","review":"This book was a terrible disappointment. I just kept slogging thru it, hoping at some point it would finally hold together. It didn't. The big \\"search for Maron\\" just fizzled. The guy was never held accountable for what he did wrong, which just doesn't jibe with the way Harpers are supposed to me.The thing I've been noticing with the trend of these latest books in the Pern series, is that no one is ever happy. There is only misery and a lot of back-stabbing. The only happiness seems to come in the last two sentences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragon's Fire","review":"The Mccaffreys have collaborated again to create a Pern saga that revisits characters such as Master Zist and Kindan. In this volume, the reader is introduced to Pellar, the mute Harper apprentice, Cristov, a miner's son, Halla, a homeless young girl, and Moran, Harper to the Shunned. This entertaining fable includes breathtaking dragon flights and the discovery of a new source of firestone to be used in fighting the dreaded \\"Thread\\" falling on Pern. Great summer reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good...","review":"This book, one of the son/mother collaborations, is just not good. Compared to the original books of the series, there is little character development, a completely simple and one dimensional story line, and a lot of cliches. I had my teenagers laughing over some of the maudlin prose. Very disappointing, with none of the rich description and depth or complexity of the older works. And speaking as a woman, it seems that it was written more by a man than a woman. Don't buy it - check it out from the library and be happy you saved the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Todd McCaffery can't write - NO stars","review":"Too bad, Todd, but it's terrible. I couldn't get past the third chapter. This book appears to have been written by a third-grader. Spoken by one who has read Anne McCaffery's books dozens of times. If you must have a Pern fix, go to the library, don't spend $25."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find a good insulin case, but this works...","review":"With everyone focused on pens these days, it's hard to find a good carry-all for bottles and syringes. This one holds everything you need - needles, alcs, and two bottles.The pocket design can make it tricky to get the bottles in and out (you have to push one to the side and try to slide the other past it), but it has the advantage of being able to accommodate those oddly-proportioned lantus bottles. My old case used elastic bands to hold the bottles, which made it easier to put them in and take them out, but the bands were too big for lantus bottles. They also gradually stretched out, making the bottles prone to slip out. The pocket design is much more flexible and durable in that sense.Nice color to this one, too. And good material. Tough, but lightweight. I'm sure it'll serve well for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted my money","review":"The diabetic carry all case is very thin and flimsy, it would be very easy for the materials inside to become damanged with little force.

Not even a three ft. drop. Not to mention the storage compartments for the vials are facing eachother, making removal on one or the other extremely difficult.

I'm afraid this is my 2nd-least-favorite (MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN's at the bottom for me). Never mind the controversy still going on as to whether Norman or Barry wrote \\"The James Bond Theme\\"-- the BEST VERSION EVER which appears here! It's the fact that like too many others, this album does not accurately reflect the film. And it took me years to realize why. Much of what appears here was CUT from the film when John Barry was called in at the last minute. And none of Barry's contributions appear here! (\\"Shocking...\\" --sorry, wrong film!) And I find the repetition of some tunes here irritating. It was hoped \\"Under the Mango Tree\\" would become a hit single (which is why it replaced the standard, \\"Maryanne\\", that was in the book.) At least \\"Jump Up\\" is a fun number! (But did it have to be here TWICE?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO!! Don't pay for this... do not even listen to it!","review":"Nauseating. How on Earth can anyone believe, after listening to those so-called Calipso-Caribbean puke-inducing songs like those on these CD that Norman actually wrote that masterpiece called \\"James Bond Theme\\"? If I met him in the street, the kindest thing I'd do to him would be spitting in his face. The only consolation John Barry could have for Norman's robbery is that at least he (Barry) doesn't have his name attached to this disgusting, nightmarish frisbee."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like carrabien music, you'll love this!","review":"True, this soundtrack doesn't have much music from the film. Only tracks 1,2,4,6,13,14 and a very hard to hear track 18 are heard on the film but some of the other music is great. I got this soundtrack a year ago just for the great 3 blind mice song. My favourite tracks are 2, 4, 7, 17 and 18. Track 7 Twisting With James is my favourite of them all as it is a great piece of happy, dance music. The first track is the original and best version of The James Bond theme. Track 17 is also called The James Bond Theme perhaps it was considered to be used as the main Bond theme first. The songs: 3 Blind Mice, Jump Up and Under The Mango Tree are classics. They are remixed and used instrumentally throughout the soundtrack. If you want all the music from Dr No, you won't find it hear but if you want easy listening, good music then get this CD. Check out my reviews of other Bond soundtracks too. And over the next month, I'll review them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the Bond scores","review":"After listening to this mess it is not hard to see why Monty Norman wasn't invited back to work on other Bond films. His score as used in the film is hammy and old fashioned, \\"mining disaster music\\" as director Terence Young called it. On the record a lot of music never heard in the film replaces it. Poor cues like 'Audio Bongo' and Twisting with James' abound. There is a track called 'James Bond Theme' which is nothing like the JB theme we know and love but is another version of the melody used in 'Twisting with James'. Norman says that the record company made a mess of the track listings on the original album but it is more than possible that this was one of his original versions of the James Bond Theme that drove the producers to bring in John Barry to save the day.Worth having for completeness but do not expect a great listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doctor No John Barry (Not CompleteCredit) Monty Norman ?","review":"When you compare Volume 1 & 2 Music To Read James Bond By John Barry, while also listen to Basie Meets Bond With Count Basie And Orchestra they understand the real composer \\"\\"JOHN BARRY\\"\\" Who lost out on the copyright but at the last minute composed the original James Bond Medley and does not get credit. If you notice in original movie does not include full song medley of James Bond Medley.The score is duct taped with harsh sounds and does not give the movie it's full honors with music style.John Barry no credit for his contribution.

(the head fits fine straight onto the hose.) He knows how to turn it on & off, but mostly likes dragging it around. He also likes taking the two attachments out. And I love how this vacuum has no real suction because then it would not be safe for my little one.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because he loves this toy so much that he wants to drag it EVERYWHERE.

I simply taped the head onto the pipe that connects to the hose and we'll see how long it lasts. Not pleased with purchase.

Unfortunately he also reveals his own flat-tyre Protestant theology! Comparing words in the two religion's main Scriptures is indeed important and interesting, but the author falls into the \\"Bible-bashing-mode\\" so typical of many protestants. He does not know and does not quote any of the Church Fathers' interpretation of crucial passages, and therefore he fails to make his case agains Islam and its literal understanding of spiritual life. It is a pity, because the author is well-intentioned and enthusiastic. But he talks too much about himself and his friends being \\"spirit-filled\\", and he never manages to get beneath the surface of the Christian Theological arguments against Islam. 2 stars for trying to do it anyway.

It is muddled in it's explanations of Islamic beliefs and (as everyone noted before me, from both sides of the issue) is clearly biased (anti-Islam).

It exaggerates the differences between Christian and Islamic beliefs and gives the impression they are in no way related, when in fact, Muslims and Christians worship the same god.

This practice has nothing whatsoever to do with Islam and is considered amongst Muslims to be a bid'ah (Innovation).

Beside this the author followed every single stereotype they said about islam in the media without even trying to see whether that is true or not. This book is very good for people who want to hate islam or those who want to have false information about islam.

He distorts the text in the Qur'an so as to cast doubt in the younger and less informed Muslim mind. In fact the Qur'an makes mention of such people. All I can really say, is that if you feel this book has a point and you really need to find out, go get the video of the debate Dr.Shorrosh has with Mr.Deedat in Royal Albert Hall, and when you see him singing, yes thats right singing his way out of proving his claims you can judge for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a solid, concrete work by someone who's been there and knows what he's talking about.

Nicolai Gedda is truly one of the greatest singers of the century. But in this memoir he comes off as petulant and unpleasant. He spends too much time dwelling on past trangressions, inconveniences and problems and not enough on his career and the music. I welcome his honesty about his family background, but am disturbed at the way his parents are portrayed.Unfortunately the book is not redeemed by either the writing style nor the fragmented nature of the narrative.Better than some recent singer biographies (Sutherland et. al.) but still disappointing. This is a side of Gedda I wish I didn't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BIRTH OF COOKIE","review":"I look back rather fondly on these old Blondie films.

I always found them hilarious, slapstick fun as a kid and while they don't pack quite the same punch today as they did back then they are still good fun.This film follows the events in \\"Blondie Goes to College\\" where we learned that Blondie was pregnant, In this film both of the bumbstead women...Blondie and Daisy the Dog, have puppies..err...I mean give birth. Blondie gives birth to the newest offspring Cookie, while Dagwood stumbles over himself trying to explai,n childbirth to Alexander. One of the funniest entries in the series filled with some wonderful slapstick.

Once again I feel classic means no spirit, no passion, just a bunch of words to help the reader feel the pain of the author, or characters. Ok, I didn't finish but I felt 50% of the book was more than enough time for me to care about something.First, I don't believe in the main character who calls herself a New Yorker yet says very little. Not in my experience. And she says she's in love with the other woman but has never asked that woman anything. She knows nothing about the OBJECT of her love.Second, I don't love the other woman, nor respect her. She give nothing of herself.And third, What is up with the caveman? Why does the silent NYer spend any time with this brute?Salt is rubbed into the readers eyes as they try to read this and feel any identification with the author.Sorry. There are billions of good books out there. I will go read one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a dissapointment","review":"The premise of the story seemed interesting, but it was written in a way that reminded me of books required for my high school Lit classes. So if you liked your Lit class books, you might like this one, especially since there seems to be an abundance of imagery in it.The characters didn't seem to have much personality and the conversations were rather dull. I like getting into the heads of the characters, reading about what they're thinking and what makes them tick. After reading about 1/4 of the book I started skipping around to find more interesting character interaction - I didn't find many.If you keep in mind that this book was written decades ago, you'll find that it's a groundbreaking book. My aversion to \\"classic literature\\" may have tainted my experience, so keep this in mind when deciding whether or not you want to read it.

Also (spoiler, sorta), over 50 years later, there is still an issue with single women losing their children in divorce because of their sexuality (end spoiler.)The Price of Salt is beautifully written, classy, unique and timeless in many regards.

Many of the best music from the movie were left out, and we are left with sonic dogs like \\"Mojave Club\\" and \\"Eastern Lights\\". It does have its highlights like Bond 77 (even then, some of the best parts as it was heard in the movie was left out in the soundtrack), Ride to Atlantis, and a stunning instrumental version of \\"Nobody Does It Better\\" that just make you want to kick off your shoes, lay back and forget the ills of the world.However, the song as it appears in the movie was left out, as was the end credits, and many of the music in the movie's action scenes were also left out.

There is a great one where music starts near the end of the movie after Stromberg says: \\"Observe Mr. Bond. The instruments of armaggeddon.\\" Also the Bond 77 theme has been re-maked terribly. It isn't like the one in the movie. And that track is why I wanted to get this soundtrack in the first place. Track number 5, an instrumental version of The Spy Who Loved Me did not appear in the movie. And all the Egypt tracks are just plain boring in my opinion.

It is reminiscent of soundtracks issued during the 1950s where composers rearranged their film scores for commercial record albums.Composer, Marvin Hamlisch recorded the music in the film very well and seemed to be quite intuitive on what was required for different scenes. I believe that composers writing a Bond score are given great liberty to call upon previous musical cues from earlier entries in the series and write them into the score.

Broadway wizard Marvin Hamlisch was brought in, again primarily to produce a hit title. Carole Bayer Sager wrote the lyrics, Hamlisch the music and Carly Simon performed what became one of that year's hit songs and one of the best title songs of the Bond series. Alas, the score by Hamlisch left much to be desired. Marvin Hamlisch was not new to the craft of film scoring. After all he had done well with \\"The Sting\\" and \\"The Way We Were.\\" But, at best, his efforts in \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\" were trendy parodies of John Barry motifs. Note especially what happened in the pre-title, \\"Bond '77\\" (compare it with Barry's theme for \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" and even the pre-title music for \\"A View to a Kill\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Biggest!

Carly Simon gives it her all with her magical title song- Nobody Does it Better. A wonderful song that tells us that nobody can do it better than Bond. With thoughful lyrics and a great singer, it earned a reputation as one of the best Bond songs and the #2 spot in the US charts! Wait, there's much more. The track Bond 77 gives us the most disco-exciting 007 melody ever, with several solos from, guitars, saxaphones and synthesizers. Other fantastic tracks are the daunting Tanker and Ride to Atlantis. There is also the end title version of the title song and an instrumental version.

Unfortunately, it's designed in such a way that you're rarely able to enjoy it. The wind catcher that hangs below the bell is very thin and extremely lightweight - so lightweight that it is unable to pull the striker sideways to hit the chime with any significant force. As a result, the only way the chime creates sound is if the wind catcher is blown to an angle of nearly 45 degrees and with some force. Gentle breezes don't do the trick. The cast metal chime is lovely to look at, but if want sound in your garden, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"Sounds great when chiming, however, the clapper is so heavy that it requires Hurricane force wind to contact the bell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find item","review":"We get this every year for a gift for a family memeber.

I think it would be very nice with a morin khuur. The other review says its is meditative. It's nice relaxing music for opening your mail to or background music when you're doing some manual work.

Not one of the four slots can toast evenly, one side is done while the other hasn't browned at all. I expected much better performance for it's price. You are paying for the looks because this toaster is cheaply made. I've also tried a Dualit because I wanted a toaster that was made well, but I experienced the same outcome. I have come to the conclusion that the cheaper the toaster is, the better it toast."},{"rating":"1","title":"It died in 6 months","review":"This toaster worked for 6 months. A small plastic piece which holds the lever down broke making it inoperable. It was impossible to repair."},{"rating":"2","title":"One hot little toaster","review":"This toaster works great... fast and even toasting. One caveat- it is very hot, so on the highest numbers or bagel setting, it gets really dark. It did, if fact, burn the bagel I was cooking on the bagel setting. So, go a notch down from where you'd expect to toast, and it will be perfect. I've toasted bread, bagels, and English muffins very satisfactorily. I'm transitioning from a toaster oven/broiler, so I know I will miss being able to bake and broil small things, but I am happy thus far. I love that the toaster is so fast! My toaster ovens took a minimum of 5 minutes to get even slightly toasted. Enjoy this beautiful product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cool but has its drawbacks","review":"Our first problem with this cage is the constant escaping, we finally set up and watched to see how he was escaping. He gets on the slide and then is able to push enough to get the door open. We did solve this problem by bending the latch and making it harder to open.Second problem, The latch that holds the roof on broke, this wasn't much of a problem since the roof still stays in place with out it, but still..Third problem, the wheel.. One hamster liked to put bedding in it and it falls out the little holes and gets every where, another hamster liked to potty in there and of course it fell out the holes too and was VERY messy. I ended up taking off the wheel and slide.Fourth problem, you have to take the whole thing apart to clean it. Its frustrating, but you get good at putting it back together!But now after having it a year the top lid has broken and it will have to be replaced.On the bright side this cage looks cool has a lot of space. but has alot of draw backs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't mess with Parker!","review":"Another great Parker novel. Stark/Westlake always throws out a few imagery gems that make you smile. For example, to describe the freshly washed caravan of armored cars: \\"The four armored cars lumbered like costumed circus elephants...\\" You can almost picture them trunk-to-tail!Unusually, this Parker novel doesn't wrap up all the ends in a neat package. The finale is a cliff hanger of sorts. I'm anxiously awaiting the next one to find out what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happens next?","review":"I happen to be a fan of Westlake's, as himself and as Stark. However, I found this last book very disappointing. The character of the female bounty hunter is interesting, but then she suddenly disappears, even though it is suggested she is on a track. On the other hand, we find out more than we need to know about what happens to another character, Dr. Madchen, even though he is almost peripheral to the story. At the end, the hero is last seen climbing a hill, with dogs and cops in pursuit. I suppose that explains the title.On his own website, Westlake says \\"the only thing wrong with the ending is that it suggests the end of a series\\". I suppose authors love even their misses. I hope he redeeems himself next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid crime fiction","review":"Parker signs on to do an armored car job. Unfortunately, too many amateur cooks spoil the stew...I really like the author's Dortmunder series, so thought I'd try some of his other stuff. Glad I did: while not as funny as Dortmunder, Parker is still as shrewd and calculating. Stark (aka Westlake) is a good writer with a good sense of pacing and plots. Technically, this book invokes a pet peeve of mine: willful stupidity on the part of the characters as a means of moving the plot along. However, I'm willing to forgive it here, as its actually in character of the characters to act so boneheadedly dim, and Westlake does a good job of dancing around it.The book ends on a cliffhanger, so if you want to find out what happens you'll also need to pick up \\"Ask the Parrot (Parker Novels).\\"I don't know how this book stands up against other Parker novels (I'm suspecting well) but if you like the author, I'm willing to bet you'll like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"possibly the most evocative ending of a Parker novel yet","review":"Like all the other Parker capers, this one has a hard, relentless \\"hero\\" and a caper that all sorts of flakes and investigators want in on. I enjoyed the ending more than any other Parker ending yet; it evoked the barking of bloodhounds and the snap of cold air in the woods as winter nears. A nearly lyrical end to a book starring a very bad man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody Runs Forever","review":"This was a pretty good crime novel. It kept my interest and the characters were well defined. However, throughout the book there were typos, mostly misaligned words and punctuation. I imagine this was a problem in the adaptation for Kindle. I wasn't going to say anything until I noticed a missing passage towards the end of the book. I am new to the kindle and hope this isn't going to be a common problem. For the price of these books we should be getting a better edited product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crappy sequal to a good game","review":"Allied Assault was a great game. Fun missions and good gameplay. Graphics were pretty good for its time. Spearhead was going downhill but still enjoyable. Breakthrough however, is utter crap.

In a world full of cookie cutter produced music without any real substance, Syleena's music has always shone thru like a true diamond in a sea of cheap cut glass imitations. That is, until this album.Not only did she sell out on this album with crap songs like \\"Phone Sex\\" and \\"Slowly\\" but this whole album lacks the true Syleena voice, and power that the other albums have. The album does have some good points, \\"Still Open, Another Relationship, and Apartment for Rent\\" are all great cuts, or maybe they just sound better because they are surrounded by the rest of the crap on the disc.Please do better next time Syleena, your fans miss the quality we have come to expect from you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Flesh is weak","review":"I think all of these five-star reviews are for Syleena herself and not for this album. I know that she's the real deal, underrated and yada yada yada but it seems like she's selling out here. She shed her clothes and is now singing more sexually explicit songs like \\"Phone Sex\\" and \\"Slowly\\". And when she's not doing that, the results aren't much better. The songwriting seems uninspired, Syleena sounds like she doesn't want to sing them and there are too many unnecessary guest stars. \\"Apartment for Rent\\" and \\"He Makes Me Say\\" are the only reasons why I didn't take this album back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Bland and BAD!","review":"I first heard the song: \\"Hypnotic\\" months ago and I LOVE that song. It is a bumper through and through. However, this CD is a DUD through and through. Boring collaborators (Common, Anthony Hamilton) yawn. It is one sappy mess from the beginning to the end.

So if she's been a naughty, so be it. Get over it. She is grown, an adult, whose admitted to making mistakes. This cd is really nice.

This movie is not clever, creative, complex, French or any of the other things that may inspire such mixed reviews. It's just plain boring. Nothing happens.

This movie may have had a fighting chance if it was about an hour longer. But, as released in the U.S., the movie seems like a crudely slapped together collection of short excerpts from what the real movie should have been. Tommy Lee Jones basically plays himself and the other big name characters are not given enough script to develop their characters. Actually, given the large number of characters in the story, and the multiple story lines, this may not have been the best Burke novel to bring to the screen. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waist your time watching this movie!!!","review":"As you watch the movie you try to link all the murders and the different events in the movie, but it is useless.

To consider the money they had for this movie and the caliber of cast, such as Tommy Lee Jones to play Robicheaux it's absolutely a ginormous shame! It was directed by an old Canadian dude near 70 who clearly did NOT get J.L.B.'s writing, tone and feel of Louisiana, the dark underbelly, the southern Gothic dark tale at all. I wonder if he even read any of his books..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book","review":"In the Electric Mist With Conferate Dead was the first novel I had ever read by James Lee Burke and I immediately became a fan. When I heard that a movie version was in production and starring Tommy Lee Jones as Burke's protagonist Dave Roubiceaux, I assumed that it would be a box office hit and a classic movie. Not so. The fact that it was released directly to DVD surprised me but curiousity made me go ahead and buy it through Amazon. Unless you've read the book first, save your money. I found this movie to be a confusing mess of a great novel. Burke's writing is poetic but you'd never guess it by watching this movie.

He knows the subtleties of a southern man. The cast in general is good and the adaptation doesn't stray far and is well directed. If you are a fan of James Lee Burke, you will probably enjoy this movie.If you don't now of Burke's work, but enjoy a flawed protagonist, colorful characters, connected criminals and Louisianan idiosyncrasies, you might enjoy this movie, give it a try while it is available on Prime and you could become a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Great movie, good part for TLJ.

But, not this one.This movie revolves around a sheriff who is in search of a serial killer that goes around killing young women in Lousiana.

When I read his books, the Spirit in my heart is constantly saying :\\"Yes!\\". When I search the Scriptures I find nothing but confirmation of his teachings. He does not show us the easy path, he does not teach us, what Bonhoeffer calls \\"cheap grace\\". In my opinion he shows us the path of true discipleship. I use his books in my teaching and in my preaching. May God bless you, Pastor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Broaden the perspective","review":"Though I truly enjoyed this film, particularly the characters portrayed in it, I found myself wishing that the director had taken more advantage of the third-person perspective that film allows. While director Ann Turner retains the first-person point of view of the stories written by Alan Marshall, I felt that a little broadening of the viewpoint might have helped the development of this film. A couple of the scenes and characters were left largely undeveloped, making me wonder why they were left in at all, other than the fact that these were some of the people in the town.Despite the need for some expansion, this is a truly charming film. The actors do a wonderful job with material that could be considered somewhat controversial without ever making the audience feel uncomfortable. Scenes that could be embarassing to watch are instead handled with such grace that the viewer is allowed to stay emotionally connected with the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUSSELL CROWE","review":"Although a good film, I just cannot show this newly purchased DVD to girlfriends or buddies.

I was surprized the opening sequence was him frolicking nude with a bunch of horses.

Here were my problems the first week in using it:1. Handle is extremely hot - a mitt is required.2. Hinges on handle are extremely dangerous - while pouring, the kettle may swing from side-to-side - not good when you are pouring boiling hot water.3. Due to the open-spout design, it takes slightly longer for the water to come to a boil.4. The handle in general was designed poorly - once the water gets hot, it contracts and falls to a side, thus literally melting the handle since it is not heat proof. Mine melted on both sides the first week.I am a fan of many Bodum products...just not this one. Bodum should consider redesigning it for consumer safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Equal to the Original","review":"I have used the original product through friends for a number of years. This product is flimsy by comparison. It has not held up well. I do not not know the gauge of the original metal, but it is considerably stronger.

It is usable as is, but neither substanial nor pleasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HANDLE IS TOO HOT TO HANDLE.","review":"This is a great looking teapot, but the handle is a problem.

I've been a big Matthews fan and loved Power in the Blood and One True Thing. This novel was something rare. It was pretty much a blatant ( ) of Catcher in the Rye, but he pulled it off so well that I think it may have been even better. The cast of odd characters are fantastic and Matthews masterfully holds up the structure of the novel(The whole thing is Burris Weems speaking into his stolen tape recorder).

The rest of the album is also quite good and I believe Bill Berry of REM wrote the song motorcade. And the last song on this cd is an absolutely amazing and good-feeling instrumental that is so awesome -it's hard to describe. Berry probably learned a thing or two from this quartet - that didn't rise all the way to maximum u.s. popularity because they focused on creating the most excellent music not being popular and image-conscious.

This is rather unfortunate as even though Unbelievable is a great song, it's not even the best song on this album, much less their later albums. This is the album that sealed the band's fate. After a \\"perfect\\" pop album like this, EMF found it impossible to break out and become the heavier, electro-metal band they seemed to prefer to be. Some clues of the direction they seemed to want to go in are on display in the wonderful \\"Long Summer Days\\" which is the hardest song on the album. But dance is the word of the day, and I can't see many people not wanting to dance to virtually every song on Schubert Dip. I recommend you give this album a listen if you want to hear how dance music really should be, want to remember the days before grunge, or just want to hear some really good tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional","review":"These are a good size to keep track of bottles and that sort of thing.

This book is a good example of this trend. It is a collection of writings by various people who claim to have had such experiences. There are a few accounts that seem to be genuine, written in plain language by ordinary people who had a profound experience, but the great majority of stories are fluffy, fanciful, painfully new-agey (or religious) tracts that read like they were written by would-be professional authors who want to be published. I am interested in the subject of NDEs but this book was nothing but a frustrating waste of money and time.

Although he didn't do so with every one, he did so enough with others to help newbie and advanced Christians to know right from wrong.His chapter on the Mormons was larger then the others, not to my surprise, and which I was actually hoping would be the case. I wasn't surprised that it was because there is so much easy to access information on the internet about Mormons, much of it damaging to Mormonism.The only things I found disappointing was that there was no mention of the Assembly of God a.k.a. the AOG or as far as I know, the Church of Christ International."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

Thus, the one caution I would issue with this cage is if you use the automatic feeder be sure your hamster is actually getting enough food. I supplement my automatic feeder with an extra food dish in my hamster's cage for safety sake. It's normal for a hamster to store extra food in his cage.

Immediately strange things start happening and no one in the local town wants to talk about the history of the house that is called Blackbiar. Excellent descriptive writing and a plot that keeps the reader on the edge of his/her seat.

I am also a sucker for a haunted house story. I am glad that I read it. Up until the end I found myself not believing that it really was a kid's story. It had major chill factor. In the end it became very Scooby Dooish even with a comment along the lines of \\"We would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids\\" It is a pretty short read and I am glad that I decided to pick it up. Let your kids read it and if you have a special place for a haunted house story then be sure to borrow it from them!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RFBR","review":"It's been a long wait for this album to be released on CD.

It was a bit different from the others in that (spoiler ahead) Sean was married through most of the book, and the second half found them married in every since of the word. That confused me at first, wondering what more was there to pursue, but there was SO MUCH MORE and Lori did such a wonderful job in taking us all the way there. It was so nice watching this husband and wife grow closer.Though not as exciting as the \\"A Place Called Home\\" series, \\"The Californians\\" is still a very good series. I can't wait to start on her next series!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story line, but lacking and unconvincing.","review":"The beginning of the story was very interesting and even a little suspenseful. However, as soon as Sean marries the woman who saves him from being hung, he suddenly seems to transform from an angry, rough guy to a perfect gentleman. I found that very unconvincing, and it just didn't seem to work with the first part of the story. The rest of the story was all right, but it didn't really seem like it was the same story anymore. The characters frequently \\"almost panic\\" or do double-takes over the littlest things. It was really pretty boring, and not worth reading after all.This is the only series of hers I've read, and the only good one was \\"Donovan's Daughter\\", the last book.

He is one of the pioneers on diving with aqualungs. And he enjoys diving at Ceylon, currently called Sri Lanka. Plus he loves the marine adventure stories like Melvil's Moby Dick or Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.If you share the love of such thrilling marine adventure shown in aforementioned works and the fans of the movies like LEVIATHAN, or ABYSS, this 50s Clarke work is perfect for you.By the way this story also shows that Clarke can not live without space materials (just find out this by searching for Franklin's past). Also shown is his respect for Bhuddism and Dalai Lama like character drives the story into the depth.Verdict: Not a space adventure as his noted works but really an enjoyable read.Rating: 83 out of 100Recommended for: Clarke's fan. And marine adventure stories' fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"1957's view of life under the ocean in the 21st Century.","review":"The one thing that The Deep Range may have going for it, now that it is far past its pulp science-fiction hype, is that it was probaly part of the inspiration for many of today's techo-thriller writers.Many writers probably read this novel and said \\"I can write better than this\\".

While he shares with us his discoveries and reflections on evils committed in his life, he also is unabashed in his joyous sharing of God's revelations to him.Some of this reads like an unabridged prayer journal, and some has clearly been reworked after the fact. Regardless, Mr. Mariani has a gift for words, and he tells a great story. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end.My only caveat is that this is Mr. Mariani's journey, not yours.

This book has inspired me even to the point that I too am now considering making the 30 day retreat - that is if I ever can resolve to do the necessary work such an adventure requires.

It will help you avoid mistakes, things you'd never think of, which will make it easier on you and your family/friends. And if you're planning on coming out, this book will give you hope, and a goal.

It went straight to DVD, with a major star like Bruce Willis in it, just says it all, a really bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redbox Kiosk Rating","review":"Experience from many Redbox rentals is teaching this slow learner that when unknown movies, often straight from studio, appear in a Redbox Kiosk that it's there for a reason - it's too cheaply bad to survive in a theater. So in honor of my newly acquired insight we have a new rating category that is below one star and it's called the Kiosk rating (I was going to call it the Redbox but I don't want to be sued.)Anyway, Willis is creatively stuck in a decades old time warp of repeating bad crime movie acting coupled with cohort actors equally as bad and a script that was so inane I was mostly comatose throughout the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy or Flop?","review":"This is an AWFUL film.

Watching Willis I could only think that actors have also got to eat...not everything can be a blockbuster. Still he could have at least tried. Ryan Phillippe sleep walks here and I can't believe this was this same guy in the great, WAY OF THE GUN. Probably the whole thing just doesn't work because the action centers around the character played by 50 Cent - who can't act worth a plug nickel (but I think he produced the flick).

But as time passed, the hope of salvation waned. Jackson(.50 cent) should stick to rapping, his skill on the screen are mediocre at best. The plot had potential, but the awful writing and dreadful acting laid it to rest. Bruce(Willis) was up to speed, but he just had nothing to work with and even with his acting prowess he could not save this stinker.

Sometimes, they're so practical that they're funny. For example, after the main character said that his friend was dead. the priest replied:\\" Your friend would be in heaven\\". The guy asked \\"How do you know? Have you been dead before?\\"- There was a couple of suspenseful scenes. For example, the scene where Mia was interrogated by the enforcer.- However it has numerous illogical holes that are as big as tanks. Many times, they're so big that they become ridiculous. Even a kid in grade 9 can find that those scenes are so far-fetched. For example, Bruce Willis who played a big crime boss but he acted like a fool in the last scene- 50 cent's acting does not help either.In short, it's a below-average show."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This is definately NOT up to the standard of Bruce Willis' acting ability or past movies.

Also, it would be helpful a book or video that tells us about the origins of this wonderful dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not terrific cardio-but LOTS of FUN","review":"I like doing this tape accompanied with another, more intense video tape. Or sometimes I merely do the tape twice. It's not a very intense workout. Very low impact. But it is quite a bit of fun. I'd say it's good for those who haven't been in the exercise game for a while. And for those who are in pretty good shape, this is a great video on one of your majorly light days, or just for one of your fun days. Belly Dancing really does bring out a Fun, Sensual side to you! The girls in the video are nice and it's an overall low stress workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Inspiration","review":"These videos have totally inspired me. I do the workouts all the time and never get bored. I think their instruction is excellent and makes me want to learn more about belly dancing, so much more that I bought their other tapes.

Only do it for home and pleasure.Their dance at the end of the videos are wonderful. I could watch them all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving the videos","review":"I purchased the boxed set a few weeks back, but I'm just now really getting into them. I started with the arms and abs, and my arms are really burning after just 30 minutes of working out. I've found they go at a nice, steady pace. But don't take that to mean you won't sweat. Some of the moves are a little hard to get at first, but I practice in front of a mirror and try to imitate what I see them doing until I'm satisfied with it. I've seen people complaining that they're not learning any bellydance moves. It's fitness for beginners. You're learning the basics to help you lose weight. These movies weren't created to turn you into a bellydance Primadonna. I definitely recommend this if you're looking for a steady workout that really does isolate the specific parts of the body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"These women are great dancers but they are not great aerobic instructors. Their warm-ups are not long enough to get you sufficiently warmed up enough. I found that my muscles were locking up halfway through the video. The movements are also too isolated. I know that doesn't sound right... what I mean is that if you have an injury like I do, the amount of time the spend holding variations of the same movement wears out my muscles. I cannot hold my arms up in the air for any great length of time. This is a good portion of the workout. They workout the arms then the torso then the legs. If they had spaced out their movements and worked out different muscle groups at \\"random\\" instead of in isolation I could have done these videos.Ultimately a disappointment. I can't use these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Booorrrring!","review":"I found this set boorring! There was more leg lifts and sit-ups than bellydancing. I felt like I could get this workout from Kathy Smith, but at least she's personable and friendly.

I do enjoy watching the dancing at the beginning and end of each video and the music is really great. I found the incomplete instruction and lack of transition make the videos hard to follow.Neena & Veena are performing the exercises but there is another woman narrating and there is no verbal transition from one exercise to the next which makes it hard to follow at first. There is also no real instruction to explain what it is you are supposed to be doing, you just have to figure it out by watching what is going on on your screen. This makes it even harder to follow because you are focusing on what they are doing and not really doing anything yourself. When you are just starting out you may not see any benefit until you really learn the moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a good workout set...","review":"I lead a group of women who are learning belly dance through videos and here are what we have said about this set...Basic moves:Great for stretching and learning the very basics.

I know that mine are getting solid.Fat Burning:Very intense! You may need to work up to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TEACHERS!","review":"I bought these videos out of curiosity. I always wanted to discover what Belly dancing was about. From my first viewing I was hooked! Their teaching style is perfect for me, slow and with plenty of repetitions. Their moves were so graceful that I wanted to emulate them immediately. I had been a gym rat for as long as I can remember, and could never achieve that \\"sculpted\\" tummy look I had always wanted. After six weeks of working out daily with the two begginer tapes, the improvement was remarkable. I now dare to wear cropped tops and low rider jeans without feeling ashamed of my body. I'm 42 and my belly looks better than that of a 18 year old! I now own almost all their videos and continue to exercise and dance with Neena and Veena everyday. Try these products, you will not be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been taught in one video","review":"I felt ripped off by being sold 4 videos, when only one was really bellydance: Basic Moves.

The twins are beautiful, but I wish I had not bought these tapes, unless you are really old or REALLY out of shape I would not bother with these, and try something else, I like Shamira, and Dolphina's Video's MUCH better. I would give these videos I have bought of NEENA & VEENA away but I don't want someone to think so poorly of bellydancing. So in other words they are so bad I wouldn't give them away. Children may enjoy watching them but these are NOT for any semi-serious adult who wants to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a satisfying workout.....","review":"There's only one video I like in this boxed set and that is the slim down.The music is a little boring and so are the twins, wish they introduce more moves.I do like the voice over.

If you want a good workout get The sensous workout with Shamira and The Goddess workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed in this set...I want my money back.","review":"I had heard about how great these tapes were but once I got them, I was so disappointed. The videos are so BORING and there isn't as much belly dancing as I expected. I felt like I was doing a workout video- not belly dancing. For most of the videos, it's the same movements done over and over. I really didn't like having two instructors- it made it confusing and they don't have a lot of personality. The best part of the video is the routine that's shown at the end.

I loved that taste right away. For the uninitiated it is basically a bean dip, consisting of garbanzo beans (aka Chick peas) with added spices, and Tahini, which is sesame based peanut butter. According to Wikipedia: \\"Chickpeas are high in protein and one of the earliest cultivated vegetables. 7,500-year-old remains have been found in the Middle East\\". Nowadays I'm a nut for the Casbah hummus mix. My recipe: mash 1 can of garbanzo beans, add the mix, stir in water to your preferred consistancy. Eat with whole wheat pita bread, tomatos, onion. A healthy, satisfying, inexpensive, easy to make meal. There are many recipes to make hummus from scratch on the net, most pretty basic.

The clips are insufficient, and they need to be snapped in after popping off every time we adjust the canopy;4. Vibration motor rattles against sleep platform.

Its biggest weakness is screwing in when there's not an existing hole -- since it's one-size-fits-all, it doesn't hold things securely. If there's existing holes and you can start the screw with your fingers, it works pretty well. Where it shines is unusual shapes -- it's way better than trying to use a pliers to screw/unscrew a hook, eye bolt, or wing nut. It won't replace your toolbox, but it definitely has a place in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi-adequate for light stuff","review":"Overall this was pretty disappointing, but one has to wonder whether some industrial designer could fix its inherent flaws. It's cheaply made and has a lot of slop in it, and sometimes the spring isn't strong enough to pop the pins back into position -- pain in the neck to re-position.It's far too inferior in quality to be used for serious mechanical work, but it might be handy if you were installing a whole bunch of big plant hangers, or something else strangely shaped.The basic idea might be workable, but the actual tool is of the \\"99-cent tool bin\\" quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS","review":"The \\"Gator Grip\\" broke first time out.

I've tried it on various things in my home and on my car and it have been completely useless. It does not provide a good \\"grip\\" of the nut and just keeps on slipping off and I have to constantly re-adjust it. It often will grip for about a half of a turn and then it slips off. Sometimes it takes a while just to make it get a grip of the nut at all.... For $[money amount], I can just buy myself a regular set of sockets and wrench.My recommendation would be don't waste your money and save yourself the frustration of trying to get it to work well. For all the time you waste getting it to grip and all the re-adjusting, you can find the correct sized socket and take off the nut already (you can probably put it back on and take it off again before you even take off the nut once with the Gator Grip)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Gadget -- Not a Serious Tool","review":"As other reviewers have noted, the Gator Grip Socket is for very light duty use. Apply any pressure whatsoever to the ratchet handle and the Gator Grip slips off the bolt head, damaging itself in the process. I had used mine only 10 minutes before several of the pins were jammed up inside the mechanism, and they haven't functioned properly since. The idea is clever, but in reality the geometry and physics just don't cooperate for this to be that useful or reliable of a tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gator Strip","review":"I've seen these in retail stores that have a sample display. I wen't to try it out and here's my findings: The Gator Grip had stripped all the nuts and bolts on the display. So I really wasn't able to try it with an unstripped nut. My thoughts on the engineering of the tool is that the pins in it are round and don't provide a good grip, therefore stripping nuts and bolts with multiple use. The bottom line is, don't use it on things that you have to loosen or tighten many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift, genuine Omega","review":"Price was unbeatable by any dealer.

But then when you finally try to have a substantial conversation you realize they are thoroughly uninteresting, and just sort of suck all around. Well, it's the musical equivalent of that.They set a great vibe for beer drinking, sitting on the porch, etc. Just like a tape of whales calling to each other really gives you that authentic ocean feel. But nice as they sound, whales don't write good music and niether do the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.Alot of people see music's primary function as providing a nice background.

During my years of service I read everything I could get my hands on about NBC warfare. I don't know how I missed this book, but was eager to read it as Lewisite is still one of the chemical agents current forces are taught to protect against. Dew of Death follows the history of the creation of Lewisite, attributed to Winford Lee Lewis and others during the closing days of World War One. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the learning the dangers associated with chemical warfare. It tends to be a bit technical at times, so the unknowledgeable might find it a bit tedious, but those in the know will be shocked at how this weapon came to be and how it remains a deadly substance in the 21st century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliffhanger Ripoff","review":"Simply said \\"I didn't get what was in the ad.\\" My Cliffhanger didn't come with \\"Spy Smashers\\" ( had a documentary instead)Also I didn't see anywhere in the ad that said \\"selected chapters' Every serial has several missing chapters.(which of course takes away most of the fun of having these old serials)"},{"rating":"1","title":"PRETTY MUCH [NOT WORTH IT]","review":"Spy Smasher & King of the Rocket Men are NOT included in this box.

The stunt work (mostly by stunt ace, David Sharpe)is phenomenal.

The fight scenes are incredibly choreographed. I especially enjoyed the fight in the second chapter, where one of the good guys who has his hands tied behind him still gets into the fight and does quite well for himself even without the use of arms and hands. An added touch that makes this serial special is the irony of the similarity of the ending of chapters 2 and 11, and subsequent resolvings in 3 and 12. Oh yes, did you notice the clever plug for another Republic serial, DICK TRACY VS CRIME, INC., in Chapter 9?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Spy Smasher or King of Rocket Men in this set","review":"Spy Smasher and King of the Rocket Men are not in this set!!!

As well you only get a couple selected chapters each serial and that [smells.] You do get Radar Men From The Moon, but I have it already and will be selling my box set soon enough here. I bought this for Spy Smasher and King of the Rocket Men and I'm pretty upset that they are not here. You get a total of four serials edited and a documentary.

To my surprise, the comic wasn't that good. Republic improved the character vastly, even giving us two heroes for one (Kane Richmond, an earlier hero of one of the worst serials ever made, \\"The Lost City,\\" redeems himself playing twins in what is arguably the best serial of all time). Direction by that unsung titan of action film, William Witney, and spectacular stunts by the likes of David Sharpe and Tom Steele don't hurt, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing!","review":"Initially banned in France in the 60s, this film version of Diderot's shocking novel about a young woman forced into the nunnery is considered the most traditional of New Wave master Jacques Rivette's oeuvre.

The film is greatly abetted by the superb performances of the sterling cast-- Micheline Presle as the kindly mother superior, Liselotte Pulver as a lesbian nun and Anna Karina, Godard's muse and then wife, in the title role. Karina's performance is unforgettable,making this film one of the important achievements in French cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the Mantis","review":"My Mantis tiller is two years old, has less than 5 hours run time on it, and doesn't run.

Yes, the front and back cover art is cheesy but so is everything in between it. The plot is ridiculous. The love story is creepy. (Falling in love with one's foster brother/sister is not sexy!!). The main characters are sappy and weak, especially the female protagonist, Honneure, who cries and faints throughout the whole book. As for the historical details regarding Versailles and The Terror they are nothing special when compared to more detailed works like \\"Forever Amber\\" or \\"The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B.\\" by Susan Gulland.

When I first learned that the recordings had been remastered, my first hope was that all the noises of conversation and glasses clinking would be removed.

They are all fabulous, and this one is just as good as the others. In all of his books, Mr. Hall is able not only to deliver a plot that entertains and keeps you turning the page--certainly a must in this genre!--but also unique and quirky characters rendered with the skill and care of a mainstream novelist. Mr. Hall's sense of place is spectacular as well. If you love the beauty of the Texas Hill country, you will smell the mesquite coming off the pages of this book. Esbeth Walters, the 72 year old sleuth of this novel and other Russ Hall novels, is one of the joys of this genre. Look, there are more famous mystery novelists that you can read, but Mr. Hall is as good as any of them.

Well, then I found it used in great condition cheap and gave it a try lately. I have made several things and all have been very good/excellent. The Thai cole slaw is rediculously good/addictive, for example. The one that frankly surprised me the most was her rosemary foccaccia version. The dough is really sticky/loose. Doesn't seem like it would come out. Usually my instincts are pretty right on stuff like that and I make adjustments and end up with something that works. This time I didn't, I just stuck with her instructions, figuring I'd get a bit of a mess. WOW, it was delicious, great texture, great taste, even looked good enough to photograph.

The text requires a certain knowledge of history that could make it hard on the non-Anglophile, but it is well researched and noted. My copy of the book is hardbound and printed on a sturdy matte paper that reproduces the illustraions well.

The twin angle is really played here - for some rather unexpected results.

When i read Ruby, i felt somewhat sympathetic to Ruby and all her problems....but not anymore. How could she screw Paul that way when he was willing to go against his mother's wishes and nature itself to make her happy. Paul reminds me so much of a Troy. Unlike Troy, he was willing to forget their relation fast enough and was strong enough to accept it. This whole thing sucks...Ruby changes places w/ her invalid twin so that she could be with the man that took advantage of her? She leaves Paul taking care of Giselle...imagining it was really Ruby he was taking care of. I just feel so sorry for Paul that he was abused by Ruby in such a cruel way.

Andrews novel and I dare to say that they went downhill right from here. The first two Landy books were good - they were similar to the other series but there was something charming about it, also, I liked Ruby's character. In this book, I honestly wanted to kick her butt.First of all - why did she marry Paul? She knew not only that he is her brother, but also that he is deeply in love with her. Secondly - this whole pretending-to-be-Gisselle was ridiculous. Everyone knew how different these twins were despite their looks. Ruby behaved selfish throughout the entire book, so did Beau. And all of the others died, I think ... is that supposed to be a plot?!

Andrews books that have been published so far, and my favorite series is the Landry series. Of the Landry series, my favorite book is \\"All That Glitters.\\" The book is packed full of suspense, excitement and tragedy that could have been prevented. The descriptions of New Orleans, the Bayou and Cypress Woods are vivid, and quite different and refreshing than the other series. Although this is my favorite book of all V.C. Andrew books, it was quite disappointing: Ruby was selfish, Beau was selfish and Giselle was her normal self. Paul was the only character I liked in the book, he had an enormous amount of love, respect and devotion for Ruby and Pearl, which was more than admirable. I was shocked that Ruby could use Paul and disgard him so easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her greatest novels","review":"Any thing by Andrews is worth reading.

You begin reading and before you know it your done with the book and waiting for her next novel.

In book #1 the spelling for Grandmere's friend was Thibbodeau & in book #2 it was all of a sudden Thirbodeau & in book #3 it was Thibodeau. 2 b's then an r & no 1 b. Also, in this book at one point Ruby was remembering the day that she painted Beau nude & remembered that later that same day was when they made love for the first time but it wasn't later that day it was immediately after she painted the portrait. I just feel that the author of this book is not even that much into the series that they're forgetting little details. These aren't huge things but I'm finding many little things like this that's just irritating me. This is the 5th series I've read of V.C. Andrew's so far & I have to admit that I think it's my least favorite. I would recommend an earlier series from her & skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful","review":"All that Glitters, begins a year after Ruby returns to Houma, and gives birth to Pearl. The book is very suspense-filled, and has many dark chills in it. It is sort of like a soap opera. But it has the same senario as all of past V.C. Andrews books. What makes it fun, is that it takes place in the swamps of the bi-yu!!!I found it suspenseful and faced-paced because, in the first half of the book, Ruby marries her half-brother, Paul. But they keep their distance from each other! Still they both pretend Pearl is their child, and they reside, in the deep swamps of Houma.All of a sudden that brick wall falls, and Ruby is living with Beau in New Orleans, as her twin sister Giselle.There is a chilling climax that will leave you reading the last three chapters without putting the book down. You will enjoy it!Although you might think Ruby is a little self-ish to the people who love her the most."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing, and it is part a long line of cliches","review":"After reading the Dollanger(?) series, the Casteel, Cutler and even \\"My Sweet Audrina\\", I found the Landry series to be lacking in originality, plot, and the climaxes left something to be desired. I was an avid reader of V.C. Andrews for a very long time and collected all the books up to the 3rd Landry. It was all so depressing and unoriginal that I couldn't bring myself to read anymore. The author killed off so many key characters that it was really hard to finish the book. Also, I found myself actually disliking the heroine for all her weaknesses despite her hardships. I would like to say this though, all the books before this were well-written, had likeable characters that the reader could relate with, and were all around DAMN GOOD BOOKS!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill from here.","review":"I was with the character of Ruby up until this book. But when she assumed her comatose's sister's identity I think that was it for me.I tried reading later novels, specifically the Orphans series, but those turned out to be teen novels.Do yourself a favour and just reread the first three series and \\"My Sweet Audrina\\" -- they're ten times as enjoyable as anything that comes afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!","review":"All That Glitters is by far one of V.C.

I really enjoyed the first couple maybe even three family series but it quickly became obvious that V.C. Andrews only knew how to blow \\"one note\\". Makes you wonder if she was living out some sick fantasy or trying to exercise some private demons of her own. Then the publishers went to great pains to find writers to fill the void when Ms. Andrews died. I would like to see these \\"ghost writers\\" give the fans something more true to life. Most of us are women, some of us have had hard lives or gotten some bad breaks but we endure and are strong and can lead happy lives, with or without men.I know my review wasnt very complementary and I will continue reading V.C. Andrews books but I wont pay full price for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"All that glitters ain't Gold!!!","review":"All that Glitters was so boring and predictable. The story is so weak. Who didn't see that Ruby was going to change identities with her twin sister? Such a lame, unimaginative, boring, predictable book. I didn't even like the characters. I was not at all sympathetic toward Paul. And why does the incest theme run throughout this book? I'm giving it a 4, because it was better than the Cutler series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as all the other books, but with different characters","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I have read every VC Andrews book and they all seem to blend together. In every book, there is a girl who has a really hard life, gets raped or abused by someone extremely close to her (ie father, uncle, etc.), finds out that the people she believed was her family is NOT, finds out she is actually very rich, and has some sort of incestuous realtionship with her brother because it was too late when her real identity was discovered. The sad part is that this occurs in every book in one form or another. The daughter always repeats her mother's mistakes. I think it's time to think of a new plot or stop writing these books all together. I do not find these enjoyable anymore because I know what exactly is going to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"Although this was a good book, it wasn't as great as i expected.

Le Doulos has Jean-Paul Belmondo, who presumably was one of the most famous French actors at the time. It should be added, however, that the others are no less impressing. The story line tends to be a bit complex every now and then, not the least because of the many characters figuring in it and their subtle and many-faced interrelations. So I hasten to say that this should be interpreted as a compliment rather than as a point of criticism. Le Doulos is a fascinating and absorbing movie experience from the first moment on. Definitely worth watching at least twice. As we expect from Criterion, the movie is delivered in excellent quality including a number of interesting extras such as archival interviews with the director and main star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy and delicious, as good food and good sex !","review":"This is a hilarious and revolutionary cookbook !

Even worse, anyone knowledgeable about weight training should be able to see that most of the exercises are minimal and incomplete, and will most likely lead to underdevelopment in martial arts conditioning.

And panned it deserved to be. This should have remained a personal fun project between him and Yoko that stayed in the bedroom and never saw the light of day.

With his new avant-garde wife at his side -- and enough money in the bank to last a lifetime -- Lennon set about ruining his bank value so he could return to being a 'private citizen.' All three albums -- Two Virgins, Life With The Lions & Wedding Album -- are potent reminders of a simpler time when artists could experiment wildly (or just be very silly) and still get released and distributed (erm, somewhat).

Sad toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, except for the end, if you can make it","review":"I rented this video from the library so thankfully I lost no money. I was expecting a fun belly dancing video. Instead, I found myself slowing moving, repeatedly and bouncing on one leg. You never really get to dance, and it is not an instructional video. I was extremely bored with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooorrrring","review":"This video features all of about three moves, and not even any simple combinations. There is no motivation--the instructors don't even instruct--this is all done via voiceover. Stretching is poor--areas that are worked out extensively in the aerobic portion aren't even stretched prior. No focus or direction on form, either. One section had you moving with your finger stuck to your forehead for about five minutes. Even if you're a beginner, I wouldn't bother. I also own the Goddess Workout and, while it's a little cheesy, it's alot more fun--and I had never bellydanced before in my life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!!!","review":"The description on the back of this video should have simply said, \\"You will hop around on one foot, then switch and repeat for a little less than a half an hour. All this will be accompanied by cheesy, annoying music. You will feel robbed of your money.\\"In all fairness, I haven't seen the other videos in this series, but this one sure doesn't make me want to give them a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bellydance, and not necessarily \\"beginner\\"","review":"I was disappointed in this video. It seemed promising at first, but the moves were extremely repetitive. While it is a workout video for cardio, not an instructional dance video, it is still listed as a \\"bellydance\\" video. It really isn't. It is a good cardio workout once it gets going if you don't mind the tedium of doing the same move over and over. It starts very slowly though. And as it is all up on your toes and hopping around, it causes a great deal of strain on the calves. I'm rather fit, and I was still so sore in the calves the next two days that I walked funny. In short, there are many many exercise videos that are more balanced, more interesting with variation, and not so straining on one particular area when it's supposed to be an all-over cardio workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative","review":"I was very disappointed in this video, I have all the other Bidasha twin videos, but this one was very unimaginative. They keep doing one step over and over ..... this video is not worth it .... try any of the other bellydance videos ... just skip this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT bellydance!!","review":"The set was nice, and the instructors were cheerful, but bellydancing is NOT jumping and hopping around on one leg, then the other. It should be classified under aerobics, and have NO bellydancing whatsoever in the title.I have taken bellydance lessons in a classroom format, and at NO time, did we jump around like cheerleaders.A total disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoy this, but...","review":"I can't ever finish the video.

I found myself working up a good sweat! The first time I did it I couldn't keep up but still tried my best.

If your looking for a tape that gives you a fast good workout that is fairly simple this one is for you!! I enjoy it each time and haven't been bored at all! Probably better for beginnners like me! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I have to agree with the majority of reviewers.This video was very boring, repetitive, and not terribly physically sound.I felt very silly during the exercises where I had to keep my finger stuck to my forehead, and although I turned it off (and returned it to the store) after 15 minutes of hopping, I was still stuck with extremely sore calves.Also, I don't see any reason to put the word \\"Bellydancing\\" on the front, because as I understand it, this is more based on Egyptian folk-dancing.Come on, V & N! You can do better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bellydance Fitness for Beginners: Fat Burning","review":"I agree with the person expressing dissappointment. Repititious, tedious hopping and a strain on the joints to say the least. I have taking bellydance classes and have worked out my whole life. This tape bored me as I was expecting to learn some other moves... also, I strained my right calf muscle so much, I could barely walk for a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I have seen these dancers perform live and I have seen the tape. Considering the 1,000s of lusty, upbeat, mysterious, or whimsical belly dance moves available to professional dancers, I see none of this in these performers -- not even the basics you'd learn in a beginner session. Although the tape is 'exercise' only, it still lacks passion and vitality. I believe the sisters are probably beginner to intermediate dancers themselves and they definitely need to take more instruction. Unfortunately, for all their good intentions, the tape misrepresents the world of belly dance and its acrobat, challenging, high energy actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not for people who want to walk!","review":"This thirty minute tape contains mainly silly one-legged jumps that can kill your calfs and feet! This is Veena and Neena's worst tape, in my opinion!

That doesn't happen at all in this video. It's all hopping on one foot, keep hopping, add an arm, switch foot, add an arm, keep hopping..... soooo boring!

My lungs could not keep up with the moves. Not only that, but it is also pretty boring.

Expectant mothers should check with their health care providers for current recomendations on fish and seafood consumption. Tape 2 includes explanation of preparation for a multiple birth in the hospital. The parents in my classes find the videography of the hospital procedures and hospital set-up very helpful.

Bernabo's review. When one speaks of Cole Porter's lyrics, one must remember he didn't write all of them. For songs from \\"Anything Goes\\" he partnered with the man few people remember as having penned the words to the most concurrent Broadway hits ever back in the beginning of the last century: Jeeves' author P.G. Wodehouse. If you listen to some of those lyrics and then cast your mind to the wacky world of Bertie Wooster, The Drones, et. al., it begins to become evident. And what a wonderful pairing Porter and Wodehouse were!As for the CD itself, it seems to be wonderful. The only limitation is the \\"Capitol\\" label. So many fine versions, which might make an even better collection if mixed in, don't happen to live in their domain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After seeing the motion picture \\"De-Lovely\\" and reading several Cole Porter bio's, I eagerly anticipated listening to \\"Capitol Sings Cole Porter: Anything Goes\\". Although the Capitol CD contains many more selections by competent, well known artists, I much prefer listening to the CD from the soundtrack of the movie. The \\"Capitol Sings...\\" arrangements are slick, but to my ear the De-Lovely arrangements are more wonderfully crafted and have a much more sensuous, emotional quality, even when sung by non-singers Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd. Diana Krall's interpretation of \\"Begin the Beguine\\", along with the gorgeous minor key accompaniment, is worth the ownership of the CD alone. I find it to be nothing less than thrilling, no matter how often one listens. I gave my \\"Capitol Sings...\\" CD away."},{"rating":"1","title":"contrarian view","review":"As a long-time fan of Cole Porter, I found this recording a mishmash of vocalists promoting their own singing style and mangling the purity of the composer's work. What was done to \\"Begin the Beguine\\" is beyond description."},{"rating":"2","title":"The world has gone mad today","review":"Cole Porter was one of the greatest songwriters of the 20th Century. This CD features Capitol Records artists singing his songs. All of the singers here are good, although some are better than others. And some of the arrangements are a bit on the dull side. It's noteworthy that one of Capitol's biggest stars, Frank Sinatra, is not included here. Most of the singers here are women, but you can't complain about the likes of Annie Ross, Peggy Lee and Judy Garland. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"I own another oxo tea kettle and was looking for a solid stainless steel replacemeny. Unfortunately, this kettle was a disappointment. It is very light weight, took 12 minutes to heat the water to boiling (following the manufacturers directions), and worst of all the whistle was so soft I couldn't hear it! Needless to say it was returned. On the positive side the handle only got warm and the click spout worked well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the product I would expect from OXO","review":"I have had such good experience with OXO that I was surprised by this tea kettle. It's extremly thin construction and feels cheap right out of the box. That would be okay if it did the job it was supposed to do, but within a month or so, the whistle stopped working, so I can now no longer walk away from the kettle and feel confident I'll know when the water is boiling, which is a major failure for me. The hunt continues for a good, workable tea kettle...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oxo VVG tea (hot water) kettle","review":"Don't believe everything you read.

Soft whistle-the lady needs a hearing aid. The kettle cap has been redesigned and works well (I think it would be improved by heat resistant ring around the cap though). I spent 30 bucks for mine (shipping incl) and I think that was a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the moderate tea drinker","review":"I really enjoy the OXO brand and haven't had any problems with their other products. This tea kettle is beautiful and is really easy to use. Easy to use with just one hand as the spout latch is within your index finger and can easily be poured. The whistle is loud enough for me to hear from down the hall if need be though most of the time I am close enough to the kitchen to hear for the whistle as I am preparing tea. I don't drink a lot of tea so this tea kettle isn't always in use. The only complaint I have is that the handle can get in the way of pouring water in as the handle is in place.I recommend this tea kettle as it works great and looks great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Long Information Session","review":"I bought this item for a 22 hour road trip I was taking. I got many hours of information for relatively cheap. The packaging was great.I can't say much for the video, but the audio portion was well done and easy to listen to and understand. It'd be nice if it was packaged better as a movie and less like a bunch of episodes from different series, as the end of the episode would include a summary, and then the next episode would contain a review.

After about a year of use i started noticing that the finish was wearing. I finally realized one day when i was scrubbing with a soft brush that there were black splatter marks all over my sink.

I love how you don't have to use a hot pad on the handles! They are not as heavy as I thought they would be but they cook very evenly and are easy to work with. To keep them from getting scratched up I got some Pampered Chef cookware protectors and they work great. The only thing I don't like is that I can't seem to find individual pieces to add to my set that match. There is a small saucepan but that is the only piece I could find.

My favorite pan is the 10 inch covered skillet which I use 3-5 days per week. I loved it...great size, nothing sticks, cooks evenly. Now there are little holes all over the bottom where the coating is peeling off. I have not used metal utensils and have only hand washed this pan.

The other issues I discovered that were particular to me, the handles get very slippery when washing, you can't \\"kant\\" the lid on the pan for slow boiling it's either on of off because the lid slids down the handle. We wanted to keep from using the dishwasher so we handwashed from the beginning and we noticed that the lid has a small space between the glass and food would accumulate in the small space during cooking.

I bought these for my wife this past Christmas and I am incredibly angry at the poor quality after just a short time using them. First they started to peel (that teflon peel)when making pasta. Then one of the pots warped rendering the lip useless. Then a lid broke. The only good thing about this set are the skillets. Don't buy the rest.

These pans are great for cooking, but. . . the only thing I don't like about them, is that the outsides (mainly the bottoms) stain really easily. The interiors are wonderfully easy to clean, but you really have to scrub the heck out of the bottoms of the pans. Maybe it is because I cook on a flatop stove, but if the slightest thing gets on the cooktop, it really imbeds itself into the bottom of the pans. I am afraid if I scrub them to hard I will ruin them. They really are wonderful for cooking though, I just wouldn't want to \\"display\\" them because of the splotches that imbed themselves on the bottoms. If anyone knows of a gentle cleanser that will help me get the bottoms cleaner, feel free to post."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"Seems quite on the low-end.

They have never been in the dish washer and never used on high heat or in the oven. I also have never used metal utincils in any of the set. The biggest pot has developed poc holes in the botom and the outside looks like its 10 years old, and so has the deep fry pan. The 9in skillet is warping and the whole set looks old.

Anyway I love this set it cooks your food evenly and I can almost swear that the food taste better, and the clean up is so easy. Another advantage is that it's really cute and I love the colors, but it also feels like you paid 500.00 for the set instead of 179.00 or in my case 160.00.

However, once the food heats up and steam is produced, you can't see a thing and have to remove the lid anyway. So, the drawbacks are: can't put the set in the dishwasher, have to take the lids off anyway plus you have to be careful not to bang them around or they'll break, plus if you have a ceramic stovetop like I do, then you cannot place a hot pot on a cool part of the stovetop or it may adhere to it, ruining your cooktop.

Needless to say I'm extremely disappointed and will not buy her brand ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"Pros: The pans look nice and the handles grip well. They will not last.Cons: After just 1 year, food sticks, even spaghetti boiling in the pot. The coating is flaking off around the edge of the pans.

I'm 39 and have a HORRIBLE back, so I was apprehensive about starting this workout. The video was well made with clear camera angles that make it easy to see what your body should be doing. After my first workout, I felt energized and my back felt fine. The workout does a very good job at stretching your core muscles, which are especially important for those with back/hip issues. You will feel the stretch in cable, abdominal, and oblique muscles at the end of the workout. However, unlike other cardio/aerobic workouts, you feel energized and happy rather than exhausted and ache-y. The basic workout had my heartrate up a bit, but nothing like traditional workout programs. Try this video if you dislike gym style workouts, but would like to try something gentle and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bellydance Fitness for Beginners Basic Moves and Fat Burning","review":"I really like this video.

It helps balance the first chakra. You will feel more energetic and aware of your surroundings. I used to be a daydreamer and flighty-headed, but all that changed. Iam more focused and relaxed. Iam not as tired as I used to be. This video is the first of a series of four. I recommend to practice the basic moves until you feel you can do most of the movements without any difficulty. Neena and Veena are very good instructors. If a movement is too fast or you can't quite follow, keep it basic. They show you the basic move first. Then, they speed up the tempo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Moves For Novices-FatBurning For In shape ppl!","review":"I absolutely fell in love with Belly Dancing thanks to this DVD.

I would highly reccomend Basic Moves if you are looking for a work out that will teach you some moves, is fun, challenging yet dosen't leave you feeling like your gonna die any moment.My only gripe is I don't understand why they included one of their HARDEST work outs on the same DVD as their easiest. I have weak ankles, so the fat burning portion of the DVD which deals mostly with Egyptian Folk dancing is pretty much a no go for me. It seems you would need to be in really good shape to do the fat burning portion.If you are out of shape, I would save the money and just buy the VHS of Basic moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much fat burning","review":"This was not what I was imagining.

I tried to keep watching it but was so bored with the looong warm up I couldn't take it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to expectations","review":"I was very dissapointed with this video. I read the other reviews and was very excited to learn to bellydance and get a workout at the same time. I found the video extremely boring and the reason I wanted to try bellydancing was to do something fun, new and exotic. Veena and Neena seemed very impersonal with using a voice over, instead of talking to the camera like other workout videos, like Kathy Smith. They also did not seem to have the something special like when you think of bellydance:mysterious and sexy. They seemed cut off from their body. If you think you are getting a deal because this video is less expensive, remember you get what you pay for. After being dissapointed, I tried Dolphina's and Shamira's videos, which are much better. Both have that special bellydance something that makes you want to be like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoughts on the twins","review":"Wow, this is by far the worst dvd I own. Aerobically-its a good workout but you have to suffer through long repetitive movements that get boring FAST. Plus you have no shoes on so make sure the padding under your carpet is new to avoid injury. And, I never felt like I was even close to belly dancing. The extra dance segments that feature the twins dancing made me feel that this video was more about their self promotion than me getting into shape. Pass this one up or give it to your man for his personal enjoyment-thats about all its worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and interesting","review":"This DVD is great, they really go slow enough and speak instructions that are very easy to follow. Its really a fun workout too. I didn't realize that there was a cardio piece too until I watched the entire DVD. I'd recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth it!","review":"I bought these for my wife. She had already started with Neena and Veena overseas and we bought the DVD's for here. Overall they have a great dancing style and are fairly easy to follow.The main problem is that you will need to rewind a lot when you first start out watching these as they tend to go a bit fast and not explain anything very well. A big help would be to put a full size mirror next to the TV to make certain you are doing the movements correctly.Also if you want to learn how to do a Drum Solo look elsewhere as they really don't do them as well as others. They do have an alluring style of belly dance and if you can follow it, it's excellent but they really need to break down what they are doing instead of having you follow along with no explanation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Own it and Love it","review":"My mom and I bought this DVD as a way to slim down a few years ago. I did start doing it when I took it home and then just got out of the habit. Now I started it back up and I'm really glad I did. I used the Basic Moves at first and that did start something, but now I'm going through the Fat Burning. I'm picking away at it, but I'm not through the whole workout yet. Even though I have to stop in the middle, I do feel better after the workout. I think this is a good workout video for an overweight couch potato like me who finally figured that she needed to get in shape and I don't feel intimidated by the insturctors. I just have to practice until it looks like I'm doing what they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Others may be disappointed in the video b/c it doesn't do much to teach bellydancing, but I bought it for the work-out aspect. So I think its great! It's a lot of fun, more fun than most home-video workouts available out there. It's enough to get you moving, your heart pumping, and your calories burning, but not so strenous that you want to quit altogether. The music is good to work out to as well. The only downside to this is that the voice-over is sometimes out of tune w/the music and the beats, which can be kind of annoying. But other than that, the DVD and the workout series (which I own) is great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very basic introduction, but that's what it's supposed to be","review":"This is not a regimen for the experienced belly dancer. However,this is a fun, easy introduction for the person who might be intimidated by the more difficult forms and videos out there, or who thinks they *may* want to take a class but aren't sure.Although the exercises are easy, you *will* feel a burn, especially in your arms and stomach. If you stick with it, you will become more comfortable not only with the movements, but with your body.I highly recommend this video as an introduction to bellydancing and as a easy, low impact exercise video."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Alternative....","review":"If you are looking to add some variety to your workout routine, then give one of these a try. The DVD allows you to select which section, either the basic moves or fat burning, you would like to complete which works well if you like options. Each section is a full workout, which takes you through warm up to cool down. I found the basic moves are good for \\"in between\\" days or if you are simply looking for a slower pace to get back into things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun video","review":"It is a nice video... I don't know how well it works for fitness because after watching a few times I got tired of watching it and doing the same excercises, so I did not loose weight. But, I guess it is the problem of buying only one DVD. It is always better to have a collection that you can keep changing exercises, otherwise it gets boring. But the moves that you learn in the DVD are very nice, at least for fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I understand that the fitness dvd was for beginners but it was so boring. I did not keep it on for too long. Except for the beginning where they did their bellydancing, the whole workout dvd was mostly warm-ups. Very boring! I wanted the exciting stuff they did at the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"One hundred starrs. Absolutely.","review":"Years ago, this wonderful workout video was the thing that got me interested in belly dance. It's on the top of my list, and I would recommend it to anyone.If you are just beginning, this DVD is perfect. You will not be disappointed.Or,If you have mastered the art of belly dance, I would recommend this DVD for an extra boost of inspiration. I can't put my finger on it exactly, but something about this workout video gets the creative juices flowing.Between buying belly dance videos and renting them on Netflix, this is by far one of the best I've ever seen. I may be slightly bias from the sentimental view that it was the first belly dance DVD I ever had... but trust me, this DVD is well worth the asking price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, good workout!","review":"I really enjoyed this video, I even purchased a hipscarf so I'd feel more \\"authentic\\" while working out. It was a fun way to learn a few bellydance moves and get a decent workout in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"My opinion on belly dance for fitness","review":"I took out of the library the video \\"Belly Dance forFitness\\" and after one week of having it home with me I decided to buy it, so I went to amazon books and found it right away and at a very accessible price. I am really glad about my buy. I am usually lazy for work outs, but this one is enjoyable, inspiring and fun, and I am doing it three tines a week. I thnk it also has an effect in the way I feel free to move and express my sex-appeal all along the day. I am in my fifties and used to feel \\"plump\\", now I see myself like \\"a real woman with curves\\"...It feels great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Basic Moves, Hate the Fat Burning","review":"I really like the Basic Moves section. It's not an aerobic workout, but definitely strengthening. And it's a great way to learn some of the 'basic moves' that they use in their other DVDs.However, I did not like the fat burning portion. I was bored to tears. It's a lot of bouncing, no hip or belly work at all. Fitness for Beginners: Slim Down is a much better (though still not perfect) option for an aerobic exercise [see my review for that DVD]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesnt Feel like Exercise!!!","review":"Love the routine.

They were hot and uncomfortable, and they bound at the top, creating a blockage just below the knee that actually aggravated a spot on my leg. I quit wearing them and eventually threw them away. Recently, my legs reached the point that I absolutely must wear support sox. I thought, \\"what the heck,\\" I'll try these cheapies. Well, they provide very good support, are much more comfortable than my expensive surgical sox, and don't bind at the top. I'm a big guy (6'2\\", 220 lbs), and the XL size fits great. My only suggestion is to try the Futuro dress sox as well. They support quite well and are VERY comfortable (see my other review). I would wear the dress sox all the time (instead of these) if I could get the right colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory:Return to Futuro for refund","review":"First, no supplier receipt was included in shipment;receipt required by Futuro for refund.Heavy sewn welt around heel opening caused blister on one heel, open sore on side of other foot.

Comfortable, more so with a thin sock under them to cushion the open heal. Research shows the knee high compression is as good at prevention of blood clotts as thight highs. This product is great in terms of wear and easing the pain of varicose veins. Launders well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"First this did not come in mixed colors as it was supposed to, but I needed bandages so tried it anyway. If your wrapping something small, like a toe it will be ok, but it's so thin that if you wrap a foot or hand or something larger the material moves and doesn't cling as it should. Bummer. Really disappointed that what I got wasn't what I ordered. Tsn is not mixed colors!!!!! Boooo"},{"rating":"2","title":"What I expected","review":"This was purchased as a gift for my Mom for Christmas, she works for a wild animal rehab shelter. She often complained about not having more of these types of bandages due to there easy of use and not needing tape or other means to hold the bandage closed.

They'll be the only ones though since there is no educational content. \\"I love birthday parties, yeah\\" - \\"They're here, let the party begin\\" - \\"oink oink\\". This is all we here from these machines when we use them, which isn't often. Kids click on the pictures to elicit related and often unrelated noises - that is it. There is little actual phonics training. The phonics \\"games\\" only ask about one softball question per minute surrounded by a lot of ADD attention getting fluff. These are entertainment systems, not educational systems. We should note that the Leapfrog brand DVDs we have are not like the Leappads at all. The DVDs are very good.

J.K.Rowling's life and the birth of Harry Potter are explained entirely by the narrator of this hour-long program, while we see images and footage of different places in Britain. It is nicely put together and quite informative, although I think for the knowledgeable fan, there isn't anything new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"There were no interviews with anyone, just a picture slideshow with narrative. The images that were shown that were \\"related\\" to Harry Potter were not even correct images. The music seemed to be a bit off from the overall mood of the DVD. Although you did learn some things about J.K. Rowling's life, you have to wonder if some of it wasn't just speculation. The best thing about the DVD were the beautiful Scotland scenes. Overall, watch it, but don't believe everything you see and don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 minutes of material stretched into an hour is BORING!!!","review":"This seems to have been sponsored by some kind of United Kingdom tourism bureau, as it mainly depicts still photographs of places for Harry Potter fans to visit. They mention MANY times what a \\"private person\\" J.K. Rowling is, which is, of course, the excuse for why there is NO SUBSTANCE whatsoever to this DVD. I'm hesitant to even call it a movie, since it plays much more like a slide show with a narrative (plagued with lots of speculative \\"filler\\" to kill time). Save your money, or if you must see it, get it from your library or request it by interlibrary loan. If you don't have to PAY to watch it, you might feel somewhat less pain for having wasted an hour of your time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This is a total waste of time and money. Not only is the info on JK a repeat of the readily available known facts, the presentation is long, drawn out, repetitive, and just awful. They only use one stock photo of JK over and over. This is not worth your time or effort at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete and Utter Disappointment!","review":"This documentary is probably the worst I've ever seen in my life. (And I'm being kind). The script was abominable, the music AWFUl and the narrator's voice put my kids to sleep-- literally. Moreover, in this hour long movie, there was only about five minutes of interesting and relevant information. BUT you did see lovely footage of Portugal where Rowling lived for a brief time (go figure!)

Rowling."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must read!","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I found it thoroughly engrossing, and just darn right funny. It was cozy read, like curling up with a Mocha from Starbucks or listening to Chopin. The characters are vivid and likeable, and the old house is a worthy character unto itself. It is a must read for lovers of what I call \\"escapist\\" fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and endearing","review":"The Amazon search engine recommended this book to me, based on my previous purchases. I hate to give a compliment to a computer, but it was right on. Very cute book - not complex by any means, but a good story. The romance angle isn't sappy or unrealistically over the top, but you still find yourself liking all of the characters and caring about them. Hetty grows up and learns a lot about herself - as does Conner. He's so disagreeable, but you know that he's really a caring person. Ms Fforde has a way with humor and dialog. I'd recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Reading","review":"My daughter picked up a book by this author when we were vacationing in Crete and I read it after she did. It was so funny I sat on the beach laughing so hard tears were running down my face. When I got home I ordered another book from the same author and while it was not funny, it was delightful reading. I usually read spy novels and murder mysteries, so this book was a nice change. I plan to read every book this author, Katie Fforde, has written. She is English so her books are not everywhere in the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, painful to get through, and main characters had maturity of young teens","review":"Strengths: The plot and setting was interesting. The writing style was light and very easy to read.Weaknesses: From the start you know what's going to happen - you just expect it'll have good twists and turns along the way. But it didn't. While the ending of the story was predictable, it was as though the middle part connecting the beginning and end didn't match at all. The writing didn't help me feel the \\"why\\" the characters felt or did what they did. The main characters had the emotional level of young teens - couldn't articulate what was on their mind & behaved in an immature and horrible way because they didn't know how to express they liked the other. Ugh - awful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Katie Fforde entertain you....","review":"Katie Fforde's heroines are charming - sometimes not the brightest, most sophisticated people alive - but they are thoroughly Nice and that's why we love them. Hetty has, in stock romantic heroine tradition, been dumped, and is looking for a quiet place to recover, so she house-sits the decrepit yet stately house of a distant relative. Enter Conan the Barbarian, the heir to the estate, who would like to see it torn down and made into a theme park. With that, we have the promised romantic novel set up and we're off to a good time. There's chemistry, there's laugh aloud moments, the bounder ex gets his due, and there's more chemistry. The reader is left smiling - no wiser or better informed, but greatly entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow But Steady","review":"Fforde's Stately Pursuits starts off slow and had me a bit worried.

You will be pleasantly surprised by this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny, light romantic comedy","review":"This and all of Katie Fforde's books make for perfect diversionary reading.

They're great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start, but petered out in to a dull and rambling book.","review":"I was looking forward to this book because it sounded so humorous and cozy--and, indeed the first half of the book was excellent. It started to bog down in the middle, most unfortunately, and I was only able to skim the last half. This is the first book I've read by this author, but even the entertaining first half of the book won't motivate me to read another."},{"rating":"2","title":"A harlequin romance for British yuppies","review":"This book reads like a Harlequin romance novel, and uses some of the same plot devices. That is an observation, not a value judgment, however; the book was a quick, fun read that I enjoyed thoroughly. I found the sex scenes a little jarring and out of sync with the rest of the book's tone but that's a minor criticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pasta, NOT GLUTEN FREE","review":"I ordered this pasta for a friend who is gluten intolerant.

The things I love about Barilla -- always cooks al dente, doesn't stick together -- also applies to this brand.It's a little expensive though -- even when you purchase by the case like this -- but a healthier choice for people who are trying to cut down on carbs.

In terms of musical excitement, this album did for me what the Beatles' Rubber Soul, Led Zeppelin's I, Ben Harper's Fight for Your Mind, Paul Pena's New Train, and very few others have done.

However this is a very self indulgent piece of work. With Erik Rutan back in the recording fold it makes a very chaotic mix. The playing was great but some of the songs should have been stripped down a bit in my opinion. But on the other side of the coin the complexity and overblown structures leave it so you will continously find new snipets to enthrall you like a piece of classical music. The songs written by Tucker are strong and grinding. The riffs on this album are very close to the playing on Domination at times. The drums sound very digital also. However this is still the most talented band in the Death Metal scene today.

BUT this is morbid angel, dude. So what happened after the brilliant formulas album? i dont know. its rather slow paced (no prob with that) but i cant handle the melodies, some of the guitar solos which are rather conservativ metal ones, and the vocals have been better before. only he who sleeps and the victor the spoils do it for me. 1 or 2 other tracks have cool parts but really boring parts too. just my taste, and i can imagine that folk who are really into death metal (im not) will certainly like the album for its crystal clear heavyness and guitat mayem. i personally think its a step back for this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Their worst album.

As always, Morbid angel has evolved in the best possible ways. This album is absolutely incredible. With Morbid Angel, the aggressivity and violence take another significance.

The musicians totally control what they play; the songs are played with rare virtuosity.according to me, this is the best album of Morbid Angel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"This album is boring.

Welcome to your doom! This album is far and away the heaviest death metal offering by any outfit I've yet heard in my 4 years exploring the genre. The deep, booming reverberations from this devastating slab of death sludge will leave you flattened under the weight of unfathomable tonnage!For me, this is the quintessential death metal record. No equal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gateways to perfection?","review":"A product of divine intervention? Hardly... However, when a certain reviewer refered to \\"Gateways...\\" as the \\"best death metal album in Earth's history\\", I agreed a long way. I have personally never heard such power contained in a cd before. \\"Opening of the gates\\" is arguably the heaviest song ever made, and sometimes you'll wonder if the musicicans of Morbid Angel posess some sort of divine skills with their instruments. Listen to Steve Tucker's growl at the beginning of \\"He who sleeps\\" and you'll know how the growl of a demon from the greatest depths of hell would sound like... And what about Peter Sandoval's double-bass attack in \\"Opening of the gates\\" which simply sounds inhuman, or Azagthoth's solo in \\"Summoning redemption\\", or Rutan's solo in \\"God of the forsaken\\"? Simply breathtaking. A true 5-star death metal masterpiece which will leave you wondering how the next album will sound like, and uncertain whether you'll want to know... Be afraid, be very afraid..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"Morbid Angel's 6th studio album \\"Gateways To Annihilation\\" starts off as a good album, but quickly gets boring within minutes. The band has slowed down their tempo which makes the guitar riffs far to boring, you can't hear the bass, and the drumming is very slow which is something that I didn't expect from Pete Sandoval. The new vocalist/bassist doesn't do nearly as good a job as original bassist/vocalist David Vincent did. Their is only one good song on the entire album and that song is \\"Summoning Redemption\\". It is a very good, because absolutely nothing in the music is boring. Death metal guitar god Trey Azagoth has some good blistering solos going on all over the place near the end of the song. I say stay away from this album by any means necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bombastic &Boring","review":"Gateways..was a big disappointmet!!Although i must have played it a hundred times i couldn't get into the songs!The tracks are boring and without signifcance,and the new bombastic style doesn't fit Morbid Angel at all!Also is Tucker no real replacement for Vincent,that's bad enough,but normally the good songwriting would help to forget the loss of Vincent,but here is everything ruinend from pathetic and \\"majestic\\" parts! You can't find one song here that could touch one from \\"Blessed....\\" or \\"Covenant\\"!The tracks simply don't get you by the balls,they lack the \\"dionysic\\" energy from the classic Morbid Angel-masterpieces!Gateways blows,sad but true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To the victor the spoils","review":"This is definitely a cd worth picking up because Trey, Erik, Pete and Steve don't disappoint on this album. Although Pete used triggers on this album they weren't overused and he still shows that he has some fast hands. Trey shreds like no other and Erik adds his talent in all the right places (check out the solo on God of the Forsaken). Steve's throat is much improved over FFF. This is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 more recording before perfection","review":"Based on this latest slab of metal mastery, I think the next Morbid Angel recording will be perfection. The advancements made from FFF are overwhelming. Steve Tucker has found his voice, the production is the best ever and Pete Sandoval is still not of this earth. Gateways sees a return to more chugging riffs and some off-kilter tempo changes and harmonies. The result is that some songs are their most \\"catchy\\" ever and some are obscure and, at times, almost unlistenable. While I would never doubt Pete Sandoval's speed or ability, I do agree with one reviewer who pointed out how digital the drumming sounds -- almost programmed, especially the snare drum sound during rolls. Gone are the pages of H.P. Lovecraft and Necronomicon invoked lyrics in favor of a more \\"realistic\\" approach. All in all this is probably their best release, if not always the most pleasurable. Wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-Woofer Problems","review":"The speakers arrived slower than expected. I installed them, which went quite well and then tried them out. The sub-woofer would not work. I had to call the Supplier (Electronics Expo) and he asked that I call the Infinity tech center to verify that the equipment was bad. I then had to call the Supplier back and get an shipping return lable. The Supplier was easy to work with and propmt they did everything that they could to make things better. But, I then had to take all the speakers down, re-package them and return them. Three weeks later a new set arrived and they worked fine. The Supplier gets good marks for service, Infinity gets bad marks for supplying speakers that were defective. As I have read in other reviews the quality of the Sub-woofer appears to be weak. So far they have been in service for a month without another failure. Time will tell if it was a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente backpack, if my 15.6\\" ASUS Republic of Gamers were a 15.4\\"","review":"The description of the backpack is misleading.The backpack is supposed to fit most 17\\" laptops but it doesn't.It is a backpack for 15.4\\" laptops.I have to say, since I've read the reviews before buying, that I saw it coming.I bought this hoping it would fit my 15.6\\" ASUS Republic of Gamers and it does, maybe a bit too tightly should I say.The quality is great though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well made","review":"This backpack is extremely well made, considering how cheap it is.

It now comes appropriately stated as fitting a 15\\" laptop, not 17' as before (now if the amazon listing could only do the same). The bag looks really good. FYI, it's black and grey-I thought it looked like an olive green on amazon's pictures. I REALLY like the fact that the laptop comes out a side pocket while the book/paper area still zips on top. Overall, it's spacey.

The biography of St. Teresa of Avila is also well written but doesn't hold a candle to Marcelle Auclair's. Francis comes alive in these pages to inspire and ignite other lovers of God! It's wonderful that this book has been released again for another generation to discover (several generations)."},{"rating":"2","title":"thank you very much fellow reviewers","review":"It's impossible to listen to all the great musos out there and ERNIE would certainly have flown under my radar. Luckily I found a glowing review by a likeminded musical spirit and took a punt on this cd. Thank goodness i did. This is instrumental guitar bliss ( the genre can be hit and miss as it is not an easy thing to do blues without words ). I have as many good ones as I have ordinary ones. This is far from ordinary and with the sterling help from LUCKY PETERSON's huge hammond organ sound this is one of the best in my 2000 cd collection. So many flavours done just right. Amazing guitar work with a tone as fat as PAVEROTTI and phrasing that does not remind you of anyone. What a player !!!!! If you like the BLUES or the guitar, BUY THIS NOW !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Teaching Tool","review":"I've been using this video for years in the context of morality and social justice religious studies courses. The movie is a good representation of Dorothy Day's life though it gets rather melodramatic at the end. It does a great job illustratiing the transformation that happens in Dorothy's life and how she and Peter Maurin develop the Catholic Worker together. Another critique would be that Maruin's role in the process is minimized but it is, after all, a movie about Day, not Maurin who generally gets less credit than Day. The movie certainly opens up a lot of discussion about faith, transformation and our call to social justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Academy Award winner, but was thought provoking.","review":"I was impressed with Dorothy's converstion experience and her commitment to the poor.

Usually my son will sit and go through a whole book, but with this one, the few times he has chosen it he has only done a page at a time. Your kids will learn from this book, but it will take a lot of time because there is nothing really to engage them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divorcing a Parent: Free Yourself from the Past","review":"This book is an excellent publication for anyone who has suffered mental and emotional abuse at the hands of a parent/parents. Every statement in the book was so true to form that it was scary to realize just how bad life really was. Knowing that other individuals have experienced the same abuse with the same threats and parental abuse was somewhat comforting to know that others have experienced these abuses and gone on to live better lives. Very highly recommended reading for anyone feeling abused by a parent(s)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"If you are looking for training advice ( and with a title like \\"How to Train your Lab...\\", what do you expect) this book is a weak rip off. The author has beautiful photos but doesn't actually start to begin the training discussion of any kind until page 39 of a 90 page book..... so 40% of the book is not even related to the title. Weak - would not purchase again, and if I could send it back I would ( and I love books)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs much more than what is offered.","review":"A few cute pictures and basic info that can be found on the web is not something I consider a good read; especially when it involves educating me on the task of raising a life...This wasn't very informative, and didn't offer much more than basic puppy information, and like a few other breed specific books, seemed to be mostly generic information. I understand training a dog is not rocket science, but if a book is lab specific, I want it to clearly lay out issues for my breed and make it as easy as possible to follow along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"\\"A C-Section Birth Day\\" was a big disappointment. For starters, the video lasts only 17 minutes, far too short to show everything it purports to show. The anesthesia scene, for example lasted about two minutes, while the procedure of the C-section only 30 seconds, and then one could hardly see anything at all. I was expecting a descent documentary showing the whole procedure in detail, but instead 80% of the video focused on the new born baby.If you are only interrested in a superficial, quick and general overview of all the steps for a C-section delivery, and want to show it to the younger members of the family, then it's a good video. If you are looking for detailed procedures and comprehensive steps, then it's a big let down and waste of money.The advertising of the video is quite misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Outlaws of Mars","review":"The book was just as I remembered it from my teens; a fun adventure on Kline's Mars.

Not only would thest DEFINITE DOZEN rules be applicable to a sports team of any age, but could be used by a teacher and parent as well. In fact, I have copied these DEFINTE DOZEN rules and try to practice them in all of my affairs.Coach Summit could be considered a disciplined, and non-bending coach, yet her success as an athlete, person, and coach would be a model for anyone.

It was an accidental battle, neither side anticipating when and where it would happen, both sides hobbled by poor communications and misguided assumptions. Nevertheless, it had important consequences, since the Confederates won in a rout, engendering agonized soul-searching in the North and perhaps overconfidence in the South. James Morgan gives the reader a thoroughly researched and beautifully written moment-by-moment account of the battle. My only suggestion for improvement would be the inclusion of a map that puts the battlefield site in context with nearby populated areas and geographical features, which were involved in the events surrounding the battle."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality","review":"Not sure if it is a new item that i got from this KENTEC. box was beat up and tape over many times.

My hopes were misplaced. Bottom line: Same name, different band.The main thing that remains is lead vocalist James's raspy shout -- and if you like that, you may like this album. Unfortunately, that's pretty much all he does, and it's beginning to wear thin. Their last major effort, \\"Unclean,\\" contained some guitar work and melodic depth that undergirded the punch and power of RT in its prime. Now we're pretty much just left with the shouting -- which reveals a temperament and worldview more simplistic (and pitiful) than any of the hypocracies that RT is attempting to skewer.My advice: Get yourself a copy of \\"Unclean,\\" and (if you can find it) RT's indie release \\"The Eleventh,\\" and then move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet harmony","review":"We have a regeneration LP Record so I decided to get this..

Except for Deborah Kerr and Cesar Romero, no one bothers to show up. Another low point in the Sinatra-Martin filmography - worse than \\"Ocean's 11\\" and \\"Sergeants 3.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Happy Film","review":"I have always enjoyed this collaboration among three actors who appear to be enjoying themselves. The film is somewhere between light comedy and screwball comedy. To some extent, Dean Martin's happy, flip character steals many of the scenes, but Frank Sinatra is more likable in this role than he is in many of his comedies (I think his forte is drama). Deborah Kerr is delightful. Some will say Dean and Frank are playing themselves...certainly true for Dean, here, although Frank doesn't often play the father role. But, in 1965 that's what audiences wanted -- Dean and Frank! You'll enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst movie I have ever finished watching","review":"What a waste of incredible talent. I will not bother to rehash the absurd plot - it was terrible, but somehow the movie just misses being \\"bad enough\\" to become a camp classic. I did not buy it separately - it came in a package of five Frank Sinatra movies - I think it was called the \\"Golden Years.\\" This one was not golden. I suppose you can watch it for the nostalgia value - but you can get that in other movies of this era without suffering through this so-called comedy.On a separate note, based on the Amazon reviews, I find it interesting that this movie was either a \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" kind of thing. I hate to discourage someone who might think this was precisely their idea of uproarious fun and merriment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did They Do It For The Paycheck?","review":"This film has a stellar cast, many of whom are adept at playing comedy.But, this is not a funny movie.The basic story premise has the potential to be a marvelous farce, but the script is mundane and the director has no sense of comedy timing.The only bright spot in the picture is Cesar Romero, who steals every scene that he's in. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to get much help from his fellow players.My guess is that Sinatra and Martin owed another picture to Warner Brothers, so they did this one to get rid of the commitment. Why else would they agree to do such a terrible script?Where is Billy Wilder when you need him?Michael B.

When the picture was not freezing it would cut off and return to an earlier episode. I was not expecting anything like this or I would not have bought it. A few nights later the movie was on TV, and I was delighted. Guess what? It also froze up, but not as bad as the DVD, but enough to be annoying. I know it is an old movie, but doesn't Amazon test/check their products before they display these worthless merchandise? I know it is inexpensive, but it still costs me something. It was not worth the hassle to return. My recomendation is that even if it is being given away - walk away or even run away from it. The quality is horrible!

After unsuccessfully searching for hours at local stores for a suitable candidate, I decided to try Amazon and found this item. It will do the job. The soft leather is both pleasant to handle and tough enough to protect its contents from whatever Mother Nature sends its way. The pockets will easily handle pens, a notebook, and a small hymnal. And it looks as if this cover will remain attractive and durable for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply flawless.","review":"I bought this cover after searching online and in the brick and mortar stores for a nice bible cover. Most of the leather ones in the stores just didn't look good, or were too flashy.After reading the reviews on this product and being able to see that it was very basic, I bought it. I'm glad I did. This cover is fantastic! The leather is very, very supple. I mean, almost to the point of it forming around your hands and you hold it.Full size pocket on one side, another storage pocket on the other and a final zipper pouch on the same side make this the bible cover to have.Nothing extravagant, or flashy. Just a soft, black, leather bible cover that will last for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good bible cover","review":"Overall this is a very good cover that should give many years of service.The leather is soft but appears strong, the zips function well and there are several compartments for additional note storage as well as a position for pen or marker. This cover is made in India and the workmanship is good. The only slight negative point I noticed was that the grain of the leather was not matched very well (some of the leather pieces that make up the cover were of a course grain while other pieces were of a smaller grain). I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be sewn better","review":"Okay, let me be fair. There are worse leather bible cases than this one, but still it doesn't imply that it should be sewn so badly. Usually position of a zipper should be more or less parallel to the body-no with this product, the leather connected to zipper in sort of wave pattern. At some places it 3mm from zipper and others its 8mm or more. There are scratches, uneven cuts of connected pieces of leather and so on. In short, it certainly will protect your bible but it shouldn't cost $28. I wanted to send it back, but than decided to keep it-the bible is more important than cover. Still product made very poorly. Here is my advise to BeltOutlet go and look how ladies cosmetic purses and bags are made, how they are sewn, try to make your stuff the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bible Cover and Super Service!","review":"I ordered on a Friday and received on Monday via priority mail.

I would strongly recommend these book covers for anyone looking for great quality at a reasonable price. Some good advice when ordering book covers like this is to be sure to measure the books you are covering, and then allow a bit of extra room for the books to give a little. That way there will be little, if any, strain on the cover itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect leather book cover","review":"I searched the internet high and low and finally found this book cover.

What has been called lounge, easy-listening, or background music, here takes another, much broader dimension, embrassing easy jazz, bossa nova, orchestral pop, choir performances etc. The ethereal melodies, the subtlety of rhythms, the airy vocals, all contribute to the creation of an unusually rich in sentiments listening experience, totally satisfying for the seeker of the cerebral element in music.

Hated the 'team leader' personality given to scoop - very confusing for my children too.

In this story, Scoop becomes a egomanical paranoid freak, which my son finds confusing and upsetting. There are a few scenes where the machines argue and \\"camera\\" zooms in on close-ups of angry machine faces. This he finds very upsetting and yells for me to fast forward. It sends a terrible message to young children- that someone can treat their friends (co-workers, whoever) very badly, and then at the end, when that person messes up and needs help, is easily forgiven and it is all shrugged off. In addition, the foreign accents assigned to some characters are ridiculous and almost offensive (and again, confusing to my son) and the yodeling is a virtual nightmare.

If you have problems with setting the sensitivy and volume I also agree it go to the website. IT answered all questions we had. If you have toddlers you know a toy has to be practically indestructable to survive. This one really is. it was been stepped on, dropped and drop kicked.

I knew I'd love for him to play a game that made exercise fun.I was disappointed right away. Instead of dancing to make music, my son had to stomp hard. I wound up limiting use to the basement rather than having to listen to him pounding on the floor of his room.On top of that, having to stomp frustrated him greatly. Several times, he wound up stomping on the toy itself. (One of the 2 stars I gave it is due to impressive durability.)Not surprisingly, the toy wound up in a closet and was all but forgotten until my teenager discovered it last week.

We turned the motion sensor all the way up and tried this toy on various surfaces and both the first and the second floors of our house. Still, no luck activating the toy. I should admit that the toy does a better job detecting the movements of adults, but even then the tempo does not even roughly correlate to the speed of your movements. I regret purchasing Musini.

I think it should be a bit more sensitive but they don't seem to mind. If the music doesn't play they just stomp their feet when they dance and then it does. And they think stomping is fun. However they do tire of it after 20 minutes or so. It doesn't play on the carpet at all but does o.k. on the kitchen floor. I have to say though I got it at the sale price and with the clarity of the music it was worth the money and I don't regret buying it at all. Besides its something all of the kids can do at the same time so I consider that a good deal. If this one quit working I would buy another one because while they're playing with it they're having a ball. The really nice thing about it is all you have to do to activate it is dance--even the babies can do that and it doesn't take them long to get the idea.

The story is ok not the most thought out story I've seen but it worked. the game is still very fun to play even that I had to start it on hard lever just to be able to get some challenge out of it, but that's because it plays like god of war which is my favorite game that I still play.

And to top it all off she gets ill and refuses to see a doctor. That's suicide. So much for religious beliefs. I guess I can't stand stories that are this pretentious. But I guess the author needed to write a tragedy for tragedy sake. What she should have done was bought a ticket for points unknown and left while not leaving a forwarding address.

And what a set of tunes - as evidenced by the Black Monk Time album, this was a a band with a compelling case for overdue recognition. And here it is. A wonderful story, told via all of the original band members, and with the added bonus of compelling live performance footage from German TV, and additional biographies and interviews. The only downer about the whole thing, is that Dave Day, the banjo player, who is featured at length in his own segment, died last year post production of the movie and DVD.

I have no doubt many people will benefit from the treatment - just not the kind of people who should do much writing.

But this documentary film brought me back to that time when I first discovered their music and felt this unexplainable rush. Needless to say, my very first demo back in mid '96 was a cover of The Doors' People Are Strange and it was truly a magical moment for me.Yes, if you are an avid Doors fan then this film won't offer anything that is substantially new. It's all been said and done already. There's really nothing new that we can get from The Doors' legacy at this point in time. Even the remaining band members have tried to push it further by getting other rock singers to sing their songs.

Writer-director Tom DiCillo has essentially given us a condensed remake of the 1991 Oliver Stone film - with the genuine Lizard King in all his chaotic glory. Unfortunately, there's no attempt at structural clarity or historical accuracy. The fact that the Vietnam War gets more attention than \\"Morrison Hotel\\" says it all. Meanwhile, we're still waiting for a definitive documentary about The Doors."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential","review":"This production has weaknesses, but it also contains some of the essence of the Doors experience. That is largely thanks to Jim Morrison's own amateur film, which provides the the framework of the narrative. Morrison's production, in which he plays a predatory car thief prowling the highways, evokes that time, era, and scene.Of course, it is also a projection of the dark and compelling Morrison, whose presence looms large throughout. As a fan of their music from back in their day, it was a treat to see them again, in newly-released footage.

Anyone expecting to find out something new about The Doors will get nothing from this film as it doesn't show or tell anything a knowledgeable Doors fan didn't already know. There is no new footage here what-so-ever, although the DVD Description states otherwise.Save your money and buy the book:The Doors by The Doors with Ben Fong-Torres, it's far superior to any documentary/film on The Doors and does the band justice, not only because it's beautifully written, but because of the tons of photos (worth the price of the book alone) contained in the book.When You're Strange - A Film About The Doors is nothing more than an underwhelming trip and if you're an knowledgeable Doors fan then there isn't much, if anything, to see here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother, listen to the Albums","review":"This is a complete POS, do yourself a favor & beg,borrow,steal or buy their CD's or dig out your old Doors Albums and just listen to the magic.This is a shallow,exploitive, rip-off, Jim would be turning in his grave, shame on you.Ughhhh !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have you seen The Doors movie? Don't need to waste time on this one.","review":"I base this review on the fact that I've seen Oliver Stone'sThe Doors (Special Edition).This movie adds basically nothing relevant to the former movie. Yes it has some very good quality original footage (at least previously unseen to me) and great Doors songs excerpts.However this is meant to be a biographical documentary yet it fails to provide a detailed biography.In fact I'll take it a step further: Oliver Stone's The Doors movie has more biographical data than this documentary. It lacks for instance detail on Pam (Morrison's lifetime girlfriend) and several relevant experiences which shaped Morrison.Bottom line: If you're a serious Doors fan and are in the mood of listening to your fave Doors songs while watching something on the screen, then you could get this documentary.

I also practice yoga, and I needed a new mat and strap. I decided on this set due to the lower cost of it and was surprised at how nice it is. Mine is also blue (like the previous reviewer), but I prefer the blue to the purple in the picture. The ball feels pretty sturdy which really surprised me, and the mat is nice and non-slip so you don't feel like you are going to slide off. I haven't had as much time to play around with it as I would like, but I would recommend this set to someone just wanting to start out, and not spend a TON of money on supplies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible Pump","review":"Unfortunately the pump that came with this product does not work.

Just as important he explains what not to do and why. This is a great video for skaters just starting out or \\"old school\\" skaters like myself that were used to flat boards with little or no concave who want to learn more about new school skating. The flow of the video is also well done; starting with the basics and moving on to more advanced tricks really helped me greatly. I know I would have fallen way more times if I hadn't watched this before trying some of the tricks on the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning tool, even for oldsters","review":"I got Dan MacFarlane's Skateboarding Explained DVD last summer when I was preparing to learn how to skate. It had been a few years (more than 10) since the last time I'd been on a board, and this DVD helped me with a lot of the basics, even before I left the house. My ambition was to learn how to Ollie, a skill I had never figured out as a kid, and this DVD helped! Through the slow-motion videos, and thorough clear explanations, I learned about the mechanics of the ollie, and was able to apply them on the street. I never really progressed into the flip tricks, or ramp stuff, so I can't comment on that. But I can say that this was a very Positive learning experience, and I recommend Skateboarding Explained to new skaters young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video, fantastic instruction","review":"This is a GREAT video for anyone learning to skate, up to those wanting to learn the more advanced tricks. My six year old got a skateboard and really caught the bug - he desperately wanted to learn how to skate and do tricks, but I had no idea how to help him get started. This video was a god-send! It spells out very clearly how to start, teaches the fundamentals, what bad habits to avoid, the lingo, and breaks down all the tricks. The menu allows you to easily skip right to the trick you want to see. It's really one of the better instructional videos I've ever seen for any sport. Almost makes this 40-something year old mom feel like she could learn to ollie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skateboarding NOT explained","review":"Ok, let's start with the title: \\"Skateboarding Explained\\"... One would think that this video explains techniques and tricks. Well it doesn't. This video is like washing machine instructions, it goes like \\"step 1: do this, step 2: do this\\" and never goes any deeper. I'm giving it 2 stars for the first part of the video, where it demonstrates the very basics where not much can go wrong and teaches a good approach to skateboarding for total beginners. If you're anything more than that, this video will not help you. when it goes into more advanced tricks it explaines NOTHING and will not help you land them, it's like a camera's \\"quick start\\" instruction manual, it very briefly describes each step of the trick without analyzing common mistakes and how to correct them. If it's your first time on a skateboard, get this video, but if you're looking for help to land anything more advanced than an ollie, then stay away from it. There are FAR better FREE videos on youtube."},{"rating":"2","title":"very great learning tool for the right age group.","review":"this learning dvd is is great as help many young skate boarders learn how to do tricks right saves time so they know there doing it right, and he breaks it down in slow motion step by step. i highly recommend it for the young skater or even a not so young skater who wants to learn the tricks. Scott Geiger,Sr. Projectskate"},{"rating":"2","title":"You want to learn to skate? Cop this dvd.","review":"It might be easy to dismiss this video because of all the free material out there, but this video gives you a sweet and condensed learning experience from a super professional skater. It's also pretty encouraging to see tricks performed by the students, so it's not just some pro doing crazy stuff then casually telling you to do it. You get to see the mastery from sensai to grasshopper. All meat, no filler. Way to go MacFarlane! Good luck fellow skaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A logical and progressive way to learn to skate. The best!","review":"I've repeatedly heard about this video from everyone and finally decided to give it a try. This is the best skateboarding investment I've purchased since my skateboard itself! It made me wonder how people begin without it. Skateboarding Explained is that good! I was skating for 3 years before this and have been kicking myself for not getting this sooner and pondering how good I would be now if I had. This video takes you from starting out, to basics, and then the most sought out tricks beginners and intermediate skaters will want to learn. I watched it over and over the first night I received it and the next day when I went skating I was thinking very differently and skating much better immediately. After reviewing it over a week my skills drastically improved. Any age skater can majorly benefit from owning and studying this video. I have to give major kudos to Dan MacFarlane for making this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aloha Hula Outfit","review":"This is such a cute Hawaiian hula outfit.

Chapter 5 is downright terrible. The tutorials are actually WRONG, and the narrator of the demo video says something along the lines of \\"uh, the book is really unclear here, so we'll just hope this is right.\\" It's kind of funny provided you aren't trying to finish a project on time.The best part of this book is some cool art that's been done by MAYA artists, in full color in glossy pages in the middle.

As noted in previous reviews, drum 'n' bass is prevalent as a source, as is breakbeat in the broader sense. Beyond that however, the Brazilian-ness of the music goes beyond carnival to include more experimental inspirations like Hermeto Pascoal. The result is a truly Brazilian form of electronic dance music, and listening to this disc offers the mix of excitement and mental challenge that one gets seeing a form of music emerge from the underground. \\"Caipirissima\\" is not a party disc: It is challenging and rewarding (and still decidedly groove-ful) look at how Brazilian artists have adapted electronic music to their own ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice summer album, though not necessarily for relaxing","review":"This is a very interesting CD, though if you're looking for gentle bossa breezes, it might disappoint you. It features quite a bit of drum n bass, and some wonderful experimental tracks, though, and it maintains high musical standards throughout.

I prefer the piano/sax lead instead of the organ lead with no sax, but thats just my preference. Steve Smith's drumming on this CD is absolutely perfect. You can still hear some rock influence in his playing, but his ability to lighten it up is superb. Steve...bring the sax back. Vitalive is simply the best live fusion CD Ive ever heard. And in my top 10 for sure. Second choice would have to be John Scofields \\"Pick Hits\\" which also cooks!

However, for a point and shoot or a prosumer camera, this is a great bag. (Although I don't know why you would need all this space for a point and shoot) It's got lots of pockets and is very sturdy. Couple of useless things on the bag, the zipper to close the inside body is very hard to close and not necessary.

It is not really about ninpo. One good thing about a book like this is that it makes one search more for the true information.

Now I know. I haven't let my neighbor try it out yet, but I'm sure he'd like it. I took it to a party and the kids there played with this book and thought it was neat. The games are actually enjoyable and, sometimes, even a bit challenging for me! I'm sure younger kids love them. There really shouldn't be an age limit on this!

It's being sold in Russia on the black market as \\"The Matrix 2.\\" 2. It has Bruce Campbell in it. Unfortunately, Bruce isn't in the movie for long, as he is killed off early in the picture. The rest of the film is pretty bad, being your typical DTV picture, but there are some good qualities to it. Michael Dorn is good as Menno's best friend, and there is some good humor. But most of the movie is very silly with terrible acting and pretty subpar action. I guess if you like \\"Johnny Mnemonic,\\" you'll like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"MENNO'S MINDLESS","review":"This is another one of those future societies where man's quest for self satisfaction is the major motivator of daily living. Too bad director Jon Kroll didn't enliven it with some good acting or great action scenes. As it is, we get Bruce Campbell for a few minutes as an underground rebel leader who when fatally shot downloads his brain into a computer. Nerdy computer geek Bill Campbell is then forced by the tough Stephanie Romanov to download Bruce's brain into his own so he can find out what it is that Brucie knew about an impending computer disaster. Corbin Bernsen (gleefully vile as usual) is an evil guy who is running for President and has decided to use the Resort to influence votes.The acting is negligible to say the least and the pace is snail-like at best.Could have been better, but no cigar this time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing","review":"I got this video and was excited by the possible plot, and bruce cambell is usually good. To cut to the chase this is dissapointing. It has a relative good idea, but the script is one-dimensional at best. The acting it sub par, the director never even gave bruce a chance to be bruce.

The 8 in 1 does have alot of neat features, the issue is it doesn't do any of the features very well. The toaster feature takes about 2 times as long to toast as a smaller, more conventional toaster oven. The Rotisserie is difficult to use and the grease catcher woefully inadequate. We found out the hard way when we had chicken grease overflow out of the grill and onto the counter.

So, I purchased this oven. I cooked full and entire meals with this oven. I used the top to cook and boil and the bottom to bake and grill. There is nothing it won't cook well. I have since moved to a much nicer apartment with a newer and cleaner stove, but, I still use my George Forman faithfully. It takes up less space and keeps the kitchen from being too hot.

It arrived damaged so back it went and I immediately ordered a replacement.It arrived undamaged but when I turned it on for a 15 minute try out, as suggested, it produced so much heat that I'm afraid we'll get burned. The back of the oven next to the wall was dangerously hot. Also, the door does not close--you can see into the oven at the bottom right when the door is closed--major source of heat loss.

It is cheap looking and does not work well. The toaster is the worst. The burners are too far apart from each other to work properly. It takes 10 minutes to make the toast. It toasts unevenly and the bread turns out baked and hard. I thought I was buying a black appliance but the only thing black is the face. The sides and top are a cheap metal color. The bun warmer on top is a joke. It is not deep enough to put anything other than a flat biscuit.

The idea is that the bun warmer is set into the hole to keep fresh bread warm. However, while baking or otherwise using the oven, heat will escape from around the edges of the bun warmer.Secondly, the edges of the front door don't meet the frame of the oven. I could almost put the tip of my little finger into one of the spaces.

Thank you to everyone who took the time to write detailed reviews of this product.I purchased this product because I was very happy with my George Forman grill and felt (along with the positive reviews) that this would be a smart buy. Thankfully, I made a good decision. I do enjoy this product and would recommend that if you are on a budget and have a small family this is for you!I haven't tried all the features but I use the oven almost daily.

But the quality is 100% pure garbage. Within a few months all the markings on the dials rubbed off; ok, I could live with that. But just after the warranty period expired, the rotisserie mechanism broke -- when even a small amount of weight is placed on the spit it tries to turn but slips back, which tells me (I have some experience in fixing mechanical gadgets) that the gears in the motor mechanism have broken teeth. This of necessity means that the material the gears were made of is extremely low quality, since ordinarily gears (that are not being shifted, as in a car transmission) DO NOT get teeth broken off. For $80 I'm not going to pay to have it fixed, I will use it a bit longer, but be warned: the parts are made out of junk materials and it will break, probably sooner than later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Parents who judge education systems/software by ability to keep the attention of today's ADD children regardless of actual educational content may like this.

Property inheritance relationship diagrams fill the book, quickly giving someone a good knowledge of all the classic point-set properties of spaces more thoroughly than is ever taught in grad-school these days. The only draw back is that the book and counterexamples deal strictly with point-set. How nice it would be to have a new edition (or volume two) of this type of book pertaining to algebraic topology.

The key is that the designs have been redrawn. This raises the possibility of aesthetic corruption- despite best efforts, it is impossible for someone of another time to accurately reproduce the aesthetic of the era. Only first generation sources- actual photographs, garments, illustrations, etc. from the actual era can be trusted to accurately portray dress of the era.

Also, due to this same issue, the \\"bottom\\" of the glass had to then be melted down manually to make the glasses able to stand upright. If you want something that's kinda corny and fun for a one-time deal, and don't mind spending the money, go for it.

Plus, the shot glasses are a bit annoying to remove from the mold. And since you're making ICE, they'll be slippery to hold and useless at holding any liquid because they're melting very quickly. We couldn't decide which happened more often: dropping them or having leaking holes on the sides. Even worse, if you try with juice, then you'll add stickiness to the equation when it starts melting.They're fun and easy to make, but they take forever to make and the novelty wears off too quickly.

As soon as the glass is rubbing flat against the Miracle Thaw we stop and put it in the storage container for the freezer. We bought our shot glass mold in Vegas.

However, that being said, after they have finished freezing, i would recommend placing around half an ounce of water into the bottom reservoir, or at least enough to flatten out a part of the bottom, as this will allow for more reuses before the bottom melts away, which can be an issue if you're making a lot of these for a party, or it's just a hot summer day. They're a lot of fun though, and i eventually bought a set for myself after i saw how much use my father got out of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I used these to make Jolly Rancher shot glasses for Christmas and New Years. They went over great and those who didn't get one kept asking if I could make more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Item","review":"I bought for my sister's bachelorette party and everyone thought it was amazing. I froze juice and water in them to turn the frozen shot glasses a pink color for her theme. It helped that it was in the middle of the summer too. I made quite a few glasses for the event and had no problems getting them unmolded at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great as a gift","review":"Bought 2 of these sets and they loved it, wish the set itself would be more than 4 but regardless I would recommend this to anyone who throws parties and gatherings... suggestion, either get more than one set or always have some already made in your freezer so you don't run out when the time comes to throw down shots around the table!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool mold","review":"These glasses are pretty cool, I have seen a lot of creative stuff done with them like freezing mint leaves or whatever. My only issue is that it takes some work to get the glasses out once they're done."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun item!","review":"Originally I received this from a friend as a gift and we've had so much fun with it that I bought it for a girlfriend that was turning 21. These are great because it's silicone and they come out of the mold pretty easily. Here are my suggestions to anyone that purchases them: Use a cold beverage in them otherwise they start to melt to quickly. To make more than the four, store them in the freezer on wax paper after removing. Try something fun like adding a bit of grenadine or lime juice after filling with water, it'll settle on the bottom which will end up being the rim of the shot glass and it'll give a bit of flavor with your shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for what it is","review":"This products makes a great humorous gift. They are good for one time shot, then expect to throw them in the sink right away or you will have a mess on your hands from the melting glasses. With that said. they are great for a one time (very cold) shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lick, Shot, Lime, Throw","review":"It works as advertised and very well. It takes longer than an hour for the glasses to form (around two) and it is a little difficult to get the frozen glasses out so you really have tug on 'em but the mold is very durable so don't worry about breaking it. The best part about this is realizing how fun it is to down a shot and then launch the glass down the street. Pro tip: get all the bubbles out of the water before it freezes so the glasses appear clearer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"I got these as a Christmas gift, and they are really neat. Root beer tastes SO good in mugs made of ice. :) I've also melted down candy and poured it in. That was delicious. As long as you wash it well before the first use, it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These work but need patience","review":"These work great but are definitely just a novelty. As an actual cup/shot glass, these do poorly. Hard to hold on to, melt rather quickly and you can get your lips stuck to the cup. Despite this I still give it 5 stars. No one should buy these expecting to replace all their kitchen cups with these. They have been a hit at parties, especially outdoor/patio ones. People take a shot and just throw the glass in to the yard. Here in Florida, it melts quick.I will admit that maybe 20% of the time, I get one of the cups that's unusable once it's frozen due to bubbles and such. I don't blame the product since it is simply a mold. But make sure to prepare well in advance for a party if you use these. Using koolaid in the mold also gets a cool (but sticky) result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"We love these shooters, they can get sticky and messy if you leave them out (obviously) or if you hold them for too long, but if you use them in \\"Boilermaker\\" style they are very handy and a nifty addition to any cocktail party."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY JUST DON'T WORK","review":"I tried it with water and the bottom just bulges up and will not freeze flat. This make a lopsided glass shots that won't even stand upright when your trying to pour something into it.The main reason I bought this was to try to make gummy shot glasses. It turned out to be a very sticky mess even when frozen. They become too soft when you handle them causing your drink to spill.Maybe I will find a good use some day but right now they are just junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate, easy to use","review":"Purchased this to weigh a sick cat. Bought it because it was identical to the one our vet uses. Very easy to use. (Would be easier with a baby, cats don't always like to stay still.) Zero's itself before every use.

I was attracted to the low profile (better in person than their stock photo), which meant that there was a good chance I could get my cats to climb onto it of their own volition. Large as well, which I also liked because it meant a greater chance for all four paws to get on the scale. After a little fiasco with shipping, received the scale and it is wonderful. Very accurate - yes, the timeout is sometimes short, but 9 out of 10 can usually get my boys to accomodate before it shuts off. If it happens, I just pull the cat off and hit the \\"on\\" button again. Not a big deal with adequate incentive... With the right \\"treat\\" anything is possible!

If it is chops that you're after - you've got it. On the other hand, if you're looking for music - turn elsewhere. Chops are what this guy is all about. Techniquely he is truly awesome, but he doesn't really have the faintest clue about the aesthetics of jazz music. The word \\"groove\\" cannot even be used in this context, since Gonzalo has no idea of how to swing in a jazz-like manner. His typewriter-like phraziation sounds hysterical as he rushes the time like crazy. Harmonically he makes a huge fool of himself in \\"Giant Steps\\", where most of the notes he plays are total garbage and have nothing to do with the chord changes. If you really do want to listen to mr.

He also gives technical explanations of how the sounds are produced.The technology was not available at the time, but I found myself wishing throughout the book that I could actually hear the sounds while reading about them. A companion CD would be much appreciated!This book is interesting but lacks the charm of his other books, particuarly To Know a Fly and The Ecology of a Summer House."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing and lovely","review":"Loch Lomond is definitely strange. I wasn't sure if I liked their first album or not; certain songs were brilliant while others were boring or over my head. The band was in a state of flux for a time, though, and that probably serves as the explanation, because now they are a full-fledged, six person band, and this EP they've released is incredibly good. I don't even have all the songs and I can tell you that it's a 10, or possibly a 9. \\"Bird and a Bear\\" is wonderfully weird, \\"Tic\\" is probably the highlight, \\"Virgin Mountain\\" has some really wicked lyrics, and the rest are just as good. It sucks that they are not more popular, but maybe, if word spreads, their next LP (due out sometime this year) will be a bigger seller for them.

The video quality is as grainy as a VHS copy.The special features include a segment from a British series called The Electric Theater Show, which discussed the making of, Who Dares Wins.The movie itself is fine, just don't expect stunning (or if your'e using HD as your benchmark ... good) quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find","review":"This film is one of the first flims that was about the S.A.S.

I was interested in trying the Transcend Ultraspeed 80x card due to the high speed claims at a decent price. Well, the company I ordered the part through indicated that Transcend no longer made the 128MB version and sent me a 256MB version. I was able to use the the 256MB version in another device. I noticed the higher transfer speeds on the first use. I did not do any real speed test measurements I just used the card and noticed the writing to the card was faster than some non-high speed cards purchased for a similar price. I think this might be good for some cameras or other devices that can take advantage of the high speed nature of the Transcend SD flash cards. The 4 star rating is because this actual part is not available anymore, but I think most people could use the 256MB size or even much larger nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating case studies of neurobiology","review":"The author risks decending into \\"Ripley's Believe It or Not\\" with thesecase studies from his own files of the neurologically damaged (and enhanced).

I found that the postscripts for many of the chapters took away from the feeling of the book as a whole. The postscripts are often heavily weighed down with medical information which can be hard to follow. The characters within the stories are very interesting, and it is nice to read how Sacks interacts with each character. Some chapters are much more captivating than others, \\"The Lost Mariner\\" and \\"Witty Ticcy Ray\\" to name a few. Although background information is a necessary part of understanding the characters, there are some chapters that have pages and pages of background information and then the story itself is not very long. Despite these minor flaws, Oliver Sacks delivers a wonderful collection of stories that are both informative and entertaining for any reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Valuable Text","review":"This is not light reading. It is a neurologists description of a variety of brain abnormalities and what they cause.

His characters are always \\"charming\\" persons, with \\"delightful\\" senses of humor. The title character is such a person who also happens to be a brilliant musician and painter, whose paintings, by golly, morph with time to trace the onset of his disease. His second subject, a man who cannot form new memories (like the protagonist in a later Hollywood film, Memento) nonetheless finds himself getting bored solving old puzzles. (If you can't remember anything, how does boredom set in?) In another account, he assigns super-human powers of discernement to a room full of otherwise incapcitated patients as they laugh at a broadcast of a political figure that Sachs obviously doesn't like. Be careful how seriously you take these stories, nothing jazzes up a tall tale like a claim of authenticity."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO tracking number","review":"There is no tracking number when the description said there would be.

What a disapointment!!True, the author is a pretty much well-known specialist on brain disorders and pretty much devoted to dismmiss a lot of prejudice one has against people with severe brain disorders, deserving all the accolades my neurologist has put on him, but it seems that (at least in the Portuguese edition I have read) the lackluster style of the texts do a lot of harm to the intensiveness of the narrative, which goes trough the lives of brain impaired people as if they were fictional characters and not real persons.I hope next time, the author will be more successfull in portraying situations like the ones presented in the book, which he surely knows a lot, but which he is not so much efficient to convey to readers like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"horribly cruel and unempathetic tone","review":"God save you if you were mentally ill and your doctor turned out to be Sacks.

It's lyout is one factor of that, for it is divided into tales so you can pick up this book, finish a chapter and pick it up again days later. I am a Psychology minor and therefore I thought it was in my best interest to read it. This book gives us tales of abnormal patients that attain very unusual mental disorders.

If you're interested in Psychology or Abnormal Psychology I really reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacks reveals the depth and mystery of the human psyche","review":"A well-known neurologist, Sacks writes of his experiences dealing with different clinical case histories. Sacks reveals the depths of the human psyche, drawing a picture of each patient's case in clear language, and infuses one with a sense of wonder at the human condition. It's comprehensible for the layman as well as the specialist, although non-medically oriented readers may find some of his neurological references difficult to follow. A fascinating book that will take the reader, in the author's own words, on a \\"magic carpet ride\\", Sacks, in this book, is more of a story-teller than anything else. He focuses on the specific personality and uniqueness of each patient, rather than on actual clinical treatment and outcome of each one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!

Most of the anecdotes were entertaining and thought-provoking, good for laypeople unafraid to wield their dictionaries in the face of neuropsychological jargon (infinitely easier when reading on a Kindle), but some sections did seem to drag on longer than necessary.

For example in the \\"Twins\\" chapter, on page 203, Sacks states he has a book that lists prime numbers up to 10 digits. As has been pointed out elsewhere, such a book, if it contained all primes up to 10 digits, would contain over 400 million numbers. Sacks later stated he no longer had the book, and it's possible it only went up to 8 digits (the case study was from 1966). I was so fascinated by the chapter that I looked for more info online about the twins, but hardly anything was found. This is disappointing, considering their stated talent was identifying prime numbers up to 20 digits long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was recommended by my psychology professor and had been on my reading list for over a year. I was finally able to begin reading Dr. Sacks' book this summer. I was more than a little disappointed. The people who are depicted in these stories are reduced to one-dimensional caricatures. Dr. Sacks' tone at times is pompous, as though he was these patients' only hope. This was distasteful to me, and instead of highlighting the lives of his patients, he uses his book as a platform to outline his accomplishments.I almost never put down a book without reading it from cover to cover. This book was the rare exception. I would never want to be treated by Dr. Sacks for a neurological problem, and I couldn't recommend his books to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the lay person","review":"This book describes some very interesting cases; people with brain damage or tumors or simply idiopathic.

If you have not seen any of the cases before, the book may impress you. But once you knew some of these cases before, or how our human mind works, what the book ends up is a lot of personal interpretations based on years of experience, but without any really good answers.

It says on the directions that you have a bunch of bosses, but you don't find them until about the fifth level. Usually I keep Pokemon blue version in my gameboy, but stometimes I play Topsy-Turvy. Its ok, but not the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWFUL TO FUN!","review":"MOST OF THE YOSHI GAMES ON MY OPINION STINK!THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE THOUGH.I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT,IT JUST IS.YOSHI CAN BE YOSHI,YOSHI BOAT,YOSHI BALL OR YOSHI BALLOON.ANOTHER MOST HAVE IF YOU ASK ME.S.L.J.C.O.A.A.A.T.R.OUT...AGAIN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but Semi-Easy","review":"I absolutely love this game!! To play, you turn the game system to change the elevation of the ground that Yoshi is on and the way that things roll or move. It works remarkably well! I have read other reviews of some other game like this and they said that the turning mechanism was faulty. I guarrantee you that this game works like magic! I am amazed at both this and the quality of the graphics. What a creative idea Nintendo had! I haven't yet played all of the Mario games, but I am most definitely working on that I can assure you. The ones that I have played so far have provided me with countless hours of fun! My only negative comment about this game is that it is not long enough and somewhat easy in the early stages. Have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fun Fun!!!!!","review":"This game is one of the best games I have ever played!!!! In the Game you actually turn your Game Boy to control Yoshi. The game's level's challenge gradually progresses throughout the game so you are constantly being challenged. Overall I'd say this game is one of my favorite games in the world!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fictional & Poorly written","review":"This book is so bad it has prompted me to write my first review. First of all, the book is poorly written. Random ramblings. Secondly, the content is clearly fictional. I am pretty open minded, which is why I picked up this book in the first place. But her descriptions of the other side just don't ring true to me. My sense is that she is making it all up for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIgh marks on content","review":"I don't know what other reviewers are looking for. For the same reason that they mentioned, I have not bought all of Sylvia Browne's books. There is some repetition from some I have per-viewed. If I had to get one, this would be the one to get. That it is from Francine, Sylvia's spirit guide, ....is why I purchased it. I am aware of some of the bad rap that Sylvia has gotten, I won't name the people who are part of it. But the content of the book is very insightful, thought provoking, intuitively makes sense to me. All of above. I must separate my review from 'repetitive' reasons and the like and base my review on the book alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock of ****","review":"The publishers should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this pile of fantastical rubbish to be published ...
