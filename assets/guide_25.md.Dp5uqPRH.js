I read where Sandra is very popular in Europe but has not caught on in the US, so I got a number of her albums. I now know why she is not popular here. Even though her voice is angelic, it is often drowned out by the monotonous drum beat that never changes from album to album and her words are hard to hear. If the unimaginative disco drum beat could be eliminated from all her songs, I would change my two-star rating to four stars. Without that, she will never be hit in North America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds too dated","review":"This is just for the nostalgic Europop fan. I remember there was too much going on in the U.S. music scene in 1986 for her to become a hit. Somehow \\"Maria Magdalena\\" crossed the pond and became a big hit in Latin America. Other Europop bands like Alphaville and Erasure did pretty decently in Latin America as well. In the U.S. only the Pet Shop Boys could make a dent. The problem with Sandra is the music is too syrupy to remain relevant after it had run its top-40 life. Still, Euro and Latin fans will disagree and will remember how great it felt when she was on the radio all the time 20 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandra has german style music","review":"I know sandra's music since I was a kid and it sounds really fine.

I bet the person who wrote this would consider themselves a Progressive. No problem with any viewpoint, but then represent the product as an opinion piece. My first experiences with IDIOT Guides was that they took accurate information and explained it simply and clearly. In this book the analysis was so slanted, it became immediately obvious after the first few Chapters. I finally lost trust in the credibility and accuracy of the information. It's not a Guide--it is an opinion piece. I will be cautious about any future purchases of IDIOT Guides. Maybe they should change to WIKIBOOKS.

Often semi-clothed. Enough said...","review":"Ah, the power of sex, and sexual images and thoughts, tawdry or otherwise. For some reason, I respond to seeing SS on the SS (silver screen) no matter how bad the script. I even liked her in \\"Casino\\" and \\"Basic Instinct 2\\". Of course, \\"Basic Instinct\\" is the Grail of SS movies. This one has many flaws, but it was never intended to be a Turner Classic Movie. As mere entertainment which offers a break from the often heart-breaking daily news, \\"Sliver\\" is not as bad as the critics said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy and Mildly Involving suspense flick!","review":"This is not a good film. If you like Sharon Stone I recommend 'Casino', and if you like Tom Berenger I recommend 'Platoon'. The film could have been much better, voyeurism is a provocative subject but it isn't well executed in this film. You can see the final conclucion a mile away, and the ending is not satisfying. Rent it first. From a scale of 1-10 I give it a 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad Movie that Sharon Stone STRIPS DOWN TO SAVE","review":"Once again Sharon Stone is in yet another terrible film. Her acting sucks big time also, but her breasts make the film very enjoyable. Seeing her in lingerie and getting those nice views of her chest saved the film. True, she wasnt in perfect shape, but still the director knew how to save his film (by asking Sharon to take her panties off)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time (or your money)","review":"This movie made me so mad I wanted to throw something at the TV.

In the movie SLIVER sharon stone returns for more skin showing in Joe's first script after BASIC INSTINCT. The sucess of BI told him the world really did love him! He is one of my idols, and I am saying that this is his 3rd best script ever. His first, and my first favorite movie: \\"BASIC INSTINCT\\", then comes the ever so naughty \\"JADE\\", then comes \\"SLIVER\\". A tale of seeing to much, and like BI it asks the question, \\"YOU LIKE TO WATCH,..... DON'T YOU?\\". This movie is great, the sex scenes are really tame, not very graphic, so the people that like Joe's script ideas, but just don't like the sex, then this one is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-intended but witless","review":"There's very little interest to be derived out of this voyeuristic, uncomfortable thriller. Almost every \\"suspenseful\\" moment is telegrammed and formulaic, the characters are hopelessly muddled, there are far too many illogicalities, and apparently Esterhaz threw in touches of dark humor that don't come off. Well let me explain the latter: the \\"panties\\" scene at the restaurant, the part where Stone and a bunch of friends at a formal gettogether at her apartment look through a telescope and see a couple having sex, and how naive Sharon is to the tempting William. I'm not sure if this was thrown in as comic relief or it's what AMAZON is talking about when they say it's unintentionally funny. The ending is particularly unsatisfying. This one is strictly for Stone fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instinct still there ........","review":"The two leading actors in this movie make it work. Stone and Baldwin are a winning combination. The story line is interesting and thirilling. This is a movie one can watch more than once. The line this movie will be rememered at is \\"go get a life\\". The love scenes are very well done and very sexy. If you enjoy a good \\"whodunnit\\" you will enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone... Hot. This movie... not.","review":"Back in the day Sharon Stone was the hottest thing in Hollywood. She is still very pretty and hot in this movie but... this movie is a turd. Billy Baldwin is a horrible actor and this movie seems to want to show Baldwins naked butt and hide Stones completely. I like Tom Berenger but he doesn't do much with the crapfest that is this script. This movie stinks. Stone is hot but you don't see her being hot enough or at all.Did I mention this movie stinks?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"Stone, fresh out of a bad relationship, moves into apartment where the last resident was murdered and as she settles in, the other tennants start getting picked off by a sloppy serial killer. Sleek and stylish but the sex and suspense of the film are mediocre as are the scares which are few and fleeting. Does raise some eyebrows with the subject of human voyeurism.

They changed some scenes so that they are show farther away to show more nudity and such, and the took out \\"the most wonder girl\\" by lords of acid over music rights, which I think is darn sily since it wason the soundtrack, but it's just good not to have to watch it on VHS anymore. It has a creepy feel to it being a voyeurism movie. If you know nothing about the movie. Sharon Stone moves into a tall building, it had hidden cameras all over, too bad they are black and white though. She gets naked plenty enough. That's all you need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"even Sharon Stone can't save this STINKER!","review":"...and she's a pretty lousy actress to begin with, but you'd think that with her looks this movie would be somewhat bearable.Nope, this has got to be one of the single DUMBEST movies I've ever seen. The plot is idiotic especially the ending, Sharon Stone has all of 2 or 3 rubber expressions on the whole time, the attempts at \\"steamy erotika\\" are a clumsy joke, both Stone and Baldwin phone in their high-school-drama-production performances...bleh!I was just glad that I rented not bought this total POS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sliver","review":"This is quite a good Sexual Thriller. There are some red herrings in the film and some tense moments. Performances by Stone, Baldwin and Berenger are good. I would have liked to have seen as extras the original ending filmed (which test audiences hated so much it had to be changed) on the dvd and the original trailer(which contained scenes that were not in the film). The book and film did have different endings. With the exception of the end which is rushed and doesn't go into detail for the killers motives it is an enjoyable sexual thriller and a good follow up to Basic Instinct from Sharon Stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Patriot Act in an apartment building?","review":"I just don't know about these Baldwin boys, so here this one is in this apartment complex and he is watching everyone on these television screens. Then yeah he does bed down Sharon Stone but by now we have all seen basic instinct so we are expecting the Douglas clan to come and join in on the fun. I guess if you want to see this guy get it on with her that is fine, but really people it is scary that they are watching you know? And I mean this film is dated because now we all have Google Earth anyways so we really do not need the millions of tv screens in the dark room effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panting buffet with plot on the side","review":"There's plenty of sex, with heavy breathing, sweat and tears. So if you're looking for a plot, but want to see Sharon Stone get busy as well, this is the film for you. Plot development is not up to par, but I don't think that was the focus of the producer. There is, however, a mystery and a guessing game that does leave you wondering who-dunnit. It's a movie characteristic of the era, so expect some predictable elements. The film is entertaining, though. NOT a family picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharon Stone Does It Again With A Little Help From Billy","review":"Sharon Stone has never lost hope with her acting and it wasn't until Total Recall and Basic Instinct that she received the credit she deserved. I became a fan instantaneously when i saw Basic Instinct. Sliver was an exceptional film with great acting on Tom Berenger, Stone and William Baldwin's part. The sexual scenes did not subtract from teh luring suspense because it played perfectly into her character, an emotionally distraught and vulnerable woman. I think this movie received Boo's from professional criitics but sometimes the most honest and meaningful words come from true fans that appreciate the movies more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great People Profile","review":"Kathleen Brady's profile of John Travolta is both thorough and entertaining.

I was happy to find this since the tracks You and I and In The Heat of The Night are some favorites of mines. You can't go wrong with this one. Music is so upbeat and uplifting, there is no negativity or dangerous symbolism here, no grunge or what have you just pure classic style and fashion blended together to make classy harmonious music without some guy in a torn up t shirt screeching like some grunge bands do. This makes a perfect introduction to start with, or if you're already a fan by the time you get this, it makes a neat new addition and is really so soulful and poetic that it is hard to describe but it makes a great addition to any collector's set or a new introduction for the ones who haven't heard of Enigma yet.

This album is absolutely beautiful, every tune is very catchy and soft, and it has some fierce electronic tunes at the same time. She has that special distinctive \\"Sandra sound,\\" thanks to Michael Cretu, that makes her hard to compare to other artists of that time period. I used to have it on tape, then it got lost, then I bought the CD a few years later and thought \\"Where have I been all this time?\\" \\"Long Play\\" is a part of soundrack of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite enjoyable","review":"This is the first time I have listened to Sufi music and I am impressed. The music is spiritually uplifting, but one must focus in order to really \\"feel\\" it.The Sufis are a small group of mystics who emphasize the esoteric aspect of the Islamic religion. They have become better known through the fame of the Persian poet Rumi. The Sufis are essentially Muslim Gnostics, focusing more on one's inner experience of the divine rather than ritual and purely intellectual knowledge (although the latter has its place).The first two tracks on this CD are rather long, but when listening to them it seems like time just melts away. They gradually build up in intensity, which corresponds to the whirling Dervish dance. You don't have to be a Dervish to appreciate this fine eastern music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd gladly trade this album for....","review":".... ANY Tori Amos CD!!!

This book was passed out to the development team at my company as something everyone should read. I read it and was shocked at how little content was in it. As put forth in MatSi's review, the message is basically plot everything. This book is basically advertisement for SPC. SPC is a good thing, but this book does little to further one's knowledge. It's rating is not justified and I just had to add a negative review to make more people really question the value of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very superficial","review":"Wheeler has only one premise: plot everything on an XmR chart and watch for outliers or trends. The entire book has very little other technical suggestions for data analysis. Wheeler's mathematical detail is extremely weak.

The same depth of knowledge can be gained in 10 minutes with a Google search."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deming for Dummies","review":"Wheeler serves up the best concise easily understood description I have ever seen for both statistical process control and the Deming management philosophy. No executive or manager responsible for imporving an organization can afford ignorance of the information in this compact volume. A leader blessed with competent statisticians may find that Wheeler's book suffices without other material covering the matter in greater depth. Leaders lacking support from statistically sophisticated staff may feel a need to stiffen their understanding with Deming's _Out of the Crisis_ and _The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education_. Even without a thorough understanding of continuous improvement philosophy, Wheeler's book, properly applied to your business, should easily offer an RoI well over 1,000,000%."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Book on Process Improvement - Even for Dummies","review":"Bought this book to get a glance to topic \\"process improvement\\" and to gain understanding in process improvement practices.

I recommend it to everyone interested in process improvement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best concept book for non-technical people","review":"I would agree that the details in the book are very, very basic. But that is what makes this so great in my opinion. Most organizations are focused on very small changes in numbers - something moved by a tenth of a percent, the punishments or celebrations must begin immediately - that are, in fact, not driven by anything anyone \\"did\\". I have worked with people who were very focused on the \\"moment\\". This book is excellent at communicating why that may not be the best way to manage a business.

This movie is a visual treat for the eyes and it has great dancing as well. If you love musicals (particularly those made in the 40's 50's and 60's) than you will love this movie. While this movie has a dark side for the most part it reflects the optimism that seems to be so much a part of the American character. Watch it you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homa, homa, homa!","review":"To tell you the truth, I haven't really seen many musicals from the 50's! I'd been too busy watching ones from the early 80's!I didn't hire the video until after I saw the musical performed on stage in the modest little town of Wangaratta, Victoria. I loved the show, the music and the story, so naturally I thought I better check out the vid!I think it actually works better on stage. The actors were better able to gauge the audience's reactions and play on that. Plus, they sang \\"Oklahoma\\" about five times due to the encores!Of course the movie is also gorgeous though and I'm definitely gonna hire out more musicals from that era, and of that ilk. It made me wish I was a local yokel living in Oklahoma... spending my days singing and trying to encourage the farmer and the cowman to get along! The jokes are very cute. Nothing much really happens, yet you find yourself on a fun and intriguing ride that leaves quite a smile on your face!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, Old-Fashioned FillmI","review":"Overall, this is a refreshing nice old-fashioned musical and a visual treat as well. I really liked the first part of this movie best with all the famous songs and great color that looks even better on DVD....and just a great feel of old-time wholesomeness.The story is just about two romances: the main \\"contest:\\" Gordon McCrae and Rod Steiger both vying for Shirley Jones, and the minor one with Gloria Grahame and two suitors. Grahame, with her humor as \\"Ado Annie Carnes\\" is the best character in the film, at least to me. Eddie Albert also chips in with some humor as the \\"peddler\\" and Charlotte Greenwood was good as \\"Aunt Eller.\\"Jones and McCrae are about as \\"All-American\\" as you can get and Steiger is the lone \\"villain\\" of the film. The most colorful segment of the movie was the dream scene that featured a great set.If I could change anything with this film, I'd reduce it in length down to two hours, which is plenty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video presentation, Sound continues to lack","review":"I have seen the musical Oklahoma many, many times. However, it has never looked so good. DVD has done wonders with stunning visuals and brilliant colors. Yet the sound for the Musical was rather dissmal. I was very disappointed. To be watching something so beautiful and to have the sound so miserable was a let down.

The original release I bought in 1999 gives a much clearer and brighter Todd-ao version that gives you a much better idea of what the original may have looked like. I enjoyed seeing \\"The Miracle of Todd-ao\\" again, but similarly the realism that was present in the original was lost, either due to poor quality of stock or inabilty to be able to digitally correct and sharpen the image. (I find it hard to imagine that Fox couldn't resore it better).There was an apology printed on our Region 4 version."},{"rating":"1","title":"20th Century Ripoff!!!","review":"I specifically waited to buy this on DVD hoping to get a Todd-AO version and not just the Cinemascope version. The freaking Laserdisc looks better than this! I, for one, will not be buying any more \\"special editions\\" without reading the reviews in Amazon or elsewhere when it comes to 20th Century ripoff. This release reminds me of all the 20Th Laserdiscs that were first released when laser was just starting out and how poorly the transfers were treated...now it seems we're right back to the good old bad transfer days of yore.

This DVD may disable your player.","review":"The new DVDs from Twentieth Century Fox use a very aggressive copy-protection scheme which grabs command of your player and then wreaks havoc. I had this experience when I inserted the 50th Anniversary Edition of Oklahoma into a Sony DVP-NC80V player. First I was forced to sit through a violent and offensive anti-piracy message and then I discovered that my disc player was completely unresponsive. The remote control would not work and neither would any of the buttons on the player itself.

Most of the songs lyrically were awful! Offensive and crude - and this movie was rated G??????

It does make you wonder what the thinking is when a Todd A O presentation is seemingly so bad.Right.....Fox . You have been badly damned in these reviews.

And it's great to switch to the French language option and hear the French singer Sacha Distel sing for Louis Jordan (though he's not credited).The Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, courtesy of 20th Century Fox, are a disgrace, and not up to the quality of their VHS releases! Without anamorphic mastering, these widescreen releases lack clarity and visual punch; you end up noticing the lines on the television and groaning about the lost opportunity to present these great musicals in their highest possible quality. I suppose we'll have to wait for Fox to re-issue them anamorphically as 'special editions', and buy them all over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie but VERY poor DVD transfer","review":"This is a great movie but the image quality on this transfer to DVD is just horrible. Now and then the colors are bright and well saturated and the film (print) looks fairly clean but in nearly every other respect the image quality is quite bad. There are many scenes where the image shimmer and flutter and edge artifacts are so bad that the viewing experience is completely ruined. In addition somewhere in the transfer from film they managed to introduce many odd shadows and visual defects that remain fixed on the image for long periods of time (looks like large out of focus pieces of dust in the optical system).This should have been a must have DVD for any fan of musicals. Instead we have something that is very disappointing because of the poor image quality. These comments refer to the CBS/Fox widescreen DVD version that was released in 1999. Ironically, this DVD is marketed with the THX Digitally Mastered label (\\"Superior Picture Quality\\" -- NOT!!!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame Fox Shame.","review":"Yes well you guessed it.I too think that fox have managed the release of this badly.Fox should outsource any re-release to Warners who know how to manage these things appropriatly.Shame Fox Shame.I'm sure you're reading this fox people.

I sincerely hope FOX will offer a recall on these discs.In the meantime, I will be watching my ten year old Laserdisc, also mastered from the Todd-AO print. Although not enhanced for a widescreen TV, this edition has excellent picture and sound.It is a small consolation that the second disc in the DVD set includes a great featurette on the difference between CinemaScope and Todd-AO. This features the use of a video process called \\"Smilebox\\" that simulates the curved screen used in the original Todd-AO releases. It also features the two short subjects made to show-off the Todd-AO process.

Matt and Keith have different, but extremely complimentary voices. When they are harmonizing on songs like \\"The Mountain Song\\" and \\"Willingly,\\" the sound is pure magic. Both guys are great songwriters and musicians, and these songs are just beautiful.\\"On The Sea\\" (in a very different form) is the only song from this CD that concertgoers will still hear from VH.

These guys I can just really identify with both lyrically and musically. Natural Born Chaos is the follow up to 2001's A Predators Portrait (which was a BLISTERING and AMAZING album) and what most Soilwork fans consider to be their best.Natural Born Chaos (produced by the muscial genius from SYL, Devin Townsend) starts off with the engaging and speedy track, Follow the Hollow. Its pretty much non-stop from there. The songs keeps a good momentum flowing and the instrumental work is wonderful. Every song on this album is a masterpiece and every listener of this album is bound to be able to pick one out that they can relate to.

This album uses keyboards, and very little growl singing, not as brutal as carcass. However, there is plenty of double bassing and complicated riffing to make any Metal head happy. It is refreshing that metal like this is still being released. I picked this album up as a suggestion from one of the few sales clerks who knew anything about metal at a Sam Goody. I basically told him, to point me in the direction of anything close to carcass or entombed, and I got soilwork.

This album is absoluitely incredible. As a fan of raw, brutal metal in the vein of In Flames, Dark Tranquility, At The Gates, etc, I must say that the melodic, cleanly sung choruses on this album are a great diversion from the crushing riffs and do not at all detract from the \\"heaviness \\" of this disk. On the contrary, the alternating tension and release dynamic created by the contrasting heavy riffage/growling and the melodic, almost catchy chorus parts give this album a really interesting twist on current metal and hopefully a glimpse into the future of the genre. Natural Born Chaos by Soilwork is on the cutting edge of modern metal.

The old Swedish melodic powerhouse, Soilwork, has gone soft. What happened to the fast riffs and dazzling melodies? The 21st century is a sad era for metal, with bands like In Flames and Arch enemy loosing touch with their old Swedish melodic style. If you do like good music I suggest you check out Soilwork's older stuff like \\"Steelbath Suicide\\" or \\"The Chainheart Machine\\"...I even would suggest \\"A Predator's Portrait\\" despite the few clean lyrics, because unlike \\"Natural Born Chaos\\" they still stay true to their older style and pump out fast paced, outstanding melodies.

I don't care if they are trying to sell out or not, this music is just bland, boring, and even annoying. Don't try to sing when you're a screamer.

The \\"clean vocals\\" are a very nice touch. While some people don't like them, I really think that they add a great level of depth to the songs. They don't over-do them at all.New listeners along with existing Soilwork fans, will enjoy this album very much. (it's a wonderful alternative to the new In Flames Album).Oh yeah, if you haven't picked up \\"Chainheart Machine\\" by Soilwork yet, you're really missing out.

It's got a plot that meanders all over the place, seemingly without point or purpose. It's got extremely, agonizingly bad acting by people you never heard of (the sister is particularly bad). And it's got very poor technical quality. The audio, for example, is terrible. Some of the dialog is virtually inaudible. I'd be embarrassed to have been part of any aspect of this movie.The only thing remotely interesting in it is the band that seems to be channeling Aerosmith. But even that isn't interesting enough to save this mess.If it is on late-night TV and you can't sleep, you might want to watch it. I guarantee you won't last the 83 minutes this movie takes up.You've been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"ACOUSTIC NEW ORLEANS BLUES.","review":"A refreshing new release from a New Orleans guitarist who refers to his music as \\"cosmic blues\\". That is an interesting characterization for 14 original and catchy tunes that are firmly grounded and may better be described as roots music with obvious delta influence.Osborne's vocals are soothing and soulful and almost recall a younger Van Morrison. His guitar playing is consistent and upbeat.In addition to Osborne, nineteen other musicians make an appearance on the disc including Keb Mo' on \\"Greasy Money\\". This is definetly one of the better acostic releases of 1999 and one that deserves support from blues fans.

It works very well for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY AND DESIGN","review":"not the best shower head you'll ever use so save the cash. Waterpik makes better than this, i bought this because ive use their flexible shower head for over 7 years and thought this would be a step up but its not. The arm design is extremely flimsy as well as the 2 areas you adjust the height and pitch to move the arm and head are really super flimsy. The pressure is not that great vs. the regular shower head i had and nothing compare to the flexible shower head which you can ALSO position to the same rain style position over your head. My advice, pass on this one and if you really want a cool shower head check out the waterpik Linea 6-Mode Showerhead on amazon, its half the price and much better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks nice, works WELL","review":"Used in overseas home where water pressure is not very good (around 20psi average vs 35psi in the USA). Still works very well.Although it has 8 settings, we only like the two rain options...guess it's due to the lack of water pressure: it's not enough to get a good massage from the other settings.Worth the purchase price and much better than a standard shower head: It's very enjoyable to use.> About leaking...NO leaks or problems, but I did install it using PTFE Seal TapeAmpro A1441 PTFE Seal Tape 1/2-Inch X 260-Inch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Desent head for the money","review":"Shower head is nice for the money.

I had to have one. It was easily installed (my husband however did have to add a washer to one of the connections). It has 8 settings which all work fine, but ours will remain set on the drenching rain - lovely! The shower curtain no longer sucks in and the shower walls are not soaked (since I wipe them down after each shower this makes me happy). I thought that perhaps with such a gentle rain I would not be able to get the soap out of my hair, but this is not the case at all.

Even waterpik customer service never got back to me. The part is so thin and poorly manufactured it's almost as if they want it to break on you so you purchase a new shower head from them.

Which I didn't know was on until I felt a burning pain in my side.2)If light is in face down, it is a very snug fit and may scratch the upper part of the light on the bezzel.All in all I like it and have figured ways around some of the siiues. In my opinion its still one of the best because its made for the light, and you don't have to fool with any flaps to get your light out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deployable product","review":"Pros:I purchased this product as a primary light source as an alternative for a weapons mounted light. I placed the holster on the front of my Sam Brown within easy draw/reach for my weak hand. You can easily draw the light from this holster and move quickly into the Weaver without any difficulty. Draw is smooth and simple and holstering light is just as easy. Seems to be well constucted and should be durable/deployable for a few years.Cons: Price should be reduced by at least $5.00. Flashlight sits a little high when used lamp down. Lamp down is a nice sleek fit. Lamp up draw is similar to the draw of a fresh mag in that you have to pinch grip and then rotate to deploy.UPDATE!!!Its now April 2011 and have been wearing product in the field under many circumstances. Have been an LE for 20 years and this is the most tactically sound way I've deployed a light. Quick out of the holster, easy to re holster. Strong product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost","review":"I love Surfire products!!! So, I bought this holster for my duty belt. Was great for about six or seven months. Then the light would get stuck. After this happened a number of times, the metal clip inside the holster broke. Now it won't hold the light. I know the light can be put in the other way, but that feels like I could loose it. Twenty-five bucks is a little high to just go get another one. The light is awesome!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect holster for the perfect light","review":"I carried this on my duty belt for two years and couldn't be more pleased. It is light and strong, holds the light securely, while giving quick access. You will more than likely use your flashlight more than any other item on your duty belt. So it pays to be able to access it quickly while insuring you don't lose it in a scuffle or in getting into and out of your car. You can't go wrong with this one, I've found nothing else that works as well and considering the price you can't go wrong with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"Ordered this product for law enforcement work.

I am also proof that they work. My experiece with Joe's training methods were personal and resulted in a dog that was a Champion in Two states for 4-H; Also one that was the envy of anyone that met him.

My family have always had dogs but had always been content to get as far as \\"sit\\" and then let them do what they wanted.

I've recommended the book to countless others and am about to order it as a gift for someone who recently got their first dog. I hope that it will provide him with as much insight as it gave me and I can assure you that you'll gain plenty of tools, both practical and thoughtful, from this book. More than just giving you a series of instructions, this book will help you to have a little more of an idea of what's going on inside the canine head.

I found it to be very informative on how to understand dogs, and simple basic steps for training a canine. I had begun to train my Rottweiler pup and then read McMains book. After reading the book I found out just why my tactics were not very effective. The author points out several dos and don'ts on dog training. Its as though he has the ability to understand them and he passes that information on to the reader. Aside from the book being very informative, the style in which it was written is basic talk. Not too many technical words to confuse the reader and at times he is downright funny. Dog Logic. The best few bucks I have spent on my pooch this year. I am well on my way to a dog that is trained and a pleasure to live with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful book from an exceptional author","review":"This book is very helpful in understanding dogs and some of the reasons for training certain ways. Training is something that has to be experienced by the trainer as well as the dog. I am sure it is a lot more difficult for me to learn how to train my dog than it is for the dog to learn. I am fortunate enough to be able to attend classes with our golden retriever, Max, that were taught by Joel McMains. He has a rapport with dogs that is unbelievable. They respect his authority, from the moment they first meet him. Max loved the classes and was eager to return each session to see Joel. It is obvious that Mr. McMains knows what he is talking about and is very helpful. I would highly recommend this book and his classes if you are lucky enough to attend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog Logic?","review":"Do not get this book unless you have a dog that's more than 6 months old.

He is just fine. If you already have a dog, don't get this book unless you have a dog Joel considers trainable. This book was very discouraging and disappointing. He even writes that a dog should never be paper trained. Puppies shouldn't go outside till they're fully vacinated.

Organic still may be missing some nutrients depending on the soil conditions, harvest time, etc. This is becoming a buyer beware market also as many so called organic suppliers are giving into the $ sign of the Monsanto's of the world.

The G-string broke while trying to tune down a step. EXTREMELY p****d off and don't think ill be buying this junk again. Long lasting? Could have fooled me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Sound and Sustain than earlier Elixirs","review":"This new Nanoweb coating promises to make the strings last longer due to slower oxidation which normally coats the strings over time and dulls the sound. Having used Elixirs with the thicker coating, I thought they were actually inferior when they were new to Martin SP Phosphor Bronze strings which had been played for several months. I'll report this is no longer true with the new thinner coating. Now, on my Yamaha Compass South acoustic, playing finger style or with a plastic pick, they sound approximately as loud, though not quite as rich, IMHO, when compared to the Martin strings when both are new. The price, which used to be about double, is now only about 30% higher than the Martin SP's. So if you want strings which should last longer on a guitar you don't play every day, these are a good alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polyweb, Not Nanoweb","review":"Although the title of this item says \\"Nanoweb\\", the picture and the item I received were \\"Polyweb\\". Now that I have had both kinds, I will say that they are both great strings and I will continue buying Elixir - however, the Polyweb strings are a lot harder on my fingers than the Nanoweb, almost to the point of not wanting to use the guitar as often. Unfortunately I bought two sets so it looks like I will be learning to deal with it ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cable didn't work","review":"I lost my usb cable to the Philips GoGear MP3 player and needed a new one.

Ok so I triple checked the connections and tried again...same problem. I went to the Philips website and downloaded the latest driver...same problem. I contacted Philips tech support, no help. I tried another computer, still not working. I contacted GoMadic and they asked me in a series of emails if I had done all the above mentioned trouble shooting steps. I responded to each email that I had done so. I got an email stating I would get a new cord in the mail...never arrived.

She divides the book into short, dynamic, well-written chapters that capture the point quickly. You don't need to be a working mom to enjoy this book, as she touches upon quite a few interesting topics, like the relationships between adult children and their aging parents and choosing love when one's career is booming.I have one quibble though - her book overall focuses on what I would deem the upper middle to upper classes of society. People who are CEOs, orthodontists, attorneys, New York writers and the heads of Internet Start-ups. I'd love to have heard the voices of those who likely have a harder time balancing work & play - folks who work two jobs to make ends meet, waitresses, college students with part-time jobs and young children, etc.Other than that, I found the book to be a delightful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pick it up","review":"what a great read! the stories are fun and i can relate to them as a mother of 3.

Some, like Katie, stay to lend their ideals and compassion.I have read some reviews in which ''Crazy Love'' is likened to David Martins pre-thriller novels.

Certainly worthy of any accolades it received either in the US or the UK, especially as it includes one of Simply Red's most identifiable singles, \\"Holding Back the Years.\\"I've got to say though, when I first heard Mick's singing, I did not think he was a male, British readhead. I thought he was an African American woman like Aretha Franklin or Big Mama Thornton.

The harmonies, the singing, the tone of the voices were to die for. I looked forward to receiving this CD with great anticipation, but was sorely disappointed when I heard the sound quality. Most tracks (except for 10 and 11) sound like they were recorded by some guy who wandered in off the street with his portable tape recorder. The sound is so bad the magic of the group is totally missing on these cuts. Luckily, track 10 (\\"I've Got Myself Together\\") is almost worth the price of admission - it really cooks. There is no warning about the sound quality in the Amazon listing or on the CD cover.

They think they can go from being Hanson and BackStreet Boy lovers to having a cd with Slipknot on it without raising a few suspicions they were wrong. This is just another attempt of MTV to make a few more dollars. They took some of the worst songs off of certain cds and labled it THE RETURN OF THE ROCK? I admit, I watched the return of the rock show whick happened to be on at 12:00 at night a couple of times, the first time I watched it, it was ok, the second I noticed that 90% of the songs on it, were on the night before?

I just bought this cd, and already it is one of my favorites. The Kittie song is awsome. Some of these bands many people haven't heard yet, but it can get you into some good stuff. Most people haven't heard of Static-X or Kittie, and the songs they picked to include by these artists give you a good idea of what their own albums will be like. It also includes a lot of older bands, or more popular bands (I bought this for Kid Rock and Korn at first). In the end, though, the Korn and Kid Rock songs aren't the best on the cd.

This happened to me last semester with a french textbook I bought on here as well. If I had wanted the old edition, I would have purchased it.

(In this it complements Coe's companion book, MEXICO.) The sixth edition nicely takes account of recent exciting developments in deciphering Maya script, which is a useful addition, since these are headline grabbers that correspond well with what is likely to bubble over into the news media. As a balanced, archaeologically responsible, continuously updated account, with lots of maps and pictures to amplify the text, this is a really useful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called peach fuz trimmer","review":"Sick of going through a $20 trimmer ever year or two, i decided to buy a nice one for myself.

Really good stuff if you're patient enough to let it simmer. What I would consider to be the introduction takes about 200 pages. Even then, it's not really until the end of this first book in the series that it really reaches the pace and depth that spurs you on to pick up the rest - immediately. No, it's not your quick fantasy fix, but it's infinitely more satisfying than the easy in-easy out fantasies that abound these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regurgitated Lord of the Rings","review":"I truly enjoy a good fantasy epic story. I was very excited to get lost in this one. However, in addition to it being painfully slow, it was such an unabashed takeoff of LOTR I couldn't take it. I decided time and again to just keep at it and Williams would add his own originality and surprise. I read 590 pages....and then when the good king sent an unlikely small group out on a dangerous quest to find a sword of power in a mountain, that was it. Come on! It was like watching the bad B movie remake of LOTR. Painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This series follows the adventures of one kitchen boy named Simon. He doesn't seem like much at first but he shows plenty of grit when the chips are down.As the book opens the old king Pester John is about to die. He is literally a self-made man the son of peasants who has ruled the land for almost 80 years.His two sons start to fight shortly after his death and when one of them disappears rumors start to fly about open rebellion of the Joshua against Ellias.Simon discovers the truth and is drawn into a conspiracy that is both ancient and the most ultimate of evil.He will find friends and lose them along the way to the last free lands in the empire. A terrible battle awaits him and his new friends upon arrival and it will keep you thoroughly interested.The only thing that might throw you off is the vast amounts of characters there are so many and each is drawn with great attention to detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't do it","review":"I really really tried, but just couldn't do it. I got 100+ pages into the book and was about to give up, but all the reviews on here said stick with it. Now I'm 100 pages from the end, and I don't see any point in going on. While I love Williams' other books, this one jsut did nothing for me. it wandered around too much. I didn't care about the characters. Spend all my time wondering there things were going, and suffered through the plodding to get there. if you've never read Tad before, start somewhere else and find much better material."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that'll keep you coming for more","review":"It's an overall good book, but has many of the classical plots used by many authors around the world (i.e. peasant transformed into hero). It wouldn't be good for someone who couldn't stand politics and only reads fantasy cause they're really bloodthirsty, but it's very interesting with fascinating plot twists and strange new ideas never before thought up. It tends to have less action than your usual fantasy book, and it might be more sophisticated than the turtle and the hare, but it's basically a good book that you'll want to read as much as possible. The length might also be a little daunting, but hey, you can handle it. Anyways, you'll wish it was longer by the end of the book. Overall, I'd say it's almost up there, in my opinion, with the Wheel of Time series (Of course, nothing can match that). I'd recommend it for any fantasy-obsessed reader like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"...must try to stay awake....","review":"I bought this book based on all the hype I've heard from other people and from reading so many favourable reviews. I should have saved my hard earned dollars... I must agree with the few enlightened critics out there who complained about the \\"yawn factor\\" when it comes to reading this novel. I could only read 2/3's of this book before I couldn't take it anymore. The story moves too slowly! The only reason I read as much as I did is because I felt I should at least try to get something from this book after spending money on it. If you love long drawn-out descriptive fanatsy novels that meander about the place without really getting anywhere, buy this book NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"slow then moving","review":"Like most other reviews have said, the first 200 pages are slow, it's introducing you to the many characters and scenic landscapes. I do believe he could have dropped about fifty or so pages, to do this. But Williams is a true wordsmith and even though its long, his words make it far from boring. After those first 200 pages the story really picks up and makes reference to all the characters and lands that were introduced, This story is a great epic one and if you make it through these first 200 the story never waivers, and moves at rapid pace from here on out through the entire trilogy. I've had many of friend think me for urging them past the first 200.Hope everybody gets to check out this epic fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"At the risk of offending, I will say that, while Tolkein probably must be credited as the greater story teller, Tad Williams' beatiful writing style is a treasure that not even Tolkein can rival.Besides a slow start, which is forgivable given the solid foundation that is created, this book is awesome. Having read the entire series, I can assure you that you will be so captivated by the story before the end, you may forget to read slowly enough to relish Williams mastery of the language. A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored Senseless","review":"I thought this book was boring and slow moving and couldn't get into it. I didn't like the characters either. I might be spoiled on George RR Martins song of ice and fire trilogy. And I began reading this book because he's a fan of Tad Williams. This book is what made him want to write Ice and Fire ! I guess I have different taste than Mr. Martin his book was ten times better than this one. I thought the characters were lame, and the story itself a retread of other works. He does do a good job of describing his world in detail which I enjoyed. I give this book 100 pages, still no interest.I just couldn't get into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helps you fall asleep","review":"In this case I'm afraid I must agree with many of the more negative reviews. This book is simply INCREDIBLY slow and boring. It drags on and on and on, about a dull life in a castle, then a trip that is equally boring, on and on and on... The main character is extremely hard to like; slow, dull witted and whimsical. He mopes about, drags his feet, cries and feels sorry for himself. What is his reason for existing? I can't stand him. Most of the figures feels very paper cut, not even Dr Morgenes - whom I would like to feel something for - manages to capture me at any deeper level.I'm at over 400 pages and still struggling. I only kept at it because it helps me fall asleep at night. Put your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"third times a charm","review":"After reading the reviews of this book, I think that I am finally going to complete it.

I would purchase from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, just not good.","review":"There's nothing in particular that was bad about this book. Usually when I can't finish a book it's because there are some really annoying characters or the author has a really bad style of writing. That wasn't the case here; I just couldn't get into it. The plot was a little too slow and I didn't care enough about the characters to make it through the story with them. I got about halfway through the book and it became too much of a struggle to finish each chapter. So it's not a bad book, it just wasn't good enough to finish. Ever since I started reading George R.R. Martin so many authors seem to have the skill of children."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my fave's","review":"Tad Williams is one of the best writers i have read so far. It is a VERY SLOW STARTING BOOK for about the first 150 pages, but after that it just keeps on grabbing attention. It is a very well written story, and I enjoyed it more than the Lord of the Rings, all though I still love that epic immensely. I will say this much, if you enjoyed Tolkein, give Tad a try, because Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn are better (to me) than Tolkein. The story starts out so slow because it has to give you the history of the main character and the kingdom's drama in which he lives as he grows up. I have never befriended a character as much as Simon, because of Tad's idea of writing a story in which you watch the boy grow into a man. GREAT STORY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, I look forward to the rest of the series","review":"I've just finished book one of this series and am waiting for the second to arrive.It took me a bit longer than usual to get into Williams' world, but I think he does a virtuoso job of world building-- very, very descriptive. I like his main character and find that he acts convincingly. As is often the case, his protagonist isn't as interesting as many of the supporting characters. I like the idea of friendly trolls and think the Sithi will turn out to be very interesting characters.While agree that parts of the story line are the same as many other fantasy novels (ignorant boy thrown into quest-type situation) I think Williams is doing a great job with it.I don't think this would be a good book if a person is looking for a stand-alone novel, so you'd better be prepared to do some reading if you buy the first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but...","review":"The book itself was fantastic. Beautifully written, engaging, great characters, etc. It did start off a bit slow, but the last half more than made up for it. I highly recommend reading this book.I really just wanted to say that the Kindle version is a mess. There are constant spelling errors, typographical errors, punctuation where there shouldn't be any and vice versa, italicized words where there shouldn't be and again, vice versa. The really sad part of that is the Kindle version is actually more expensive than the paperback I could've bought at my local Barnes & Noble.I just started Stone of Farewell.

I still can't get Williams' masterfull storytelling out of my mind. Never have I felt so close to characters or cared so much about their plights. If you are reading this and have yet to read the book, stop here and go get the complete series. But be warned, I have yet to find a series since completing MS&T to satisfy my demand for rich storytelling. I'm afraid the series may be to good, leaving all others lacking.P.S. If you don't like to think and you don't care about the careful wording an author chooses both in narrative and dialouge, then don't bother with this series. Get a Goodkind novel instead and be happy with mindless and intellectually insulting writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a riveting tale of fantasy which you cannot put down","review":"Memory, Sorrow and Thorn, Book 1 is the opening for for one of the greatest fantasy trilogies since C.S. Lewis. Every character lives and breathes so that you have to follow them into the second and third books without delay. I couldn't wait to see how Simon and other characters fared in their adventures in the two sequels. This book should not be missed if you are a fantasy reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"He could learn from Robin Hobb","review":"I read the first 273 pages and gave up. All Simon did was cry and feel sorry for himself. The trolls' speaking was too cutesy and contrived.Mr. Williams could learn alot from Robin Hobb about creating characters the reader care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent start to an excellent series","review":"This is one of the most vivid and realistic fantasy series thats I have ever read. I found the world of Osten Ard to be far more engrossing than Middle Earth. The characters feel fresh and unpredictable, and their journey always encounters great twists.That being said, what you have no doubt read in the other reviews is quite true... every chapter in the series that occurs underground seems to become instantly boring. Between Simon wandering under the castle (several times), and the displaced maiden (forgot her name) spelunking in the ancient city, the stumbling about in the dark does get old very fast. Brave on through these chapters, for the reward is well worth the patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched, no originality, boring.","review":"Yet another epic where a country boy has to go on a quest to stop an ancient wizard who was defeated hundreds of years ago but now is amassing an army. Instead of rings, they're trying to find swords. One of the main characters is a suspiciously hobbit-like troll. Williams should be embarrassed--what's the point of writing a book if all you're going to do is rewrite Tolkein, and do it badly at that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"very poorly written","review":"I persevered for almost 100 pages. By then the direction of the plot was still unclear. It's like the author just finished reading \\"Similes & metaphors for Dummies\\" and couldn't wait to spin bunches of colorful and confusing comparisons. The author is definitely in his own fantasy world, but gives the reader very few opportunities to go along with him. Some passages are so loaded with excess verbage that I had to stop and re-read them even to get a vague idea of what he was trying to say. Don't waste your time or money. Spend your time and money on RR Martin or the Eragon series if you want great writing and memorable storylines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blacklisted - Georestricted - Not Free SF Reader","review":"A standard fantasy, but non-standard, if you see what I mean. You havea young boy setting out to become more than he his. However, this storyis not of the princess, knight and dragon school of high fantasy, andhas always seemed to more, more realistic, perhaps a little grittier,or more grounded, which made it enjoyable enough to get through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willing to read over a 1000pgs?","review":"Over the years I have become a bit of a snob. It seems to me now that if a book can wrap up completely in under 1000 pages it better be part of a series. All the great works are long winded series that take time to develop. The first time I read the book I was in 8th or 9th grade and did not finish it, since then I have finished it and the series several times. My opinion is that this is a slow starter but the series is worth it in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"I have been reading A LOT of fantasy novels and this oneseems the worst of them all. Pages after pages of nothing but stumbling words, saying nothing that would move the plot forward. I can't imagine how it can be comapred to Tolkien where the action was going one from book one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not groundbreaking","review":"'The Dragonbone Chair' follows teen aged Simon, scullion in the castle of High King Prester John. When Prester John dies his son Elias inherits the throne, and a shadow falls over the kingdom. Simon finds himself caught up in the dispute between King Elias and his brother Josua, as well as the machinations of the evil Priest Pyrates. Ultimately he is forced to flee the castle and take part in a desperate quest to find the legendary sword- Thorn.This is book one of 'Memory Sorrow and Thorn'. Tad Williams is not breaking new ground here, but still it is fairly good. Many complain that it takes too long to get going but I didn't really find that to be an issue. Although the main focus is on Simon, Williams switches frequently to other character's story arcs.The world building is pretty good, with several human cultures, trolls and the immortal Sithi, and lots of names with apostrophes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"Enjoyed the book. Seemed the plot and ideas were not completely put together as well as I would of liked. Williams himself claims as such...His Otherland series is great and he proves his writing skills in them. However, MST is great anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"The only series (and particularly this first book) that has ever made me say out loud: \\"what a great book\\" - and not just once or twice.Sure, the main plot looks suspiciously familiar (elves, kitchen boys with a Destiny, magic swords...), but honestly: it doesn't matter! Usually it matters a lot, but here this negative aspect just gets overwhelmed by the imagination of the subplots, the richness of the world imagined by Tad Williams, and the vitality of the characters (they develop gradually according to their experiences - when was the last time that this happened in a fantasy book?)In one sentence: a wonderful ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"In love<3","review":"I have a passion for books... so let me warn you now the first 150 pages will definitely test your resolve.. I was so angsty to get to the good parts that I didn't absorb as many of the names and places as I should have.. what to me started out as an extremely dull read started blossoming almost instantaneously into a page turning addiction till the end of this novel! I could only have a deep appreciation for the intricate groundwork Williams creates in the Castle Hayholt..The story line is superbly put together (minus some grammatical errors that I could care less about compared to the quality of the story and the richness of young Seoman's world)and flows wonderfully!If there are any avid readers out there who are sad that a good book ends after 300 pages...You are in for thousands with this great series.. I cannot wait to get my hands on his other works am so happy I took a friends advice!Great job Williams"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow starter but I celebrate this entire series.","review":"I'd say the first 100 pages of this book are not very characteristic of the rest of it. It starts off very slow and somewhat childish to the point I almost put it down. All I can say to someone is keep reading. This turned out to be one of my favorite series in general. Yes it certainly has similarities to Tolkien, but honestly as far as fantasy is concerned what doesn't? I thought the story blossomed into something really special. I thought the characters and fantasy elements in this book, while similar to fantasy elements in general, where unique enough to where this book was not a copy of anything else. The Sithi were not just elves with a new coat of paint.Rarely do I re-read any book and I've read this entire series twice, that's how much I liked it. The main reason I don't give the opener 5-stars is because the beginning almost made me miss this wonderful series.Both this book and the series in general are long and complex. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A languorous, long-winded bore","review":"I loved Tad Williams \\"Otherland,\\" so I bought the pricier, trade paperback versions of all three books in this series.

Cardboard characters, lame plot, horrible pacing...basically 638 pages of painful back-story. An awful waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly slow and detailed","review":"I kept slogging away the first half of the book but it is overly detailed and tedious. I did finish it only to feel like the story had just began. Tad Williams needs a much better editor to trim the excess and he needs to bring some kind of completion to each story even if it IS the first of a trilogy. I will not be buying the rest of the set. The story was just starting to really take off when the book is chopped off. I know he wants to get readers hooked and sell more books, but I felt I put a lot of reading in for very little satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Tolkein...","review":"Defiantely the best Fantasy series I have read... and the last two books stand on their own.

Why write a biography of Errol Flynn, of all people, if you're going to do it with no humor and with lordly disdain? It's like a biography of Tom Sawyer written by his half-brother, the tattle-tale goody-goody Sid. Like many, I guess, I picked it up in order to read about Sean Flynn, since there is so little out there about him. But as noted, Sean is reduced to three chapters presented as endpapers. One might conclude there wasn't enough to his short life to make a full book... if there weren't so much other evidence of the biographer's tendency to stop researching once he has enough evidence to support his (rather ugly) pre-determined thesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely well written Biography!","review":"As a long time fan of Errol Flynn, I had to buy this latest biography. This is probably one of the best written biographies on Flynn I have ever read. It is right up there with MY WICKED WICKED WAYS by Flynn himself. This book is painstakingly researched with obvious assistance from the Flynn family for accuracy. No outrageous claims are made as in the past books about the actor. It is downright eerie how parallel Sean and Errol Flynn's lives really were. Definitely a must read for Flynn fans and highly recommended to those who love all things Classic Hollywood.Reviewed by Miriam van Veen"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's not that bad","review":"This book isn't easy to describe. The title and cover are certainly misleadingbecause, as some reviewers have pointed out, the book contains scant informationabout the life of Sean Flynn, and the few insights given into Sean's motivationsfor taking risks in Vietnam are little more than pop-psychology. That being said, if read strictly as a biography of Errol Flynn, the book is pretty darn good. The authorhas a good understanding of alcoholism, and his insights into Flynn's mentalstate during his final years, as the toll for all the wild living comes due, are very interesting.My recommendation is to ignore the title and enjoy one of the better short bio's of a man who had a very interesting life."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems","review":"I received the product when expected, packaging was perfect and there were no problems.

The story telling is choppy, at best. The author has somehow managed to take a very interesting time in world history and some very interesting people and turn them into a very boring story.To make matters worse, technical terms and jargon are used with little or no explanation. I get the distinct feeling that the author herself doesn't fully understand what they mean.

Some of the most important inventions of our world (radar, encryption, computers, ...) were created or spurred on in this era. Yet somehow this book manages to make what should be an exciting and fast-moving story slow and turgid. It suffers from a fault more usually found in autobiography than history/biography, namely bogging down in extended dull backstory of the principal actors before getting to the relevant subject matter.

But what White has done is just plain horrible. 256 pages of horrible actually. Though White's essay/book is informational and effective, it is extensive and overfilled with pointless history.Breaking down Lincoln's speech, White provides powerful information about the rhetorical devices Lincoln uses to unify the nation. However, this \`powerful' information is often drowned out by the incessant historical lessons. In reality, this story is more of a biography than an analysis on Lincoln' Second Inaugural address. Although this may excite some people, for most, myself included, this is more of a turn off.So if you want to read some history, go ahead, pick up this book. But if your looking for information on Lincoln's Second Inaugural, I strongly suggest that you go on the internet to get your information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Time or Effort","review":"Found this book to be onerously biased and self serving. Ronald Whites depiction of Lincoln lacks any credibility, considering the fact that Lincoln the man was such a complicated human being, politician, and president. Not worth the time or effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent interpretation of a great speech","review":"The words of the second inaugural address are very moving and have great relevance for today. Ronald White examines the cultural, historical, and Biblical context for this speech. He explains how Lincoln underwent a dramatic change in what he perceived to be the causes of the Civil War. Going far beyond the usual states rights versus preservation of the Union discussion, White traces Lincoln's change of thought in clear and well-researched terms. The journey from preservation of the Union to judgment/grace theology is a fascinating one that is not often discussed in history classes today. In addition to the great research primary presented in the book, White's writing style is engaging enough to catch the interest of those who normally wouldn't pick up a history book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The depth of meaning in the deceptively simple words of Lincoln's second inaugural address is probably missed by most modern readers. It was missed by many of those who listened to him at the inauguration and by many critics of the day. Professor White goes through the speech paragraph by paragraph and line by line and exposes the beauty of Lincoln's carefully constructed prose. His listeners expected to hear words or personal vindication and wanted to hear how southern rebels would be punished. Instead they heard words of reconciliation. How different our country might have been had this great man had lived!Humble servant leaders like Lincoln don't exist in our government any more...and our country is poorer because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A broad look at a narrow subject","review":"I can't really recall where or when I bought \\"Lincoln's Greatest Speech.\\" I know it sat on my shelf for quite some time before I got around to reading it. I think this book has value on a number of levels and could be profitable to people for varied reasons. It has obvious value to the person interested in the Civil War and/or Abraham Lincoln, but anyone who writes or gives speeches will learn from this study of how Lincoln crafted this speech. Because the author sets the speech into a theological context, it is helpful reading just in terms of thinking through issues of church and state, God's relationship to the nations, divine judgment and just or unjust war...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Great!","review":"I was a student studying french and picked up this album without knowinganything about Julien Clerc.

Also the stroller is quite easy to assemble and collapse. However, now that my baby is starting to outgrow his carseat, and I have to use the stroller seat itself, I am very dissapointed with it. The seat is big, bulky and cumbersome, and we cannot fit it into the trunk of our car (Honda Civic). We also got very little use out of the basinette (he outgrew it by 10 weeks), and the sunshade/canopy might as well not be there it's so small. The basket is equally as useless, and can barely carry anything - this is VERY frustrating. I wish we had bought the Valco Lattitude stroller. It has all the same features (except the wheels) with a much bigger basket and canopy, is lightweight, compact, and about half the price of the RSB."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bassinet is great","review":"I should preface this by saying we have only used the bassinet part of this stroller. We have the black stroller and it looks great and feels like quality. We have never event taken it outside. We use it inside so that when baby is sleeping during the day we can move him from room to room and this has made our lives much easier. I don't think I would like this stroller as an everyday stroller because it is wide and takes up a lot of room in the car and doesn't fold up compactly. It has no cup holders which I would like (but the handlebars do fold down which is nice when you are using it as a bassinet). The basket underneath is pretty small and doesn't hold very much junk and that could be a problem since we all know how much stuff babies and toddlers require. This stroller manuevers great and would probably be a great stroller for outdoor jogging and what not. So depending on what your needs are this stroller is very good.

The actors work so well together and they really bring Shakespeare alive. I was one who thought Shakespeare was boring and didn't know how anyone could put up with it, but I saw the movie \\"Twelfth Night\\" and all that changed. I recomend that if you enjoyed \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" that you sould see \\"Twelfth Night\\". They are both excelent movies.

Emma Thompson is always a joy to watch, and the chemistry between her and then husband, Kenneth Branagh is amazing. Denzel Washington is just about perfectly cast as Don Pedro. I'm not overly impressed with Michael Keaton, as all I see is Beetlejuice all over again (and that movie was dumb the first time around). And now to address the disturbing trend of \\"let's beat the crap out of Keanu Reeves\\", I happen to think that although he may not be an Oscar winning actor, he was very beleivable in this role of the evil Don John. There are few who can convey such evil and bitterness with just a look, and Keanu Reeves did just that. I have always been a fan of Shakespeare's comedies, and this version has just reinforced my enjoyment of them.

For your own good - YOU MUST BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good attempt at one of Shakespeare's B-list plays","review":"Nobody could say the storyline in Much Ado About Nothing is particularly clever. In fact, despite some very witty lyricism you would have to say this is one of Shakespeare's weakest plays. Having said that, this interpretation by Kenneth Branagh makes the most of the material. The comic characters are completely over-the-top (including Michael Keaton of Batman fame, and Ben Elton, creator of the Young Ones) and the more serious ones are given a slightly modern interpretation. The main plot which deals with the importance of virginity in a new bride, has a gently mocking modern treatment. The whole play is, as its name suggests, a storm in a teacup and Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thomson make the most of the sarcastic interplay available to them. Even the charming Denzel Washington manages not to stumble over his lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, quirky, and true to the spirit of the Shakespearen romantic comedy","review":"I consider this to be one of my favorite movies. It's a true chamer that proves that a good play of Shakespeare can be set at any time. The charming game of cat-and-mouse with lovers is only part of the wonder when it comes to the talented set of actors, each one perfect for their role. However, the best performances are demonstrated by Branagh and Emma Thomspon, whom we all know can do just about anything. The setting of the little villa is charming, and the classical score suits the story well. Even if you think Shakespeare is boring, you will adore this fun romp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven on Film","review":"Whether you are a Shakespeare buff or have never read a single one of his plays, you will adore this gorgeous movie and entertaining interpretation of \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\".

Well, maybe Robert Sean Leonard (as loveable, rash Claudio) and Keanu Reaves (as Don John, the Prince's bastard brother) were slightly miscast, but Emma Thompson, Denzel Washington and Kenneth Branagh more than make up for it in their charming performances.

This is an excellent version of Much Ado, and the interplay between Branagh and Emma Thompson shows two actors at the top of their craft. The photography is stunning as are the sets. Two jarring notes, when I purchased and viewed the video last week -- the treatment of women as a piece of \\"goods\\" not worth having if non-virgin (well that's just the attitude of the time in which it was written, but really, preferring your daughter to be dead?), and Keanu Reeves, who is seriously miscast as Don John (OK, he's fine in The Matrix, but Shakespeare is way over his head). Fortunately, it's a small role.Let's hope Branagh continues to provide us with new interpretations of Shakespeare -- I wonder what he would do with Macbeth, Richard II or III.

Artek The Knife is the thief's name and being boring is his game. Artek is half-orc on his father's side and this is the only interesting thing about him. The other characters fall short in most respects, except for Muragh the talking skull and Guss the Gargoyle. Muragh provides comic relief in the story and Guss shows great bravery.

Animals can't dot that! This would be an OK book for say, a second grader BUT it is not fit for say a fourth grader. This book is not realistic enough.I am a 12 year old writting this review. I read this book. SUCH a dissapointment. I rarely read any good horse books. If you want a good book written from an animal point of view get \\"A Dog's Purpose\\" (no talking animals, no animals understanding human talk, all object described from a dog point of veiw, it's my favorite book I promise you that a dog's purpose is good)This Book is so STUPID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I had thought I downloaded this onto my iPad, but it never showed up anyway.

It is so much more than a story about horses. Michael Morpurgo writes in detail about the many different owners and handlers this horse had and he does it cleverly through the eyes of Joey, the horse. I read the book and saw the movie as well. My favorite part was when Joey fled in terror from the sounds of war and became entangled in barbed wire that separated the Germans from the English and French. The horrors of war were suddenly brought to a complete halt by both sides while volunteers from both sides of the barbed wire came out with wire cutters and cut the trapped horse free.

What a thrill to find this book still available after over 40 years! I read it repeatedly when I was in about 4th grade.

It really showed me at a young age the suffering that some animals must endure, and the quiet patience and courage with which they endure it. I can still picture Joey struggling in thick mud to pull his load. And even as young as I was, it made me understand more what my older uncles had experienced in WW1.

Though they cost more than other strings, I change them less often. Also, they sound good at the outset and they don't change very much over their life on the guitar. Most other strings (O,K, all others that I have used) have a distinct change of character in the first days to weeks of playing: usually from very bright to very dull in a relatively short time. Elixir Nanowebs give you a consistency of tone that lasts for months. They don't break easily. They are quieter while changing positions.The coating will, after quite a while, start to fray. Not a big deal, as that indicates it is probably time for a change anyway, and it takes a very long time for it to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"High E string flat as a chess board","review":"I switched over from DR to Elixir and was I disappointed!

Yes, it does fit the smaller juice boxes but it slides around and is short inside making it hard to drink from the straws because as anyone with kids know, those straws are never straight up in the air. So you are constantly pulling the straw up but you have put your fingers down inside the container of this holder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Good drink box holders seem to be hard to find. The whole point of a juice box holder is to prevent squeezing (in my opinion). Although this item is a good size, it is also pliable, allowing a child to squeeze the sides of the box, causing liquid to shoot out of the straw hole (if held anywhere other than the handles. Other boxes are more rigid, but not large enough to fit all box sizes. I do not recommend \\"Dwink\\".

Knowing this is a learning process for her, I was a bit tense about the missed spoonfuls that would land on her chest,lap and floor. A few days ago, I gave her a bowl of blueberry yogurt and a spoon, armored her with the Crumb Chum, grit my teeth and let her go to town. It worked great - the food that didn't end up in her little mouth (and there was a LOT of it :-) was plopped on the Crumb Chum, not on her chest, lap or the floor. I have to add that she used to yank her previous bibs off every time, but the Crumb Chum is so light, she barely knows she has it on. Now I'm completely relaxed about mealtimes with her, and I think she is, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"really helps","review":"this is a great idea and it really does help keep the food from going all over them. The only thing I have to do since my son is new to the world of eating soft food is to put a regular bib under the crumb chum because it's not really water resistant so his clothes get wet right under his mouth where the food drools onto the crumb chum. other than that, I think this is a great bib and it saves me from having to change his clothes as often."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"this bib is not long. i was disappointed to find out that it only reaches my daughters torso."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"This is a great bib but it has just one problem: the water-proof backing starts to peel off after it has been washed several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best bib we own!","review":"My son wears 12-18 months clothes so I wasn't sure if this bib would fit him.

She made a life for herself and her daughter without relying on anyone else. Chad was a caring man and while relentless in his pursuit of Leigh was not arrogant about it. The only problem I had was Chad not telling Leigh so much about his life until she found out. She knew his name but nothing about his job, home, family background, financial status or his past. He did it because he was afraid he would lose her if he told her too soon. While he may have felt he had good reason for his actions he still deceived her and she accepted it a little too readily.

As in Drum Hat Buddha we get a fun mix of folk/country/whatever with great lyrcs, two beautiful voices, and nice instrumental harmony, and it only reinforces how much we all lost when we lost Dave Carter.

The whole CD is this annoying repetitious sound (similar to Mexican Tuba music)and one number seem to flow into the next w/o much variation.

I am writing a script that requires a small amout of simple magic.

It is filled with mediocre 'funny' patters that the readers are encouraged to use, but the quality of the actual magic effects demonstrated is poor. Balancing two forks on the edge of a glass should not be considered magic. Once you read a few samples, the reading becomes stifling, knowing that you are not going to learn anything new that other magic books cannot teach you.

If you know a few tricks and want to take the next step in becoming a \\"Magician,\\" than this book is not without merits. The cartoons are great, the \\"cheat sheet\\" should be committed to memory, and the history of magic makes it a must read.

Somehow, the Doobies were able to pull it off, with great success. I'm sure it was difficult for a lot of fans to swallow the sweet soulful sounds of Michael McDonald when they were expecting the chunky rhythms of Tom Johnston's guitar. No doubt the Doobies lost fans from the Johnston camp but gained listeners who appreciated the new sound.One Step Closer continued a string of albums tailor made for top 40/smooth jazz type stations. Overall, the songs are catchy, and you get the feeling that all the members left their mark on the album. Real Love and One Step Closer are the clear standouts, but Keep This Train A-Rollin'and Just In Time are excellent tracks as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for Michael McDonald!!!","review":"I have read all 13 reviews of this album and believe you me, if it was not for Michael McDonald and his singing and musical talents, this album would be down the drane!!!Every track on this album is perfect.

Experiencing stress-related health problems years after the war, on his doctor's orders this man told his story to his son, the author of this book. Mr. Valentine experienced years of horrifying privations as a prisoner, but when the camp was at last liberated he found that the U.S. Army would not acknowledge his captivity. As a part of an expeditionary force Gen. MacArthur dispatched early in the war without government authorization, his record was permanently falsified to cover-up MacArthur's actions. Mr. Valentine's story goes beyond this, though, and is a dramatic and inspirational account of human tenacity and generosity under the cruelest of conditions"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute FICTION","review":"As an historian who had devoted some 15,000 hours researching and documention the Pacific POWs, I can say, unequivacably, the the story is PURE fiction.Valentine conflates numerous actual events to this make believe story about a POW.

I've also read the Aussies comments on this book and I agree with them. Had this camp really existed, upon release, those Australian POWs would really be raising hell to their government re their treatment by the Japanese. Also, do you really believe that the author's father, Doug Valentine Sr., wouldn't be raising all kinds of hell with the U.S. Government re his back pay, his treatment by the Japanese, etc.?

Realistic, hopeful, and wise, Carmody's writing addresses issues as practical as the need for help from friends and as profound as the need to address the deeper mysteries of life, death and meaning. All is written in a very accessible way, and organized so that particular themes and topics can be easily identified when you want to go back to revisit them. Down to earth, yet never forgetting the horizon of mystery that surrounds human life.

Keep this in your favorite reading spot because it is slow reading; you read a little and think a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"This is a very good book if you are having bad times.

All the characters are complaining, arguing, and whining in the Berryfest Princess.The little ladybugs are incredibly annoying and constantly arguing with each other. Strawberry is consistently flustered and overwhelmed, every one acts self-centered and at one point they are all crying. Oh yes, and Strawberry Shortcake calls herself the \\"leader\\" to her friends throughout the movie.The Glimmerberry Ball Festival and Sky's the Limit are so much better than this one. Those are cuter and the characters are all just friends, rather than the hierarchy this movie presents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Glammed Up For Little Girls","review":"I was a fan of Strawberry Shortcake as a girl and was excited when they first brought her back a few years ago. It is nice NOT to have evil villains that are super scary! This new, new Strawberry Shortcake was disappointing and disturbing. The girls act and look more like teenagers instead of little girls.

She couldn't recognize Blueberry Muffin and insisted that wasn't her. Also, Pupcake has green polka in this animation, while its blue polka in the original. And they weren't many songs in this animated cartoon. I thought the songs were the main attraction for this cartoon.

Its oh so girly and colorful. I grew up with the original Strawberry Shortcake and this definately isn't quite like that, but the only thing that matters is that my daughter loves the new Strawberry. This is a very visually appealing movie and the animation is superb. There are a few lessons to be learned throughout the movie, but not much of an ongoing plot. I had no idea that this was actually 4 episodes put together and really it didn't matter because it seemed to mesh well and as long as I can put it on and my daughter is interested, its doing its job. My own opinion is that although I think it can get a little annoying after the 5th time of watching it, the movie is very cute and girly, just what my daughter wants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Movie","review":"This movie is so cute.

It's a kind of documentary, but you wouldn't think it. John Tutturo is clearly passionate about the culture that produced this rich and varied smorgasbord of song and music, and it infuses the whole production. The diversity of representations, visual as well as musical, is inspiring. We first saw this in a film festival, and were able enrich our grasp of the content because the song lyrics were subtitled in English. Not so with this DVD. If you don't speak Italian, the subtitles (which translate the Neapolitan dialect into standard Italian) won't help much. I admit I'm annoyed that this isn't made clear in the dvd info.

The story is long and boring and never seems to reach a climax. They move rocks, then move them some more, then there is a bit of a story about the brothers, their lovers, and their gods, then the rocks go a little farther. It seemed Cornwell was trying to address too many avenues in the story without focusing well on any one point. I still haven't been able to finish it unlike the Warlord Chronicles that I couldn't stop reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Cornwell style","review":"Not my favorite Cornwell book but still interesting. I think you'd like it if your a fan of his stuff. He brings to life an entire different acient culture that has a feel to it unlike any other. Cool to get a different concept of what Stonehenge could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Pre-History","review":"One of the sites I plan to visit on an upcoming trip to England is Stonehenge. When I went looking for information on Amazon, I came across this novel. I found the story line compelling enough to keep me caring about the characters and turning the pages. I particularly liked the author's educated guesses about how, when, and why this stone circle was built. I think it will make my visit to Stonehenge more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiring, boring....","review":".... uninteresting, repetitive. This book has been a huge disappointment. The themes of the story were repeated again and again, the characters were superficial, flat and simplistic, and the only really interesting part of the book was the depiction of the techniques used to move the stones & build Stonehenge and the afterword, where the author spoke a little about the era and his research. But then, if I wanted a construction manual, I would have bought one. I wanted also a story, and there was none. Don't buy this book, if you absolutely want to read it borrow it from a library. And can someone who has read Cornwell's Arthurian trilogy inform me if it is similar to Stonehenge before I go ahead and buy it despite my misgivings?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Cornwell falls a little short","review":"I absolutely love Mr. Cornwell's novels. Thomas of Hookton was an excellent character and I have found his adaptation of the King Arthur series incredible. However, I feel that Stonehenge is not as good as it could be. I had to literally trudge through the book. I expected something big or suprising to happen throughout the novel. The characters fell flat and the story was terrible. If you are a Cornwell fan, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stonehenge","review":"Three brothers--a conqueror, a mad shaman and a regular guy turned builder--work both together and against each other to create the temple that we now call Stonehenge.Although I normally enjoy Cornwell's books, this one did not work for me. The primary reason was the shallow characterization. I never cared about the characters' fates or felt a sense of tension or excitement. They lack depth and none engaged my sympathies.The society Cornwell portrays seems somehow limp and tired to me, with little to make a reader sit up and take notice. There are some interesting bits, but overall I just couldn't find it engaging.A strength, and a place where Cornwell's research did show, was the depiction of the building of the temple itself; the backbreaking work as well as the artistry. The illustrations are invaluable. Having seen Stonehenge, I know it's astonishingly beautiful, and that does come through here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike the Builders of Stonehenge, this Misses the Mark","review":"I have never read anything by Bernard Cornwell, and eagerly picked this up hoping for another _Pillars of the Earth_ or _Sarum_. Unfortunately, this book echoes those only in the broadest sense. Like those books, this features human drama set against great erections in England. Unlike those books, this one did not seem well-researched or relevant. Cornwell, by setting this book in prehistory, has the luxury of creating his own mythology. This leaves him free to do as little research as possible while still writing what seems to hope to be a weighty tome. The one feature that is unchanging--the topography--is only referenced in the endnote acknowledgements. I do not profess to know anything about Stonehenge, and thus felt disappointed by being unable to place the oft-mentioned landmarks in any type of context. The story of the brothers is interesting at points and tiresome at others. All in all, I left this book disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very entertaining hypothesis","review":"I think I read this book in one sitting. This book is delightfully entertaining and very detailed. It is obvious that Cornwell did his homework and researched this topic rather extensively before writing anything. It is true that he has taken some liberties in adding his own opinions, but so do most historians. The plot is captivating and Cornwell's use of words and description make the story come alive in a way that most other stories do not. There were certain points in the story where I actually could feel the pain of the characters - it was scary... not many stories have that effect on me. I highly reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys an intellectually stimulating and exciting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Bernard Cornwell, but this was a slog","review":"I have read many of the Sharpe novels, but this is nothing like it. I had to persist to get through this, rather than being swept away and enjoying the ride. It just didn't capture me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Surprising Disappointment","review":"I am quite familiar with Mr. Cornwell's work. From the Sharpes series to Saxon stories, I usually find his work intriguing and his characters brilliant and beautifully flawed. This is the exception.I'm not saying that every protagonist in a work of historical fiction should be a warrior or a hero, but they should have at least some redeemable quality other than being obedient. Saban, the protagonist, is about as complex as a Labrador who wags his tail when his family comes home from holiday.If you enjoy reading about cuckolded, cowardly, and weak men, then this is the book for you. I really had high hopes for this book, but after the first hundred or so pages, it ended up being Bob Villa's neolithic guide to stone masonry. Unsatisfying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stonehenge","review":"I started this book with great anticipation as I like novels about the pre-historic era-and I like Mr. Cornwell's writing. However, I was extremely disappointed.It seemed very contrived to me, very long, very boring. I did finish it-I kept thinking it would get better.

He is constantly 'wounded' by those around him, starting with his own half-brother and ending with his wife. Saban must be goaded into responding to anything, and is constantly victimized by the wicked and cruel. Sometimes the actions and violence in this book seemed needless and lacked any significant purpose.I enjoyed this novel for a brutal taste of bronze age Europe. But I would've enjoyed it more if I'd liked Saban, his wife and their kids a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary ancient historical fiction from Mr. Cornwall.","review":"Did I really say that? I did, didn't I!I can hardly believe that Cornwall came out with this fanciful tale of the origins of Stonehenge. He really would have been better to have left this a mystery. I believe I only fought my way through the book because it is by Cornwall and I knew it must soon get better. Sadly it didn't.The plot is dreary, the narrative childish and simplistic, the setting is fanciful with a whole era in history (apparently), with it's own customs and religions, invented solely for this book. I consider the whole effort a sad waste of Mr. Cornwall's prodigious imagination and talent.I have read everything this chap has ever written and loved it all; I really do not know what he or, perhaps more importantly, his publishers were thinking about when they decided this project was good enough to go to print.Avoid this book unless you are looking for a cure for insomnia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive...Pointless...Couldn't Finish","review":"I hate when a book gets so boring, stagnent and full of dead ends that I have to give up.

Just read the first paragraph, re-read it and learn it by heart. You will get into the story from there. Just picture it while you read. This is a great book. Wonder what his new novel will be like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just really boring","review":"I really, really wanted to love this book. It's about the building of Stonehenge, and pagans in old England, so I thought it would be perfect for me. Unfortunately, it was one of the most boring books I ever read.There is just nothing interesting about this book. Lots of people are evil, lots of people age really fast, and nothing is described well. I don't even have that much to say about it. I just thought it was incredibly boring and a tad gross. And why are the gold bars always being described as lozanges?!!Two stars. I can't really recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can't Go Home Again","review":"This isn't a \\"bad\\" retrospective, but it's not the same as the original stuff. Maybe I wouldn't be so hard on this cd if I didn't also have some old \\"real\\" Ventures tapes with the original cuts. The Gold version of songs like Walk Don't Run and Apache are oddly \\"off\\" -- the reverb isn't right, the slides aren't right and the rhythm lines are too crisp. I'm not sure, but I think the guitars aren't tuned quite the same, either. The notes might be OK but the music isn't the same. Perfidia is pretty good but Telstar stinks -- it's too \\"digital\\". To me, part of the magic of the original was the mushy cymbals and guitar reverb, you know, early \\"surround sound\\" stuff.

Greg Koch does a fantastic job in this DVD providing detailed instruction that is easy to follow and comprehend.

They are light weight compared to standard dinnerware and a bit smaller in diameter so are well suited to apartment living. They take up very little cabinet space, are dishwasher safe and resistant to scratching. The color is a brilliant white which works well with our minimalist approach to home design. We have used these Corelle plates for over a month now and are well satisfied with them for everday use. The bowls hold one cup and are a nice design but the salad plates are a bit small for a salad although they do fine for something like serving sliced tomatoes. Even the glasses are a pleasing design! I would highly recommend these to any young people starting out and needing dinnerware for a small apartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value","review":"I read the reviews before I bought the sets so I knew that the glasses were cheap and should be thrown away when I got them. All 4 sets came in when promised and in perfect condition. I paid more for the shipping than the item and that was wierd but still the best price around that I had seen in the past 4 months. I bought 4 sets and love them. Now for the rest of the pieces of the set...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corelle dinnerware is great.","review":"Corelle dinner ware is lightweight and thin.

So I returned it and the next shipment arrived and without even opening the box and you could hear pieces of glass just rattling inside. I had opened the shipping box on the first order and I thought it was packed ok. Amazon have been great on the returns, and if I had been home when the mailman dropped it off I would have refused shipment. I'm glad for the people who got their orders shipped without damage, but I guess USPS in Ohio doesn't care about it's customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price","review":"I still have the plates and bowls in the set but the glasses have slowly broken over the years.

Oddly, only found at store, wasn't shown online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Alternative to Mugs","review":"I love this set! I have always been a fan of Corelle dishware, and nothing can beat the classic white collection. What really sold this set to me, however, was the inclusion of simple tumblers instead of coffee mugs.

The plates are a nice crisp white and wash up beautifully in the dishwasher. They don't get too hot in the microwave either. I love that this set came with glasses instead of mugs.

Much of the book accurately represents the doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Other elements are the author's opinions, his position in the Church notwithstanding. In particular, his treatment of evolution is problematic. David O. McKay, the church president when the book was published, stated that \\"the Church has officially taken no position\\" on evolution. He said Smith's book \\"is not approved by the Church\\" and that the book is composed entirely of Smith's \\"views for which he alone is responsible\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Booties are better than socks-This Rocks!","review":"This Faux Suede Roll Brim Hat & Booties Set Is great.

The plot basically revolves around game in which Furlongs character is playing. the game makes him think he is killing people. Furlong gives a decent performance, one of his finest. Langella gives yet another outstanding one, stealing every scene he is in. The character of the trickster, a mix of Axel Rose and Freddy Kruger, is about the gayest thing in a movie i've ever seen.

Then Major Glover Johns recounts his personal participation in one of the toughest fights our GIs faced; the struggle through the hedgerows from the D-Day beaches to St. Lo. More importantly, Johns' book demonstrates the critical importance battlefield communications played in achieving victory. As a Battalion Commander in the 29th Infantry Division, Johns' ability to manage his units was directly related to how fast phone lines could be restrung after each mortar attack or how successful his radio operators were in linking to artillery support units. Despite his relative remoteness from the foxholes, you feel every attack and suffer every loss as if you were shoulder to shoulder with the heroes who defeated Hitler's vaunted 2nd Parachute Division.This isn't rehashed third-hand research, this is war as it was fought by one of our best combat commanders. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I am a big David Weber fan and was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately it is a severe disappointment. It is an expanded version of a short story. It should have stayed a short story. It is a disjointed puffed up overly long and frequently repetitious mess. I get the impression that Weber was going through the motions to meet a contract deadline. The author is capable of much better work which is why it is such a let down.If you are a David Weber fan save your money for his next book it has to be an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"A futile effort","review":"While having never read the short story the book is based on, this book alone does not stand as a worthy addition to the rest of the authors works. Weber has written some fantastic stories, and mainly its been the characters of his books which have imprseed me. In this, the characterization of mideval persons miss the mark. Everything seems overly contrived to fit the plot, and the characters themselves are fairly flat. Its an interesting plot that has been re-worked by many authors (best accomplished in Ranks of Bronze by David Drake - in my opinion) but this seems to have been stretched from a short story with filler material to create this book. It's certainly not Weber's best effort, and in fact fact its his only one which i have not liked so far. It lacks the characteristic clash of personalities that seems to permeate a lot of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun story","review":"While others may knock this book for not being the next great epic, this is a great book if you like to escape to other realms and 'alternatives'. You may just like to wait for the soft back edition.As for how to position the book, I would say that it could be viewed as a prelude to a much larger 'ASIMOV' space story - if only."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if you find it used, and have time to waste","review":"Yet another one of David Weber's very predictable, quickie books to make a buck. As so many others have pointed out, the entire concept has been done much better: Anderson's \\"High Crusade,\\" Pournelle's \\"Janissaries\\" and Barbet's \\"Napoleons of Eridanu.The real weakness of the book is Weber's predictability and falling back on tried-and-true themes worked out in the Honor Harrington series. Telepathic aliens that hold the solution, evil but stupid villains oh so easily outsmarted by our endlessly virtuous hero, and the \\"contralto\\" voice which is obligatory for all Weber heroines.However, it is a ripping-enough yarn for a not too discriminating reader who, like myself, bought it used. IF you have already read Anderson, Barbet or Pournelle, try Weber. Otherwise, get one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Oldie but Goodie","review":"In many ways a traditional Good vs Evil plot, it is extremly well written, believable characters, and an unexpected ending worthy of true \\"Englishmen\\"...

Such is the case with the Excalibur Alternative. Although David Weber has written many notable volumes, this is a piece of schlock that is best avoided. Weber describes in his forward how this book began life as a short story, and it would have been better if it had stayed one. The middle 60% of the novel is nothing but filler, where the main character endlessly lectures on things to convey little additional information. Unless you need something to read on an airline flight and then throw away, look for one of Weber's other works instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"Ford is a lovely writer.

Overall, a bit second rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not nearly as fun and intersting as Genesis Co","review":"I thought this book was a big let down after reading his first book. It started out with an interesting premise, but degenerated quickly into a cliche. I don't read many books where I cringe after reading a passage (which is often the case with suspense movies). Often times I wondered why entire chapters were included at all. Perhaps to extend this already short book. Although I was disappointed, the book was entertaining enough to warrant reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasty ending","review":"Sure the book was interesting and even exciting at first, but when the plot starts to unfold, it seems that the author lost interest in writing and decided to end the book quickly.

My primary gripe with it is that I knew the whole story about a third of the way in, and so all the suspense was gone at that point. A really great book immerses you in the storyline, but this one made me feel like an outsider looking in the entire time. I spent the rest of the book waiting for the characters to catch on to what I already knew, hoping for some clever plot twist or two that would make it interesting again, but not getting it. And must every bio-villian be a crazed psycho bent on thinning the world's population?This was a total snooze-fest. Even though it seemed like a movie treatment at times, I preferred the Cobra Event in every way; its characters were better developed and more believable in their actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak writing makes for dull reading","review":"This books tries to hard to scare, doesn't try hard enough to involve.

So wanting in character development and exposition, it reads like a B-thriller's screenplay. Despite its short length, red herrings abound.If you are a fan of the genre, you might find this novel passable; others beware. At least you should be able to knock it off in just a couple of days and move on to something else a little more satisifying.A disappointing effort from the author of \\"The Genesis Code\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak plot, weak characters, weak writing","review":"The characters in this book are one-dimensional and laughable. The events which bring them together are contrived and improbable. The writing jumps from event to event, with little or no glue to tie things together.

Even _The Genesis Code_ was better, which is difficult to say since it, too, suffered from a lot of the same shortcomings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickedly Cool Cover","review":"I bought this one on cover originality alone. Nah, seriously I've had this on the bookshelf for a couple years, and that damn cover kept glaring at me to read it. Good thriller, although I wish the bad guy had more background and story time.

The facts that Chase uses are intruiging, but I think that the Fed's would be all over a cult after learning what this reporter had uncovered. Biological weapons are certainly a threat, and I would hope the Government would be quicker to respond to such a threat than what was portrayed in this book.As for accuracy, just what kind of paint did they use in such a hostile environment as the arctic? And PCR, is not correctly defined in the book either. I know it's a little picky to find such flaws, but if the author is going to try to wow us with his scientific knowledge, he ought to get his facts straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth reading!","review":"A good book with a great villain.

Very entertaining and captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"STRANGELY CLUELESS CHARACTERS","review":"Is it only me, or has anyone wondered how Frank and Annie seemed to be so unconcerned, hell, CLUELESS, about the danger they were in?Despite an escalating avalanche of evidence on just how dangerous those whackos from the Temple of Light were... they, weirdly, went around as if nothing and nobody was going to hurt them.Add that to the fact that they continually do stupid and moronic things, the characters of Frank and Annie begin to border on the preposterous.The evidence before them should have made them paranoid about their safety. They weren't.That borders on the preposterous.Hence my conclusion.Frank and Annie are CLUELESS.They amount to characters who are so centered on their selves and their petty concerns, that they don't deserve the honorific of having saved the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"A great premise that turned into a boring story. Everything seemed to just move along too conveniently and many things were just too far fetched. The dialog was lame and many times pointless, the characters were mostly window dressings and the story left out any feelings of suspense. To top it off, the ending leaves you staring at the back cover wondering why you wasted your time. Leave The First Horseman on the store shelf and pick up the Genesis Code instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon John, you can do better than this!","review":"After reading Case's first novel, The Genesis Code, I eagerly anticipated his next offering, The First Horseman. Unfortunately, I trusted Case would once again weave together a thought provoking plot with dynamic characters in his next novel. Although Case falters in his pure storytelling ability, in The Genesis Code, Case compensated with an excellent plot and spectacular action.Nothing could compensate for the attrocious plot development and static characters of The First Horseman. The conclusion was predictable half way through the story. Dramatic irony does not explain Frank Daly's foolhardy behavior. He was more irritating than Jar-Jar Binks in Star Wars, and Daly was the main character! Case really disappointed me with this novel, I truly hope he has an excuse. Maybe next time he should create the plot and have someone else do the writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is \\"John\\" Case?","review":"In response to several other reviewers' interest in the _real_ John Case, my feeling while reading this book was that the author most likely lacks the Y chromosome that is common to most Johns. The gender-discrete \\"author profile\\" at the end of the book made this even more likely."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"This has got to go down as one of my favourite books. I was gripped by the story line right from the start and finished it in record time. I can't wait to read his other books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Thriller","review":"Though not nearly as good as Case's The Genesis Code, the book is still engaging and has a lot of interesting scientific information that is simple enough for the layman to understand yet detailed enough to grab the attention of a scientist. It's somewhat slow moving at times, and becomes kind of obvious towards the end, but Case manages to maintain our interest with his very good story telling, allowing the bits and pieces into place as the story progresses. And it has neat ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am a lover of thrillers, but The First Horseman had no thrills. The first third of the book was somewhat enjoyable, and after that it became one of the most dull books I have ever read. If you are trapped on the airplane with this book, be sure to watch the movie, even if Stepmom is showing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"The second novel by Case is less interesting than \\"The Genesis Code\\" - his first thriller. The idea is good but its implementation in the book could be more interesting. It seems to me the author hadn't have enough time to finilize the work - make it smoother in some places, cut off some pieces to reduce the volume or put in additional action in order to increase the percentage of adrenalin. Nevertheless, Case made a good job, and I liked it, and now I am waiting for his next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tedious \\"thriller\\"","review":"This is one of the most tediously-written books I've ever encountered, particularly since it's supposed to be a \\"thriller.\\" Good editing would have helped a little, but the story was probably flawed from inception. I couldn't last past page 291."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major dud","review":"This book started out well and good and certainly kept me turning the pages. However, it soon became very predictable and boring. I agree with the other reviewer who said there were too many convenient situations and outcomes. I didn't really care about the characters and it was painfully obvious the two lead characters would become romantically involved (no surprise there). This was a HUGE waste of time. There were also too many elements that went unanswered. For example, we never found out WHY Susannah stayed even after the boxing match. What kind of woman/mother would have stayed with a lunatic like that? There was absolutely no insight into her behavior -- now that would have helped to have made the story more believable and yes, even more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"intesting premise but...","review":"I read the Gensis Code and while I had an easy time figuring it out, I belived it. This book however I did not belive. It seems like the major reason Case picks the disease he picks in this book is because no one else has used it. He even states at one point that it would be eaiser for the villians in this book to use a virus like Ebola, so why don't they.I gave the book two stars because I think he makes intersting use of apocolypitic legend. Also some of his charcters aren't bad but they pale by comparision to the ones he created in The Gensis Code."},{"rating":"1","title":"fast-paced, highly forgettable","review":"This book is like a disposable razor. It works for a while, but you can casually throw it out when you're done. My main gripe is that the characters are relentlessly boneheaded. Friend gets death threats and then mysteriously disappears? OH, HE'S PROBABLY OUTTA TOWN! Why doesn't the press report this vital story? 'CAUSE THE FBI SENT ALL NEWSPAPER EDITORS A NASTY FAX! Why does the main character try to free his girlfriend from the cult compound *alone*? HEY, THE FBI SCREWED UP HOSTAGE SITUATIONS AT WACO AND RUBY RIDGE, DIDN'T THEY?! Why doesn't the main character report the whole story in the end? 'CAUSE FREE SPEECH IS OVERRIDDEN BY THIS NATIONAL EMERGENCY (according to a ficticious article of the constitution). Good book for a plane flight, maybe, but that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHO IS JOHN CASE?","review":"Whoever he may be, he ranks with Michel Creighton and Robin Cook. His mixture of fact with fiction gives his story both suspense and credibility. There really was an expedition to Norway to hunt for the virus. The 1918 flu was pandemic. My 90 year old grandmother lived through it and to her flu equals death. She would no sooner take a flu vaccine then I would an AIDS vaccine. Anyone who has worried about biological terroism should read this book. Lets just hope Saddam Hussain doesn't get hold of the copy. As for those who compain about this not being a \\"thriller\\" they must be addicted to gun battles and car chases. This is a psychological thriller based on the very real capabilities of anthrax brewing terrorists. If you want blood, gore and ridiculous story lines go back to Dean Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Genesis Code","review":"Genesis Code gripped me from the beginning and kept me. Each chapter drew me to the next. The First Horseman had an intriguing intro., but then I just couldn't get Op-Center out of my mind. Clancy makes me believe he knows what he's talking about. I come to trust him. He makes me feel that he's been in the rooms, he's seen the files, and he's seen the technology. I also got that sensation in Case's Genesis Code, but The First Horseman made me long for some character depth from the beginning, and wish that I hadn't started the book. I was very dissapointed that I couldn't get Clancy out of my mind.Oh, and what's this with the \\"F\\" word? Why so much? Use it this much, and the characters become weak.

Outside the studio and live albums, all you can find are compilations of stuff fans have heard many times before like 'Love Songs' and 'Instrumental Works.' Case in point, 'Eye in the Sky,' which uses the title of one of the APP's most popular albums and adds the very misleading \\"Extra Tracks.\\" If this was in fact just a compilation with actual \\"extra tracks\\" that I haven't heard I would buy it in a heartbeat, but all these songs are available on various APP studio albums including \\"Standing on Higher Ground\\" off the 1987 LP 'Gaudi' (five years after 'Eye in the Sky').

I felt it may have tried too hard to be \\"novel\\"ish as opposed to research-oriented or academic, and it sounded contrived sometimes in the process. I, too, thought the author was too enthralled with the slut stories and didn't delve deep enough into the possible link between the \\"slut\\" archetype and past sexual abuse. I also wanted to delve deeper into exactly what the \\"slut\\" stereotype says about our 21st century view on women's sexuality.I discussed this topic with several men, and it's clear: Women are viewed as sluts whenever they sleep with several men, or even have any sort of love/sex relationship with several men over the course of years. But when men do the same with women, no stereotype, no archetype ensues. Why is this? I was hoping this book would explore this, but it didn't. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAST GIRLS: TEENAGE TRIVES AND THE MYTH OF THE SLUT","review":"I was disappointed in this book because the author struggles to present a coherent point of view.

Bob Buck gives a detailed account of his life in aviation from the early days flying DC-2's to his retirement in the cockpit of a Boeing 747. He has a way of describing situations with immense detail, but not going off in boring rants. I literally could not put this book down. This is the first book I have read in about 3 years that is going on my \\"read again\\" list. If you are even just slightly interested in aviation, this book is a great read. Bob Buck lived through, in my opinion, the most interesting 40 years in aviation, 1930 to 1970. He started his career in the early ages of passenger transport, flying a plane that carried 14 passengers and topped out at 145mph, and finished his career flying a plane that could carry 550 passengers, and cross the Atlantic in 6 hours.

Having flown in and out of the same airports Capt. Buck writes about and being able to relate to his experiences brings upon a whole new appreciation for the aviators of yesterday. One page made me yearn for the \\"good old days\\" while the next page makes me happy that my airplane can fly above most weather and that I don't have to put a raincoat on my lap to stay dry while flying through rain.This really is a magical book, especially if the reader has any background or experience in aviation."},{"rating":"2","title":"North Star over my shoulder","review":"I always had a dream of flying my own plane and 9 years ago at age 52 I did.

His telling of history and his life is both informative and insipiring.

Here, the authors start from first principles, with the photosynthetic species and the depths which they occupy.The book also shows that at the ocean bottoms, even with no photosynthesis, there is still a rich environment for benthic species.The diagrams are well done and readily understandable.

It was enthralling and fast moving. The scenery was spectacular and I particularly liked the inner torment as experienced by Hal Martin. I have lived in areas much like those in the book and could visualize each character and scene. I would recommend this book to any reader of quality fiction. Good on ya Evy Cole!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All right, Fire, you can stop any time now...","review":"Know what this is? That's right! It's the seven hundred thirty-eigth attempt by Fire to cash in on their ownership of the early Pulp catalogue! Well whaddaya know...specifically, this set contains the It album and the Masters of the Universe compilation in their entirety. And that's all. No bonus tracks or anything. Just your average run-of-the-mill crass and pointless quickie job. Just never gets old, does it? Of course, it doesn't help that these are Pulp's two weakest CDs, either--I suppose if you're a completist like me and you don't yet have those two you could save a few bucks by buying this, but somebody needs to give the money-grubbing gits at Fire a good kicking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhino Wire Labler","review":"I like1. good sticky labels and ease of availability2.

Los temas distan de ser los mejores de cada uno . podemos acceder a diferentes ritmos ,y nuevas voces que son dificiles de encontrar : nazare pereira,sylvia torres o conocer a otros chico cesar, zeca baleiro,etc. Es muy desparejo en la calidad musical, y no permite apreciar la riqueza de los diferentes ritmos e interpretes. Las ausencias son notorias, pero es inevitable,en la amplia musica de brasil.

Most of this music is kind of ugly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brasil has far better to offer than this","review":"Brasil produces some of the finest musicians, singers, and composers in the world. They are innovators of great charm and beauty. This collection does nothing to showcase the music of Brasil.True there are a few good cuts...Silvia Torres, Rosa Passos and Clara Nunes all sound wonderful. The sweet voiced Passos is singing Jobim, so it's hard to go wrong there.For some reason I keep buying Putumayo collections hoping to hear wonderful music from around the world. The concept is excellent. Bring out representative collections of non-commercial music, whether by location or genre, introducing music lovers to sounds they have never been exposed to and are likely to fall in love with. Invariably I'm disappointed in Putumayo's selections. There is so much good music out there...how do they manage to find so little of it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk!","review":"Save your money.

It has detailed information about the Islands history and geological evolution that is still very readable. This book covers the many vacation and resorty aspects of the Island also. If you are looking for a readable text book with all the general information about Mackinac Island you could every want, this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"This is not quite straight Bach, nor is it quite straight jazz; however, it can be enjoyed as either. Pianist Jacques Loussier and his bandmates Benoit Donoyer de Segonzac (bass) and André Arpino (drums) work their way through Bach's variations, jazzing them up as they go. Some are made to swing, others to dance, some are played brightly, others with more reflection. The end result is something quite interesting--again, it is not quite jazz, not quite Bach, but it is quite colorful and enjoyable, as multicolored as the cover art on this delightful and well recorded Telarc CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serendipitous","review":"I bought this on an impulse, having never heard of Jacques Loussier, while foraging for some new ear candy. It is like hearing the Goldberg Variations for the first time, with subtleties, textures, and moods in the variations that were, for me, undiscovered. This is delightfully fun stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time for general reader, historicians only","review":"I find it very hard to understand how a work about \\"Modern\\" religious movements should be helpful - if the stopping point is 1913! This edition was published by \\"Low Price Publications\\" in Delhi, and that's what it looks/feels like. There may be some historical nuggets to harvest if read really thoroughly - but except for some historicians I doubt many people will take the toil to do so. In my opinion this book should carry a warning tag because of its publication date and I'm rather disappointed with it, but I appreciate the thorough and critical treatment of Theosophy. Generally this book flows over with information, but I'd be critical whether it is not outdated. If you can use it anyway - all the best to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Essays","review":"I enjoyed this book so much I almost gave it five stars, but several of the essays were a bit disjointed. Still, those that are good are excellent. She does a masterful job at keeping personal detail out of her essays and writing nothing that will embarrass her sons. This is laudable, but it had the unsettling effect of making me wonder why in the world she divorced. This is a minor quibble, though. I think most thoughtful people would enjoy this book. I am not divorced, but it resonated with me as a mother and as someone who loves her home."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read!","review":"Reading this book was like sitting in the parlor and having a cup of tea and girl talk with Ms. Browning.

I keep reading and hoping it will get better, but no such luck. Chapters are very short and choppy. The author just touches on the surface of her subjects. Doesn't go into very much detail.

Not only is this book short in length, each commentary is ridiculously short and often devoid of any relevant content at all...the title pretty much says it all, but if people are paying this guy for his insights, they deserve to get f'd for their own idiocy. He's right, he's nobody special, but he happened to be in the right place in the right time and he tapped a vein that's made him rich and relatively famous. Lucky, very lucky. But not brilliant or insightful by any stretch of the imagination.Don't buy this stupid mini-book. Borrow it from a friend, or your clueless coworker, and laugh at the first dozen anecdotes because they'll be funny. Then you'll realize... the book doesn't go anywhere else, but it goes on and on and on... and you'll give it back an hour later, glad you didn't buy it.Just like most of us who didn't buy into the whole snake oil scam now known as \\"Dot-Com's\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and educational","review":"This book is a virtual almanac of internet companies, their business plans, why their business plan wouldn't work, how much money they were 'given' by investors, and how quickly they spent all of it. Not too mention the number of employees they hired and then later laid off.Approx. each page of this book is a short story of an internet company. It's extremely educational and it's written in a George Carlinesque type of language, which makes it very funny and quite the page turner.I only wish there were more companies in the book. I think he covers around 180 dot com fiascos, but there were several I could think of that weren't even mentioned. Still, what an eye-opening experience it is to read the truth about the internet insanity that occurred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who published this thing?","review":"It's just a collection of stuff from a website you can get for free anyway.

It was nice to see which other companies were going under while mine (ubo.com) was in the process of being f'd. The book is written in the same cras, irreverent, obscene style as the website and that is entertaining in small batches.My complaint is that in the only case I know of for sure, ubo.com (Chapter 10, Party Like It's 1999), Kaplan's facts are very f'd up. For example, the company didn't rent Liberty Island for the launch party, it was Ellis island and the company was in business for over 18 months, not \\"less than a year.\\"You may say these are little details and they are, but if Kaplan puts this stuff in print I expect it will go down in the annals of history as fact.

The blurbs were funny to read at first, but get old and dull pretty fast, and the whole thing ends up being a fun read for no more than 10 pages.

Kaplan has a knack for nailing the fundamental stupidity of these plans. Only criticism is that sometimes he oversimplifies what's involved in building web applications, \\"hire a high school kid, tell him what you want your website to do.\\" Of course, sometimes it is that simple, but not always.But overall, it's a delight... it's much more fun reading a page or two on each of 150 bad ideas..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunter Thompsons Cabana Boy writes a book","review":"A lazy mans Journey through the elephants graveyard of Dot-bombs, guided by an annoying self promoting New Yorker.

Believe me - it is a much better sound than a screaming baby !Now that they are older, we have removed the soundmaker from teddy's tummy, and it has become a cuddly friend to share their bed.What's more, they come in blue, pink, and original beige.

While the bear itself may eventually be of use as a generic toy, the audio pacifier has not been at all effective in the anticipated pacifying efforts. The audio/motion detector is only triggered 50% of the time when our daughter screams directly at it, and oftentimes I've needed to give it several good, solid whacks to get it to play. When it does play, the audio track of womb sounds has had no impact on her crying. I acknowledge that it may work better for some children, but ours is not one of them.

The selected stories are spotty at best. Obviously the Author was more interesting in making money than chronicling one of the most famous performers in pro wrestling, especially considering the many other 'The Story Of' \\"books\\" he's done. After finishing it in 15 minutes, it reminded me of one of my son's 5th grade book reports.As someone else mentioned, there are also many errors.

Too many good things were left out. Too many lies were put in. This book was horrible and I'm afraid to read Ross' OTHER wrestling biographies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vertical Wood Slat Gate","review":"This gate was exactly what we needed as it was for an extra wide door opening.

Would not recommend this gate to anyone. Had to buy a sturdier one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Paws Wood Slat Gate","review":"All in all I am very happy with my purchase. The gate arrived pretty quick, about four days after ordering it. The gate itself was not a full 96\\" wide as advertised, but the way the hook screw extends from the wall it worked out just perfect. I have a four pound chihuahua who I needed to keep off of the carpet so this gate worked perfectly. The gate is very delicate, so if someone was purchasing this for a large dog or a baby I do not think this gate would be the right choice, unless perhaps you find a way to secure the gate to the ground as well. The product is definitely worth the price and I would order it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Paws Extra Wide Slat Pet Grate","review":"This is a really good gate because it's wide and tall enough to keep your pet(s) enclosed.

Yet we could not find a style we could agree on and we weren't wanting to spend too much. These seemed like a good compromise. I had to talk my husband into it as he was not too sure about the thin dishes. What helped is that we have elementary school age children who will be handling the new dishes and the fact that these dishes are virtually unbreakable. We ordered four boxes from Amazon.

We are very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corelle Impressions","review":"My wife and I have been looking for a set of Corelle dishes for some time. We made the mistake of buying stoneware sets in the past because I liked the heft, but later found that they do not hold up well to the daily use; after only three years they began to break.This set of dishes is much stronger and lighter, but hold up well to the daily use we give them. We bought two sets and they only take half the space of the stoneware set they replaced. They are plain, but the design on the edge makes them nice enough to use over the holidays.I gave it only a \\"4\\" because I am still adjusting to the dishes being so lightweight which in reality is a good thing.There are also other dishes available to this set so it can be exxpanded upon. We are pleased with this purchse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this set","review":"This matches the set i already have. I just needed more plates.

He is often overlooked as being a founder of fusion, but this album shows that he was one of the very first to experiment with rock/jazz music. The disc starts off with the intense, rollicking vibrafinger. Burton utilizes the rare electrovibes that were manufactured in small numbers about 35 years ago. The furious melodic and harmonic interplay between the brilliant Burton and the steadfast studio musicians is unparalelled in the field of vibraphone induced fusion. Burton goes on to cover \\"pain in my heart,\\" the song that was popularized by Otis Redding, as well as \\"I never loved a man\\" by Aretha Franklin. Burton utilizes the entire sonic and dynamic range of the vibraphone which he helped design. His four mallet technique has yet to be surpassed.

More recent accounts have brought to light some nefarious activity by Cramer and his hedge fund. Send a copy to Elliot Spitzer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What It Appears To Be","review":"Cramer does not make any confessions in this book. The book's narrative is done in a way that Cramer lets the reader know only what he wants him to know. In other words, the information is overly managed and provides few insights into Cramer as a confession would. This style makes good copy for lawyers and nerds, but is rather stale and dull for readers who are looking for more substance. I am sorry to say that this book is more about marketing and hype than a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cramer's Best Book Ever","review":"This book is the best. I laughed reading this book because not only is Cramer so funny but I can tell he is to honest and almost to reveling. There are many trading and investing books out there that sell you techniques and Strategies but this book gives you everything and teaches you the side of investing that the wanna be books don't tell you.Even though this book is a bio of Cramer's start I can promise you will get more than just that. I learned so much out of this book. I am a big fan of Cramer mostly because of his honesty. I hope he comes out with more great books. I wasn't a big fan of his last book that was based more around safe investing. I really like the the real dirt on what Street Pros really do-Thanks Cramer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest","review":"Unlike most, I wasn't a big Cramer fan before picking up this book. I'd read his columns at the [...] during the dot com craze, but now only occasionally catch his act while channel surfing. However, I'm a big fan of biographies and thought his would make an interesting read.I wasn't disappointed. I didn't know much about the man, but it was interesting and inspiring to hear about his ups and downs. Cramer takes us from his Harvard education to living out of his Ford Fairmont to running an amazing hedge fund.What was especially refreshing was the fact that Cramer owned up to many of his mistakes in dealing with people. Too often auto-biographies become platforms for excuse-making and blaming others. Not this one.You won't learn many tips to help you double your portfolio's value, but you will learn alot about one of Wall Street's most identifiable characters as well as getting an inside look at how hedge funds operate. You'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good look at history","review":"this book gives a good look at the receint history of the stock market. this book also shows you how you can prosper even in difficult times in the market. though it it is a bit hard to read. for me it is a bit slower than what I read normally also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great View on The Street","review":"This is a rich book full of great, in-depth info on the live of one of the newer market pundits to step onto the scene in the past years. Cramer brings a fresh, full view of Wall Street and what goes on with it. This book should be recommended reading for any investor professional or not, and Cramer's unique views on the market add to this fun, interesting read. Definitely should be high on the Summer reading list, as Cramer delves into the rich history of Wall Street and what it means to be a hedge fund manager surviving in today's anything-but-easy marketplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable insider's view of the Wall Street game","review":"Excellent read.

Also quite helpful for understanding what's behind some of the recent scandals and company blow-ups."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a freak!","review":"Jim Cramer...wow, what a freak job. Fortunately, I enjoy freaks...people who dont let times define them and try to define the times. This guy is hyper type A and he lets it hang out in this auto-biography. I did get the impression sometimes that he was making some passive apologies and not telling the whole story or softening his role in one controversy or another but I cant say for sure. I read the book, enjoyed it, will read his others...and yes, I even learned a few things about investing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great audio book.","review":"I listened to the audio version of this book, which is read by the author. This is one of the most enternaining books I have ever read/heard (I have listened to well over 100 audio books). The key is that you are gaining so much insight into how Wall Street really works while at the same time being wonderfully entertained by the author as he describes his own roller-coaster career. Add to this that he has his own \\"dot.com\\" story to tell and you have a great package. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovable Nut","review":"This is a page turner especially if you are driven (in whatever you do) and dabble in the market. From the insights as to the how and why some \\"little\\" guys like me can win some and lose some with the same, crazed Cramer-like feelings to having a plan and knowing when enough is enough, this guy is real and relevant. Besides being a money maker, the guy can write. Although I found his profanity distasteful, he kept it to a minimum for effect (no excuses, just the way I see it). He is the type of person I would have liked to work with but not for long. He is the type of person I would like to share time with but maybe just brief visits. Forget about his antics and read the book. I'm fairly confidant (a 90% degree of certainty) you will grow because of his writing and by correlating the knowledge he imparts with your own experiences. In the interest of full disclosure and to avoid trouble with the SEC, I have one of his books for sale on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read","review":"This book was fun to read, as much of a page turner as a good novel. It is told from one perspective, of course, so you have to trust you are getting the straight line, I for one, felt that Cramer was honest and shared his own short comings in a way that many people aren't capable of doing. It would have been interesting, perhaps, to have had his wife write a few chapters here and there, just to give us another pair of eyes.In any case, for those interested in trading, the stock market or just another great American rages to riches story, this is it. Perhaps it would make a great movie.I give this book a strong recommendation, I really enjoyed reading it and I also think I got a lot out of it in terms of understanding the market and how so many of the institutions set in place are there to fleece the public. Cramer expounds more on this subject in the short book he wrote called \\"You Got Screwed!\\" another one worth reading if you are in or considering get into the stock market."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hero with a thousand faces?","review":"Having read virtually everything Cramer has written since 1996-1997 at TheStreet.com, I was concerned that the book would just be a re-arrangement or compilation of his \\"best\\" articles. Rest assured this is not the case-- so much more is revealed and I learned a lot, yet again. Imagine that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome view into the inner-workings of Wall Street","review":"I found this book to be absolutely fascinating. In particular, the chapters covering the worldwide financial crisis of 1998 and its effects on Cramer's hedge fund are as intense as anything I have ever read. Great, great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Game Stops","review":"I purchased this book because I have a keen interest in trading, having managed money for several years now. Although this book has some good points, as a whole it is not reflective of the mind or life of a trader. It seems to be more of an autobiography and not a very attractive one.I would urge others to stick with Schwager or Neiderhoffer. Or if you are particularly bearish, try James Grant."},{"rating":"2","title":"this guy is hungry","review":"I started watching his show mad money during a period of unemployment and I realized that no company is going to give me a job for 30 years and I can not count on the gov. for social security as a retirement fund. I plan on starting my own stock portfolio this year and I plan on making more money from capital gains than earned income in ten years."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down...","review":"Cramer is a polarizing figure. When I first saw him on TV back in the late 90's or early 2000's I thought he was just a goof ball that had landed a cushy gig on a cable network that needed some attention. After years of watching him on CNBC, listening to his advice and finally reading what I presume is the first book he has written about his life, I see him in a completely different light. Love him or hate him you've got to believe that he is a decent person who truly wants to help people invest their money in a safe manner. The more I learn about him the bigger fan I become. His writing is manic, just like when he is speaking, but it comes across so much smoother because he doesn't have his tongue getting in the way or others interrupting him. An exciting read from cover to cover. Always a funny guy, but his writing had me laughing so hard at times that it shocked me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confessions?","review":"I am part of a book club which selects new books to read for discussion. We selected this book expecting a book on trading and were extremely disappointed. The book rambled on with some kind of autobiographical story, but it was not worth following. I suggest Cramer stick to trading or whatever he does these days as he is no writer. Chalk this up to a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good autobiography but bad investing book","review":"This book is more about his autobiography, and albiet amusing at times, isn't a real investing book.

The only interesting tidbit was how Cramer admits to \\"planting news\\" to get people to say certain things. I couldn't help but wonder if he practiced this with CNBC reporters, especially after having read that OTHER Cramer book. Cramer rants and raves but where's the how Wall Street really works? I learned more from Trading With the Enemy by Nicholas Maier. When is Cramer going to jail?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Waste of time\\"","review":"It seemed like this book could have been written in a matter of 50 pages.

This guy is a journalist and a marketer, not a great trader."},{"rating":"2","title":"All i can say is WOW, this book really moved me.","review":"This was the first James Cramer book I read but it wouldnt be the last. From start to finish you can tell that James is a very tallented writer. You follow his life through the strugle of James trying to make it as a publicist in a very competetive world.

Similarly, the emotional environment at Cramer Berkowitz when they almost went under in '97 is very worthwhile reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Story/Worthwhile Market Insight","review":"Jim Cramer's \\"Confessions\\" is at once a compelling personal saga that makes fascinating reading and an insightful entree to the trading methodology of an aggressive hedge fund. Mr. Cramer is a remarkable character: self effacing, yet self aggrandizing at the same time. The story of the near failure of his hedge fund, saved only by a timely trading cameo by Mr. Cramer's wife (the Trading Goddess), is riveting. Jim Cramer's considerable bluster and tenacity are pale shadows of his wife's skill, experience and strength. \\"Cold blooded\\" does not do her justice -- she must have liquid nitrogen at the core of her circulation.Read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please...","review":"This book is not to be read by any serious investor. Read some of the reviews here a few months back. Seems that most of the negative ones have been deleted. This reflects the level of honesty of Cramer and Co.In his book, Cramer claims that his hedge fund made alot of money. That may be, but in the past two years, Cramer has consistantly underperfomed the market. Some of his market calls have been so poor they are laughable. The word \\"charlatan\\" comes to mind.Wonder how long it will take Cramer and his band of lawyers to delete this review?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book....interesting take on his life and the market","review":"look, you either love your hate this guy. i happen to really enjoy watching him on cnbc and remember when he got kicked off. it was nice to hear what was going on in the background. there's some really good stories in hear about his life and he certainly is one dedicated character when it comes to what he does. if you like reading cramer's style, you should certainly enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-boasting","review":"I bought this book because I saw a recommendation somewhere together with One Up on Wall Street.

He's the touting speculators who incubate the cynical view that American Capitalism is zero sum. Cramer's the Jerry Springer of your 401K.Read no further than the Preface where Jim applauds himself for giving his father IPO shares to flip. Why should anyone think that an IPO is an opportunity for an ordinary investor to capitalize a great venture when they find out that they have to pay vigorish to play.Cramer is a speculator. He's fascinated by Brownian Movement, and wants you to heat up the pot (and get in it). Jim's neighborhood is too tough for me. I'll stick with Omaha. I'd rather bet ON America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think I will trade this book for another","review":"Cramer's writing is okay in the book, but what he has to say was not very interesting. He spends a great deal of time disecting the past and most of what he talks about is more suitable for a magazine article than a book. He talks about certain stocks and trades that happended long ago and when these trades took place they might have had some importance to Cramer's story, but that was a long time ago and the material really comes off flat and stale. On a personal note, I have to say that the publisher has done Cramer and the reader a great disservice by putting the most unflattering picture of Cramer on the cover. I mean, if you want to judge a book by its cover you might use this one to scare away readers.A picture also says a thousand words, but I have only two words to say about this book: No thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"life and times of mad money","review":"great, fscinating book on th life and times of mad money host JIM CRAMER.MUST READ FOR TV VIEWERS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great education","review":"This is a great book and an eye opener into the real world of trading.

Moving from definitions of apocalypse and rhetoric, O'Leary extracted three basic topoi: time, evil, and authority. By means of a case study of the Millerites and Hal Lindsey's writings, O'Leary gave the three topoi a home in the tactics of persuasion of Miller and Lindsey. Though the subject matter is a timely one, the book does not appear accessible to everyone. This scholarly written book includes intense philosophical and literary discussions and presumes one to be acquainted with rhetoric. However, for the scholar who can follow the flow of the argument the application seems rather trite. Yet for the layperson the application seems of utter interest but the discussion of methodology and the foundational presentation of apocalyptic reasoning seems beyond grasp."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine guide to the Central Asian republics.","review":"Until recently, few westerners have ventured into the former Soviet republics of Central Asia; but there is a lot to see here: the Registan of Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva, Alamaty, the fading Aral sea, and remote (and possibly dangerous) Tajikistan.

Although out-of-print, I'm pleased to find a soft-cover version just out. I took a look at the reviews for fun and want to add mine. I found the book a perfect introduction to Burroughs' as one of the pivotal figures of his time, and as a man, showing both his greatness and generosity, and his fallibility. I think Burroughs' himself would have enjoyed the book and its wonderful photographs and, perhaps more importantly, would have found the treatment of controversial issues (e.g. his illegitimate child) altogether fair.I'll order the paperback version and have it sent to me for a sneak read before sending it off with a card and a bow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good pics but brief bio","review":"This large-format table-top picture book provides a wealth of photographs of John Burroughs but a very light and brief biography of the man.

Its author is an in-the-field naturalist as well as a superb writer and scholar. The beautiful format of The World of John Burroughs might mislead readers to look at the pictures and ignore Edward Kanze's superb writing and painstaking research; but the book is filled with factual and verbal treasure-- including the most recent and complete research on the fascinating story behind the birth of Julian Burroughs. Most of all, this book helps to renew our awareness of the continuing relevance and liveliness of John Burroughs's contribution to American nature writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling portrayal","review":"Ed Kanze's \\"The World of John Burroughs\\" provides a compelling and fascinating portrayal of this remarkable American naturalist.

I eagerly await the next installment in the saga of Richard and Kahlan. To the reviewer complaining about sex in Goodkind's books, wake up honey. Obviously you haven't been around much if you think that what you read is porn. Goodkind doesn't write childrens stories, he writes adult stories. And guess what? Adults have sex. (except maybe you)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodkinds Crowning Masterpiece","review":"I have not even finished reading Temple of The Winds and already I think it is Goodkind's best book. This book brings new heights to character and plot development. Temple of the Winds is permeated with a anxious hopelessness that gives a sense of great urgency to everything that happens.

This trilogy is excelent, by far my favorite, and Terry Goodkind is a writer with talent that rivals that of the great Piers Anthony. Now, while all of the previous books may have had stories of such a great caliber that one could read them without reading their pedicesors, this does not fall into that catagory. This book, great as the conflicts are and the story interesting, does little more on its own for the Trilogy then to provide background for the anciously awaited fifth book. That is all I have to say, thanks for taking the time to read the views of a 14 year old. Paul"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book- little to much lovin' goin' on though","review":"It is a good book.

Goodkind does not copy others style, as was shown in this book. I felt that Drefan was a good character to put in the book because in all of his other books, Goodkind has Richard be so alone in family. It also follows the precedant of the other books, in which Richard trusted and was betrayed. I also feel that we learn more about Kahlan, who for other than being smart, independant, loyal, and loving to Richard, we know nothing about. I feel that Terry Goodkind is an excellent author and cannot wait to read more of his books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodkind was beaten as a child.","review":"What an interesting person Mr. Goodkind must be. His Sword Of Truth series continues to keep me on edge. You never know who will be killed or raped next. I can appreciate his style. He writes with authority. There is action. There is progress. Every novel is whole on its own. There are common elements in his series and Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series (another great series). Except that Goodkind's story is moving at full pace at all times. Book 2 was the best. I was so worried about the Mother Confessor that I couldn't put it down (a protective male, I am).

I think you only criticize because you are ignorant and you know that you could never come close to doing as superb a job as Mr. Goodkind has done. In short, I loved all his books, and I think that the people who criticize his book only do it because they couldn't understand the big words that he used.

To write this review and not leave a email adress (so others can respond directly) reeks of cowardice, but i guess you already know that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but below his potential.","review":"Terry Goodkind has got to be one of the most imaginative fantasy writers out right now. That is why I must rate an above average book below his potential. The first two books were probably the best two books written in any fantasy series, but the last two, while very good reads, lacked his amazing ability to wrap up the reader inside of the story. His series is the only fantasy book series I've ever found myself becoming partially attached to the characters, but I'm not seeing the incredibly deep character that made Richard so intriguing during the first two books in his last book. That is why I'm a little disappointed in the book because I think he's way better than just a good author. I think Mr. Goodkind has the intellegence and ability to write several more excellent novels, and it's probably hard to follow the first two books as good as they were. However, I do think he will in his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"X-Rated \\"Fantasy\\" trash","review":"Readers Beware: This is a sex-filled romp of a series. Mr. Goodkind's idea of a plot is the necessary space in between rape scenes and gettin' the characters good and naked. The writing is sophmoric, the characters are unbelivably shallow and the love (read sex) story between Richard and Kahlan is laughably ridiculous. To call this stuff soap-opera would be too great a compliment. To even waste the time to read one chapter is an unfortunate loss. This series belongs nowhere but the filth pile. If you want real fantasy read Jordan or Tad Williams. I can find nothing about this work that elevates it to be worthy of being printed. As a printed novel it belongs in the romance (once again read sex) section."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Richard EVER develop his talents? (Mild spoilers)","review":"An excellent fantasy story although I didn't think it was as good as the previous three. My primary objection is that Richard, Kahlan et. al are perpetually behind the eight ball. The last two books seem obsessed with telling us how powerful Richard is, but he has learned almost nothing about his abilities. The heroism through ignorance theme is starting to wear a little thin. It would be something if Richard was learning more about his abilities as time went by, but the only thing Richard seems to be able to do is \\"pull the rabbit out of the hat\\" but only when he has absolutely no other choice. Despite this it is still very fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part of the same series?","review":"Enough with the incessant need to have ridiculous reasons to keep Richard and Kahlan apart/back together. PICK 1 already. This last book really was over the top with irrational behavior, melodramatic drivel, predictable \\"twists\\" and times just stupid plot advancements. I enjoyed the first 2 books and the 3rd was ok, but cant understand how this book is even considered part of the same series. It feels like the author just woke up one morning and decided that book 4 should be wrote in one day. Very little thought for long term advancement of the story was put into this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could NOT Put This Book Down","review":"I think I stayed up until 3am reading this book, flipping through the pages as fast as I could read them, saying, \\"I know Richard and Kahlan are going to get out of this...BUT HOW!!??!!\\" It really looked hopeless and Goodkind did a great job telling this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good book.","review":"The fourth book in the Sword of truth is a good book.

I can't believe someone said that Goodkind was the best writer ever. No sane human can say that. This is the worst book in the serie so far. And all the other books weren't even that good. In fact they sucked as much as this one. What happened to Rachel? She was a rimple in a pond and than she dissapears and doesn't even show up in book 3,4 and 5. Nice rimple....Want some good fantasy?

The fact that many readers find this acceptable is scary. I put it down unfinished. I think it is sadistic pornography. I would not let my adolescent daughter or son read this book. JR.Tolkein created high fantasy without S&M and graphic rapes. We readers must have some values for our world. I won't buy another of his books, and I will write to the publisher and even Mr. Goodkind. As a rape survivor, I want fantasy to take me good places not my nightmares."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a slog!","review":"This will be the last book of this series that I read. Poor pacing, nonsensical plot developments and vile 'torture porn' scenes ruined this book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Really, really bad","review":"I read the first three books and enjoyed them; this is barely readable.A few new characters are done well (Cara), most are horrible (Nadine). And while I'm not opposed to love and romance (I've read my share of trashy romances) the never-ending sap-fest between Kahlan and Richard is tiresome. If their love is so true and great, why all the jealousy and need for constant reassurance? They carry on like a couple of whiny, insecure teenagers.I understand the need to revisit some of the previous novels but there's way too much of it and it's accomplished badly; incessant questioning and detailed explanations and history lessons while in pursuit of a deadly enemy? Seriously? That's just one example. Several plot devices were absurd and hard to buy into and I found myself thinking they (the characters) were often behaving stupidly.I had been looking forward to reading this series, but if the following books are similar to this one, this will be my last. Hugely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does no one review the audio book?","review":"Distracting and disorienting. The reader of this audio book didn't bother to learn how to pronounce the names of the major characters, which is unconscionable when you are reading the fourth book in a series. It's almost forgivable when he mispronounces agiel, because it doesn't occur once a page. Every time he says the name Colin, I wrack my brain trying to figure out what minor character I've forgotten. There is no Colin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hi. I'm Temple of the Winds and I'm a...uh....good book.","review":"When I read a book, I generally like it to be good. This is not what I like to call a good book. It was boring, and there were just a few similarities to ROBERT JORDAN here and there. There was no point to completely devoting a chapter to Drefan raping and attacking a prostitute. What was the point? It could have been written quickly, but still incorporated. Some people may argue and say that this is a good book. Those people like to lie to and decieve you. They are after your souls. The book was horrible. You really wanna fight about it? Email me. (I made my address after reading the first-and only good-book in the series)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and pointless","review":"This book is a serious decline for the series. The first half revloves entirely around boring, repetitve and dry dialouge. It very much feels as if an editor should have been more involved. While the book has a fairly intersting plot line it is scattered, drawn out and poorly executed. Kalhan and Richard seem to be looseing charecter depth as the books progress, their interaction is cliche and overdramatic,more than anything this book seems to be lacking purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wizard's last rule: Quit when you're done.","review":"The continuing soap opera of Richard and Kahlan. I just cannot relate to Kahlan's neverending angst. Much as I loved her in the first book, it wasn't her that made it a success.Goodkind has joined Jordan. I wisely did not buy this or the 3rd book. I unwisely read them. No more."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets better and better","review":"I have been reading Terry's books since I was in the 8th grade.

And keep on writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing spectacular","review":"I really love the series, but I find that his writing is very corny. The characters show absolutely no developement. I dislike the quick solutions that the heroes always seem to find. I find Terry Goodkind lacks originality in his writing. Hopefully in his later books Goodkind can display better character developement, a better plot. I hope so for his sake, because if he doesn't, the series will lose its popularity."},{"rating":"1","title":"No comparison to the first 3 novels","review":"I have to admit to the minority of those people, who said Goodkind writes great fantasy, but only in the first three novels. Temple of the Winds is a very boring thing. The lovestory of Richard and Khalan gets finally to a happy and, on the last 20 pages, but before. It's terrible, some hundred sides of \\"I love you, I never will leave you, blablabla..\\", then the great betrayel we know from the other books. And last but not least, a hideous sentence how the next book will be (the three greeting formulas, very suspicious). I think, if Mr. Goddkind thinks more about the plot like learning Richard his magic and the good intentions he have shown us in the first two parts, and a little bit lower in the third one, I hope I can buy book number 5 in order to read good fantasy again. It's very sad, because I know from the first books that you can write good stuff, so please, don't write only for making a lot of money with blowing up old, driven out pathways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"The Sword of Truth series truly belongs among the classics of Fantasy. Terry Goodkind is an intelligent and creative writer whose books I truly enjoy. Temple of the Winds picks up right where Goodkind last left off. The trials which face Richard Cypher are interesting to read about. These books are truly unique. I have nothing which I can compare them to. I highly recommend this book, and this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WAS AWESOME!!!","review":"i love terry goodkind him and robert jordan are the two best authors to ever write a series and this book doesn't deminish that title at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait for the Paperback","review":"Well, although I did read the book in one sitting, I do think that there are definite flaws in this book, and in the series as a whole. How many times do we have to see Kahlan betray Richard, but, it all turns out to have been necessary? It's getting repetitive folks! Plus, what with the Sisters of the Light, the fall of the Prelate, who is *supposed* to be dead, but instead, is off trying to twist the world to fit the prophecy, I just keep getting flashbacks of Aie Sedai in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Actually, if you look at the whole series, there seem to be *many* essential plot elements that have been *borrowed* by Mr. Goodkind from Mr. Jordan's (IMHO) FAR better written series. Check out the real thing folks - Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. Then read this series to laugh at the stolen concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop whining......","review":"This is another great book in the series.

Definitely enjoyed this one, which is why I started it at 7pm and didn't put it down until it was finished (3am!).I've read a lot of comments on how repetitive the \\"Richard and Kahlan love each other so much\\" bit is, and yeah, I have to agree it gets annoying after a while, but I guess that it's been put in for those unfortunate readers who've just arrived and don't know the depth of R&K's past...This book is very intricate, I loved the way Goodkind deals with the subject of jealousy and betrayal - something he hasn't really shown in R&K's relationship before. The only flaw I can see is the fact that the bad guy was so OBVIOUSLY the bad guy... although I'd be lying if I said I always spotted the bad guys in real life straight away!All in all, a fabulous read, and I for one cannot wait to read Soul of the Fire! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it...","review":"I was vey disappointed when I finally received the audio cassette.The story itself was entertaining however the actual recording was awful.I don't know who came up with the brilliant idea to use the single speaker story play but they obviously didn't consider the common walk man user.Most stereo headphones don't come with a balance knob!I would tell you to read the book instead and avoid the audio cassette altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say but...excellent","review":"I do not have any idea why everyone keeps bashing \\"The Temple of the Winds,\\" in my opinion the storyline is still fresh, and so what if there is some sex and violence? It is definitely not \\"pornographic\\" as it was labeled by some, I would call it \\"realistic.\\" The characterization is excellent, no two ways about it, Mr. Goodkind makes you feel as if YOU are each of the characters, from Richard and Kahlan to Zedd and Ann, I take my hat off to him...and if you can't take the violence/sex (it is by no means the worst you will find out there) then just quit reading his books and let the rest of us enjoy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick A$$","review":"I see there are many opinions about this book, so my view on this book really has no meaning. I read books and I read alot of them, alot of them are the same style as Mr. Goodkind's. When I get into a book i get into a book, it becomes my reality.When I started this book it was like no other book that I have read. It pulled me in so fast with his discriptive writing and the realistic problems and horrific events that follow through each book.

It is truly a wonderful book. I can't wait to read his next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book in an amazing series","review":"Temple of the Winds is the crown jewel in this incredible fantasy series. The action and emotions in this book far surpass the previous books in the Sword of Truth saga. There are times when I was affected so profoundly by the events in the book that I had to stop for a moment, put the book down, and catch my breath. Nothing prepared me for the way this book would make me feel. I felt I knew the characters, moreso than ever before. I felt happy when they were happy, felt sad when they were sad. It was incredible. Terry Goodkind is a master at his art. He can make things seem utterly hopeless, and then find a way to make everything work out. He is the new fantasy god, and this is his Bible. Every fan of fantasy novels must read this. It is not just a novel, it is an experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it, but.......","review":"I've just finished the book and found it to be the least enjoyable of the four Goodkind books. It has just been released in Australia in hardback, and to show how much of a fan I am, I paid $40 for it. Now I wish I had waited for the paperback. It took me a while to realise what was missing - and that was humour. It was far darked than the other books, and I too found the sexual violence a turn off. There seemed to be no joy in the characters. I missed Zedd, who hardly featured, and where was Gratch? I hope the next installlment is an improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of The Sword of Truth series","review":"This series has four books that are probably among the top ten best fantasy ever.

This book was a page turner I stayed up till 1 in the morning without putting it down. Mr. Goodkind leaves no unanwsered loose ends in his books. He writes everything with an individuality that seems so differant from lots of other modern fantasy. This book is a tale that at first glance seems simalar to the other three books (ie- Richard and Kahlan breaking up, solving a problem, and then getting back together) However, Temple of the Winds provides a new twist and some completely unexpexted ideas and actions of certain people. This book is a continuation of what will hopefully one day be a well remembered series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanderlust","review":"The series lost me with this book. It is just meandering on and on without direction. It has become a fantasy soap opera without interesting characters to sustain it.

The plot is great but the story behind it is not. Goodkind focuses his mind on too much political issues and it moves the book very slow. I wasn't nearly as enthusiastic about reading this one as I was the previous ones. Bottom line: not that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy addition to a great series","review":"Goodkind has managed to take a genre that was in danger of becoming a parody of itself and injected it with new life. Wizards first rule started in a very familiar way. To be honest my first thought was \\"here we go again\\",but the author through vivid imagery and exciting action sequences proved me wrong. Terry Goodkind's writing is fresh,imaginative and compelling. The two books that followed kept the promise of the first introducing us to great characters and intriguing plotlines.Temple of the winds continues this tradition but seemed to lose some of the pace of its predecessors.It is also the darkest of the series thus far(and that's pretty dark),that said ,I still finished it in two days. If I have any complaints it would be that at times the main character just doesn't get it! Also at times the coincidenses that take place seem to be a little contrived.

And I finally put my finger on it: Sadism. This author is very sadistic. His books are filled with scenes about the abuse of little children and endless rape and torture scenes. Drefan for example is a copy and paste of Jack the Ripper.

I know, you Goodkind sychophants and apologists out there will now read this review and give it the old unhelpful label. Ha, that should teach me not to review horrid books involving some of the worst developed and contrived characters I've had the displeasure of getting to know.Here's a tip: Go to your library and check out George R.R. Martin, or Stephen Erikkson, or Robin Hobb, or David Coe, or John Marco, or LWE, and read those author's books and then decide who writes good fantasy. Until you do, keep reading the sword of truth series and the Shannara series to complete your overrated author sweep"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick puppy","review":"I read the first 3 books in the series and found them a little derivative of LOTR and the Wheel of Time series, but he has a flair for quickly paced, exciting endings. While this book has all of the above pluses and minuses, it also introduces some of the sickest torture scenes I have ever read in science fiction. Yes, there is a love of minutely described gore in all the previous books, but this book hit a new low. I refuse to read another of his books. I do not recommend this book to women at all, because the torture is misogynist, sickly sexual and gratuitous. I don't recommend it to men on the same basis, but if you read this and enjoy it, you too are a sick puppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"a marvelous addition to the series.

I get done with each book wondering why I even bothered to finish it, but then for some reason read the next installment. Very poor character development. Richard is the only one I can stand. Anyone who didn't see that Drefan was going to be the killer was asleep at the wheel. Does anyone else have a tough time picturing this world? I can never seem to get a clear picture of anything. I do see similarities to Robert Jordan, but Jordan uses these motifs masterfully while Goodkind just throws them in whether they fit or not. I should give this book 2 stars if only for the fact that I actually made it to the fourth book in the series.

The long-winded prose was painful to listen to; I finally had to give up on this book (a first), not too far from the end.In this case only, this audiobook would have been better abridged."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is by far the best book I have ever read!!","review":"I love Goodkind's SoT series. I can't put the books down. I'm only thirteen and I have to thank my friend for introducing me to this series. Temple of the Winds is the best book in his series. The plot is so exciting and suprising. He builds up the plot very well. Goodkind sure can fit characters in and use suprising ways to save the main characters. The ways Richard and Kahlan are always saved are unfathomable to me. They always seem at first to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and then, in the right place at the right time. I can't wait to read the book 5 of the SoT series, Soul of the Fire. I think Goodkind is the best fantasy writer ever. His books take me to another world where it seems that I am at peace and time doesn't matter. I could read for hours at a time and not get bored. I hope Soul of the Fire is as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry, fire your editor.","review":"Please stop rehashing the story with every book. It is not necessary. If there are those who did not read the first few they should go out and buy them. For those of us who did take the time and read them, we don't need it retold over and over. Great book anyhow. I would read it again and skip over the rehash."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD! Overly Violent, poor character development, plot dies","review":"The other books in this series had much more to offer. This one is quite poor. I wouldn't recommend buying it - certainly not in hardcover. Terry seems to focus on brutal violence often linked to sexuality. This is truly sick stuff. The other books had bits of this, but here there is little else. I regret reading this one. There is too much good out there to waste time with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"F A N T A S T I C !!!!!","review":"To all those out there that think Mr Terry Goodkind is a Robert Jordan clone, double raspberries on you, I suppose you think Mr Jordan is completely original, well let me tell you something, I could sprout off Names like Tolkien, C S Lewis and Frank Herbert, just to name a few, God knows how many other authors are out there who have written Fantasy before Jordan, with similar ideas, judge the story on its own merits, and its enjoyability factor, so please enough with the GOODKIND/JORDAN comparisons already!!! besides, at the rate that Jordan goes Terry will probably be supplying him with FRESH NEW IDEAS, (as well as how to write faster, does any one remember the storyline of that Rand something fellow???)Anyway I enjoyed the 4th book in the series the characters were excellent, and the story line kept the series continuety going, cant wait for the next installment, I hope Terry keeps on writing and ignoring useless criticism!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I read them all back to back and cant wait for soul of fire!","review":"People who read Mr.goodkinds books instantly compare them to the wheal of time by robert jordan and its obvious why we do this ,the similarities are just to close to be coinsidance,but while i was wating for mr.jordan to finally compleat another book i read these .Its like reading a fast paced exiting all the way through jordan novel. Not once did he(goodkind)devote an entire chapter to a main character sitting in a tavern with a spiced tea watching the people go buy waiting for someone special to show up. read this book and read mr.jordans latest A PATH OF DAGGERS,(witch has no begining and no ending and way to much in the middle.)youll stay awake a lot longer with RICHARD and KAHLAN than you will with RAND and EGWENE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS AWESOME!","review":"I don't know how of all of you fantasy buffs can POSSIBLY think that cool writers like Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordan play second fiddle to J.R.R. Tolkien! It's WAY IMPOSSIBLE. It is my firm opinion that any single book of the Sword of Truth Series is better than the whole of the Lord of the Rings series combined! THAT series was the most boring that I've ever read and Goodkind's books are so interesting. I really love it how there is always something new, another enemy to face, while the Lord os the Rings series takes three books to come to the point!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eww... the fifth book better improve","review":"I first was addicted to Terry good kind with his first 3 books. But this book was a total disappointment. It had no plot advancement, and suffice to say, the cover art was the only thing good in the whole book. Not that I really care, but it is strange that as soon as Robert Jordan gets into a writer's block, Terry Goodkind starts writing plotless books. Hmmmm..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old thing","review":"Well once again I told myself that the next book of Goodkind's would capture the magic of his forst book. Once again I was wrong. In yet another installment of Richard and Kahlan getting torn apart and then reunited against all odds, Goodkind thrashes what has become a rather dead horse. In achieving this glorious finale for our protagonists, Goodkind also explores some rather disturbing aspects of fantasy that should be left between him and his therapist. Either that or hs has been indulging in the game of shock-tactics. And that too I find disturbing. It seems that graphic sexual content is how Goodkind makes up for his lack of plot or characterization. Pain and pleasure seem to be the common theme involved in all of the books in this series but in this last one I feel he has gone too far. My advice? At least wait till it comes out in ppbk or go to your local library. Even with the great prices at this place it is not worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Great book, one of my favorites of the series behind Faith of the Fallen..and of course, Phantom."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of same","review":"OK, so Goodkind understands he has a franchise and is going to milk it for whatever it's worth. There is enough life in this series to keep me reading found or borrowed copies though I certainly wouldn't buy it. The characters are relatively engaging and flawed though of course oh-so-heroic. The world gets saved every single time--there's no pretense of an actual arcing story here, every single doorstop-sized volume brings the characters and their entire world to (and beyond) the brink of utter failure before (somewhat cleverly) pulling all the chestnuts out of the fire. Goodkind's weird obsessions with S&M are considerably less evident here, and in fact the odd warrior/bodyguard/dominatrices are curiously endearing in this volume. And the 850 odd pages do whiz by."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Touching Twist","review":"I started reading this series on a whim, and was quickly drawn in. Temple of the Winds unlike the prior novels, and to this point the later ones, touched an emotional core. Mr. Goodkind does a very good job at not only fleshing out the main characters but the surrounding characters as well. The plague was definitely a different twist, and well...read the book for the juicy info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent story, troublesome plot devices","review":"I was very much taken in by the first three books of this series -- I enjoyed the development of Richard and Kahlan, and the ways Goodkind used the Boundary, revealed Zedd's abilities, and so forth.In this book, the details of what Drefan does made me ill. I am concerned for Goodkind that he was even able to conceive of such crimes, never mind describe them in detail. I think he is a very troubled man.I will wait a while before I buy book five in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reggie the Chipmunk strikes again","review":"Wow! A whole world peopled with characters with the maturity and motives of college kids, and disturbed ones at that - though at least his women don't sniff all the time! I thought it couldn't get sillier until Reggie the chipmunk showed up. This man can write a good story; whose time is he wasting?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy fans: Avoid this series!","review":"Terry Goodkind is the Bret Easton Ellis of American fantasy. One gets the impression that he enjoys depicting sexual violence more than he enjoys telling a story. Read George R. R. Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones\\" instead - realistic violence and a serious theme done a thousand times better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry Goodkind's Temple of the Winds","review":"I read Temple of the Winds and cant help but feel that Terry Goodkind is really going downhill. This book wasn't exciting at all and I can't help but feel that Terry might be disturbed due to his over reliance on rape, castration and gross brutality to furthur the plot. I certainly won't be buying the next book! Poor show Terry."},{"rating":"1","title":"By the fourth book, Goodkind's writing style becomes really annoying.","review":"I'll give Terry Goodkind credit for a having a decent imagination, but he has a serious problem: He distributes dialogue like a 5 year-old with A.D.D. The characters constantly have long, repetitive, melodramatic, unnecessary conversations at the most ludicrous moments imaginable. Even though the entire world is in peril and there's precious little time to save it, the characters will simply drop what they're doing and talk and talk and TALK, even in the middle of an action sequence. All this talking makes the story seem totally unrealistic. This is a very unsatisfying read that will have you rolling your eyes over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many Twists & Turns","review":"Many of the reviewers who have said the book starts slow are right - however these pages go by quickly. There is little \\"action\\" in this book, but there is still a great deal of conflict, and a few new characters are introduced that greatly challenge the status quo for Richard and Kahlan (to say the least).As the plague picks up steam and the prophecy is revealed, the book really takes off (about halfway through) and it becomes very hard to put it down. Mr. Goodkind has done an excellent job revealing how bad the plague is and how damaging it could be to the world. Especially because the first victims are children.There is also an element of intrigue here that is lacking in previous books, when Drefan and Nadine arrive at the Palace. They add a mysterious element to this book that really adds some spice to the plot.The last 200 or so pages are incredible. The plot has several surprises. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad joke","review":"If you liked the first three in this series, don't think for a moment you will like this one. If you didn't like the first three, this one you will hate. Basically, having written three books, the author decided to take a break in this one and write sheer and utter nonsense. The first 100 pages is a complete joke, inane conversation abound, written as if by a high school child. Worst of all, it's unbelievable BORING. It's as if he's paid by the word and he just sat down and started rambling. Page after page of childish, boring conversation between the characters. It's UNREADABLE. I cannot believe the editors let this be published as is, shame on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE ?","review":"I would like to start out by saying that my beef is with Brilliance Audio and Dick Hill and not with Terry Goodkind. I have purchased all of the preceding books on audio cd and listen to them on the way to and from work everyday. I have read the whole series as well. When I first started listening to this cd, I couldn't figure out who Kylin was. I finally released it was Dick Hills version of how to pronounce Kalan's name. This my be trivial to some people but it really annoys the crapp out of me. I would think that someone would of picked up on the fact that the pronunciation of a main character's name was completely different in this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been shorter without the summary","review":"This book prabably could have been a couple hundred pages shorter if it weren't for the fact that every other page was a review of what happened in the previous books. Don't get me wrong - it's great that Goodkind tries to explain what has happened in the event of new readers, but the way he does it is unsubtle and tedious. Otherwise, I liked the book, but when you skip almsot entire chapters because they are nothing but one character telling a new character what you've already read, something is not quite right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a porno or a fantasy?","review":"I enjoyed the series up to this book but after reading this, I was very upset. I was upset with the sexuality in this book. Calm it down Terry, this is being read by kids. I won't read another book of yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Drivel. Like a soap opera set in the middle ages, Temple of Winds tells the story of Richard's love for Kahlan, and Kahlan's love for Richard. And on and on we go, with all the written appeal of a dimestore romance novel. Goodkind can't even bring himself to describe parts of the body - referring to a vagina as \\"her sex\\". It appears as if Goodkind's story - which started wonderfully well - is petering out. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somehow it disappointed me.","review":"This has not been my first series regarding lost and ancient worlds. Ages ago I was introduced into these types of books by the magic hand of JRR Tolkien; since then I have found authors that even could match him in inventing gripping stories. I'm talking about Tad Williams, for instance. When I read the two first parts of SOT, without no doubt I'd have included Goodkind atop my selected ranking. However books III and IV lose that strange bait that attract the reader, sometimes you even get bored reading them or what is worse: you know what is going to happen next. I was really fed up with Khalan and Richard's pasionate demostrations of love. Jezz! Goodkind spends more that a half of the Temple of Winds writing about if they kiss each other in the first step of a stair or behind a corner. I thought it was going to be much more fluent and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book bites","review":"Call me sick (and many have), but I don't mind the sex or violence. What I do mind is authors adding unnecissary filler to stories. I loved the first book. It was a full, wonderful novel. The rest of them (2-4) are short stories filled with extra dialogue. Many of the chapters are elongated with redundancy simply becuase this writer thinks he needs to write a 500 page novel.And who else but me could give a hoot about Richard and Kahlan? Okay the love each other. That was established in the first novel. Now, it's just plain sappy. Each would give their lives for the other. (How many times was that crud said?) Their whole love affair with each other is just corny beyond belief. If I wanted this kind of dung I would have read a Hallmark card. I will not be buying any further installments of this series"},{"rating":"2","title":"I would love to see this put into film","review":"I started this series aprox. 4 years ago. The first book reeled me right in. Out of all of them thus far, (with exception to Wizard's First Rule), this book is the best! A definite page turner from the beginning. The relationships between Kahlan, Richard, and Cara the Mord-Sith are riveting and fun. This book makes you hold your breath, laugh and cry. Goodkind has a flair for detail, capturing every movement of the characters as they speak and think. I would love to see this book adapted to a screenplay. There are so many interesting characters and plots weeved in. I know it would be a blockbuster hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodkind is the best, but this is his worst.","review":"Terry Goodkind is probably my favorite fiction author of all time, right next to R. A. Salvatore. This, however, is the worst book of the \\"Sword of Truth\\" series. It's all talk and no action. I recommend skipping it and heading straight to \\"Soul of the Fire\\". That one's much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Service","review":"Item ws received in excellent time and was brand new. I now have four of the 12 books in this series. When I have again go money I will continue to purchase the rest.I have read them all except for the Omen Machine but somebody borrowed and did not return my paperback copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry Goodkind is awesome","review":"Terry Goodkind is often compareed to and sometimes accused of ripping off Robert Jordan. However this is not the case... Yes, Goodkind fans will enjoy Jordan's work and Jorda fan's will enjoy Goodkind's work... However Goodkind's work is unique. Temple of the Winds is one of the best books in the Sword of Truth series in my opinion and if you haven't read it, or any of the series I suggest you do so. Obviously you will only appreciate this book for its full value if you have read the books up to it, and continue to read the books that came after it and the few that are yet to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Richard and Kahlan catch a break??","review":"Well this book didn't have the ending I had hoped for, but that aside... It was well written. Here's my thing though... Richard and Kahlan are constantly getting screwed in these novels, and it's always somehow their fault! It's depressing and tiresome. By the fourth novel you would think that Richard and Kahlan could battle something that wasn't going to destroy their lives and everyone around them. It's always a no-win situation. If I was Richard I'd be like \\"F-it!\\"And I can't continue the series, because the NEXT novel is about how they screwed up YET AGAIN, and unlocked some spell by getting married. I mean they're such benevolent characters it makes you want to puke or pull your hair out, and they still get jacked no matter what they do! Come up with something NEW! sheesh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Change something","review":"I don't want to sound too negative, but I liked only last 100 pages.

I don't think that was enought."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ!!","review":"Another slain dragon for Mr. Goodkind! While maybe not as good as the others, it was still above the level of most writers. And for those who try to compare Mr. Goodkind to Mr Jordan(Robert, not Micheal), I have this to say: Mr Goodkind is publishing books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harlow steals the show!","review":"As a diehard fan of Clark Gable I rented this movie for him and came out of it completely under the spell of Jean Harlow. Who cares what their personal lives were like, does it really matter? No, when they're on the screen together everything else just disappears. While some actresses seem to shrink in the presence of legends like Gable, Harlow actually steals scenes from him. Her tough talking Vantine is the one you're rooting for from the beginning. And when she's not on the screen the story gets a bit sappy and diluted. But as always she returns to save the day (and the picture) with her wise-cracking unapologetic manner. Hooray for Harlow and Gable! Whatever genius got them together on the screen did film fans everywhere a favor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original \\"Mogambo\\"","review":"\\"Red Dust\\" proved such a success for Clark Gable that he starred in the remake \\"Mogambo\\" over twenty years later, in the very same role. That doesn't happen very often, you know! He's a man's man, all hard liquor and sweat, and he takes a liking, naturally enough, to the floozy who drifts onto his rubber plantation, Jean Harlow. Things are pretty cozy for them until the Upper Crust couple arrive, naive Gene Raymond and his prim and proper wife Mary Astor. Then Gable takes a liking to HER, and the fur flies with Harlow. \\"Red Dust\\" is a barrel of fun that ought to interest even the most casual of viewers==just check out that impassioned kissing of Mary Astor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this not on DVD?","review":"I can't believe this movie isn't available on DVD.

This movie is a must for any Jean Harlow or Clark Gable fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Dust","review":"Jean Harlow and Clark Gable did a series of films together. This is probably thier best.

It did not show her usual style. I felt the same way about SEAN. I loved the \\"BRIDES\\" books and even though I don't usually keep books I kept those and refuse to lend them out. Someday I may want to read them again. The first few of the \\"COWBOYS\\" were great and I was happy to find another series by LG, but the quality of the last couple could not keep me excited about reading them. I'll try the next one when it comes out and I hope they are LG quality. If not, I'll give up on that particular series. Sorry Leigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folk at it's best","review":"I saw Casey Neill open for Great Big Sea, and he was amazing. Went right out and got the CD. He's gotten me interested in folk again. There's a wide range of songs on the CD, showing Neill's wide range of interests and knowledge, and all the songs are beautifully constructed. Living in Colorado, I love his song about water rights issues and land barons in the San Luis Valley. The last song, about returning home from the sea, is worth the cost of the CD alone for anyone who has spent any time on a ship. You can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to be out of your mind!","review":"New Order without a doubt is the one if not the best groups in the world.

I have only seen the first six episodes, so I was thrilled to get the DVD, thinking it would contain the whole series - all nine episodes. As I found out when I got the DVD, it only contains THREE episodes: the pilot episode, \\"Every Dog Has Its Day\\" (ep. 5) and \\"One Acquainted with the Night\\" (ep. 6). If you're a fan of any of the actors (I got it because of Ken Olin), okay, you'll get to see them a bit. If you want to watch the whole series, though, no luck.

You can only extend your pants as far as it's designed which might be a good amount for you but it wasn't for me (and again, as your belly grows, this doesn't grow with you).I would save your money and invest it in a Be Band or similar item.

Rather than focusing on the individual strengths and weaknesses men and women bring to relationships, the author focused on the weakness and instability of women. In addition, his examples and analogies were often misplaced and poorly devised... certainly not illustrative of his points or of a healthy marriage. I found the content much too general with overuse of stereotypes.

My husband and I are in our 38th year of marriage, and \\"later is most certainly greater\\" for us. This book helped me through some of the struggles that are \\"reality\\" for many committed Christian couples in today's world of high divorce rates.

Many major categories are covered: the artist, the potential emigre, the emigre who has returned, the indebted businessman, the mafia thug, the hard-as-nails old woman who's survived so much, the heavy-drinking, English-teaching foreigner, and more. They're all a very odd bunch, but he somehow makes them believable, and likeable.Everyone will enjoy the novel, but a small amount of Russian--at least the alphabet--and some time in Moscow itself will be needed in order to more fully understand all of the inside jokes.Highly recommended. This foreign resident of Moscow will lend it enthusiastically to others in order to give them a better idea of what it's like here."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book!","review":"I first learned of Jim Masterson by listening to a podcast of an interview he'd done.

I've taken an acupressure course and the knowledge gained by using this book has only enhanced what I learned from that.

I think I have to write this review for class credit or something. Anyways, I read somewhere on the internet that prior to 132 B.C. Idaho was ruled by spiders. I don't know why that Morris guy couldn't have written about that.Instead he writes about precarious normalcy or something. Some athletes and their dads. It looks like he was trying to get this turning into some ghey movie starring James Van Der Beek. Instead it just makes me hate Idaho. There is also some story about a man going blind from masturbation. I think this author's writing is pretty masturbatory itself.I was really disappointed in the story \\"Astronauts.\\" No one went to the moon, but the author did bend over and show us that he is an arse. So I guess there is that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Philosophy After Postmodernism - What makes this book brilliant is that it doesn't just reject deconstruction as obscure but criticizes it in detail, and tries to work with what's positive in it.

If you don't really care about the post-human, skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hayles delivers a (virtual) reality check.","review":"Finally, a well-informed, razor-smart analysis of the cultural evolution of information as we (mis)understand it today. Hayles does for information and cybernetics what Foucault has done for sexuality, madness and the penal system, and she does it in a way that is thorough-going, highly contemporary, and enjoyable. Hayles offers the paradoxically devastating thesis that, in our visions of information, in our approaches to cybernetics, and in our handling of our own place in the world, Western culture has been hurtling down the wrong path. We have forgotten the physical. Worse, in order to forget the physical, to elide our own bodies, we had to forget or disregard a mountain of evidence. Not content to let us remain ignorant, Hayles recalls that evidence for us, shows us where we've come from, where we are, and offers some insight into where we're going. This is one of those books that you will tell all your friends about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book, Bad E-Book","review":"My low rating is not for the text itself, but for the kindle formatting. Normally, one would be able to transfer between each chapter by using the arrow buttons, but this e-book provides no links to be able to do that. This seems like very lazy e-book formatting.

Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. The vividness of the imagery and color James Morgan succeeds in conveying through words on paper is simply stunning. And the masterful way in which he weaves his own self-discovery together with a travelogue of France, a painting lesson, and biographical glimpses into the life of Henri Matisse is delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chasing Matisse","review":"Chasing Matisse: A Year in France Living My DreamWhat a load of pretentious nonsense! The author combines samples of his own work (which are child-like), a poor travelogue of France and a brief, dry biography of a great painter (with few original insights) in an offering that had me bored from page one. He asks for sympathy for his financially 'risk-taking' venture whilst telling us of his efforts to sell his house (at $79,000 under value) and fly his children over to France to celebrate Christmas whilst regailing us with descriptions of the expensive meals and swish hotels he stays in. We don't need the constant admiring prose for Henri's work - it speaks for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book this year!","review":"Little did I know when I bought this book that it would be such a great companion on my trip to Paris in May. I began reading on the long flight from the West Coast and was immediately intrigued with the first line on the cover about leaving everything to start a new adventure. Then I arrive in Paris and see posters everywhere touting a new exhibit for Henri Matisse in the museum at the Luxumbourg Gardens. The whole experience was enhanced by the wonderful insights of this author. Not only have I learned new things about France and Matisse and painting but I have a new appreciation for the wonderful opportunities that keep appearing no matter what our age.

Though she's very much a leftie, the nature of this inquiry is into all things political, and Dukakis as much as Bush is a target for Didion's scorn.

It has always had a special spot with me and it didn't let me down the second time around. I worked in Manila 1981-84 and remembered the book as capturing the feel of the place. Indeed it does capure the post-Marcos era and the poor, terminally corrupt Philippines. The main characters are great. Who wouldn't want to run a caper with this crew. Wish Thomas was still with us and we could look forward to more from \\"Other Guy\\" the pretender and the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first intro to Ross Thomas","review":"My dad had this on his bookshelf. It's hard for me to imagine I made it to my late thirties without ever having heard of Ross Thomas. But I grabbed Out on the Rim as I was getting on a plane to Shanghai. The only bad thing was I read it start-to-finish from the minute the plane took off. I even managed to eat an airplane meal without putting the book down.Other reviewers have detailed this one well enough, but I will say that I just cannot imagine anyone having anything but fun reading this romp. If I had to choose a favorite Ross Thomas novel, it would be Seersucker Whipsaw, but I'm glad I lucked out with Out on the Rim first."},{"rating":"2","title":"stories without words","review":"This series by Mercer & Marianna Mayer is a great tool for showing young children how to interpret pictures and story sequence, even nonverbal children can can profit from these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"No words","review":"I ordered this book for my 3 year old nephew and was surprised to receive a book without any words.

Browning provides an in-depth discussion of the logistics, tactics and strategy of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, which played a very important and often overlooked role during the Civil War. Its successes benefitted the efforts of the Union's Army of the Potomac and adversely affected the operations of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. There is also a succinct explanation of the campaign to capture Wilmington, North Carolina and the broader effects that campaign had on Lee's army. Eight maps, fourteen illustrations and over a hundred pages of notes and bibliography augment the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Updating Holst","review":"This is an excellent recording of the Planets. The Naxos engineers have managed to capture most of the subtle orchestral effects of this work. It is a wholly acceptable recording.However, this recording adds on to Holst's masterpiece by including Colin Matthews' Pluto. I quite liked Matthews' movement, but I really wonder whether Holst's masterpiece is served by appending a movement so out of character to the original work. Matthews' Pluto is a quite modern work. Some critics have pointed out that had Holst wanted to add an eighth movement, he could have just as easily added earth. (Pluto was not discovered until long after The Planets was composed.) Much like adding a modern structure onto an ancient building, you really have to wonder whether or not this is actually a good idea.This is still a good recording to have, however. It brings out the shimmering textures of Neptune. Jupiter is certainly glorious."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tutor's Joy","review":"This book has lots of good ideas for games to help improve skills.

Well it is a Ab clarinet, not a Bb clarinet. The barrel is too short. I sent the barrel back to the company that shipped it and am waiting for the correct part to ship back to me.

The little prim ladies were appalled. I loved their recoil. Anything that suggests vulgarity, let alone sex, is frowned upon.

Very little of the usual silent film hand-wringing and eyelash-batting takes place here, instead she draws us in with subtlety, thankfully at the hands of a great director.The camerawork is genuinely moving, genuinely beautiful in many ways.

There are various close ups of Brooks which demonstrate that she was not only a talented actress, but a true vision of beauty. Her face is absolutely flawless. Buy this movie today on DVD, you will not regret it. The DVD also contains the eighteen minute movie short, \\" Windy Riley Goes to Hollywood\\", where one can hear Louise Brooks talk! This was directed by Roscoe \\" Fatty\\" Arbuckle under an assumed name.Arbuckle's life and career were devasted by a scandal in the early 1920's, he died not long after making this film short.Also highly recommended is of course, \\"Pandora's Box\\" also starring the lovely Louise Brooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shovel is Tiny","review":"I bought the Snowivor kit thinking I was getting a normal sized shovel.

The story makes little sense... a safecracker goes underground in the Paris subway system, where he eludes a variety of pursuers, forms a rock band with subway musicians, pines for Isabelle Adjani (who is equally, and inexplicably, drawn to him), and somehow all this is Significant.

Set almost entirely in the Paris metro underground system, it follows a punkish man named Fred(Christopher Lambert of Highlander fame). He is on the run from some corporate characters and meets the beautiful Isabelle Adjani. It is not nearly as good as Leon, but does have some style. The DVD is atrocious though. The picture has got to be the worst one ever. The transfer looks like it was taken from an old video tape with the tracking out, it really has to be seen to be believed. Also, there are no chapter times. The sound is not much better too, and is very loud, probably because it is encoded in MPEG 2 compression. There are no extras as well. An OK film is let down badly by this transfer to DVD. It is cheapish but still not worth it. The film deserves a better score than 1 star, but the DVD doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who said Subway ?","review":"Thanks to Luc Besson and UAV Entertainment (Luc, did you sell your soul with that great movie's copyrights ?) not to include the original soundtrack on a DVD featuring a french movie that is not even out in France !

After having watched Subway I can't imagine someone giving it a favorable review; and I watched the supposedly \\"best version\\" of the film. There was no aspect of the film that made it worth spending time watching it. Til you've seen the movie, you're simply choosing which reviews to believe.

Even though I am doing a review of the DVD, I saw the video version and it was dubbed as well. I am giving the movie an extra star just because DVD quality and subtitles usually add to the overall quality of foreign movies.I doubt it. This is a stupid movie. Christopher Lambert is trying to be hip but looks lost. Adjani is cute but she is one of those timeless beauties, and 80s fashion never worked for her. Jean Reno is usually cool. Besson did figure out how to use him properly in Nikita and The Professional. In this one he drums. THere are also plots about Subway robbers and whacky whacky homeless people who start their own 80s pop band.If you want dumb fun, watch Repo Man. Watch Repo Man over and over again.

It fundtions very well. It was a challange to get adjusted but doable. Adjusting the cut depth is still trial and error and must be done for every thickness of stock used. You can't pre-adjust based on material thickness. It is designed for a right tilt balde. There are instructions for conversion to a left tilt but it isn't really designed to do that. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the stock holder doesn't reverse for a left tilt situation. This leaves no backing for the stock. It works OK anyway. It is just worrysome.

This moves the face plate 1 1/4 inches closer to the blade. Next mount a piece of square 1/2 inch stock (I used a piece of oak)using the four screw holes in the face plate.

In one of my wood magazines, there was an article on this jig and it stated that Delta was coming out with a new modle this year, but in the next issue, they had to retract their article.

Through a series of her own mistakes and willfulness and the actions of others around her (many of them negative or trying to use her), she discovers more who she is - and what her place is.The series was fairly fast moving and uplifting; fairly plot and character centred.

His father taught him that life was a Great Joke, that it was an illusion; that the best way to survive was to drift oneself into oblivion. But he found love in the person of Lena and it changed his perspective on living and was responsible for his change of heart as represented in the above-quoted statement. It's too bad that the novel could not have had a happy ending, but Conrad's view of the world probably would not permit it. I found the novel engrossing, somewhat melodramatic, yet vintage Conrad in its depiction of good and evil battling each other on the island of Samburan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Good Conrad book.

It was brand new but a off beat publisher. I am still looking for the Moderen Libraryk edition.

In Britain we claim him as British and in Poland he is is claimed as Polish - and why wouldn't we all claim this genius of the descriptive, the fleshing out of characters and the tight and taciturn dialogue. Based on his experiences at sea at the turn of the century all these books - and Victory: An Island Tale is no exception - it is 5 stars. But one word of warning - if you want to get to know Conrad - avoid movies - such as the Sam Neil Willem Dafoe - disasters. Read him. His books cannot be effectively translated to the screen as they depend too much on the imagination of the reader. The screen only serves to diminish his work"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Conrad's best novels, if not one of his best known.","review":"Victory is the story of a man named Heyst who leads an isolated life in the South Pacific. However, he is drawn out of his isolation when he brings a woman to his island home. A chance encounter between a dishonest German who dislikes Heyst and two criminals sets up the dramatic ending. Conrad's style is as fluid as in his better known books, such as Lord Jim, and it is amazing that someone could write English so well who did not learn it until later in life and who always spoke it with a heavy Polish accent. Victory is similar to Conrad's other works in that the plot flirts with melodrama, but always is rooted in realism.

This is a laugh-out-loud funny book to be thoroughly enjoyed by the pool, ocean, or after the kids are in bed. At the same time, there are scenes that will move you to tears.

It makes me wonder where Ms. Crittenden went to college. Did she ever learn about critical thinking?

I thought her portrayal of the midwife as medically incompetent was unfortunate, as that is entirely inaccurate in my experience.

The beginning and end have a few insights into the feelings of a woman who quit work to stay at home, and there are a few witty lines. In between, there is a long arduous tale of an idealistic lawyer who decides his idealism is misplaced.Where are the kids? After reading the whole book I couldn't even give you a description of them, except to say that the son has some problems with aggression. I think most stay-at-home moms spend most of their mental energy on the kids, with all the sometimes mundane and sometimes delightful details that involves.

Stop whining and do something!'If you read the dustcover, the summary implies this story is 'hilarious.' It is nothing of the sort. For example, the character Amanda compares the DC mommies to broodmares. Well, I didn't find that funny. The comparison was very heavy handed.I hated the Amanda's epihphany moment at the end of the book. I felt lectured.

The focus is on the weather, not so much on the chasers as what one may find in other storm videos, these three volumes are the best for a more historical aspect of tornadoes, showcasing scientific development up to present times in clear terms and analysis of the storms themselves. While I truly admire the chasers for doing what they do, I would like to see what they are doing scientifically, not focusing so much of the internal fighting and squabbling that seems to be gong on in so many of the newer videos.

This particular recording is his first and was released in 1990, not 1999 as Amazon incorrectly states. The 62 minute CD has 21 tracks ranging in length from 33 seconds to almost 7 minutes.

In the movie, Dwight is a 2-dimension stereotypical alcoholic abuser and that's all.Read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Dramatized Story","review":"I was quite sad after finishing the book \\"This Boy's Life\\" because it was such a well written book about times past and innocence lost. I rushed to rent the movie from Blockbusters and was quite disappointed. Many details were missing and some were overly dramatized, such as the scene of the wedding night between Dwight and Toby's mother. Call me old timer, if you want, but I thought it was unnecessary to be so graphic since the book certainly didn't give the details of sodomy, although I should have expected it in Hollywood productions.The book was far better. I don't suppose movies can quite capture the details of a book, perhaps only its essence. I must say the movie captures the essense well.Also, it was listed as a True Story in the beginning of the movie. It should have been called True Dramatized Story instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"it should be 0 stars","review":"this was the worst movie i had ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best and funniest child abuse movie around","review":"You will be dry gulched by the performance of Robert De Niro in this classic tail of a harlot mother who drags her son from town to town. Leo Decaprio play Jack the harlots son who starts out wanting to do well but because of the bums his mom keeps selling her self to he heads on a spiraling path towards juvenile delinquency.That all takes place in the first half an hour of the film when Jacks saving grace enters the picture, played by Robert De Niro. This role was perfict for De Niro, being a manipulative two faced dirt bag named Dewight. Dewight continues to make Jacks life more and more miserable with every day through the clever use of verble abuse which made me really laugh and violence that would normaly turn the stomach but here it just made every thing that much better.So if you are looking for a funny true to life movie about [the in a cruddy little town, then this is your movie. I laughed and laughed and laughed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Boy's Life - movie to support book","review":"I used this movie in a high school class this summer in which we first studied the book.

That's where single mom Caroline (Barkin) and her teenage boy Jack (DiCaprio) land, seeking a fresh start. And this time, she's determined to make her marriage work.Based on a true story, Caroline meets Dwight (De Niro), who apparently offers stability, steady pay and a father figure for Jack. They move in to Dwight's house although he has a wedding night surprise for Caroline.Dwight immediately begins to mentor Jack through Boy Scouts, a paper route and boxing lessons. Despite good intentions, Dwight begins to reveal himself as a loud, selfish and crude man who uses such slang as \\"road apples\\" and \\"shut your pie hole.\\" Dwight continues to goad and humiliate Jack until the teen learns that an odd friend he's made may be able to phony up his test scores just enough to be admitted to a distant school. But Caroline's and Jack's actual escape turns out to be quite a bit more violent."},{"rating":"2","title":"De Niro is creepy","review":"I found it a little wierd how well Robert De Niro fit into this role. Very convincing!! Of course, Leonardo DiCaprio made the movie what it is. This kid can act (if you don't believe me, see Gilbert Grape).My suggestion would be to read the book first. Then watch the movie. The book (in my opinion) is not quite as good as the movie (usually not my opinion). The director takes a little liberty with the film, which really adds to it.Good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touches sensitive issues","review":"I have watched this movie many times on VHS. After I write this, I am going to order it on DVD. The issues it touches are single mothers, abusive fathers, and homosexuality. I have read all the reviews that other people wrote and didn't see this last topic touched upon. It also is intertwined with the issue of bullying. Two other boys look upon the gay boy as being weak just because he was gay. They convince Dwight (Leonardo) to pick a fight with this boy. The gay boy wins the fight and he and Leonardo become friends due to a mutual interest in playing the piano. Dwight, going to a new school at high school age, which is always a difficult adjustment, is desperately in need of friends. This was very moving to me.In addition, there is a wonderful conclusion to Dwight's problems with his abusive father (Robert Deniro). I disagree with the reviewer who disliked the ending.

The author places too much emphasis on designer ideas and too little on practical instructions. I wasn't looking for \\"wearable art,\\" but for bags which were useful, durable, and good looking. Far better for those purposes is Nancy Restuccia's book \\"Hold It! How to Sew Bags, Totes, Duffels, Pouches & More.\\" Ms. Restuccia gives careful, easy-to-follow directions, clear drawings supplemented by photos, and resources for finding materials and hardware to complete the projects in the book.

It might be fun but it does come at a price. The book brings the conclusion of Raskob as the winner of the height race but does not take it to it's conclusion with enough details of the Empire State Building becoming a financial burdern during Raskob's life and therefore the call into question of a real success or win.The one dissappointment with the book is the exclusion of details of other challenges during the same time - specifically the City Services Building, City Bank Farmers Trust Building and 1 Wall Street and possibly the soon to follow Rockefella Center.

You realize that this is self-indulgent crap, because it is about a singer-song writer searching for a tune, so that he can keep his job, and keep his girl. This is explained by the main character. \\"I need to write a song to that I can keep my job and my girl friend.\\" There are a few interesting animations that might make an interesting graphic for an album, but nothing in this random assault of imagery justifies a movie.If you made it through that poorly written review, imagine a movie of lower caliber, less wit, and sketchier organization, and that is the movie \\"The Tune\\" is.Avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the must have books of Ufology","review":"This book (along with one or two others) has had a profound influence on my view of UFOs.

I got it mainly because I was already buying some other things from Coolerguys and it was on sale for $4.95. this cooler doesn't get hot at all, so either it is working great or the Northbridge isn't really heating up in the first place. my rationale for buying it was two part 1) I wanted a non-moving cooler in case the fan ever did stop working and I didn't notice & 2) I wanted to eliminate the noise from the fan in the first place. The first part I achieved, the second point, to be honest, I can't really hear a difference although there probably is one. In conclusion, this really isn't a must have cooler, but it looks neat and does what it advertises.

This edition covers 11,000 wines versus the 7th Edition's 40,000. For example, Beringer Alluvium Red (a particular favorite) is listed only for the 1999 vintage, while the 7th Edition, published in 2000, reviews and rates four vintages: 1993 through 1996.The typefont used in the 8th Edition is overly large: intended, perhaps, to disguise its reduced scope.Wine Spectator's wine ratings, available to members at their website, are both extensive and reliable, but they have failed to pull that value forward into this Edition of their Wine Buying Guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"In this eighth edition:1.

There are only the reviews for the past couple of years, and already it seems somewhat out of date. If you're looking for something older than '99 you're out of luck. I found the reviews (in large type, no less) to be less than all-inclusive of even the small number of wines available now. Instead of over 40,000 reviews, you are only getting about 11,000.

The book provides little general background on wine flavors, styles, and appellations. For instance, the introduction to the section on France discusses Burgundy's key white wine districts without mentioning Chablis! The book's largest section is the alphabetical listing of producers and the scores for each of their wines. The French section is not sorted by appellation making it very difficult for use in any purchase planning. The comprehensive list of wine scores would be valuable at the wine shop.

It's better to think of Pole as minimalist dub inspired by glitch - almost a laid-back version of Monolake. At its best Pole is excellent chill music, catchy and even somewhat danceable. Certainly not what I was expecting when I first bought the album (Pole being a German musician, Stefan Betke).In its less interesting moments though it can sound dull and repetitive, which is why I've given this album a four-star rating.

Works very easily, just plug it in and use whatever program you use to record.The only thing that i will say about it is that when u sing loud it doesn't pick up the sound good unless you lower your volume imput..which makes it sound kinda weak..But i dont have enough experience with mics to know if they all do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samson C01U-USB MIC","review":"I bought this mic nearly 4 years ago,and I do voice over work for commercials, promos, practically any and all voice media. I have used Neuman U87, Blue kiwi mics and to be honest, I put this mic up aganist either one of those for sound quality. The aforementioned mics run 100's of dollars, and don't deliver the sound quality, (for what I do) than the Samson mic. If you have a million dollar studio and mic drums, guitars, etc, and can have an engineer to eliminate the analog problem, then It might be worth it. I'm a pro and have been around studios over 30 years and this is the best mic I own. I'm trying to sell my Neuman and Blue, but no one whats it cause they know what I use, bummer, in a way.

The latency (delay) is very high! You can expect to hear anywhere from 1-4 seconds of silence before sound acctually goes through your speakers.

It works, but at the expense of annoying delay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works as well as a cheap microphone","review":"I purchased this so that I could use my own headphones and a good mic with Skype and MS Onenote (audio notes). Since I use Vista on my laptop, I could not use the software that came with the product. The Vista driver is dated to 2006 so its old. I tried recording audio in Onenote and the mic performed as well as my cheap microphone headset combo, which means that it performed badly. Yes, I did follow Samson's Vista instructions and it still worked poorly.I also tried installing it on my XP desktop machine and got an error while installing SoftPre software. The error stated that MSVCP71.dll is missing. I did a search and apparently I'm not the only one that has had this problem. I uninstalled the software and tried testing with the basic XP drivers and it performed badly.I returned this product for a refund and I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for a desktop microphone.

Sound Quality was okay but either the buffer was too small (which caused the sound to scratch every few seconds) or the buffer was too large which ended in a lag causing me to get distracted from my monitor-earphones.

This Microphone might have a nice sound but I can'T recommend it for high standard voice recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent mic but rather useless","review":"It's \\"plug-n-play\\" if you use Garageband 08. But it simply doesn't work with Logic 8. The instructions on the samsontech.com site are pre-Leopard and don't work. Even if you're running Tiger, their instructions are missing a step. I've tried everything. It's useless. If you want to use it in GB 08, it's fine. But if you want to do more than beginner's recording (like many Mac users), don't buy it. [...].

I made the Cranberry Beach-Plum Cheesecake on page 129 which calls for cream cheese, ricotta, sour cream, and ten eggs, but NO sugar! This was not a savory cheesecake, but a DESSERT, and the tart cranberry topping and graham cracker crust could not compensate for the blandness of straight cheese and eggs, flavored only with vanilla. It was so startling and unexpected that my friend actually spit it out.Was this an error in proof reading, or simply a bad recipe? It certainly makes me hesitant to try another recipe from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"analyze the water","review":"Did you analyze the water or just making generalizations (\\"it certainly removes harmful bacterial, cysts, and protozoa.\\")Yeah, thought so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, warm, suicidal, family Christmas fun!","review":"This has to be the Vandals' musical masturpiece! It's is ridiculous, yet true, with more obsecnity and insanity than Christmas itself. Songs like Thanx for nothing and A gun for christmas are excellent parodies; and Hanging myself from the tree and Christmas time for my... are strangely emotional ballads while maintaining a high level of humor. The whole thing ends with a beautifully orchestrated instrumental medley that shows just how hard the band worked on this one. If you must own one Vandals album... or one Christmas album, let this be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not a fan of punk but I loved this album","review":"This may not be the ideal album for the entire family sitting around the fireplace on Christmas Eve, but it's still a Christmas classic. \\"My Frst X-mas (as a Woman)\\" and \\"Christmas Time for My [...]\\" are sweetly melodic and and the lyrics are hilarious. \\"Dance of the Sugarplum Fairies\\" is a little more hardcore but the theme from The Nutcracker is cleverly woven into the electric guitar insanity. There is something here for people of all sorts of musical tastes, and it makes an excellent offbeat gift for people other than your grandparents."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best vandals cd- by far","review":"Wow. I've been a vandals far for about 2 years now and this one, the christmas special, is so funny.

An interesting stop in Godard's career. A pseudo-revolutionary and a pop singer have an odd relationship. It is worth it to watch this one alongside \\"Pierrot Le Fou,\\" because the two movies are different yet at the same time quite fluid. In fact, if this one does not hook you, I would give \\"Pierrot\\" a try and then come back to \\"Masculin/Feminin.\\" Jean-Pierre Leaud (from The 400 Blows) is particularly excellent in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The French \\"New Wave\\" at its height","review":"Amazon's review is right on the money concerning this film.What I would add is that this film best shows the change that female sexual liberation had on society. The boy, totally in love, has nothing of value to give to a girl who considers sex an everyday occurance -- a big change from the going-steady days of the late fifties and early sixties when sex was the culmination of a protracted courtship. The masculine and feminine roles changed forever and continue so to this day. Goddard was there first. In 1966, this film was cutting edge. In 1999 it remains an important work with a lot to say to the present generation concerning the battle of the sexes that has, apparently, been won for good by the ladies.I saw it in 1966 on a first date with a very conservative girl who was convinced after we left the theatre that I was a sex pervert. Unfortunately for me she was as yet unwashed by the New Wave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"Most of the time I love French films. 400 Blows, Breathless, etc. This one caught my eye so I bought it.

Of course most books written about the Ecumenical Movement over the last 45 years are written by Roman Catholic Authors with a Roman Catholic Slant. What about a Protestant perspective? Yes, Protestants are divided, but so is the Roman Catholic Church? Pre-Vatican II Catholics, and Post-Vatacan II Catholics. Where I live, in a predominate Roman Catholic city, I meet many Roman Catholics who are divided over Vatacan II Council concerning the Ecumenical Movement. I also meet many Protestants who are divided over the Ecumenical Movement. A thought provoking book written by a Protestant, \\"THE FINAL APOSTASY UNVEILED!\\" tells the other slant to the story. If Catholics and Protestants are to come to any agreement, We must get both sides of the Ecumenical issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Artsy is good, but this?

It was one of the most blatant attempts to be an \\"artsy\\" movie that I have seen... yet being that obvious about it made it not art, but just bad. As serious as the tone of this movie was, I found myself laughing at moments that I found unbelievably ridiculous. Just wait for the dinosaurs and you'll know what I mean. That's right...

It is a fine example of what filmmakers ought to have been doing with the tools at their disposal. It stands alone, but I suspect many film-goers are too ignorant of both science and the Bible to understand the allusions. So although it is tightly plotted, they are lost in a sea of images and sound. If they were simple enough to enjoy it as a spectacle, there would be no problem. However, America abounds with fools who think themselves wise, and it vexes them to perceive that something is going on, but they don't know what it is. For instance, the director uses dinosaurs to illustrate the beginning of self awareness, and awareness of the other - a theme which is further developed later.The film deals with all the big issues, but it is also simply a wonderous spectacle, and isn't that also one of the big themes of life?"},{"rating":"1","title":"MY GRADE: C minus","review":"20 minutes was enough of this film.

Normally I love films with symbolism, but this one was beyond or above my pay level. I started to get irritated with the flashbacks and lack, for me, of cohesion. The photography was beautiful, but to me Fellini's films captured a mood, symbolism, a story, and always left you thinking. His film, Juliet of the Spirits, reminded me of The Tree of Life in some ways, but I loved Juliet of the Spirits. I was frustrated with the tree. The one stand out to me was Jessica Chastain's performance. I had seen her in The Help and in Debt, and was amazed by her versatility. Someday, she may be the next Meryl Streep.

I watched the trailer for this film, thinking that it would be a good character study movie. WRONG! It was some abstract, modern art, poetry mumble jumble that was absolutely boring and disjointed at best. I want my money back! I love movies and I enjoy a really well written story. There was no story, no plot, or anything. It was like following someone's thoughts with landscapes and music. I even hated the way it was filmed. Honestly, this was the worst piece of crap that I've seen in a very long time and it should not be listed in the film section. Unless one likes modern art, the only way anyone would rent this is because of the trickery that was used to make us think it's a movie with a story. A waste of money and a waste of the time that I lost trying to watch it (and I never made it throught the entire film - fast forward showed me it was more abstract crap)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it NO STARS if I could","review":"I'm an artist and can definitely appreciate something different and new, but this movie totally sucked.

It was just too much, even with fast forwarding some scenes, it just kept draaaaagging on. My husband fell asleep a few times, but I was determined to know that this movie was not a waste of time and money, but IT WAS.If you really have to see it, go rent it from REDBOX, but don't say you haven't been warned about how much this movie really sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzz","review":"My wife and I never...

It was so bad the dog left the room and went to bed. We were stupid enough to sit thru the entire painful 2.5 hours thinking that there would be some plot or redeaming value to the film. There was none. This movie equals \\"Howard the Duck\\" or \\"Mars Attacks\\" as the worse movie ever made but without any attempt to entertain.

I really like Sean Penn and Brad Pitt, but this movie is disappointing.Turn on the Discovery Planet Earth series. Turn on some loud opera/piano music. Have someone stand behind you as you watch/listen and whisper things in your ear like, \\"Are you watching me?\\" or \\"I wanted to believe you were there.\\" Then turn on two minutes of Jurassic Park with some dinosaur footage.That sums up the movie.

Some movies are great when you slowly build up the pieces to understand what is happening. This one makes it annoying. During serious emotional trials you are not 100% sure at times what it is about.

Main-stream, independent, whatever - as long as it let's me escape to a different reality for a little while I am happy. This film did not make me happy. Escape was impossible because I kept wondering when the movie was going to start. A bunch of little scenes of a family, jumping back and forth through time, with hardly any dialogue to speak of does not make a movie. Then we get to the creation sequence, dinosaurs and all. Great for a PBS special, but in the middle of a movie that is supposedly about a disfunctional family? I am not ashamed to say that I just don't get it.

If only I could have felt so much of a religious experience watching this film! My favorite part was the film's ending. Hurrah! Want some advice? Drop some 1960's acid and listen to Pink Floyd, \\"Echoes\\" (Meddle Album), and imagine yourself in the Pompeii ruins, and watch a volcano heat lamp light. You'll be glad you did.

There is virtually no dialogue and it is boring to the extreme. I have to admit the visuals were stunning, especially the creation sequence.

If you want to see a movie about father/son relationships watch something like October Sky for a real story.

The ending was completely crazy, the father loses his job and they pack up the car and I have no idea what was going on after that. First I thought they were going science fiction or something. If this is art then it is bazaar.I would not recommend buying this unless you at least watch a preview.I see a lot of people love this movie and I normally love deep alternative type films but this was just a bunch of images and not even a good soundtrack. I watched it to the end thinking something would come together but it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish i could give this 0 stars","review":"Absolute garbage! Trying to be too clever through \\"art\\", this film is just an annoying mash up of visual mumbo jumbo. Forget about it if you want a film where you can follow a story. It's not clever and is just a waste of money. I had to turn it off, we watched and waited for it to do something given it had won awards, but alas it went from clouds to dinosaurs to other rubbish. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This movie was so slow and so all over the place that I kept on wathcing just so it could get better. before i knew it - it was all over and I felt dissapointed and bored. What a waste of a Sat night!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Withered Root.","review":"Beautifully filmed! Talented cast, for the most part and perhaps the most self aggrandizing, pretentious, and painfully exhausted \\"father dynamic\\" story ever put on film. A long three acts that never resolve satisfactorily and leaves the audience not bewildered by the convoluted moral message but by the affected exposition.This is best viewed as a master's class in cinematography and a how to film on what not to do when trying to convey a story.WJH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever!","review":"Wow! I wanted to turn it off within 15 mins. My husband made me watch the whole movie. What a huge waste of time. I am a huge Brad Pitt fan, but this is garbage. If I could have given it 0 stars I would have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, and I'm a huge fan of this director!","review":"This movie made me angry it was so bad. It tries very hard to be hipster-deep. The acting is ok-ish, when there are actually people in it. One of my favorite movies is another polarizing one from this director, so I'm shocked I hated this so much. I can't believe I spent money to rent this.All that said, my brother, who I agree with on most movies, LOVED this. I was shocked! I only found out after blasting him an email about how horrible and self-indulgent the movie was. So I can't say for certain whether anyone else would like this or not, but I can't in good conscience give this more than one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT OR HATE IT!","review":"There is something to understand about this movie. That is...........It is different.If you like different things. You will enjoy it.If you don't, you will not like it.This movies dialog speaks to the audience through other methods than just a script. You see motion picture that will bring back memories as a child. You might cry at just the sight. There is so much feeling in this movie. If you don't allow that in, you will miss the point and I would recommend you not to try to watch or understand it.This movie isn't for everyone.But, I garrentee that if you purchase this movie, you will watch it over and over. To be honest, the more you watch it, the better it gets. The visuals are just breath taking, and the music is wonderful.After seeing it, you will want to be a better person, a better parent, and a better being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transformative","review":"The Tree of Life was perhaps the most transformative I've ever seen, bringing Big Self perspective - magnificence, tenderness, wholeness, innocence; appreciative, non-possessive love - to the struggles, extraordinary and ordinary, we as humans face, always with an underpinning of spiritual longing. Every level -acting-expressing, visual majesty and simplicity, deeply evocative. I love this film. I return to it in my heart to remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Great...","review":"It's not surprising how polarizing the film is. It's one that takes some work on the part of the viewer and some people just don't want to do that. But if you occasionally like to see films with a little poetry and a lot of ambition, don't pass this one up. I'm not sure every bit works for me, but I'm glad movies that attempt to engage the viewer like this still exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"Amazing! Inspiring! Fearless! I've never seen anything like this before. It's totally spiritual and mystical. Superb selection of music.Not for those who want to see more of what they've already seen, or a conventional narrative. Bravo!Btw, the story is a re-creation of Job's dilemma in a modern setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie is terrible, it is visually beautiful, but seriously 35 min in there still was not plot and very little dialog. Just whispers in the back ground. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Anything Else","review":"Take a walk, listen to a CD, watch someone else's home video; do anything besides watching this movie. It is a boring, pretentious, plotless stinker. Pitt and Penn, you owe me the $3.49 I spent to rent this piece of cheese. What were you thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE","review":"I don't normally review movies but this was SOOOOO BAD that I had to save others from wasting their time.After the first 30mins I was extremely irritated, annoyed and thoroughly confused. The confusion came about because I couldn't understand why anyone would produce, direct, publish or watch more than 30mins of this movie.If you like just looking at pretty pictures then this is the movie for you. The movies has no substance, plot, direction, cohesion, or VALUE!This tree of life sucked the life out of me.Safe yourself the time, you will be more entertained by watching your trees live their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no......","review":"What was this one about? I thought Brad Pitt & Sean Penn, no matter what anyone writes, I cannot go wrong. I turned it off after 20 minutes...should have paid attention to the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Absolute Worst","review":"The worst movie I've seen in years. Over the top pretentious. I would have left a third of the way through but I thought my wife wanted to see it only to find out after it ended that she felt the same as me. We wondered why so many big names signed on for it. I've since read Sean Penn's remarks that the original script was wonderful. He implied that something went terribly wrong in the production. The story of the working class Texas family could have made a good movie but it was overwhelmed by the simplistic scientific and religious shell in which it was placed. Maybe it was meant to appeal to religious fundamentalists but then there was all that evolutionary stuff. All in all a genuinely awful movie. Worth seeing only if you enjoy train wrecks. But wait for Netflix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretencious B.S.","review":"Dramatic camera angles (the kind that give you a good look up everyone's nostrils), nature photography, and whispering of 'deep thoughts' sentence fragments. Give me a break. Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever rented."},{"rating":"1","title":"high THC concentration required","review":"This film was awe-inspiring, much in the same way some of my Windows screensavers are, except I don't choose to stare at those for three hours straight because, I'm sorry, but life is just too short.I wouldn't mind some of what Malick and some of these 5-star reviewers are smoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made.","review":"This movie shows the arrogance and Narcissism of the director. This movie is all about him and his pathological ego than anything else. He is the most boring of egotists to expect people to sit through his tedious direction without wanting to scream out loud and demand his exile to a place where he can disappear into the oblivion he deserves. He makes me hate movies. He obviously is a tedious, self-absorbed, progressive, elitist, rich democrat. What crap he makes poor, blind suckers swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"TREE OF LIFE SUCKS","review":"THIS MOVIE MAKES ED WOOD LOOK GREAT.WORST THING I HAVE TRIED TO WATCH IN YEARS.IF YOU WASTE YOUR MONEY,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell","review":"Question, If this movie was as good as the Five Star reviews say it was, why didn't it play in any movie theaters in my area in CT? I didn't see this movie listed at one theater in my area whenever it was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring, drawn out movie","review":"Malick's Tree of Life exemplifies the director's arrogance for his movies. It is apparent during the long drawn out segments of the history of the universe and of Earth that Malick believes he can simply ignore plot, immersion, and interest to try to get his philosophical and artistic ideas onto the screen. However, I give this review 2 stars, not one, because there are some redeeming parts in the middle of the film where he ceases to be artistic and focuses more on the character development and family structure which actually mimics Malick's own upbringing. Perhaps this would have been better as a short, 45-minute film, but instead any semblance of a good movie is lost in philosophical nonsense which simply alienates the viewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought-provoking","review":"This is the type of film you have to watch several times in order to appreciate and understand. Highly recommended for those who think about the meaning of life. Good product and was delivered quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Malick's tour de force","review":"The first time I watched The Tree of Life, I found myself frustrated and perplexed by the nonlinear storytelling, non-descriptive character development, and cinematography that generally focused on inanimate objects with no sense of purpose. The second time I watched it, I applied a scientific and psychological lens in order to see the film in a new way. During this viewing, I discovered the beautify behind the film, the possible message the director was attempting to portray, as well as reaffirming my sense of nontheistic beliefs. The film is meant to be seen and understood in a personal way, which is rare for a film to achieve successfully without limiting and/or frustrating its audience, but here, Malick has succeeded in creating something that could easily be labeled as one of the best films of all-time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxiously Boring","review":"The Tree Of Life was a 130 minute like sucker. During the second act the movie did start to pull you in, but unwound quickly in the third act when it returned to pointlessness.Tedious at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I sat thru this...","review":"In reading all the rave reviews I have come to the conclusion that I am one of the haters. When I first started watching I thought I had rented a Planet Earth episode. Squirming in my chair, I waited for some dialog, some actual people. Finally I fast-forwarded until I saw some humans on my screen. It was tolerable after that but definitely not what I had expected from the synopsis that I read. If you're not into artsy films, don't watch this one. I can't figure out what all the fuss is about, I'm not one who gives up on a film once I start watching but I almost did on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"well that was a big waste of my time...I get it and it was just lousy...not entertaining at all...felt like this was a movie made just to torture students required to explain what it all meant..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure garbage","review":"wow and wow and wow.WHAT WAS THAT??????????SERIOUSLY!!!!!!!!I kept on waiting for something to happen and nothing happen.I did not mind paying $3 for that movie since i did not know it was that bad its the fact i spent 2 hours watching pure garbage.I m so mad, i could have watched something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cure for Insomnia","review":"Congratulations, while it was probably unintentional, the writer, director, producers, actors, and everyone else affiliated with this movie have finally found the cure for insomnia. No need to purchase expensive drugs that can leave someone with an addiction that ruins their life. They can spend $20 and get the best night's sleep for the rest of their life by spending 15 minutes watching this movie.That being said, how does everyone find this movie visually appealing? I saw 15 minutes of screensavers and people whispering nothingness. This was the absolute worst 15 minutes of my life. This movie should be boycott by human rights organizations because this movie is cruel punishment and torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"2011 \\"Best Picture\\" Nominee???? Another \\"emperor's new clothes\\".","review":"Ok, to start: (1) knew nothing about this film when I rented it other than it nominated as best picture of 2011 and (2) did not and could not make it all the way through this film. With that said, no idea why anyone would think this film is anything other than a total waste of time. \\"Artsy\\" comes to mind. Over-reaching, comes to mind. I do appreciate when one tries to encapsulate some aspect of living such that it is conveyed to others, actually conveyed, much as real art tries to do, but this picture is a total failure. I can not believe that the first 35-45 minutes was this terrible mismash of special effects about our planet forming and early life. Duh, been done so many times and ever so much better than this movie tries to do. Enough. Not recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"so far....67 retards liked this movie","review":"I am stunned at the 67 people who gave this five stars!! I gave it one (which it didn't deserve) so I could make a comment. That was the stupidest movie I have ever seen. For it to knock the rest of my worst movies off the list...that's how bad it was. If you gave it more than one star...you were tripping on acid, smoking crack, went to sleep before it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"what?","review":"I couldnt even watch the whole thing. BAD. There was no story, no dialog, maybe I am just not artsy or refined enough, but it really sucked, IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"we cut our losses at 25 minutes","review":"We were 25 minutes into the movie and still saying HUH? So far the movie was alternating between depressing scenes of funerals and abstract nature scenes.So I started reading more of the reviews and found out I'm unfortunately not in the \\"love it\\" camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"turn it up","review":"I'm sure this has been reviewed to death, so I'll just say put me in the 5-star column. There is a way of nature and a way of grace, represented by the different personalities of two parents, raising three boys in 1950s Texas. But it's about so much more than that. It has everything - God even makes a cameo. Sad and joyful, inspirational and terrifying. Play it loud, because a lot of the narration is whispered."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"More Art Work than Story\\"","review":"There is very little dialogue in this impressionistic mosaic of metaphysical/ apocalyptic fragments, which are combined with a disturbing portrayal of family dissension in 1950's. I know that the above description sounds pretty terrible, but it's actually enjoyable if you have the time and patience to sit back and take it all in. I waited a long time for this film to come out on DVD and I wasn't disappointed. But don't buy or rent it if you're looking for a traditional story with a firm linear plot, a logical sequence and easy-to-understand concepts. It's more like undergoing an artistic/philospohical experience as opposed to watching and absorbing a storyline. My only complaint is that the little bit of dialogue that exists, is spoken primarily in whispers. So be prepared to keep the volume turned up and the subtitles turned on."},{"rating":"2","title":"...And then there are Terrence Malick Movies","review":"There are movies; then there are great movies; then there are almost perfect movies; then there are Terrence Malick movies. AMPAS should just set up a special Oscar called \\"The Most Recent Terrence Malick Motion Picture\\" that Terrence Malick is awarded every year that he releases a new film. I thank my daughter for constantly reminding me to watch the Terrence Malick movies :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too pretentious to be enjoyable","review":"This movie is like a roller coaster... that fell off the tracks. There are glimmers of something that would be interesting however the effort to make it into an Cannes winner makes it fall on it's face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully filmed and hard to understand","review":"I don't know what to think about this movie. Was at the cinema last night and was totally unprepared for what I was going to see. First I thought that if I had watched it on DVD at home I would have been giving up on it, but being in the movie theater with friends I had to sit through it - and in the end I'm glad I did.It is very impressive with beautiful filming and great acting. But the story is hard to get a grip on. It challenges you, \\"What is the director trying to tell me now?\\" question often came to my mind. I think I have kind of sorted it out, but also have come to terms with that there are parts I don't understand, and that's OK.I think this is a like-it-or-hate-it movie. I have decided that I like it because of the beauty of it, but it is not a love it movie, so I give it a four stars review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu Ray of The Tree of Life","review":"A great package with Two disks, one Blu Ray and the other DVD and the rights to download a digital copy besides."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful \\"movie.\\"","review":"What the...? Huh? What just hap...? Why?All I have to say is WOW. This movie made no sense whatsoever. Brad Pitt barely finishes a few sentences. Sean Penn says a couple of words. No one ever finishes a thought. One minute we're looking at a young boy stealing his neighbor's night gown and the next we're watching dinosaurs romping through a river before mankind existed. Then there's tons of whispering you can barely hear followed by insanely deep, loud bass. Great cinematography though. Obviously the movie ends just as horribly - which was completely predictable - but it could have come a lot sooner!!! The tree of life? I just don't get it. Sure, I've read other reviews talking about the parallels between our life here on Earth and the cosmos above, and something blah blah blah about God, but this failed to accomplish that...which I assume was the main premiss of the movie.Do NOT waste your time. Awful, awful, awful!!!!! AWFUL!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean Penn who?","review":"All I can say is that this movie was almost as bad and boring as MELANCHOLIA! Raptors? Really?Rent this only if you are having trouble sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, mother.","review":"This movie reminded me of the film parodied at the end of Mr Bean's Holiday. It is so pretentious and awful, it will leave you in stitches....and I'm a film buff. We turned it off after the first twenty minutes or so, and are still muttering \\"....mother....? \\" to each other...and collapsing in laughter. The photography was pretty good, however, so I think this film is perhaps best appreciated by viewing its promotional stills, or watching it at 6x the clock speed, on mute."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not polite to whisper...","review":"Let's keep this short and sweet..I love daring movies, I love experimental movies, I love mysterious movies.I hated this movie. Hate may be too strong, I despise this movie because it pretended to be intellectual and artistic when it was actually mundane and stole everything from Earth Documentaries and actaul artistic art films from 20+ years ago. A little late Malick."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring.","review":"It reminded me of a film student's class project. It seemed to be trying very artistic, with lots of stock footage (space/nature/etc), lots of repetitive talk about God, with a thin, slow plot weaved in. I watched about an hour, and couldn't watch any more. The long parade of nature and space footage, with little bits of animation (there was a dinosaur) reminded me a bit of The Mind's Eye, only way less interesting. Such a waste of money. The acting was fine, for what little of it there seemed to be. The editing and quality of film itself was fine. The problem was the lack of plot, poor writing, and over use of stock footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, drawn out and just plain boring","review":"I saw this movie in Italy-of course it was in English, but I have to say I dragged a few Italian friends to see it since I had seen a few good reviews. WHY? I ask...horrid waste of time. there were some nice photos in the movie, but they read as stills. I thought it seemed pretentious, and a pathetic attempt at 'an art film'. (Now,\\"Tell us how you really feel!\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie has dinosaurs.","review":"Yes, the movie has dinosaurs. I cannot tell you why as I've been unable to really figure it out. I watched this movie knowing that it was very polarizing and I would either love it or hate it. I tried to love it - I did. I even started to believe I \\"got it\\". And then came the dinosaurs. You can try to say that this movie is existential and brilliant. I'm just going to go with the explanation that they were playing a joke on the viewing audience. It has to be a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I wish i would have never watched this movie, hard to follow, very abstract, does not hold your interest at all. it would serve better as a screensaver on your desktop."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER WATCHED","review":"The movie should be nominated as the RAZZIE Worst Movie of the Year. Trust me. You may be really sorry if you rent or buy this piece of merde."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money and time.","review":"I bought this from Amazon because it is a 2012 Academy Award nominee for Best Picture. This movie is crap. It is disjointed, confusing, disappointing, lacks a recognizable story line and made my wife and I both unhappy after watching it. Don't waste YOUR money. I can only be grateful, I didn't waste a lot more money watching it in the theaters.It also leads increasing credence to the complete lack of credibility to the Academy who nominates and votes on crap like this that is passed off as entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse movie ever","review":"Oh my gosh I cannot believe so many thought this was a good film. Stanley Kubrick knew how to show on the screen man through the ages. This was the worst waste of people's time I could think of. Yes art is in the eye of the beholder. I aknowledge this is art but for me it is bad film making. What plot? This is as far from a normal film as can be made. I stayed until the end to give it every chance to redeem itself. Until now I thought Trip to Bountiful was the most boring film I had ever seen. This was far worse. Don't waste your hard earned money buying this DVD or seeing it in the theater. There are so many better movies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the usual story telling method","review":"I guess there was a story in this movie. It seems like the director & screenwriter were trying to do a Kubrik-esque kind of movie, and in my opinion, failed miserably. If your kind of movie is one with a lot of nice visuals of just about everything under the sun with classical music playing in the background, this movie is for you. If you prefer movies with a plot and character development, you might want to take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my .99 cents back","review":"Sorry to say, but I didn't like this movie. It was a noble attempt at making a movie with deep thoughts but I couldn't handle the split personality of the scenes from cosmos to earth which represent the grace and nature theme the director was attempting to recreate. Also story libe was just too sad for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I rate this for less than one star????","review":"This movie has been added to my list of the absolute lousiest movies I have ever seen... This is two hours of mainly ethereal, abstract, wildly absurd, funky cinematic junk...the worst I have ever endured. A flimsy thread of a plot about poor parenting tries to hold it together....but regardless of the poor parenting and wildly absurd National Geography type photography of sand drifts, stone scapes,sun bursts,blowing grass,etc....the movie still sucks.Did I mention I thought is was a total waste of time, not to mention, my five bucks!!!! Gees....How do I get my money back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"With the actors listed, and the description of the storyline, you'd think this would be a very special, well done movie. However, when the scenes kept switching out to very weird lava flows, dinosaurs and views of the cosmos, we actually thought the stream was malfunctioning. Think cross between a National Geographic special and a Hallmark channel movie. Separately, it works - together, not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tip: Google \\"Job 38\\" first","review":"I loved this movie, and am sitting down to watch it again, right now.I urge all people who this movie is \\"for\\" (- and that is not everyone) to Google and read the passage of \\"Job 38\\" before viewing, or a repeated viewing. It's a beautiful passage, no matter your religious beliefs, and really explicates the \\"Cosmos\\" scenes in this Masterpiece of a film.I know I will be viewing this film for years, as its impact - like \\"Wild Strawberries\\" is apt to change as \\"we\\" age.The film hasn't changed.We have...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and boring","review":"Thought this would be a great movie, not painful hour after hour of watching a man walking around looking at the sky.

Oh god, no."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"My husband and I both found this movie painfully slow and unconvincingly acted. We hung on, hoping that a good story could move it along, but the subplots (or what we thought might be subplots) went nowhere. I normally don't write reviews for Amazon, but I rely on them heavily. Therefore, when I saw that the only 2 reviews written for this item were so glowingly enthusiastic, I felt it my social responsibility to warn would-be customers. If you are curious about this movie, borrow it from the library, or even rent it - but please don't spend 17.99 for your own copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen, it was so bad I'm actually writing a review and I have never done this before. The plot line was so bad it was actually shocking, but the acting was below the standards of some adult films (mostly the main character). I did not pay anything to see this movie and felt like I was cheated. If you spend $17.99 on it I'm positive you will regret it. I don't know what movie the two people who gave it a 5 star rating were watching, but trust the 1 star people because this movie sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"Even though I had read the other one-star review, I had to purchase it anyway, for I had been an Extra in the cocktail party scene, so I wanted my own copy to add to my acting reel. The creators of the film promised all of us that they would send us a copy of the finished product as soon as it was ready to be released. After contacting several people and realizing that they had duped us, I had to purchase my own copy, which I did not appreciate. Back to the film: I'm embarrassed to have been a part of it, for the acting was very sub-par, especially the overabundance of corny, cutesy lovey-dovey scenes. But my negative opinion definitely does not include Vincent Curatola, Christopher Noth,Tony loBianco or the great Thom Christopher (who was not even mentioned in the credits) who I adore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definite Favorite in Our House","review":"This book has become a huge favorite with my 3 year old. He loves to look at the pictures, even on his own - he'll just sit and study them. It's a fun book to read, and has a good storyline. It's also allows quite a bit of interaction.

She has researched the philosophical and poetic background--Cowper, Gilpin, Rousseau, Repton and others--of the late 1700s and early 1800s to help the reader understand the literary climate that influenced Jane's own written portraits of life in her time. I particularly enjoyed the warm pictures she painted of Austen family life--as the Austens worked in their gardens and walked through their shrubberies . . Mavis connects each of Jane's books with Jane's response to the familial and intellectual landscape of the correlating time. And she does all this without wearying us. I think this is one book about Jane of which Jane would approve. I also found it in my university library, and I want it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vital Information for the Serious Scholar","review":"I checked this book out of my university library several times and finally had to buy it. Batey's scholarship is thorough and impeccable. I have turned to the book as a resource repeatedly, and also have joyfully read the work for the sheer pleasure of it. If you need to know about Gilpin and the Picturesque, Austen and the Rousseau connection, or the Responsible Landlord in Austen's novels, get this book for your reference shelf. A must for serious Janites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must hear","review":"Frustrated by the clinical environment of recording studios, the nomadic Swiss (keep in mind he has gypsy ascent) solved his problem by setting his recording place in a real casino in the Swiss Alps. Other than the title of his 5th long play, he got a somehow woody and intimate ambiance out of it, one that fits his songwriting perfectly. For the second time, he benefits of lyrics written by French novelist Philippe Djian whose everyday's poetry on songs such as \\"Déjeuner en Paix\\" or \\"Pas d'Ami Comme Toi\\" brings a real extra to Eicher's world and two of his biggest hits. Managing to cover Hank Williams (\\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\") as well as J.S. Bach (\\"Jésus que ma joie demeure\\", I'll let you find by yourself where he included it.) Eicher proves to be more than a simple pop/rock singer, a true artist. All of this make of Engelberg a complete artistic succes where serenity walks hand in hand with what I'd call a discreet melancholy. A must hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and refreshing","review":"Stephan Eischer is Swiss, and his music reflects the modern multi-cultural influences in Switzerland today. He sings in English, French, and Swiss-German on this album. The music evokes the rural countryside (cowbells in 'Es Ist Alles'!), the U.S. pop music influence ('I'm so lonesome I could Cry'--with an accent), thoughtful acoustic balladeer in 'Tu ne me dois rien' (you don't owe me a thing), and Mediterranean fury in 'Dejeuner en Paix'. His voice sounds natural, neither over-produced nor obscured by the varied arrangements. I used to live in Switzerland, which is how I learned about his music. Give it a try. Pleasant pop with a European twist and some interesting lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Malevolent creation is one of best death metal bands!!","review":"I discovered malevolent creation in the movie CkY2k which is bams famous vidoes.

It is completely disjointed, the characters make no sense at all and there is a kind of claustrophobic aimlessness to the film that is difficult to describe. There is no story line and absolutely nothing happerns for ages. I just do not understand the scene where the two teenagers are openly laughing at eating an animals insides...this is like a bit of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Then you have Ian Smith (Harold from neighbours), what's he doing in this?Utter total rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"One of the worst films ever. I consider myself to be fairly knowledgable in the realm of horror movies, even those played for laughs, but this one is just awful. Nothing happens for the first hour of the movie. When the \\"special effects\\" do finally show up, they are terribly fake and cheesy looking. Unintentionally hilarious, in fact. I get the attempted point of the film, one of scientific experimentation gone awry, it was just completely botched. There is no need for anyone to waste their time on this piece of crap. It is truly terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz for the classical listener","review":"Garden of Spaces is very nice. Well-written, solidly-performed.Cantus Articus is fine. Although this performance is as good as any -- and far better than the other two I've heard -- I'm just not sophisticated enough (maybe) to listen to the bird noises. They bug me. Just a personal issue, I know, but I can't handle it.But the Clarinet Concerto is out of this world. Truly. Personally, I feel this piece in a jazz sense. Don't get me wrong -- it doesn't swing or have cheesy blues riffs. Instead, if you've ever understood a really fine jazz performance, this recording will ring true. Stoltzman plays so fluidly and honestly he could be improvising. The orchestral structure is perfect -- complex, beautiful and exciting. Rautavaara manages to keep a tonal feel while stretching harmonies. Overall, it feels like the sophisticated version of Stan Getz's \\"Focus.\\" If you are trying to convert a friend from jazz to classical, give them this work. Unreal."},{"rating":"1","title":"What volume?","review":"Although I love the Pure Abundance shampoo and conditioner, i can do without this product. I see no difference in volume.

It is still very nice and suits our needs regardless of the shortfall in thickness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pad - good price","review":"I haven't tried any others, but I have the regular size of this and it pretty much does the job. The suede-like finish on the top is very pleasing to the touch, and the pad inflated OK. The regular size is around 2 lbs.One thing that wasn't immediately obvious, at least to me, is that the bigger sizes (than regular) are also thicker. Something to keep in mind just in case you need a little extra support.I'm 6'1\\" and I'm happy with the regular size since I also use a separate pillow.

I used this while traveling across the country and staying at different houses each night for two weeks. I did not have a bad night of sleep any of those nights.

I highly recommend the pad.The shorter length version would be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pad, very well constructed","review":"Yes, this pad takes a very long time to inflate the first time it is opened. I left them on the ground for several hours before they completely inflated the first time. However, they are surprisingly comfy for camping. My boyfriend and I slept on them no problem for 3 nights in a row.

Shadow, named because of the way he used to follow his brother around, has enough going on in his life as he begins High School, and things are further strained in the Thompson household by the fact that Daniel has been accused of murder. With Shadow, his mother and father, each reacting in different ways to Daniel's return Rottman vividly portrays the intense, and sometimes contradictory, emotional journey that the stress of Daniel's return causes on each of the four family members. Teenagers will be able to relate to Shadow's excellent narration.

The protagonist Dr. Grant blunders about in a plotline that is so weak that Huyler fails to deliver a conclusion. This book goes absolutely nowhere, and I regret the time I invested in reading it through to the end. The blurbs promise a medical thriller like The Hot Zone or Darwin's Radio, but Huyler's novel is a paltry wanna-be.

Unlike the other negative reviewers who found the first two thirds of the book adequate, I found the entire book to be an amateurish attempt to write like Hemingway: short, staccato sentences, laden with deep meaning but in Huyler's case, signifying almost nothing. I enjoyed the excellent descriptions of medical procedures in the office and the hospital (I'm an MD) and kept expecting an interesting, even if fictional, medical solution. Instead, the book ends with nothing resolved. Frustrating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't pleased!","review":"This happens everytime. The professional mixers extend the song too far!

Cher's song Believe captures every womens heart whether they know it or not. Every women relates to this song and if they haven't yet, they will sometie in the future. And her song Strong Enough, I think that every women amd man should listen to this song at least once, it is saying you can be strong and you rule your life and you make the choices, and what you say...GOES!!!I urge everone to listen to this CD, glance at the titles and select one that suits the mood that your in, there is a song for everyone on this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shake your groove thing!","review":"Although the hit single Believe carries the album and it's theme is displayed throughout the CD, the album is a very good dance album.

Cher is more an actress than a singer. Her voice is very weak, furthermore this song sounds like a disco 70s retread, trying to recapture the popularity of \\"I Will Survive\\", but the song has no structure to say the least and is definitely one of the weaker songs on Chers \\"Believe\\" CD.

After viewing it, I knew it wasn't just \\"another space documentary\\". It was deeper than that. It was in my words, a \\"space age gangster flik\\". I say this because the whole concept of pushing the envelope and successfully launching a privately funded space station under the radar of NASA & the government was just too smooth! Plopping down huge amounts of cash , putting it all on the line for the sake of introducing space travel to the masses. All of this & doing so \\"privately\\" without government intervention... well that was the plan. What a concept!Michael Potter's vision was truly multidimensional. Throughout the movie there was a consistent layer of \\"techie & science\\" but underneath the veil lies the real concept..Space entrepreneurs, space geeks, conspiracy theorists, or just curious, all have a place enjoying this film & I recommend it for your viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book has been very helpful for me in writing my novel.

But after watching it again, man were Richard Widmark and Sidney Potier slumming. I had always rated it on the same level as Kirk Douglas' The Vikings not even close. Really hoky, poor costuming, acting a real low level. I guess it was most done to show off Richard's legs for the most part. Viking ship in the wide sceens obviously a model. I guees this one should have remained a memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but STILL incomplete.","review":"I have to agree wholehartedly with E.E. Gurango in regard to the missing footage from this film. Also, the preceeding harem dance was a bit of a flagraiser for a young lad too, and with the release of this version, the footage no longer exists in the 70mm master either. this is another obvious example of political correctness. when I was younger,at the time of the films release,the only prints that were cut were the 16mm. prints,and the TV. print (eventually) But the 70mm. and the 35mm. prints were complete. It's really annoying when this happens and I feel that if the missing footage has'nt been restored by now, it never will. I've been chasing it for decades.But, all things considered, it is a magnificent transfer from the Technirama 70 neg. and the sound is crisp and clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"After reading some of the reviews and with Sidney Poitier and Richard Widmark, I was expecting a good old fashioned movie. I am pretty well able to enjoy any of the old movies but this one was terrible.

A great Viking adventure with a very young Sidney Poitier and (I always liked the guy)Richard Widmark. Paced well and a decent enough plot but mostly its Vikings in Viking ships.

I own it on VHS, but it would be a great full-screen epic to watch on DVD if it becomes available! Sidney Poitier is excellent as the Saracin lord who is obsessed with the legend of the Golden Bell! Richard widmark has always been one of my favourite actors, and this picture is non-stop thrills,from his daring escape at the beginning of the picture to his;and his viking cohorts brush with \\" the mare of death \\" (Sids' unique way of dispatching his enemies), near the end.

To start off, the two brothers steal the Norse King's funeral ship; kidnap the King's dauhter: then, they battle a mutinous crew; and finally, they face opposition from the resident Moores. The all-star cast thatbrings this action-packed adventure: The two brothers are played by Richard Widmarkand Russ Tamblyn; the Moorish opposition is led by Sidney Poiter.

I tried skipping to the meatier stuff later in her life; still could not quite muster up the empathy needed to relate to this woman. Her life was no doubt tragic and sad, but I was not moved.

It does have some value in that both males and females in our society are having to cope with changing gender roles and their attitudes towards traditional roles must be altered to a degree. This is something that the public has not heard a great deal about . . . we have often heard of the plight of females having a hard time in their roles of mother, provider, employee and wife in that they often feel conflicts as to how to remain \\"feminine\\" while using traditionally masculine traits that are necessary in today's work environment.

I bought these to replace my original 680 EL cartridges (the pre-mounted headshells were of particular interest), and after comparing between the new and old, was disappointed at the inability of the Trackmaster's to reproduce sibilants (words with S's, Ch, etc.) accurately. A few records were completely unplayable due to the distortion in the mid-range areas. Since both of the cartridges exhibited the same behaviour, I have to assume it's inherent in the cartridge. I'm back on my old 680's until something else comes along."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important and powerful film on a vital issue.","review":"The film takes you right into the minefields of Cambodia -- you follow deminers as they attempt to clear the more than 8 million mines in the country. The film crew also followed Khmer Rouge mine laying operations, producing extraordinary sequences. The film shows clearly, however, that there are not \\"good\\" mines and \\"bad\\" mines -- they all are a danger innocent civilians long after the war is over. One soldier is horrible injured by a mine laid by his own army. A beautiful 17 year old girl looses a foot cutting firewood. The film also follows the battle to ban landmines. Since this film was made, a treaty was signed, but the US has not signed and the mines are still in the ground. The camera work is beautiful (particularly in the Cambodian countryside), and you can't help but be moved by issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Fab Barbara Stanwyck","review":"I have never seen any of Barbara Stanwyck's movies.

The professor of my class is a grad of Indiana University, which is where one of the authors (Pepinsky) teaches. The book really takes a hard look at some misconceptions that the general public may have about crime. I noticed that the other reviewer used it in a class as well, but this is not a textbook. It's thoroughly readable and enjoyable. It's also something that you can go back to and read again, as I have done just recently and see how the book stacks up to the news about crime you hear today.

It gives you the nutritional breakdowns which is nice, and compares them to the same products made with sugar. She uses healthy ingredients, but not much in the way of whole grains.

None of the recipies include other sugar sources which is nice to see in a stevia cookbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answered most of my questions","review":"Well worth the money. User friendly.

That is the best part of the book; and perhaps the book tastes better than the recipes. I tried making the chocolate chip cookies and the brownies (twice) and both turned out very egg-y. The texture was more souffle-like and pretty gross; it is not the \\"cake like\\" consistency the author claims it to be. I even made the brownies a second time-- using less eggs; same result. Needless to say, I was disappointed and will continue my search for good stevia dessert recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not actually low-carb","review":"I bought this book thinking it was a low-carb stevia cookbook (as the title indicates); however, it uses wheat flour. The only thing that makes it low-carb is that the recipes use stevia instead of sugar. To me, that is not low-carb. It is probably a good cookbook if you only desire to use stevia to replace sugar in your recipes, as there is an art to using stevia. You can't just replace the sugar with stevia; you have to add some bulk, such as apple sauce or some extra liquid, etc. The book has lots of recipes that sound very tasty, but I needed a cookbook that was also wheat-free so this wasn't the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor luck baking with Stevia","review":"This is the second stevia baking book I have tried. Did not have good luck with this one or the other one. Stevia seems to work when baking with fruit as a supplement to the sweetness, but I have not been successful with chocolate cake or brownies. My tastebuds get two sensations, first of bitter unsweetened cocoa, then an aftertaste of sweetness, but these two do not seem to come at the same time.

One day while at work, I rushed thru lunch and afterwards I felt awful but I had to get back to work. I was sluggish and a friend asked if I were okay. I told her I had eaten too fast and my tummy was upset. She had these papaya enzymes in her purse and gave me three of them. I chewed them and within twenty minutes, I felt so much better. I went home and ordered them immediately. I chew these everyday and my digestive system feels so much better. I have issues with my tummy often and these are the answer.

I now have my hubby chewing them after a meal as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think these taste great, chew them after every meal","review":"Believe it or not, a car salesmen told me about these - not this brand, but digestive aids in general.

I'm chewing them to make sure I get the most out of the food I eat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should state \\"Papaya-flavored antacid\\"","review":"The last ingredient is papaya flavors (see list later). Everything else seems to just make an antacid. Probably works great for that, if that's what you're after. I wasn't. Sure would beat mint or other 'fruity' antacids--so I would highly recommend if you need it. The tablets are very small--I would say 2 or 3 would compare to one small tablet of a competitor. Bright white, with a slight off-putting smell, but they do taste great--just like papaya. I think I'd have to eat dozens to get any papaya benefit though. On the label everything is listed as \\"Other Ingredients\\" which are: Sucrose, Calcium Carbonate, Vegetable Stearic Acid, Vegetable Magnesium Stearate, Corn Starch, Papaya Flavors. 157mg calcium, 45mg Papain, 6mg Protease, 3mg Papaya Fruit (Carica papaya)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for the sweeteners","review":"Tastes OK, but each papaya enzyme product contains different sweeteners. This one contains sucrose, the \\"bad\\" sugar. My wife feels nauseous right after taking these (sensitive to sweets) so we ditched it and are moving on to another brand. Mannitol, another sweetener used by American Health, is known to cause diarrhea if you are sensitive to it, so be careful which papaya enzyme product you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Papaya Enzymes for my dogs and my family","review":"Whenever our dogs get a tummy upset or when we do, we use this product and it works great.

If I remember correctly, Bronc played baseball (usually pitched) for tiny Sonora in New Mexico. They typically competed against teams from larger and more notable New Mexico cities such as Deming, Raton, etc. I think my favorite book was \\"Legion Tourney.\\" I was totally into athletics at that time and Wilfred McCormick's series fed my appetite.Other sports fiction books that I thoroughly enjoyed -- during my youth -- were, \\"Floorburns\\" by John F. Carson (basketball, 1967), and \\"Perfect Game\\" (baseball, I can't recall the author). All deal with overcoming adversity with lots of character development/transformation. These were truly innocent times when sportsmanship and redemption truly meant something."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This book was my introduction to goddess craft back in the '80s.

It was tortuously slow, tedious and pretentious. I did not care about the characters.

I found myself skipping entire sections of the book to try to get to interesting points. All in all--a disaster"},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychobabble","review":"I couldn't finish this book. It did nothing for me. I was bored from the start. No insights into the human psychic in my opinion, nothing of any value about men at war. The Movie was even worse. Compared to Saving Private Ryan, it couldn't hold a candle. You can show the stark reality of warfare and still maintain the dignity of the men who fought and died. It's distasteful to diminish the memory of these men because of acts of savagery. In Warfare men fight to survive, you can't hold that against them. Humanity is the missing factor when forced to kill or be killed. I do not recommend this book or the Movie unless you like psychobabble. Although the Movie version of \`From Here to Eternity' is certainly one of the finest.

It is well worth the money if you are a Foo Fighters fan, just don't expect to be amazed and thrilled with the entire album like you were with their first two albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy protection prevents legal uses...","review":"I really wanted to buy this disc, but after reading some comments on the copy protection posted on the web, I had to take it out of my cart. As I understand from what I read, the copy protection prevents you from ripping it to your computer, and in turn from loading it on your MP3 player or making a compilation disc which includes music from this CD -- all perfectly legal uses of a music CD under the Home Recording Act. So, basically, although I would have been paying full price for this CD, the bundle of rights I would normally get with it would be artificially limited by the copy protection technology on it. As all my music plays from my PC into my stereo, or in my MP3 player at the gym or while traveling, this disc would be virtually useless for me. I understand the company's desire to protect what they created, but not at the expense of my legal enjoyment of the CD. Maybe if they lose enough sales this way, they'll stop this annoying practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've got three words for you - DO NOT BUY","review":"SEND a message to the greedy record companies and DO NOT BUY to prevent this from happening to other records.

Musically, the record is great. If you like the Foo Fighters, go and buy this but the whole copyright protection thing kills it for me.

Why is it then that in order for me to rip this to my PC \\"legally\\" I now have to go to itunes (or a similar online music store) and, purchase it again. I know there are work arounds for this issue but after I already own the CD, why should I have to go through the trouble?

Foo Fighters should be ashamed to have any part in this scandle to sell more albums. Plus you if you want to listen to the album seperatley on the ipod, you have to buy it twice. Once for your cd car player and another time for your mp3/ipod player. I thought it was supposed to be about the music, not just about ripping people off for more money.

Why? \\"Because you may have copied the songs.\\" I politely pointed out to a manager that the CD is copy-protected so they can't fall back on that excuse.

I have tried, but I can find no redeeming qualities to either of these CDs. I don't know how Foo Fighters could follow up a great album like One by One with such a repetive, non-melodic, badly produced group of songs. The songs all have too much base and sound muffled. There are few if any catchy melodies, and never throughout the whole songs. Then there's the copy protection. On mine, it appears on the acoustic CD. It is obnoxious and makes it diffiult to put songs my iPod or copy them to a mixed CD. Since I have no desire to listen to the songs again, am not trying too hard. I am a musician, so do not support stealing music; but if I want to copy a song from a CD I paid for onto a mixed CD or iPod, I should not have a problem doing it.

The second disc is most certainly not only appropriate for birthday parties after the Dido disc finished...that's almost an insult.

The \\"geniuses\\" who invented this software should be tarred and feathered, and artists better wake up and start refusing to release CDs that have this software on them. Basically, the record companies are making us MAD, and we're all just going to go buy the albums at iTunes in MP3 format. Then we'll see how they like having warehouses full of unsold copy-protected CDs. The clue phone is ringing, Record Industry, and it's for YOU. Get out of your flippin' ivory towers and come down here and live with the rest of us for a while. Somehow you'll still be able to afford the payments on your yachts and Lear jets.

This means if you want to transfer your music from the CD onto your ipod, or copy the music to your computer , you have to agree to a TOS, and install big brother's software.If you are satisfied with poor quality 128kbps m4ps from itunes, then go ahead and give in and shell out your ten bucks and download it.

They could have insisted the cd not be relased that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a pretty decent cd","review":"Just because this cd is \\"copy protected\\" doesn't mean you can't make copies. I have bought other cds that are so called copy protected and I had no problems importing them into my i-pod. Once you copy the cd into your i-tunes folder you can make as many copies as you like. Not that I'm endorsing the pirating of cds. I just think we should be able to make copies for our own personal use. Those of you who are against cd copying let me ask you this: how many times have you bought a cd for one song and the rest of it sucked?If bands want us to stop copying their cds they need to start making better music. This cd is a fine example of a great band in it's prime. If you decide to actually buy this cd I don't think you will be disapointed. The second disc is kinda slow. but it's still ok. I can definitly see a lot of hit singles coming off this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are you people supporting copy protected CDs?!","review":"I love the Foo Fighters and have all their CDs but I am not buying this CD. Because it is copy protected I can't put it on my Ipod. You've got to be kidding.

I just want to put it on my Ipod and not have to pay for it twice by buying the CD and then paying again to purchase this CD via Itunes. That is just plain not right.

I was all ready to buy it from amazon when I saw the reviews indicating the fact that this CD is copy protected in a manner that it wont work with my Ipod. Due to this fact I gave the CD a 2 star review. A CD that does not have the flexibility to allow me to listen to the music I purchased any way I want to is simply useless to me no matter how good the songs are. I simply will not spend my hard earn money on an item that will limit the way I want to use it after I have paid for it legally. I hope other artist, labels and websites get smart and stop this nonesense of trying to control the way customers want to enjoy music. Stop trying to blame us for the declining sales figures for the music Industry and start looking within the Music Industry itself.

Each song that went by I was getting more excited about how the album rocks with great grooves, riffs, tightness, and also melody emotion and sweet harmonies. Wow- a lot of new ideas here- and the drumming is totally bad ass- The single, Best of You, is not the best song here- many others to listen and rock out to,I have only listened to the first two tracks on Disc 2 but I already love it- I have been waiting for Dave to do this, knowing it would be welcome change for him-I am a musician and a recording engineer and I just in awe of Dave Grohl's talent-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never underestimate the poor taste of the masses","review":"I just heard an NPR story on the issue of DRM & cd copying and they played some of this.

The first thing I do when I buy a new CD is rip it to my computer, not to share it with others, but to listen to it myself. I only listen to music on my computer, and therefore, it only makes sense to have mp3 copies of it.

Standout's on the first disc include \\"Best of You,\\" \\"Resolve,\\" \\"DOA,\\" and \\"No Way Out.\\" The second acoustic disc showcases Grohl as an extraordinary vocalist. The guitar duo of Chris Shifflett and Grohl come into their own as guitarists. Tracks such as \\"Over and Out,\\" \\"Friend of a Friend,\\" and \\"On the Mend,\\" are among the best Foo Fighters songs recorded.

The first CD is classic Foo Fighter style. The songs are good, solid rock - just what you'd expect from the Foo Fighters. CD two is acoustic. It isn't what you'd expect. It is good to see a band step outside the box and do something new and unexpected. So while I applaud the Foo Fighters for stepping out of the box, I found the second CD completely lame. The songs were unmelodic and uninspiring. There was no punch, no life. If you want solid rockers doing acoustic the right way pick up the last Godsmack CD or take a step back in time about a decade and pick up an acoustic version of Alice in Chains. The verdict here is download the best and forget the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Get Fooled Again","review":"Articles in the papers and Sony-owned media outlets are telling us that this and a couple of other albums released with this abominable copy protection are selling as well as forecast.

Now after all these years of being a solo artist, Art has a small folio of songs that were minor hits. As a folk singer(which is what S&G were after all), it is not surprising that he is not a top 40 star. His songs, especially as a solo artist, are more traditional, laid back, and simple. The \\"wall of sound\\" that characterize our modern FM pop hits is not evident; a simple guitar or piano accompaniment is all that was required for this performance.

I recommend it only for deep thinkers who also enjoy hearing every detail of volleyball games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weaking Writing","review":"There was no intensity or action I had come to expect from this difficult story's situation...but come on...a little more description would have scared readers and left them more intrigued.

For shame!","review":"As a middle school teacher and as a mother, I don't let my children or students use some of the language in this book. Why would I allow them to read it? The mother is a very poor example of what a mother should and should not do--smoking indoors around a baby and child and leaving an eight-year-old alone with a baby. There is no redeeming value in this book. I can't believe it won a Newberry Honor medal."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Jamie Saw","review":"The book I read was What Jamie Saw .I enjoyed the book for many reasons. The main reason I enjoyed the book was that it had a good story line that was very easy to follow. I felt the author did a good job writing the story, yet the author could have possibly used the character Van a little more. I feel the book reflects people's lives more than I know because in the book Van drank and hurt the baby. All in all I would recommend What Jamie Saw because of its content and how it was written. I can understand why it has been on the following book lists: Newbery Honor Book, 1996 National Book award finalist, ALA Notable Book, and Booklist Editors Choice. This selection is a good book for older readers and is a very enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Jamie Saw","review":"THis book has a lot of emotional fellings in it.

What I got was of the history behind some Arizona courses- who designed them, how design decisions were made, and other historical trivia. There is very little attention given to how each course plays, the amenities, or the conditions. There are a couple of descriptions of a few holes, but very little depth. The stories are somewhat interesting, and the photos are beautiful, but overall it does not deliver what golfers most likely expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing journey into the jungle","review":"Did you like kon-tiki? you wont want to miss this adventure documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and not very believable","review":"I purchased the book after hearing the author speak at a journalism conference.

Mayle returns to Provence and, unconfined by his self-imposed chronological organization of A Year in Provence, which went month-by-month, produces a delightful, anecdotal account of life in his adopted country. We get to hear about singing frogs, an attempt to train a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig to hunt truffles, as well as various wine-tasting festivities, and particularly a special party for Mayle's birthday that changes his mind about picnics once and for all.It's a delightful book, great for listening to in the car and almost certainly an entertaining light read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as great as A Year in Provence","review":"I didn't think that this book was quite as good as A Year in Provence.

In this book, Mayle shares his experiences and appreciation for this land and its people. Chapter by chapter, he shares little stories about his life there.

Reading this book is a treasured experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying Intermediate to Advanced Reading.","review":"Toujour Provence is very much similar to A Year in Provence but with new random tales of life in Southern France. It's the same delightful read, just as the first, peppered with good-humor and open-minded observations, all thoroughly described with a level of upper intermediate to lower advance level of reading. There are books that deceives the reader with 300+ pages of wordage, only to find oneself disappointed in how unbelievably easy and grade-school the story is approached and written. Not so with Peter Mayle. Then there are books that drone on and on, over-descriptive, over-wordy, takes too long to get to the point. Not so with Peter Mayle. You will be satisfied with the manner and level of how this book is written.*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant taste, ineffective relief for me","review":"In my personal experience, neither the liquid nor the tablets provided anything more than a very brief respite from heartburn.

It does not have the splashy special effects and camera work that is standard on most science presentations, but the sincere forthright manner of it's presentation is on target for reaching high school age students.

No illustrations just a very masculine woman an effeminate man with a rather large shiny earing and an old black man who talks about menstruation.The focus seems to be preventing STDs and AIDs and basically encourages your kids to think that \\"if it feels good - do it, you're normal, it's all OK\\"One intro discussion includes descriptions of the various kinds of very \\"normal\\" sex as anal, oral and vaginal.

He has one of the longest parts and he races along with an odd cadence. The older woman speaks slowly and well and more attention was paid to her and the younger woman speaking about planned parenthood. The Dr. (Urologist)seemed bored with the subject.There are many other DVD's out there that also show teens speaking about the peer pressure and need for education that had my audience rivited to the screen. As another reviewer said, this is a lecture on tape. There is no interaction with others, no questions from an audience are answered and even if I was a student interested in the subject, this video was too much information in too short a time, presented in a way that showed no creativity and created no interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie Music","review":"This is a great Jerry Goldsmith movie score.

Mixing an eastern sound with today's technology, this soundtrack has all of the themes....from desert battles to chase scenes, from horror to love themes, each track is an audio adventure that enhances the movie to its utmost. Goldsmith is right on par with John Williams, Trevor Jones and Wolfgang Korngold.

The maestro infuses The Mummy with an exotic \\"Wind and the Lion\\" flavor while fully developing ideas explored in The Shadow, The Edge, and Air Force One. The Mummy's action cues are as aggressive as those in Rambo 2, and track #8, \\"The Crypt,\\" oozes evil. Moreover, there's no filler here; each track matures musically as well as dramatically, providing a cohesive and immensely satisfying listening experience independent of the film. Not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"In your face\\" great film music","review":"With so much hype surroundung the Phantom Menace score it was with great surprise and pleasure that I found Jerry Goldsmith's score to The Mummy a truly tasty, popcorn-munching good time. Goldsmith revisits his ethnic flavored style from \\"The Wind and The Lion\\" and \\"Masada\\" to create this gorgeously romantic action adventure score. At 57 minutes it is never a bore... to the contrary the score continually outdoes itself as it progresses. The last 3 cues are hammering and breathless, full of brutual percussion, bellicose brass and a deft blend of all out action and horror creepiness. Get it if you love good old-fashioned film scoring. It's a gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Music Without Enough Variety","review":"This soundtrack by Goldsmith falls into the age-old soundtrack trap: repetative tracks. There are very few themes in this one. Although it is a catchy one and exciting (for a time), I feel like Goldsmith scratched the score out at the last minute and decided not to go the extra mile. Download this one as an MP3 and save your money.

The music was boring and unpleasant.Although I am still waiting to see how it fits to movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goldsmith's Mummy","review":"Jerry Goldsmith truly gives satisfaction in his score for \\"The Mummy\\". The love theme truly sounds marvelous, with a sincere Egyptian air that really touches, particularly in 'The Sand Volcano' where the theme is better exploited. The action music is a very good trait on this album, especially in 'Tauger Attack' and 'Crowd Control'. However, the only thing that troubles me about this CD is the theme for Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser's character), which sounds like the Alan Quartermain theme from \\"King Solomon's Mines\\", one of Goldsmith's most tiresome scores. All in all, you can be satisfied with this work from Jerry Goldsmith, who tries to give class to a very entertaining film."},{"rating":"2","title":"For some reason this score has been called Goldsmith's best","review":"work in recent years while others say its one of his worst. For my money this is oneof the composer's most dynamic and satisfying works written during the last decade of his life. Parts of the score reminds me of his 1969 score for a little known filmcalled \\"Justine\\" that also took place in Egypt. Goldsmith's style was much differentback then, of course, but there are similarities in orchestration.\\"The Mummy\\" is a powerhouse score and is well worth having. It may not be as good as his magnificent \\"The Wind and the Lion\\" but its miles above the crap that passesfor film music nowadays. I recommend it with no problem. Goldsmith's name alone is usually enough for me to go on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Men, The Mummy, The Movie, The Music","review":"For women like me who were swept away by the fantasy and the male cast's fabulousness in the blockbuster hit \\"The Mummy\\", the music to the soundtrack provides good background music fora long boring day at a computer.While the sequel to the Mummy was a disappointing \\"money grabber\\", this soundtrack will remind those who love it still why they found it so fun, funny and appealing. Romantic, intense and all around tinged with a hint of terror, the soundtrack brings you back to the rosy golden sands of the Sahara. One wonders why they opted for bad commercialism and sucker bets like \\"The Scorpion King\\" when Evy and Rick could have had adventures a la Indiana Jones over at least 3 movies...Oh well, relive this gem and dream of Oded, Arnold, Brendan and wish that YOU too could walk like Ank Sun Amun into a room wearing only gold body paint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOM","review":"I loved it.

It begins slowly, a lone stringed instrument with light choir and low strings. Bang! drums, brass, thumping sounds that you put with the amazing Cairo scene from the film. Following this is the tragic, yet sinister love theme for Imhotep and Anak Sanu Mun.

They are filmed out in the wild over an extended period of time and document actual events, but Disney embellishes the facts a bit with a story written to entertain. Sadly, their narrator doesn't appeal to me.Very well filmed and put together. My only gripe that loses a star is the Samuel L Jackson narration. I don't know why he is so popular. I can't stand him!! There were points early on where I just wanted to mute the movie and watch in silence, but I suffered through.I suppose Jackson is good at what he does, but he is no James Earl Jones. That is to say, Jackson can't fit into just any setting for narration. The \\"parents's\\" book \\"Go the F to Sleep\\" on the other hand-- was the perfect narration project for Jackson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated for the Forced Blu-ray Combo Pack","review":"What is with you distributors?

Although this story can - and is - enjoyed without the annotations, this version is a rich companion to the various other popular versions. It is also a fine looking volume. As to the story, we would be hard pressed to find people not familiar with A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, due to several movies the novel has spawned. I finally sat down and read the novel and am glad I did. The novel by the prolific and popular Dickens is well-written with great characters. That the author can generate such imagery and fully-realized characters in such a short story, is a testament to his staying power. This book packs an emotional punch, and is a great tale for the holidays, or any time you need to remind yourself to be thankful for what you have and those around you.

She's suffering from short-term amnesia around the event, but is certain that that couldn't be true-- she had been dissatisfied with her relationship herself. Why would she try to kill herself over a relationship she would have been relieved to have ended? The question becomes more than academic when the pair turn up murdered, and the question is how much Jinx really remembers...The book kept me reading, and fascinated. Jinx was a strongly drawn character and conflicted enough that you buy the fact that people have doubts about her innocence. The ending was unfortunately disappointing for being overly convoluted. It may not live up to the standard of The Scold's Bridal, but it's a well-written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Suspenseful Read","review":"I have read several books by Minette Walters and rate this as one of her best. The main character, Jinx Kingsley, has amnesia after a car accident and we are left wondering (as Jinx is)about her involvement in some pretty gruesome murders. A great concept, well handled by the author to create a suspenseful read.The characters are interesting and the pace is good. The only reason I have not given it a five star rating is that I felt that the ending was a bit too happy and optimistic - out of character for some of the personalities in the story.If you have read and enjoyed any of Minette Walters' books before, then you will not be disappointed with The Echo. If you have not read one of her books, this is a good first read. If you like The Echo, then try The Ice House and the Sculptress as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Room by Minette Walters","review":"This is a great story with very interesting characters, (a must for me). Her plot unfolds in a way that keeps you guessing, her ending has shock value but is entirely credible. Once you start this, you won't want to put it down. I liked it as much as another great story of hers, named The Ice House."},{"rating":"2","title":"another masterful match with skill of Harlen Coben!","review":"The heroine, Jinx, wakes up in a psychiatric-rehab hospital. She is recovering from a terrible auto collision. She is missing her short term memory of a few weeks. Her long term memory is intact. She knows who everyone is. So this is different from the typical amnesia novel and more believable because of it. Although she is alive, others are not, including the the now reopened murder of her first husband from a few years ago. Interestingly, it is her wealthy father who is the chief suspect in that murder. She herself suspects him and her father suspects her of being the culprit! They also loom as the most likely suspects when more murders turn up. There is a touch of romance in the story too with her psychiatrist. All in all an excellent read. Her who done its are NOT easy to guess who done it. They keep you working it out till the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long and repetitive","review":"I was interested in the plot and characters for about half the book. After that it seemed that little new information was added, or the little that was new came in the midst of much repetition. There were so many different characters, and we had to hear the separate reactions of each of them to bits of news. The structure of the tale reminded me of the way a police procedural might be played out on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth reading.","review":"Hints and clues abound, but the ending still carries some surprises. Characterization is uneven and it's hard to come away saying \\"I cared about x or y\\" -- but it's a complex psychological thriller and worth reading. One more-serious cavil: Walters plays fast and loose with her (mis)use of the term \\"existentialist.\\" I leave it to more erudite readers to critique this if they will. I just stuck it in the \\"jargon\\" box and went on to enjoy the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENGROSSING!","review":"I got the book at 11:00 a.m. today and read it nearly continuously all day (I finished it just beforemidnight!)As another reviewer mentioned, the only slight disappointment is in the ending.

It is brutally honest and a powerful insight to the falsehoods that Hollywood portrays, especially with her father, who should hang his head forever in shame, and attempts to abuse her to this day.

She talks about her mother's early life, very sad. Alot of early deaths & you start to understand why her mom had some of the problems she had. I know Ryan O'Neal can be charming in interviews but I never cared for him & after learning how he treated poor Joanna Moore (Tatum's mom) despite Joanna's hard childhood I dislike him even more. Overall the story is of course about Tatum's life (not sure what some reviewers expected) & yes there are many famous names, but if anything she proves that Hollywood celebs are not only not above anyone else , but they may be much more flawed than the \\"Average Joe\\". Who knows maybe that's why the end up searching for fame in Holllywood.

Many did not believe her story of abuse from her father and husband but after reading this book and given their histories I find it hard NOT to believe Tatum.

Reading this story made me realize why todays child stars (think Britney Spears) are in such a mess. Read this book and get the scoop on how it was to grow up as \\"Hollywood Royalty\\". It is definitely not the fairy tale story that you expect to read.

The book is decidedly impressive on many levels mainly its honesty and fluidity- reading with the cadence of a non-fictional thriller only this is a collection of real life experiences. While enthralling, the tone of the book is not overwhelmed by Hollywood gossip. As a result, I am confident that it can help many people who have struggled with drug addiction or have been abused in any way. Tatum finally finds her voice in this wonderful work."},{"rating":"1","title":"If US Weekly Became a Self-Help Book...","review":"It's difficult to criticize this autobiography, seeing as how Tatum O'Neal repeatedly endured hellish experiences, came out healthy, and wrote a very earnest book to document her struggles. She offers a tantalizing glimpse into her life--from her neglectful mother to her physically and emotionally abusive father, Ryan O'Neal, to the many women in her father's life (including Farrah Fawcett and Angelica Huston), to her battles with drug addiction, to her emotionally abusive marriage to John McEnroe. At times I questioned the veracity of her claims because they were so incredibly awful, but I believe that they are true. The parts that dish on other celebrities make this a very quick, entertaining read, but the self-help stuff and seemingly endless details about McEnroe's tournament schedules drag it down a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I should have felt sorry for Tatum with all that she went through as a child. But I found myself not believing most of what she said... not because I thought any of the people in her life were so great, she just does not come off as believable. Instead, she comes off as a spoiled-rotten, name-dropping brat.I can't believe I wasted as much time as I did reading this. I kept hoping there would be something redeeming in this book, but I felt absolutely nothing for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a whiner!","review":"I grew up loving Tatum O'neal.

She said that she never graduated high school but yet she sure does use some big words in this book. She lied so much in her youth I'm wondering how much of her story is really true.

WE KNOW SHE'S THE YOUNGEST WINNING OSCAR WINNER IN HISTORY after reading it a million times. Validation seems to continue to be a huge problem for Tatum, even at the conclusion of her book at age 41. Where on earth was the editor throughout this book? The 12 center to last chapters could have been completely skipped. America is totally aware of the dysfunctions of Ryan O'Neal and John McEnroe (several decades now -- yawn, yawn). I was hoping to read briefly about her rise to fame, her eventual fall, and more about her actual recovery and the lives of her children and how they actually functioned through all this.

I could have done without the endless poor me's and all the name dropping just to make herself seem more interesting.

This book should be used for toilet paper and nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me! Me! Oh poor me!","review":"Tatum needs to understand that there are many of us who have been through much worse without the benefit of money, mansions, and servants. I find it very hard to fathom that she lived in squalor with her mother without anyone noticing. I do beleive her father is a narcissistic coward who knows nothing about real life. I do not beleive that he punched Tatum. How come no one noticed the bruises on her face? He may have shoved her or hit in places unseen but I really doubt it. Ryan would not have wanted to damage his career in any way. Besides, Tatum could have reported her abuse to the police or better yet the press. What is she? Stupid? I think this book is an attempt to get sympathy. Well Boo Hoo lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"TATUM TELLS ALL, AND READS IT SUPERBLY","review":"Tatum O'Neal's story of her troubled life has been dissected, contradicted, and praised ad infinitum. The ultimate compliment may have come from Oprah who said of the bio, \\"It's hot, hot, hot!\\" It would seem that not a syllable could be added to what has already been written or said. However, my comments bear solely on her reading of this book.First off, her voice performance is superb (she is an accomplished actress). But, not only is her delivery flawless, there is an added impact in hearing this sad yet triumphant story told in her own voice. It becomes even more meaningful, and most listeners will find that they are at first deeply touched and then moved by the hope and strength manifested in her recovery.These are CDs you'll not only thoroughly enjoy but be eager to share with friends. All thumbs up for this reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Blaming Life..","review":"This book was a waste of time and money. Nobody has the perfect parents or the perfect childhood.

Lots of inside dirt to satisfy the celebrity hound. Heartbreaking that Tatum endured so much abuse at the hands of her parents and then went on to marry her father in the form of John McEnroe, if we are to take everything she says at face value. I know that her family (Ryan, Griffin and ex John) is appalled and denies what she purports. Whether or not her history is accurate, it is kind of sad that she must've felt like she had to purloin her past to make money.

She's a great mom (when she has custody, is not high, in rehab, or hanging out with her artist friends or personal trainers.) And, that her father is a horrible, horrible man - blamed for all of the failures in her life thus far (see \\"Paper Moon II\\" for future failures and blames.)PLEASE...I almost threw up in the middle of reading it, I thought it was just that bad.

However, what I respect most about this book is that the author exposes her own flaws in a way that a lot of folks would not have the courage to do. She acts out, is needy and a pest to more than a few people -- and she admits all of this. However, with the way she was raised, I don't see how one could expect a better outcome. In fact, few could manage what she had to endure without ending their lives. Her own parents didn't attend the Oscars to see her win best actress at age 8 because of their own dyfunction and jealousy. I hope every \\"stage mother\\" reads this book and seriously questions whether they want to put their child into this kind of industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational, courageous, great job Tatum","review":"I loved this book, as a survivor of childhood abuse and alchohol I identify with what she went through. It takes courage and fortitude to overcome a lifetime of abuse, addiction, lack of love and support - actually its a miracle she made it.

I didn't know much about her life other than I really enjoyed her in her adolescent movies. After having read the book, I don't even know what to say except that I hear an addict blaming everyone else for their problems. Is it possible that no one at all was ever nice to her? Even the ones that were nice to her, eventually did her wrong??? I was very disappointed in this book and consider it to be very whiny and unbelievable that it actually happened that way. I can see an addict continuously making the wrong choices, but at some point you have to take responsibility for your own life.

However, I'm sure it's meant to be more of an eye-opening look at familial addiction amidst the jungles of Tinseltown. It just comes off as phony and uninspiring, though many of my fellow amazon reviewers appear to disagree.

For anyone who was a fan of A Woman Scorned this book does not disappoint. This is the sequel to AWS telling the story of Jonette's brother.

It was refreshing that after they slept together they discussed where to go from there (what a concept), no big misunderstanding looming in the background. Did I mention how much I enjoyed the relationship between David and Cecelia? The book is worth reading alone just to meet Kimble the Valet. He's hilarious!

But, this time it was not. This book is not very romantic, nor interesting. The two main characters, Cecilia and Lord Delacourt, were not well developed, I am not sure even what they looked like, except for her breast size, and his handsomeness. There are many minor characters in the book that are more interesting than the main ones. The plot revolves around a mystery of some prostitutes getting murdered. In the end you don't really care who did it, nor do you through out the book. If not for the infrequent romantic moments the book would have been a total yawn.

It's not too bad, though.However, I have a major complaint with the durability of these jeans. The fabric is exceptionally thin; any time there is any stress on the seams, the stitches look like they're going to pop out. Plus, I wore them only once and there's already a hole in the fabric.

I thought, why is this so loose? So I looked at the bottom and it appeared to have some dust particles on it. I wiped the surface again & washed the pad with soap & water to make sure it was clean. Remounting it, I then laid my phone on top of it and headed for a 200 mile trip. With the sun beating down on my dash, the pad became so loose that I ended up placing it on my leather passenger seat (it says don't use on leather! - who has a car that doesn't have leather?

After the marvellous \\"Fist of God\\", this seemed written in a rush, contrary to all others Forsyth's books (I've read them all). The main character (Jason Monk) seems like a robot and everything seems so easy for him: travelling around the world, infiltrating the Russian Mafia, planning incredible plans.

THe proof of this fact is that he wrote, after this book and after a long time, a book about a different genre that he's used to (PHANTOM of THe Opera. This book is much worse than \\"FIST OF GOD\\". The main character, Jason Monk, wracks havov in Russia with extreme facility, make \\"contacts\\" even in a easier way, and resolve all the problems of Russia almost single-handed. As always, the characters act like robots without personality, but this isnot the poin, because this is one of Forsyth's ingredients to success. The history is weak, that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange sense of Deja Vu","review":"Though I like most of what Forsyth writes but this is definitely one of the books where Mr. Forsyth looks out of his touch a bit. The research as usual is brilliant but the Russian characters sounds very similar to the Devil's Advocate's character.The tone of the book is kind of slow and sluggish until Jason Monk takes over the main stage. All in all Mr. Forsyth doesnt traverse any unchartered territory. The plot and characters sound similar to his earlier books. Read it because the twists and turns in the end are neat or like for me I cant resist a Forsyth book but do not expect Jackal..."},{"rating":"1","title":"a primitive, if not naive view of Russia","review":"The Russia of this book is ridiculous. The author makes a pathetic attempt to deliver a story charged with ethical scruples, and drawing a sharp childish line between the Good and the Evil: consequently all characters are nothing but puppets, including the puppet masters. Today's Russia is a country very much in trouble, but it is unforgivable to dream, like the author seems to do, that the complexity could be resolved with a few coups de theatre, like restoring the monarchy in the country, or mounting a putsch through \\"skillful\\" disinformation and manipulation. Don't read it, even if you're stuck in an airport closed because of severe snowstorms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Genre work","review":"This is possibly my favorite Forsyth novel, and Forsyth is definitely my favorite spy-novelist. As in The Negotiator, this book has a somewhat disjointed flow - there's a great deal of set-up (half the book) that isn't really part of the rising action. But who cares - it's thrilling and fun, and Forsyth has a good ear for the language. First Rate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK BY FORSYTH'S STANDARDS","review":"ANy real Forsyth fan knows this is his worst book.

The background historical information was very informative, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Icon - One of Forsyth's best","review":"In a book that is fast-paced and hard to put down, Forsyth expertly weaves historical fact with modern-day fiction to create a plot that is wholly plausable. His chosen topic - modern day Russia - and its timing allows the novel to take on an extremely realistic feel which makes the book one of Forsyth's best efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best novel of Frederick Forsyth","review":"Much better than Tom Clancy's techno-thrillers ,this spy-novel is exciting.The plot is very attractive,because the Russian scenario is done in a realistic mode.I liked how Forsyth draws the the dramatic atmosphere of the ancient Soviet Union, declined and weak.The author proves that in a good novel the high-tecnology weapons aren't necessary for make a convincent story. I strongly recomend it for the people who liked like me Forsyth's \\"The day of the jackal\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful mix of fact and fiction!!!","review":"Forsyth writes an impressive book with an incredible mixture of fact and fiction. I have been to Russia and studied its history and economics; I was very impressed by Forsyth's accurate portrayal of the country. I enjoyed the complex journey from the beginning to the end. Unlike some, I liked the flashbacks and although the ending of the book seemed disapointing to some people, I thought it was fine. It was actually closer to what could possibly happen in reality than what other spy novels usually include. All in all, I thought this was one of the best novels I have read in a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense builds like a rollercoaster","review":"This Forsyth novel starts rather slowly but then takes off like a literary rollercoaster. No simple plot here; this story of how a cabal thwarts the election of a Russian despot-to-be, spearheaded by a former CIA master spy, is intricately plotted but doesn't lose the reader in a jumble of story lines. Obviously well researched, the background information is richly detailed in a way that enhances the story without bogging it down. Definitely a good read (and I see miniseries potential)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling view of a possible future Russia.","review":"Thrilling and very detailed work. Easy read.

Most armbands don't allow use of the Nike+ system.Nike has done a good job with improving this armband, but it is still difficult to get the iPod with the adaptor all the way into the pouch, and then you have to take out the ipod each time you want to download your run. (This is one reason why the Marware product is better). I'm considering cutting a slit in the bottom so that I can leave the ipod in the sleeve and just take out the adaptor to download or plug in the ipod.Otherwise, it's comfortable and fits well on my upper arm.

I finally picked up the first 6 movies for real cheap off Amazon, and bought this movie at a local store. The movie is suspenseful, and really doesnt rely on Pinhead at all. The movie lacked in places, and some scenes could have been cut down. Seeing Pinhead was a real treat, and the end was awesome.

It feels disjointed and contrived...possibly related to rumors I've heard of patchwork scripting. It's slow, badly written, and boring overall, with a painfully low-budget feel to it. It definitely doesn't bring anything new to the game. Avoid it, save yourself some time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best in the Hellraiser series.","review":"I thought this movie was awesome for a straight to DVD movie. Deader is somewhat low budget but is filmed in europe, so it looks much more authentic and a bit gothic. Also this movie has somewhat of an artsy David Lynch vibe to it, and I really appreciated that.The script is very good and engaging. The acting is mostly good. The plot is very interesting. The blood, special effects, and gore scenes are mostly excellent.This movie is about a journalist who investigates into a group called the deaders, run by an ancestor of the box maker, who made an appearance in the 4th Hellraiser movie. As you watch the movie you will find out how pinhead and the cenobites are related to the deaders.There is actually a bit of full frontal nudity and sexual scenes in this movie. So it is not for young teens.Is this movie better than Hellworld? Yes! It is much better. In fact this ranks as almost as good as the first two hellraisers.Very much suggested!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deader Cheddar","review":"Deader has it's moments; they are few and very far between.The plot jumps around alot, trying to give the sense of what may be a dream and what may be reality. I think if time was spent on the writing and a bigger budget was spent (maybe, $1,000,000 more), this would have been a better; if not a greater addition to the Hellraiser series than the last few films.Badly scripted, acted and under budgeted; the viewer doesn't need to be put through this type of hell.As it stands, the series is \\"deader\\" than this movie. There is no reason to make more Hellraiser \\"sequels\\", to do so would be an insult to the original, Mr. Barker and fans of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Goods","review":"Bought this DVD for a present to a friend.

And if you're a \\"true fan\\", you'll probably rent this anyway, despite all the mixed reviews on this page. I would suggest renting it, definately. I really liked it. It's good for like...I dunno.

While enjoyable and sometimes touching, it didn't make me feel like the movie would be as outstanding as I had heard,Boy, was I WRONG.The movie starts off in a similar manner to the mood through most of the series, then takes an unexpected turn. From there on, everything id cinema magic.I HIGHLY recommend.Though it is not really necessary to watch the show first, I would advise doing so and holding out till the end.

After looking over the reviews posted here, I would have to concur with the reviewer who observed that those who have given negative reviews of Kellmeyer's book really should point out at least one error of fact in Kellmeyer's book. It's all well and good to not like Catholicism, or not like the author's style or approach, or to prefer other Da Vinci Code debunkings to this one -- but it would be good to see something substantial in the objections lodged by the negative reviewers.

Nothing fresh, nothing illuminating, nothing even very convincing. In fact, after reading this book, I would be more inclined to believe Brown.

Very few, if any, of the \\"facts\\" presented in this book are undisputed, and yet he presents them as though they were common knowledge, and in most cases without even citing a source or an authority (other than himself). When he does cite a source, it's usually both selective and dubious: For example, he cites a fringe anti-environmentalist like Anna Bramwell in support of his notion that Wicca and Goddess worship were invented by the Nazis -- a strange choice to say the least.

Starbird, a Roman Catholic scholar, builds her case squarely from canonical Judeo-Christian Scriptures and is worth reading on that grounds alone.

We bought it as an introduction to opera for our homeschooled children, and never guessed we'd all enjoy it so much.All the tunes are ones you will probably recognize - but hearing the words that go with the music and hearing them in *English* is so helpful! It has been really fun to find out what these songs are really about.My kids and I often catch ourselves singing opera through the day now, which is really neat. It has helped build their understanding of music in many different ways, and has improved my oldest daughter's voice ability as she strives to keep up with the professional singers on the CD.The music is beautiful, the words are lovely and give meaning, and this whole CD is just exceptionally good entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally understand what these arias mean!!!","review":"I love this CD and can't wait to use it with my music students when school resumes.

However, I would never recommend this one, and it disappeared from his shelves. It seems gratuitously violent in many places. The page The Nasty Nasties bothers me most. It shows vampires, skeletons and bats. The vampires are drinking blood. It's just too gory, and I'd rather not have the pictures ingrained in my son's head. I am not the type of mother who usually complains about this stuff, but since I bought it on Amazon, I thought I might save someone else the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of entertainment","review":"My kids are not easily entertained, especially in the car, but this book captivates them for long stretches of time. My older son received it as a gift when he turned 4. He is 6 now and still get so much enjoyment out of it, as does his 4 year old brother.

However, I wasn't expecting it to be impossible to see. Even using the magnifying glass, along with my reading glasses didn't help at all. I'm fairly certain that the ONLY species who could actually see the tiny print, would be a hawk, or a giant squid since they have amazing eyesight.

However, as a mother of one and three-year-old boys, I am trying to teach them to respect each other and the world around them.

Certainly I found the photos lovely, but somehow the overall package does not convey the excitement, spirituality, and drama of the region. In other words, the book is a little flat. And what I expected to be a good read turned out to be more of an encyclopedia style rundown of facts (in other words, boring). The book comes off as a cold report on what is in fact a fabulously exciting and inspiring region."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than the Southwest","review":"This book is filled with history and ideas for living. It's about regular houses inhabited by regular people, but the flowing writing style and beautiful photos make you feel rich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but not for everyone","review":"The book is attractive but not that helpful because it applies to a narrow style category and one region. I agree that one can find southwest style in many parts of the country, but it often doesn't \\"move\\" well to those locations. As a designer, I see that the colors and materials often do not easily move from the southwest to another region, in part because the natural colors of the landscape and the color of the light itself change when you go to another part of the country. I wish that this book had made that point and helped readers translate the ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited appeal","review":"This book has very limited appeal. I was drawn to the \\"home-lover's guide to architecture and design\\" part of the title, but a little southwest style goes a long way and just doesn't fit the rest of the United States all that well. I am surprised by how many of my friends went, \\"Oh, ick,\\" when they saw this on my coffee table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not pay this price!","review":"I bought this puzzle for my son, but not from this sellar.

In fact, it covers this topic in the last quarter of the book and only in a couple of pages. Mostly covers the endocrine system, symptoms, signs, thyroid drugs, differences between hypo and hyperthyroidism. This information is ok for those who are newly diagnosed and need more information. Does not provide any insightful methods on alternative methods for treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"No book is perfect, but this is a good one.","review":"Really good book. Throw out every diet idea before it kills you, and soak up the advice Ann Gittleman (a recovering Pritkin - or any - \\"diet\\" fan) has to tell you.

Don't miss the many good reference sources she lists at the back of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this book!","review":"I browsed thru this book briefly, but what I did read let me know this book is a lemon. I could mention several points of misinformation in the little that I read, but I will only mention the statement that made my Gravesian eyes pop further out of my head. The last sentence in the segment about the antithyroid medication PTU says, 'Do not take PTU if you are pregnant or nursing.' The authors clearly are not aware that the treatment of choice for pregnant and breastfeeding women is PTU! If they don't know this fact, I would doubt any other information in the book.

I've just finished reading this one, and I must say that, although I'd never really liked Wellington's often-characterised stiff-upper-lip persona, I found Hibbert's depiction very appealing. It reveals that, even though the marshal created a mask of aloofness and control, behind it he was charming and engaging. Wellington may not have possessed Nelson's instinctive, natural flair but he was solid, reliable, courageous, determined and a good learner. He comes a close second to Nelson as our greatest military hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, too much irrelevant personal gossip","review":"I was dissappointed with this book. I guess the title says it all, the author focuses too much on minor aspects of the life of Wellington."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a snooze-inducer!","review":"Having just finished McCullough's John Adams, I picked this up, hoping for another wonderfully vivid portrait of a great historical figure. Instead I find a book so crammed with useless details, so choked with irrelevant facts about irrelevant characters in Wellington's life, as to be virtually unreadable. I have no objection to a high level of detail, when properly employed in the advancement of a good narrative. But I can't explain the purpose of the useless details in this book, unless to parade before us the author's exhaustive knowledge.I fall asleep each night after reading one and a half pages. If you're an insomniac with no real interest in Wellington, this book is for you. Otherwise, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jar very poorly-made","review":"There seem to be two Oster-compatible stainless steel blender jars out there. The first is just the jar and lid, which is this one. It is basically junk.There are no actual true screw threads on the bottom of the jar -- just a molded thread-like ridge which fails to tightly seal against the bottom cap. In fact, even if you do manage to get it screwed on well, the jar randomly pops out of the cap during blending -- disaster.Even the included rubber top lid doesn't fit the jar well -- you might as well just put a dinner plate on top of the jar. I'm going to return this trash and try the other, slightly more expensive Oster-compatible steel jar, the one that includes the bottom cap. The image makes it look as if there are actual threads on the bottom of that one. My suspicion is that this is a dime-store knockoff, and that the $24 one is actually made by Oster (or at least, someone reputable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed -- designs not stylish","review":"I was hoping this book would have cute sweatshirts like the ones I've see at craft shows selling for $40++.

While the cover project is intriguing, inside are the simplest of ideas, many poorly executed. Considering this book was published in 2004, it is baffling why the projects are not more in keeping with current design trends in terms of apparel and crafting. Some barely qualify as entry-level projects, and that makes them anything but fashion statements.

More than just an inoffensive disc to listen to while working, every so often Wesley will impress with his sense of the musically impressive. He's definitely the only composer I've heard from this series that could hold a candle to Haydn, much less to Mozart. Also, this is the only disc from the series that I'd recommend buying in its entirety instead of just sampling mp3 files from. Wesley may not exactly be a genius on the level of the true masters, but he is clearly able to compose interesting, melodic music that will capture your attention if you like the classical period of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"very usefulI","review":"Haven't watched the CD yet ,but just he books and the plastic memo sheet is very usuful for the new moms."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good...","review":"I liked the kit however, for less money you can buy just the hardcover book.

Coming from a company that is based on feeding children natural food you would think they would want to cook it in a more natural manner. I don't even own a microwave and definitely don't plan on cooking 100% of my baby's food in one. They do have about 4 sentences in their 100 page cookbook that relates to steaming food but it looks like it was added as an afterthought.Also the book and DVD are written with a 12 year old in mind as their audience. They could give their customer a little more respect and act like they have at least half a brain.The trays are nice and I plan on making my baby food using the cook book but you have to be a little curious about a natural baby food product that encourages everything to be cooked in a totally unnatural manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with the Lithium ion battery","review":"I have now owned this watch for one year. Right out of the box the promised \\"months\\" before it would go into the \\"sleep\\" or \\"hibernation\\" mode was only one week. I read on blog sites it takes 25,000 wrist movements to fully charge the new Lithium-ion battery. Previously SEIKO had used \\"super capacitors\\" made by Panasonic, but now discontinued because of leakage issues. If you do not wear the watch daily, with the above 25,00 required movements, good luck that it will EVER be fully charged. Result, premature 'death' of the battery. I read on blog sites that the new Li-ion batteries will last maybe only 5 - 6 years. So much for a maintenance free watch! Note, the cost of having the battery replaced is > $100.-Another observation: the watch is difficult to read under certain low light conditions. All \\"bling\\", you cannot make out the hands.

Written in 1970, the book definitely shows the mark of time and changes in society. The book's theme is the conflict between blacks and whites which was pretty hot in the 1960s but not nearly so bad now. The concept of a global war between powers based on the colour of the skin doesn't seem too likely today. The book does cover the generic subjects of racial hatred, first contacts with new races, and low tech people meeting high tech people reasonably well. I didn't get many surprises though. The book also suffers from being too short. For example, there is one chapter devoted to the political structure on Mars which could easily have been expanded on to add more depth.

(The second alarm is about as loud as a loud doorbell).We got this for our toddler's room, in order to alert us when she got out of bed. After a few weeks, we took it off. When it worked, it was fine, but about 50% of the time, she opened the door gently enough that the alarm didn't go off.

This is not the one I wanted when I ordered this a a few months ago. I am now finally able to see it and low and behold, I am disappointed. I expected the original cartoon series which is still shown on tv today, not this modernized version. I don't mean to sound too critical but I am not into these modernized, newer versions of these classic cartoons. The batman, superman, justice league, etc. are not the ones I grew up on. I watched a few minutes of a few of the Fantastic Four episodes and I am not too thrilled.

So many books offer what amounts to lackluster, weak sauce rehashing of the essence of what Ernest Norling has so skillfully laid down. The old timers, Andrew Loomis, George Bridgeman, Robert Oliver deliver this information with illustrious clarity. These guys hit the point, everyone else is reframing the same topic, not really adding much in terms of content or style.

In some ways, I could imagine this novel being a mock or low-key soap opera--It has all the imprtant elements of scandal and relationships. It was a pleasure to read because the style is very causual and flows with a sense of light hearted humor, but at the same time stays clever and hip. I very much liked the fact that the story seemed fairly modern--it was easy to relate to. The only thing I would say that is a drawback about this novel is that it is a little hard to get into and doesn't really speed up until the end. Otherwise, I was very amused and entertained. I'm looking forward to reading \\"Le Marriage\\" to see where Diane Johnson brings us next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and Forced","review":"The alleged humor in this book is overrated. The storyline is a summarized retread of many divorce stories floating through our pop culture society. The witticisms and quips that I was promised by many a book club and on-line reading group was woefully minimal. Not even a book I'd recommend for an airplane trip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paris as a setting for a common story","review":"I am French and I have been living in Paris for 6 years, so I was very interested in reading this story about Americans discovering a bit of Paris. I must say this is nice to read about places you know, about features showing the writer actually was in Paris quite recently. I was a little disappointed to see that most of the extraordinary things to the main character may not sound fabulous to an American not coming from Santa Barbara, a quite protected area. So I had this growing impression of reading more and more cliches as I went on in the book. It is a quick and easy book to read on vacation. At some point, the main character gets bored and I did too and I was not in a better mood when I read the unrealistic end. The french setting is not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential but was trite","review":"This book was such a disappointment! I actually re-read it to make sure I didn't miss anything, since I had heard such good things about it from friends and reviews, and was disappointed twice. I have spent considerable time in Paris and enjoyed Johnson's observations of French culture, especially concerning the subtleties of family interactions, gender roles and double standards that exist. These insights however were the highlight of the book - the plot was unbelievable and the American characters were one-dimensional stereotypes. Johnson's new book, Le Mariage has an unbelievably charitable review in the New Yorker this week - they hint that it is not as good as Le Divorce, so I won't even try! If I had known it was this easy to write books about Americans in Paris and get published with such success, I would have done it the first time I went to Paris, when I was 16."},{"rating":"1","title":"Le worst book I have read in years","review":"This is more akin television or foodie magazine writing than to literature. Cliche follows cliche. It is amazing that the author lives in paris as the observations seem entirely canned. I suggest missing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have missed something...","review":"It's always difficult for me to enjoy a book if I get the feeling that I wouldn't like the main characters if I knew them in real life, and that's exactly how I felt about \\"Le Divorce...\\" I bought it last year but could never read more than a few pages at a time, but then with the movie coming out, I figured I should try again. The descriptions of Paris and the changing of the seasons were wonderfully done, but the characters left me completely cold. The two sisters never took any steps on their own behalf-- they let situations control them in the most irritating fashion without ever becoming proactive. I'm curious to see if the movie rounds out the characters of the two women, or leaves them as flat and featureless as Diane Johnson did. With any luck, it will be one of those few times a movie was better than the book on which it was based."},{"rating":"1","title":"So misleading...","review":"This novel was such a huge huge disappointment to me - it will be the last time I rely on the back cover of a book to give me any indication as to its contents - sexy, cool, irrepressible Isabel?? She was one of the the most boring, most self-obsessed characters I have come across in fiction. I think there was one scene (where she tells Antoine it is so tacky for the De Persand's to try to take Roxy's picture) when she had any kind of spunk to her. The rest of the time (\\"he told me Americans smiled too much. So I tried to smile less\\") she was this whining wet rag, who seriously needed to get some friends and a life.If Roxy and Isabel are the sort of characters exported from California to Paris then no wonder the French hold the US in such low opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like a run away train!","review":"Chapter after chapter, I tried to stay focused and read on, but couldn't. I didn't see the point of the story. She repeats the same ideas over and over in each chapter so that it is hard to tell what's the plot or the point about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Stiff, in a Pompous Sort of Way","review":"This story is told in first person, but the first person is a little stiff.Maybe she's supposed to come across as a cold-hearted, unemotional, spoiled young woman,but that doesn't mean that all the other characters should as well. I didn't like any ofthe underdeveloped characters enough to care what happened to them. It wasn't all that funny, either.Perhaps if you spoke French or knew Paris, you might appreciate it more, as thereare a bazillion references to Parisian locales and menu items.If there is something really redeeming about it, I guess I missed what it was.This doesn't stop me however, from wondering how the movie will turn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing; didn't live up to its hype.","review":"I suppose I shouldn't be taken in by the brief descriptions I read on the back covers of books (even though this is how I usually decide to read a particular book). I was looking forward to reading about an \\"irrepressible\\" heroine. Isabel was anything but. She just let her experiences in Paris happen to her, as though she were a spectator in her own life rather than a participant. To live in a foreign land for that long and resist learning the language is not the mark of someone who is \\"incapable of being repressed or restrained.\\" She also displayed an appalling lack of curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"A short review because I basically agree with the other reviewers' opinions. My trouble is that I actually really like Diane Johnson's writing: I like her use of language and I like her funny observations that are so very human and familiar. What I cannot stand, and in this book particularly, is that the plot is so dull, the plot points seem almost arbitrarily thrown in, and that the climax and resolution to the story are so tepid as to be almost non-existent.I have tried two of her books and I will not be trying a third."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"If you're French and homesick, or interested in the \\"real\\" France, stay away from this book. Every page is full of French words and sentences which the author doesn't deign to translate; even more annoying is the fact that these French phrases are full of spelling and grammar mistakes... If you want to show off, at least get it right! I am French, living in the States, and I have yet to find a cruder collection of stereotypes about my country. The French in this book spend all their time eating or having sex. Sometimes for variety the women will tie scarves and the men will make some political comments -- or kill for love. The book does not reflect well on Americans either, or on gays, or on Arabs, or Africans, or women... What a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful divorce","review":"Le Divorce is a delightful book. It definitely appeals to the feminine reader. The main character can be easily idenified with. Johnson writes very fluidly and has a distinctive style of her own. My main greivance with the book is that the plot does not really get started until practically the end. Once you are completely used to the dull overtone of the character's life with her sister in Paris, it turns completely. Simple daily memoirs become an elaborate murder mystery. It was a very amusing book none the less. If you like reading about Americans in Paris, check out \\"Le Divorce\\". Il est tres amusant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nominated for the Nat'l Book Award??","review":"How this book was nominated for the National Book Award I'll never understand, but this should give all aspiring writers hope. I thought Le Divorce was very poorly written indeed, with everything from tangled syntax to plot threads that went nowhere. Was there no editor? The best parts of the book were the cultural observations. I just wish Johnson had eliminated all the tedious cloak-and-dagger stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Cares What Happens?","review":"Yes, the setting is wonderful, and the occasional commentaries of the characters on a culture not their own were sometimes humorous due to accuracy (or conversely, due to inaccuracy); but I simply was not endeared to a single character, including the narrator. Consequently, I found myself not caring what happened to the characters. Lacking any strong positive feeling about a single character, a strong NEGATIVE feeling can often make for a positive reading experience. Sadly, there was no such strength of feeling at that end of the spectrum, either. I continued reading, hoping for a change. None was forthcoming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I'm a Francophile, read/write French, and have been to Paris, so this book held great promise for me, but I couldn't get interested in this particular story; I'm surprised that this book has received so many good reviews. I didn't care about any of the characters, especially Isabel. As I read, I skimmed more and more, hoping that it would improve, but it never really piqued my interest and I gave up before the conclusion, not even caring how it ended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I a snob if I say how inredibly lowbrow this book is?","review":"If you are a young teenage girl, or a Cosmo magazine devotee you may find this work to have literary merit. However, if you have ever read any books seriously, or have ever been to France or even if you just believe that life and people are actually complicated and interesting and deserve more than tired cliche characterizations than you will agree that this one bites le gran chien!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EuroDisney became Disneyland Paris in 1994.","review":"I am caught up on reading Oprah's book club recommendations. Due to my love of Paris, I decided to read this. Very disappointed that the author, who supposedly lives in California and Paris, didn't realize that the name of EuroDisney (opened in 1992) was changed to Disneyland Paris in 1994. I believe the book was initially published in 1997. A big faux pas--especially to Disney fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I am glad that I bought this book used--it is not worth the retail price!The reviews said the book is a National Bestseller, and it is delightful, humorous...I kept waiting for the book to get better.

The picture was interesting and artistic. After reading the back cover, I assumed that Le Divorce was going to be a worthwhile read. Unfortunately for me and my $17.00, this book was the opposite. I'm normally a big fan of modern literature, but this book did not do it for me. I found myself uninterested in the characters, which made it hard for me to care about what happened to them, which in turn made it hard for me to fully appreciate the story. Normally when sex, violence, and attempted suicide are involved in a story, I look foward to reading it; such scenes in Le Divorce were unsatisfactory at best. Reading this book was like watching paint dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"So I've tried to read this book so many times, but every time I pick it up, I can only read a few pages.

It was SO boring! Finally I skipped ahead, wondering if there was any redeeming event in the offing. But no. And just for the record, the next time I purchase a book of this nature that is purportedly written in English, but contains endless French phrases and quotations that are left untranslated, I intend to return to the bookstore and ask for a refund for the percentage of the book that is unreadable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vive Le Difference..!","review":"This was an enjoyable,if flawed,story that gave me alot of insight into the French-American relationship,warts and all,which was I enjoyed most about the story of a young woman named Isabel who goes there to help out her newly-abandoned pregnant step-sister. The French are neither portrayed as horribly rude and unwashed( a played-out,suspect stereotype to begin with) Nor are Amercians portrayed as simple and uncultivated,(at least the ones in this book weren't.) What I like less was the rather icky affair Isabel has with a 70 year old man and the ending which didn't match the tone of book and seemed to belong to a different story. The \\"travel-guide\\" aspect and observations of this book are great though and it's what I reccommend most. Read and enjoy the \\"trip\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Americans Abroad in a All Their Splendour","review":"Diane Johnson has created a pleasant read in Le Divorce. The narrator, Isabel Walker, will lead the reader through her time in Paris as she visits her step-sister, Roxy and becomes involved in events, both silly and serious, erotic and neurotic. It is a gentle, funny comedy of clash of manners. This book recieved much hype when first released and has spawned a new sequel in Le Mariage and while perhaps not quite living up to the hype for this reader, it is still an entertaining and smart novel. The author has made the experiences of these ex-pats quite believable in sometimes unbelievable circumstances and the story moves along at a swift pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't completely hate this book","review":"The 2 things I liked about this book was that it a fast read with an American view of life in Paris.But this book gets annoying really fast. The plot and characters are unbelievable. The main character Isabel is suppose to be 20-something but she acts and thinks like a 40-something having an identity crisis.Also the characters are never fully developed, in fact there are too many characters and stories in this book in my opinion. Some characters are briefly introduced at the beginning of the book and don't appear again until many many chapters later. I went through this book with the idea that everything will come together in the end, and it doesn't. The ending is sorely disappointing. But if you need a fast quick read for a trip or the beach this book will suffice."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American in Paris","review":"I really liked this story. The characters were funny and realistic, especially in their self-absorbtion. In other words, characters don't necessarily have to be likeable in order to be entertaining. I especially enjoyed the American vs. Parisian culture clashes. And the heroine's wide-eyed plunge into French cuisine and love affairs.No, it's not a perfect story. There are too many loose ends left hanging, too many attempts at subplots dealing with antique-dealing intrigues, when the education of the heroine to French culture would have been adequate. And the ending is not what it could have been.But the ride was so enjoyable, to complain about the destination (or lack of it) seems petty."},{"rating":"2","title":"At times great, at others only so-so","review":"While the idea of running off to Paris appealed to me, the story had its moments where the characters turned me off. I never really bought into Isabelle's relationship with a man so much older than her. There never seemed to be a genuine attraction, and I almost disliked her for her self-absorption. Her sister was also self-centered, and not exactly an empathetic character. The best thing about this book is the backdrop of Paris. Johnson did a wonderful job of making me feel like I was there, I just wished I'd enjoyed the characters that brought me there a little more. On the whole, I didn't dislike the book, I just expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about an annullment instead?","review":"The story is disconnected and stuffed with odd characters. It is somewhat of a sad story that the author is trying to make light of but systematically missing every opportunity for accomplishing that goal. I never understood why a young attractive college student from California seeks to sleep with a 70-yr old man (Uncle Edgar)or what is at stake for her in the relationship. She claims to be in love with him but sleeps around with a couple of guys who are quickly mentioned. Her sister is a spoiled sniveling brat who only garners sympathy from the reader because her husband leaves her while she is pregnant. Basically, Le Divorce lacks flavor, depth, timing, and sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick entertaining read with imperfect characters","review":"I always check the Amazon.com reviews before reading or buying a book but I was glad that I put aside some of the negative reviews of Le Divorce. I loved how Johnson created such flawed yet likable characters. I admit that it was hard to relate to some of the character's adventures and troubles. But honestly, if I wanted to relate to characters who are like me, then why bother reading! I read so that I can let my imagination soar. It's fun reading about people that I would never meet in my own sometimes mundane ordinary life. I read Le Divorce in record time and laughed out loud at some of the crazy situations. I also appreciated the glimpses into French culture from the American perspective. It's clear that Johnson had spent time in France and has done her research. I bought Johnson's Persian Nights after reading Le Divorce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilled","review":"I read that this book was a national bestseller and national book award finalist and figured I couldn't go wrong.

I am an American living in France and it seems that all the authors ideas about cultural diffeances are based on old pre war novels and tourist guides.

Who nominated this for the Book Award?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Expatriates in France","review":"This book, at times witty and humorous, reminds me of \\"Portrait of Lady\\", \\"Daisy Miller\\" and a \\"Moveable Feast\\" combined. The theme of the novel is the old world vs. the new world. American innocence next to European jadedness and fiendishness. It is also a good example of the modern novel. That being said the book was somewhat slow moving and I thought the descriptions of the French and French living were a bit cliched. Particularly the part where the main character, Isabel, becomes involved with a much older Frenchman (Colette does it much better). However, it is still a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Divorce yourself from this bore","review":"This book reads like a 5th grader wrote it: run-on sentence after run-on, extreme use of parenthetical expressions, repetition after repetition, etc. Whoever edited this should be fired.

I recently discovered it in the bookcase and this time finished it though I don't know how. While advertised as intelligent and humorous it isn't particularly so. The characters are all ciphers -- you don't get in any of their heads. The narrator, Isabel, addresses the reader while relating her first-hand experiences, yet seems to turn all-knowing when it's convenient. There's a particularly annoying habit of foreshadowing along the lines of: \\"If I'd only been more XYZ, I would have seen the catastrophe coming.\\" Some of these catastrophes turn out to be ... not so catastrophic. The ending is pat and the reactions of the characters to a true catastrophe don't feel real. One of the books where I just don't understand what anyone else sees in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I agree with many of the reviewers - I am amazed by the critical acclaim this book received.

All in all - I would not recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiled, Vain and Self-absorbed Characters","review":"The book, Le Divorce, is well-written but this does not mean that I have even remotely enjoyed reading it.

I only finished it because I was reading it for my book club (at my suggestion!). I found it impossible to like the lead character, a selfish young woman with a complete lack of good morals. The book seemed to wonder aimlessly with the thoughts and desires of the main character without developing any of the other characters or even the very thin plot. Additionally, the author seems to assume the reader knows French! I believe she was trying to show Isabel's progression in learning the language and culture but in the end alienates the reader. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very exciting","review":"I wanted to read this book since there was a movie coming out based on the book. Well I sure hope that the movie is better.

Towards the end, somethings started to happen, but it was a little too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeserving of the buzz","review":"Took this book with me on a long flight (Seoul - Delhi). I was eager to read a book set in France to get my mind off of Asia for a while. Too, the trade reviews said it was witty, well-written, etc. In a nutshell, it disappoints. It isn't particularly well written--there are several places (sorry, not motivated enough to go back and find examples) where the author's idiosynchratic usages make one wonder if she's a native English speaker. They are either editorial oversights or blunders. The characters are uninteresting. The plot bores.

Beyond that, it is hard to say anything positive, or for that matter polite about this blistering and unnecessary attack on an American icon. The author is clearly a bigot. Had this book been written about a member of almost any other ethnic group it is doubtful it would have ever been published. If you enjoy the \\"Soprano's\\" and believe that all Americans of Italian heiritage are ignorant, pasta-eating members of the mob, you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, I wouldn't waste your time.

First, Boston priests, now this. It's a greasy tabloid in book form, mostly undocumented with impossibly intimate, fly-on-the-wall commentary. Please. It's a slow read but a decent bathroom book. Yes, you CAN put it down. Joe D. comes off as a miserly skinflint with a cold winter gripping his soul, enjoying an alarming countenance with the Mob and tortuous relationships with a succession of bimbos (one more notable than the rest.) He displays as an unrequited Scrooge, sleeping alone all through Christmas Eve with no trio of ghostly visitors to save him from himself. Humbug. This book debunks all the legend, all the grace and presence of the man, other than his undeniable prowess on the field. This hero wore a black hat.

THE dIMAGGIO i KNEW AND REMEMBERED was a classy gentleman with style and dignity. Nonetheless i remember the baseball Dimaggio who was one of baseball Heroes who in 13 short years left an indelible mark not only on baseball but on the Nations conscious . He was remembered as every boys dream that he too could become a great player-he could become like dimaggio. What purpose does it serve to portray OUR hero as a distrustful, jealous, greedy cheap miscreant. I am disappointed in this book- would this book been published if Dimaggio were still alive---- SHAME--- WHEN I FINISH READING THE BOOK I WILL RETURN WITH MORE IMPRESSIONS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Cramer---what'd Joe ever do to you?","review":"This man had no business writing a ''biography'' of someone he obviously hated so much. And I use the word ''biography'' loosely.Cramer wrote as fact what he couldn't possibly know---like what Mr. DiMaggio was thinking, for example---and of course wrote it in a negative light.Make no mistake folks, this is a GLARINGLY FICTIONALIZED biography.I can't believe it was excerpted in Newsweek. It should have been in Weekly World News next to the alien who gave birth to his own twin."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not about BASEBALL, it's about TABLOID GOSSIP","review":"I'm not really sure what I expected from this book, but what I got was glitzy tabloid gossip about Marilyn Monroe, Toots Shor, Frank Sinatra ad nauseum. This book was not written by someone who cared about baseball at all, rather by someone who obsessively wishes they were part of the papparazzi crowd 40-50 years ago. Richard Ben Cramer gets off on gangsters, gambling, drinking, womanizing, and celebrity worship and splays this sick addiction out for the reader.In a 500+ page book about Joe Dimaggio, there's maybe 1 page about Mickey Mantle. Maybe 2 or 3 about Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Yet there is page after page about Marilyn Monroe, her affairs, her addictions, and her problems.

Joe DiMaggio ignored Mr. Cramer for good reason. Cramer relates that DiMaggio spit up blood at 4 in the morning during his illness. How does Mr. Cramer know what occurred if only DiMaggio was present? Cramer \\"sets up\\" the reader through the use of language to become sympathetic to his point of view. There is little excellence left in the world. Cramer and those who share his philosophy take pleasure in attempting to destroy the excellence of others. It will take a lot more than a Richard Ben Kramer to tarnish the excellence of Joseph Paul DiMaggio. Read the book and evaluate Cramer's stance. The loser is Cramer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hatchet Job","review":"This book spares no opportunity to trash the man. Things that are really irrelevant - Monroe's life and treatment in Hollywood before Dimaggio, his sex life, etc. are devoted large amounts of space.Compare this book to his book on Ted Williams and you can see how Ben Cramer treats his \\"friends\\" (Williams) and those he holds in contempt. Even in the Williams book, he slams Dimaggio. At times it seems almost pathological, his fixation on tearing down the reputation of this man. I am sure that Dimaggio is far from perfect (who isn't), but this seems to go above and beyond the course of biographical inquiry into perhaps - slander or a vendetta.My recommendation is to skip the book, read Halberstam's \\"Summer of 49\\". It combines sports and personality much better and unlike Ben Cramer's book, doesn't make you feel like you need to take a shower after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Considering the circumstances...","review":"...to which the author freely admits surrounding the book (namely the absence of the blessing of its main subject) one must admire the finished product. you get the feeling that most authors would not have undertaken such a monumental task on a level playing field; much less down 0-2. nevertheless the author manages to shed some much needed light on perhaps America's greatest enigma. as a young Yankee fan, DiMaggio was my second favorite player of all time (behind my hero Don Mattingly...and at the risk of getting off the subject am I going to have to wait until he succeeds Joe Torre as manager for a decent bio on him?) before I read Mr Cramer's work. And while I always will admire the supreme talent with which DiMaggio played the game on the field, I am equally unimpressed with his lack of talent in dealing with his life off of it. A fascinating look at the pressures that come with being among the most famous people in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind as well read a supermarket tabloid","review":"This book was nothing but a piece of trash. First of all, it's hard to believe one thing in this book because Cramer doesn't give a source. I could write a book about how Lou Gehrig was a womanizing racist using quotes from unnamed sources, but that doesn't mean a word of it is true. I'm not saying that Mr. DiMaggio was a saint but this book tries to make him out to be a spawn of Satan. Lastly, I find it funny that one of the editor's said this book was \\"elegantly\\" written. Elegantly? Using racial slurs is elegant? Don't waste your money on this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter, angry, jealous - and that's just the author","review":"This is a bitter, self-indulgent attempt by the author to attack DiMaggio. Period. He was a bad guy... so what? He liked money? Last time I checked, the author wasn't giving his book away. The main problem isn't with the book or DiMaggio, but with the people who make guys like DiMaggio the heroes they can never be. The bar is set way too high for these individuals. No one can reach it. Our solution: write about it. Consider this: I seriously doubt anyone will write a book about the author, because while he may have received accolades for his work as a reporter, all he has really done in his life is write about what other people have done in their lives. Seems like an empty accomplishment to me, and might be the reason for the high level of bitterness and, perhaps, jealousy that came through in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the personal assault?","review":"This book was a gift from my daughter; as such, I read it even though I knew that it was a hatchet job, for whatever reason, against a great player. At the end of the book I came away with the same conclusion I had when I started, and that is that Joe DiMaggio was one of the greatest hitters of all time (had an immaculate swing) and one of the greatest all around players of all time. As a baseball lover that is all I need to know. In short, he was idolized for his playing ability and for his quite demeanor on the field, while keeping his peccadilloes from public view - why is that so bad? What grudge the author has against Joe DiMaggio I don't know, but I see no need to attack a person based on the shortcomings of that person's personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIMAGGIO-SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT OR RE-WRITING HISTORY?","review":"ONE OF THE PREMISES OF THE HEROES LIFE is that almost all of the reporters wrote only good things about DIMAGGIO---- for whatever reason the commentators OF dimaggio's DAY WERE AFRAID TO TARNISH HIS IMAGE----even modern day writers such as MIKE LUPICA would see only DIMAGGIOS good face---- BEN CRAMER has no such compulsions in telling us that DIMAGGIO was a flawed man spinkled with hate - distrust- greed and disloyalty----WHY was this book written-Why DO WE HAVE TO KNOW HIS PERCEPTION OF THE MAN WHO WAS OUR LAST BAseball hero --WHY INDEED"},{"rating":"1","title":"A rejected hero-worshipper strikes back","review":"This sad attempt to bring down the image of Joe DiMaggio as far down as possible seems to result from the fact that Mr. Cramer was rejected in his efforts to obtain DiMaggio or his estate's co-operation.

It exposes and explains one of America's mid-twentieth century icons in a more complete way than any other book to date.The book is divided into 4 \\"books\\" in chronological order (It skips his first 15 years and also the post Marilyn period 1962-89!). The meat of the book comes in \\"books\\" 2 and 3 which cover the Yankee years followed by the Marilyn years. His failed first marriage, his \\"relationships\\" with his teammates and managers, and lots of questionable characters and lackeys pop up throughout these sections. The last \\"book\\" which begins in 1989 involves all his baseball memorabilia business dealings and wasn't as interesting as the 2 previous \\"books\\".In the end, the essential portrait of Dimaggio is of a one dimensional man who was great at baseball and being \\"Joe Dimaggio\\" and not much else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look at more than just statistics","review":"I enjoyed this book very much, it was a very entertaining read, failing to get five stars from me only because the author did not provide enough documentation of his facts.Mr DiMaggio was a divinely talented ballplayer- greatest ever - no, in fact, definitely not - but certainly among them.Away from baseball Joe D always struck me as both egotistical and just plain goofy. I liked the way the author gave credit to Joe's skills and accomplishments, while steering clear of a simple advertisement for a man we already knew was great on a ball diamond. DiMaggio was a very complex man, who had his failures and shortcomings, the same way all of us do.I would certainly recommend this book as an entertaining read, it's not just a stiff baseball biography, there's a lot more here than just dates and statistics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Biography on the Legendary Yankee Clipper","review":"This book is a solid baseball read. We get into the private and secluded life of Joe Dimaggio. I appreciated the way this book gives an honest look at his flaws and lets the reader into his life to the point that you actually see how lonely he was at the time of his death.Most of all, this book reminds us that heroes are people just like us.

The clamp design is very bad on all lamps of this type, but this one is made of apparently an even worse plastic and part of it was cracked and snapped off as I was taking it out of the box. The pins that hold the tension rods are made of metal on the Alvin lamp, but here they are made from a plastic that bends and looks like it is about to snap off (and release a spring into someone's eye!)

However, most, if not all, of the stories are told in other volumes and in better depth. The author only briefly mentions some haunted places that could have been better researched. She tends to throw out little \\"teasers\\" and leaves the reader wanting to know more information than is given.As a student of the paranormal, I was disappointed in the quality of several of the photos. One would expect them to be a little more clear. She included some in the back that are purported to be \\"ghosts\\" They are very blurry and one cannot see much.

He said he won't buy anything else by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fake meritocracy","review":"This book is about a fake society where 'perception is reality', where people show naked respect for power and money and where Cupido is Stupido.It gives us a good insight into the superficial mentality of the rich and famous and into the false 'meritocratic' argument by people who pretend to have earned honestly everything they possess, while in fact they inherited it. The same 'merit' should also justify the enormous income differences in the US.Toby Young's biography centres on the glossy magazine 'Vanity Fair' and his misadventures as a junior writer. It contains the well-known ingredients of booze, drugs, sex, the homo/hetero battle and his unwelcome English 'hooligan' behaviour.In fact, besides some thoughts about 'de Tocqueville, freedom and the US', his work is nearly a 'colossal waste of time' (the author's own words) and certainly not more than somewhat better gossip for insiders about totally uninteresting people."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, I feel stupid...","review":"I suppose the dollar or so I was able to pick this thing up for here at Amazon should have told me something. Young is a really unappealing character and just not very funny. Why he has been paid to follow this thing up with a second book is way beyond me. I too hate this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horribly indulgent human and book","review":"This is one of those few books that you really want to root for, that the hero/author somehow learns from their errors and does a 180. This is not that book. I wish I could get back the time I spent reading this book. I will probably end up using it to light some winter fires. It is not even worth donating or passing it along.Toby Young (at least in this book) loves the sound of his own voice (even it is just whining or using his parents' credentials to give him meaning) and never truly admits just how self-indulgent, arrogant, and downright oblivious he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok then....I guess I'll never get those hours of my life back. Uh...how about a warning label next time?","review":"I'm wondering how long Mr. Young has been living under the impression that he should, indeed, pursue a career in writing...too long, meeethinks.Put down the No.2, Toby...milk n' cookie time is over. Maybe you should sit on the bench for a while and ponder the meaning of life. At the very least, quit with the ego-tripping and learn a new language...as you seem to be having trouble with your native tongue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funloving English contrarian roasts the pretensions of New York's \\"Magazine Avenue\\"","review":"Young steers clear of discussing the occasional exquisite political journalism for which Vanity Fair is known--e.g. articles about the Nixon Watergate affair, exposes that led to the prosecution of Big Tobacco, and today several columns documenting the unmitigated disaster of the Bush Years--and gets right to the sex and the city, New York version. (Indeed, Young comes along at just the time that Candace Bushnell is writing her column in The New York Observer that would become the famous HBO series... and now, the movie (which I review here). They're friends.)He's sort of a testosterone-and-alcohol-afflicted male version of Carrie Bradshaw, and more doggedly politically incorrect....For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2008"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Purchase","review":"I thought that this was a very entertaining book. Toby is not always a very likable person in this story but he is brutally honest about himself and that is part of what makes the book so entertaining.

The british are renowned for their wit but maybe being in NY too long dulled this in Toby Young. I ended up despising the author as a snivelling weasel who fails in life by his own lack of integrity and intelligence and belittles his friends and collegues whether they deserve it or not. I finished the book only to see if it improved but alas, no.The name dropping anecdotes are worse than a boring gossip column. The most redeeming feature of this boring and trite book is being able to put it down and thank any diety you can pray to that you are not like the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Title, Loser Author","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book since it sounded like a fun read. And I will admit that parts were funny but the more I read this book, the more I hated the author and the book. If he had just stuck to telling his story, he would have been fine. Then it would have just been a funny book about a hapless loser. But what really made this book awful was his continual justification of why he's really a failure. Apparently it isn't his fault at all -- it's ours. Our value system apparently kept him from succeeding. It's infuriating when someone has to condemn an entire culture simply because he can't get his act together. Frankly, the fact that this drunken slacker couldn't make it in NYC proves that we have got it right. If you must read this book, borrow it from the library. We really don't need to encourage this guy with any more royalty money."},{"rating":"1","title":"When He Says He Has Negative Charisma, He Ain't Kidding","review":"This is a whiny anti-American book by a guy who really, really wants to be a part of the crowd he tears apart. Despite the fact that he idolizes the most superficial of American sub-cultures, it ends up looking better than it should. The superficial entertainment and fashion biz is criticized for not being dysfunctional enough. At one point, he claims not to be able to make close friends in NYC because no one is willing to get drunk with him. Bottom line, our whole culture is slammed because we're not drunk enough, not drugged out enough, and not sexist and homophobic enough. The only big mistake that Graydon Carter made was keeping him on staff as long as he did. If you must read this book, borrow it rather than encouraging this loser-wanting-revenge writing with royalty money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NYC is not America","review":"As an Englishman I found Toby Young's review of his time in New York (with occasional trips to LA) mildly amusing, but his blatant anti-Americanism and, worse still, his misconception that New York is America, really tiresome. This book is what Woody Allen would have written if he were an Englishman visiting New York and if he were considerably less talented."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite a disappointment","review":"I have always had a flair for British comedy but this book is a huge disappointment. I kept reading it, waiting for the book to make me laugh and after getting about half way through it, I gave up.

Oh well...."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to become a failure and get paid for it!","review":"This book was pretty much what it promised to be until you get to the end. Then Toby begins a whining tirade to justify his failure to make it in Manhattan. He uses the example of George W. Bush to prove his point that you must have connections and family money to suceed in America. Toby, did you ever hear of a guy named Bill Clinton? He was president of the United States the ENTIRE time you lived in this country. The difference between you and Bill (and for that matter George) is that they were willing to start at the bottem and WORK their way up. Also the United States of America does not begin and end within the city limits of NYC, LA and Washington, DC. To bad you never knew us and hasta la vista baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"True to the title","review":"Toby Young alienated me in no time. The book is one huge whine-fest about his lack of success in the New York publishing world. He seemed to attribute his failures to the uptight careerists in publishing and the fact the days of Dorothy Parker and Robert Benchley are over (which is why he's so unappreciated). Well, I've got news for Mr. Young: his writing and wit bears little similarity to Parker's or Benchley's. In fact, the only similarity he showed to these true wits was in his alcohol consumption.In short, it's a dreary, unenlightening (and unenlightened) read sure to make one cranky."},{"rating":"2","title":"toby young can be my friend","review":"I found this book a blast to read--a delightful peek inside the world of glamour from the perspective of someone who (like most of us) never quite belonged there. Through his experiences, Young reveals just what makes us worship at the altar of celebrity, then is vicious in tearing it down. I don't fault him for many of the criticisms that the book has received--that he's hypocritical about his love/hate relationship with all that glitters. These are obvious--what the author gives us is a look at his life and the lure of fame without a shred of self preservation. Don't buy this book as a treatise on meritocracy, but for its delightfully candid narrator and his exceptionally witty writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't feel sorry for the guy.","review":"He does it all to himself. As I read this, I figured that I would somehow identify with Toby and see his foray into the magazine world as a realist going into a self-stroking, cynical environment. I was figuring he was just the wrong guy for the wrong job. Well, not true.He's a journalist. Granted, he's a British journalist (I did learn a few new colloquialisms reading this) going to an American magazine...but he's a journalist and he should have known. I.e., you would not take a job at Company Y if EVERYONE around you said it's not a good place to work.Either way, he digs his own grave. His failure to play the game is what does him in. Quite frankly, his boss tells him to do things, he disobeys, and he wonders why everyone get's peeved at him.Geee, I wonder why?A decent read. If you're in the publishing industry it might be a little more relevant. A decent read, just not what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get it from the libary to bypass author's royalties!","review":"I guess it's easier to like a memoir if you like the writer, but unfortunately, Toby Young appears to be 1) shallow as hell, and 2) harboring delusions of grandeur. Not an attractive combo. Remind me again why I would want to read about him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well he got a movie deal so it's not totally bad,,,","review":"But it's pretty bad.Toby Young comes to America for a job at Vanity Fair and succeeds in American Cafe Society about as well as the Duchess of Windsor did with the Royals after her husband's abdication. Imagine the Conde Nast headquarters as a combination of high fashion and low life and make the author the lowest of th e low lifes and you have a pretty good clue where this memoir goes.There is a movie deal, but my bet is that it will be greatly fictionalized because failure just isn't that funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly good read","review":"This is a funny book with a surprising amount of vulnerability and erudition. At its core, it's about the child of a celebrated intellectual who is at once fascinated by the bright glossy world exemplified by Vanity Fair magazine and ashamed of that very fascination. Young is struggling with feeling not quite fabulous enough for that world and with the question why one would want to part of same (real intellectuals don't care about going to the Oscar party at Mortons -- they barely register the Oscars in the first place).Young is a facile, amusing and self-deprecating writer with an eye for the little detail that says a great deal (e.g. the expectation that VF staffers walk with a sense of purpose as a way of expressing confidence; talk about form over function!). This is a book for anyone who reads VF or People or Us, etc. with a sense of guilty pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"WYSIWYG","review":"Who buys a pond filter and doesn't get the hose with it?

It has nice chapters dedicated to clear and practical applications of the experimental part of these subjects, giving also some sense of balance, which is nowadays more needed than ever. People ask on why to expend money on these field withoun noticing the benefits, so the book contributes to shortened the bridge giving to the students extra tools.The final part of the book is also important, it open the window for outstanding issues, of course this part may become obsolete but it a good incentive anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wendi's review","review":"There is no such thing as a \\"bad\\" Nero Wolfe book or novella.

Yes it is uncomfortable for anything other than short term use, but it is a generic neck stabilization device for accident or crime victims to wear until they are evaluated at a trauma center.

There were 1 to 2 times when my neck was still able to move but for the most part it's allowed my neck to heal while I was sleeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"For the money, this is a good neck brace. You probably could not use it long term, but if you have neck aches sometimes, this would be a great brace to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Pasta Recipe Book","review":"I love this book! I learned to cook pasta from my husband's Italian mother and grandmother and I thought I was doing well, but this book has refined and simplified my pasta dishes. The book is easy to read and easy to use with step-by-step directions. After making one of the tomato based sauces, my husband said it was the best he'd ever had! There are recipes for every type of pasta, too, using seafood (my favorite), herbs and oils, and cheese. Fresh pasta, store bought, how to cook it...whether you've been cooking pasta all your life or just learning how this book is perfect. The pictures alone make it worth while. I, also, purchased the author's Ultimate Bread book and love it as much as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good fit","review":"The TV sits at a comfortable height on the stand. It's well built of MDF, and comes mostly assembled, only the shelf mounts need to be screwed in. It is short, so it won't fit too many devices, but I've got a receiver, DVR, DVD and Xbox connected with plenty of room to spare. A good deal for a solid piece of furniture, and a good fit for a nice TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to agree with the other reviewers","review":"I am also a big fan of Jillian Hunter, but this book was dreadful. Where was the editor? How did this get published? If this had been the first Jillian Hunter book I had ever read, I'd never read another. But fortunately, I have read the wonderful Bostcastle books first.I really echo the other reviewer who said she can't believe that Jillian Hunter wrote this. It was just a mess-- scattered characterization, slapstick humor that often didn't work-- it was just a mess. I suppose it had some charm, because I finished it, but I was shaking my head over how dreadful it was all the way along.And the ending? Who cares if Hannah finally felt like she was home? Why introduce a fully sprung daughter after the poignant scene at her grave?Sloppy sloppy writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Slog Through","review":"I'm a great fan of Jillian Hunter, but this is not a very good book. There is no reason to like or even care about the two main characters. Marsali's behavior is irrational and irritating (going fishing in a gold tulle ball gown??). Duncan is not much better (a successful general sitting on the floor playing with and talking to tin soldiers??). An attempt seemed to be made to make the secondary characters cutesy and oddball, but they were simply paper-doll flat. The plot dragged along at a snail's pace with jarringly abrupt leaps forward by weeks with little or no exposition to bring the reader along. All-in-all a singularly bad book. As a matter of fact, it is so bad that I can hardly believe it was written by Jillian Hunter. I highly recommend her more recent books."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertisement!","review":"The item doesn't come in the package that the picture shows.

It's great for nausea, churning stomach, indigestion, everything!!! I have turned SO many people onto this. Every one I have told about it, and they tried it, swear by it. It's just a shame that you have to get onto the net to find the Vanilla flavor, as it is the best. I love the cherry as well, but have a friend who can only take the vanilla. She tried the Tropical Fruit flavor, and it had little crystals in it that got caught in her teeth. But this particular flavor, and the cherry are great, and work amazingly well!!!!

While I have no objection to presenting points of view of many different faiths, this book takes a strong fundamentalist view towards parenting. Much of the narrative and Biblical quotations are needlessly shaming to parents who are already struggling with the strain of a chronically ill child. The casual browser who reads the jacket blurb on this book will see only that the authors incorporate prayer in their coping suggestions, a perfectly acceptable option. This book is not appropriate for an unsuspecting parent seeking solace and support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool product","review":"I like the smoke ring gun a lot, i'd say smoke rings disappear at 5ish feet.

Nothing prepared me for the beauty in it. I understand that many things in it are speculation from the author, but what daring views, what awarenes of connections.I would recommend the readers to continue on to \\"King Jesus\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Poetry, BAAAD History","review":"If you treat this as poetry or new mythology, this is a great book. Inspiring, poetic -- great stuff. Unfortunately, it's presented as history and a commentary on ancient mythology -- and that it's not. I'm a medievalist; the quality of the historical \\"research\\" is exceptionally low. In fact, Graves is responsible for much of the historical misinformation that plagues Neo-Paganism. He invented the Triple Goddess motif (Maiden, Mother, and Crone), the \\"Celtic\\" tree calendar, and the notion that lunar calendars have thirteen months. So while I acknowledge the beauty of Graves' vision, I can't recommend his book highly. It's done too much damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"The White Goddess","review":"A lot of what Graves theorized in The White Goddess has been disproven since. Here and there I ran across stuff I can agree with or think hey maybe he is on to something but overall I don't jibe well with much in the White Goddess. The biggest thing is he tries to draw all these parallels and relations between Indo-European and Hebraic stuff. Its possible Graves was a well meaning (but wrong) guy but I think its just as likely he was intentionally putting out nonsense to muddy the water. Its hard for me not to think this considering the Kabballistic/Masonic/Occult secret societies with connections to the aristocracy that he was involved with and all the new age and Wiccan garbage that was heavily influenced by his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"He doesn't back up any of his hypotheses","review":"If you want a true book on Celtic myth and not some made up, undocumented treatise of some guys imagination then do NOT buy this book. Buy The Gaelic Otherworld, or the Carmina Gadelica, or Irish Bardic Poetry by Bergin. Buy anything but this book because you WON'T find the truth that you're seeking in it's pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a dream","review":"Is this the book that launched a thousand neo-pagan cults? So I am told. It certainly got me interested in Celtic myth. When it was first published in the 1940s, this was THE book on Celtic myth. It hasn't quite stood the test of time in academic circles, and understandably so. The author, in order to arrive at his conclusions, takes leaps that defy academic credibility. What we see here is Graves the mythmaker, Graves the poet, Graves the dreamer, Graves the oracle of the white goddess but not Graves as an authority of prehistoric Europe. As I read on, I wanted to believe, but better sense told me not to. But I still say this is a great book (and I give it five stars) because of its dreamlike quality. At parts, I thought I was reading Tolkien. In its essence, this is a work of historical fantasy, about warriors from ages long past, about the decapitated priest-king, about orgiastic priestesses, about the key to ultimate wisdom. Does that sound like a good read? Yes, it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saroyan views himself through the eyes of his son.","review":"This is a marvelous and simple book. William Saroyan paints a delightful picture of what he imagines life for his son is like when they spend summers together. Whether or not Aram Saroyan actually perceived anything like his father's description is irrelevant. I first read this story a a boy of 13 or 14 years of age and always remembered it vividly. The book is a wonderful instruction manual for how a father should teach his children about the beauty and celebration of life. When I became a father 25 years after first reading the book I searched my family's house for the story. It remained as vital as I remembered. The book taught me at an early age that a good parent must permit children to see you as you truly are. And thus, one must strive to be a good and generous person."},{"rating":"2","title":"well illustrated could be more dynamic","review":"The book is well illustrated and well linked into case studies for medical students. It appears that the book was focused for a medical students. this can be irritating as pathology and science students use the book, and as much as the case studies are interesting, a more molecular approach occasionally would have made a more dynamic book. The book is wonderful and easy to use, a sensational book on all other points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary evil","review":"Although this book is helpful at times, it was only a recommended textbook for my course.

I tossed it and bought another one and the same thing happened. So now instead of an automatic fish feeder I have a manual fish feeder - I'm advancing it myself. I won't buy a third one. No other products out there that fill this need at near this price.I took it apart and cleaned it thinking that perhaps debris was holding it back.

Fancy that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs significant improvement","review":"This blender blade/cutter does not work well for pureeing foods that are anything but thin and watery. This is caused by excessive pitch to the blades that results in overly strong pumping action and cavitation. i.e., when used to puree significantly viscous foods, the blades draw a lot of air down and end up not circulating the contents but only working the lower portion. My sense is that the pitch of the blades needs to be reduced about 50%."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some things never change...:)","review":"Recently, I aquired my mother's Osterizer blender which is at least 40+ years old (hence my title).

There are many illustrations that were duplicated throughout the text. Many of the illustrations are just plain pointless. The text size is ridiculously large as if to just take up space.

There are also extremely awkward in text citations that ruin the flow of the book.Pros:- a few interesting links between physical health and mental health- quick/easy read (organized by emotion)Cons:- repetitive/banal- poorly written/organized- plugs in writing advertising his other books (no thank you)- no connection between emotionsAll-in-all I pretty much despised this book.

The lyrics of the new songs really suck and a re an insult to the depht achieved in previous years. I think that if they don't have anything new to say, there are better off silent.

Then once you turn the camera on, you find that the preview image is horrible. The image, if you can even call it an image, is blurry and grainy and completely undecipherable.

No more little voices that would break your ears in tears, no more words without meaning as Mmmm Bop, only good lyrics and perfect voice harmonies. It's been a long time but Underneath souds great and it should please the Hanson fans all over the world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album sucks, give me my money back!","review":"This album sucks. I regret buying this. I should spend my Amazon vouchers for something much more worth it. I was excited when the cd arrived in the mail, but when I listened to it.. I had tried to like it, but the more I listened to it the more I hated it. The album just sucks, it's just boring. Give me more variations, please.

My tastes in music are broad,from Rolling Stones(Best Band Ever) to Jimi Hendrix(no guitarist can beat him). However, I also treasure the Mozart Piano Concertos of Murrey Perahia and the Beethoven Sonatas by Wilhelm Kempff. But Hanson is the music I listen to most these days. Why? As I'm pumping miles on the exercise bike in front of a mirror with headphones on, I've got this enormous smile on my face, that's why. This is feel-good music at it's best along with deep songs that move the soul.Penny & Me is for the true Romantic at heart,while Lost Without Each Other perfectly describes the way I feel about my husband.In my opinion, Get Up and Go and Crazy Beautiful are soulful in the style of the best of Stevie Wonder. Deeper is addictive. All in all, this is the best Hanson album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music, as always!","review":"hanson's sound is always changing and developing, as they are, which makes every album a new experience. this one is no different. it makes me dance and sing and even get watery eyes. this is an amazing album with beautiful music; whether you're a hanson fan or not, check this out, 'cause itz SUPER!! and the dvd's cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanson - Underneath","review":"Hanson continues to get made fun of for \\"Mmmmbop\\" from people that never bothered to listen to their future music ventures.

Since the time of MMmmBop I have always been able to listen to their music and smile. This album is no exception. I imagine my hair blowing with my top down in an old convertible on \\"Penny and Me\\" I see myself dancing with friends at a Hanson concert on \\"Lost Without Each Other\\" I sing along at the top of my lungs with \\"Strong Enough to Break\\". It's music that makes me feel, and that's what music is all about. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanson is Ok for 04","review":"1. Strong Enough To Break- I usually skip this song2. Dancin' In The Wind- Kind of sound like Guns N Roses or Aerosmith in the beginning3. Penny & Me- Not classic Hanson4. Underneath- Really good ballad reminds of \\"I Will Come To You\\"5. Misery- Zac isn't a great singer here6. Lost Without Each Other- Possibly one of the best on the album7. When You're Gone- This song SUCKS!!!!8. Broken Angel- Zac's voice shines on this song although he sound like Taylor9. Deeper- I hate Isaac but this is good Michelle Branch is great in the background10. Get Up And Go- Good song although it sound like \\"I Found A Way\\" By Drake Bell from Drake & Josh11. Crazy Beautiful- My favorite on the album has like a 60's feel to it12. Hey- This song is good I like at the end when Taylor tries to sound like Steven Tyler or Axl Rose with the screeching13.

A great album for any music lover's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Was Well Worth The Wait","review":"This has got to be on my favortie albums. There isn't one song on this album that I don't like. Hanson did the right thing in leaving their record label and forming their own. At the moment Broken Angel and Beleive are my favorites. I also enjoy Strong Enough To Break and Underneath. These two songs reflect the pain and struggle the band went through in order to make this album and release it. For everyone that says Hanson has not matured. Listen to the whole album and if you can watch the DVD because there you'll see the struggle, and heart and soul Hanson put into making this album. Hanson has defenitly matured."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT cd! =]","review":"Yes, I've been a fan for 7 years, but i've had my stages where I really liked them, and sometimes I wouldn't really ever listen to them. I went through the obsession stage, and just a few months ago I wasn't paying attention to Hanson. There new CD took a while to come out, but when it was released I immediately bought it. I was thouroughly impressed. Many people think of Hanson as the pop pand with the girly boys. Well, they've changed. They have a pop-ROCK sound now, and they're better than ever. Every song on this CD is wonderful. They're upbeat and make you want to get up and dance. If you haven't gotten this CD yet, your missing out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Biased, maybe, in love, for sure.","review":"I can proudly say I am a Hanson fan since 1997, ecspecially after hearing this album. I've been waiting for so long for their new release & I can safely say I was definitely not let down by this. Maybe it's the anticipation that has made this album sound so amazing to me but I can safely say that it isn't that, they are amazing. They been the only \\"boy-band\\" to write, play & produce their own stuff, that in itself is an accomplishment. Their talent really shines through in every song in this album. \\"Strong Enough to Break\\" is a great way to start the album, showcasing a more upbeat song & then sending us away with \\"Believe\\", a beautiful ballad. I love it. It's not just me liking them because I thought Taylor was \\"hott\\" back when, now that Taylor has a wife & children I know he is off limits & it makes me focus on the music which is, fantastic. 2 huge thumbs up for one of my favorite bands of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow....","review":"Hanson has really outdone themselves this time. These songs don't sound like the simplistic pop ballads we've come to expect from these guys. They touch a nerve and definitely show maturity. I think this is the best album they've put out so far!

(Or anyone else for that matter!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no word to describe it!!!!!!!!!","review":"This last CD just confirm that Hanson is an amazing band.

However, it seems to be missing the emotional, piercing songs of TTA and MoN. There is not \\"Song to Sing\\" or \\"Save Me.\\" The songs are catchy and move musically developed, but lack that hanson soul. The lyrics are also novice, more so than their previous albums. It's worth owning, no doubt, but don't be expecting to be completely blown away or compelled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs with depth","review":"This album is simply fantastic. Many of the songs may sound simplistic and just fun on the surface...but when you dig deeper and really listen, you find depth and insight that is truly refreshing. I've only had the album for a week or so, and it's already one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great move for some great music","review":"The guys in Hanson made the greatest move they could make by cutting the cord with Island and starting up 3CG. They did what they had to do to get the music they wanted out there, not what some big-money record company wanted, what they wanted. Their music. And it's some great music folks. They've grown and matured a lot over the years, evolved into a true rock band. The stand out songs are Underneath and Broken Angel. The passion and strain in Zac's voice in Angel make it such a beautiful song. The whole album is great though, there really isn't a flop song on it.Give them a shot, they're no longer the long-haired mmmboppin' kids you either loved or hated. They've kicked their bubblegum sound to the curb and have given us a pretty great rock album. I'm looking forward to future music from these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these guys","review":"I know they started as a boy band, but they are so much more than that.

Well if you think that you OVIOUSLY havent heard this CD yet, they sound is much more mature and very well put toghether. They are a rock band now, no more little pop kids (although i loved them when they were) their more grown up and just what youve been looking for. I garante that this CD will put you in a good mood, thats just the way there music is. I love Hanson and this CD is amazing, I know youll agree with me once you hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"hanson's best effort yet","review":"i have been loyal to hanson since \\"mmmbop\\", but i recognize that their earlier material can be hard for some folks to stomach. even if you hated \\"mmmbop\\", you just might like this album. these lads are so talented. they play their own instruments, write amazing music, and their tight harmonies are SO BEAUTIFUL. anyway, everybody i've talked to has had nothing but good things to say about this album and i have to agree. musically speaking, it's stellar. they won't disappoint their old fans, and they will certainly win new ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underneath-Brillant!","review":"Underneath in my opinion is some of Hanson'sbest work to date. These guys foughtreally hard to get this album out. Theypoured their sweat, tears and soulsinto these songs.This album definitly shows a more vulnerable side of these guys that we have not gotten to see before with songs like Believe and Broken Angel. At the same time though they haven't forgotten how to rock out with songs like Dancing in the Wind and Crazy Beautiful.This album really reflects the guys passion and lovefor music and that they are in this for the longhaul.Underneath is an album you want to have inyour collection of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Infinity...","review":"Alright folks. These three guys have really gotten their game on, and discovered what it takes to make it in the music business... after having built up a seemingly indestructable \\"girly boy band\\" image. This album is phenomenal, and sure to be enjoyed by any fan of the pop/power pop genre. I had the pleasure of spending some time with Zac, Isaac, and Taylor before a show a few months back... and they are genuinely nice, talented, and dedicated guys. Going into the show, their only appeal to me was \\"Ha! It's Hanson, this'll be hilarious!\\" Well, they blew me away, and rocked the house. I had no idea.

A good reader will really make or break a story and this one is wonderful. With al her different voices, she really brings the story to life. It's a beautiful story to listen to. Icy sparks, a young girl who people think is just crazy, has been undiagnosed wiht tourette's syndrome. Your hear the stories of her frustrations as she explores her disease and learns to live through it. A good mix of sadness and hapiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh for sobbing out loud, Oprah!","review":"When I'm reading a book and the number of pages yet unturned is getting alarmingly thin, I expect to have some hope of liking the main character. Or at least having some sympathy. It didn't happen here, which is odd, because in the beginning of the book, I did like Icy Sparks. It seems acceptable to me for a ten year old kid to be a bit self-centered and bratty. But at some point in a novel about growing up with a handicap, I expect the growing up part to actually happen.This is what I call a \\"coming to the realization\\" novel. The main character is exactly as obtuse when the action ends as she was when it began. Then the final ten pages or so sum up what she learned, and why she is now a fully functioning person. I found it annoying and preachy.To quote the redoubtable Dorothy Parker: \\"This is not a book to be tossed aside lightly. It should be flung with great force.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"... I wish I'd read the editorial reviews before I bought it. And because it is now an Oprah pick, I got the book out and wasted valuable time reading it, (trying to) again. It is a boring, distasteful read. I finished it because I couldn't believe a book that had been accepted for publication could be as bad as I thought, so therefore, it must, I reasoned, get better. It never did. At first I thought it must have started out as a case study of Tourettes and then someone had the bad idea to fictionalize it. Then I quit trying to characterize it. I don't know whether this book helps or hurts victims of Tourettes. The only person I ever knew with Tourettes was nothing like Icy Sparks -- he definitely lacked her rage (which was about the only real emotion the writer managed to convey in the whole book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I just did not believe the story. While I enjoyed some of the use of language, overall I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coming of age...","review":"This book claims to be about an tourette child and tempts the reader by offering insight into her life. What this novel really is is a coming of age novel of the blandest outline. Any depth of discovery into tourettes is brief and repetitive.The closing chapters were of the utmost disappointment. Rather than having the character find a therapist competent enough to diagnose the illness the author introduces the church and through Icy's new faith she musters the strength to persevere and the acceptance she has long desired.Though I don't doubt the power of faith, I think it demonstrates a lack of research on the author's behalf. People with psychological disorders have been failing at this approach for centuries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Missing","review":"I know I'm in the minority but I found it a struggle to get through this book. Not because of the subject matter, which could have been compelling, but because the writing, to me, seemed to get in the way of the storytelling. While I admired the author's obvious talent, it felt at times like wading through a writer's showcase rather than following a story line. It reminded me of some of the stuff I read (and wrote) in a college fiction writing class. A short story can bear the weight of descriptive detail, metaphor and imagery. I'm not so sure a novel can sustain its momentum with such heavy handed use of same. To me it felt as though the author was just a bit too immersed in exploring her gifts at the story's expense. Had an editor trimmed just a bit of the descriptive meandering, it would have made a huge difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ending was a dissapointment","review":"I loved this book up until the ending. I found it intresting mostly and I couldn't put it down for 3/4 of it. The ending was very Little House on the Prarie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"I liked the book (lots of good insight and determination on behalf of the unfortunate main character) until all of a sudden, this religious ending comes along. You have to suspend belief that she sees her dead grandfather; and then all of a sudden she gets into it all????? MALARKY! I can't believe a seemingly intelligently written book thoughout could all of a sudden turn into what it did. I think the Epilogue was good; perhaps if only that was used as the end, I would be less disappointed. What a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Flat and Disappointing","review":"Our book group chose to read \\"Icy Sparks\\" due to it's being an Oprah choice, and the reviews I had read made me look forward to this book. Not far into it, though, I found it very disappointing and one-dimensional. Although some parts are satisfying (her relationship with her grandparents), numerous characters are totally one-dimensional and unrealistic. The plot starts and stops at times, going nowhere. Her stay at the mental hospital seemed pointless. The end of the book sees her suddenly get religious, solving everything. I think this is most likely due to inexperience on the part of the author. Yet, she does seem to have promise in that her writing can flow very nicely and her descriptions at times are lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Icy Gal kept those pages turning!","review":"I laughed and cried while watching Icy Sparks grow up in the hills of Kentucky in the 1950's. As an orphan living with her grandparents, she was so real to me and I felt as though I knew this ten year old child. I could not wait to see what would happen to her next. I enjoyed her humorous dialogue and could actually see this child standing in front of me. With each chapter, I was never disappointed. The author's voice impressed me and made this a wonderful journey. Usually I read suspense books so this was different for me. I enjoyed Icy Sparks thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting insight into tourettes","review":"Having a child with tourettes, I read this book with interest trying to see, hear and feel what he feels. I enjoyed reading it and was, in fact, able to understand in a small way what she (and my son) might be thinking and feeling. It was a good read and is recommended by me to anyone curious about what goes on inside the head of a child with this neurological condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Oprah's Usual Picks.....","review":"Without fail I have enjoyed Oprah's choices and I purchase each as soon as they are announced. This is one I wish I had borrowed. The Appalachian setting provides a backdrop for the story of Icy who is afflicted with an unknown malady. We see her struggles with \\"croaking\\", eye popping, and the like as she grows up in a small community. This had the potential of a great story, but the plot lost me completely as Icy was continuously mistreated by the townspeople and teachers. I fail to believe that this many people could so badly treat anyone. Eventually even the Tourette's syndrome became hard to believe. The reader is led to understand that Icy could control her symptoms and that all her symptoms came over her at one time, lasting for an hour. Is this really how Tourette's inflicts itself? I have to agree with People magazine's review of this book. It seems to follow a \\"Pick me\\" formula to become an Oprah book - without the normal great story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our Discussion Group's thoughts...","review":"We were sadly disappointed in the weak, over-used one-dimensional characters who apparently had to be either nicey-nice or the vile and wicked in order to rate a mention in this story. We were likewise disappointed in the story line which made us feel that the author thought that coming from the Kentucky \\"hollers\\" or having hill country innocence (like the grandmother and grandfather) was almost criminal, instead of the circumstance that many found themselves in. While we never regret reading any book, it was difficult to find something good to say about this one. We did, however, came up with the fact that this book clearly shows that any town can be made up of lot's of very \\"different\\" people which in it's own way makes us all \\"normal\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"What started off as a good premise, never fullfilled its potential. We ever feel the experience, just get a narration of the main character's life. The relationship between the young girl and her grandparents makes a pleasant tale but certainly not a compeling one. The manifestations of Tourette Syndrome are never clearly detailed. The book gives the impression that the disorder comes and goes (especially when convenient for the plot of the book). Perhaps the author make a mistake writing in the first person, as the young girl. How can the reader feel and understand the emotions of the characters when the narrater is only able to relay events with minimal emotion. The ending of the book was especially disappointing and I took it as an easy way out. Beware...just because a book is in Oprah's Book Club does not make it good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blindsided by the church","review":"A seemingly unrelatable child struggling with an undiagnosed case of Tourette's in a remote mountain town has an amazing spirit that enraptured me as a reader. The people that float into her life throughout the book seem to feel the same way. I enjoyed it.275 pages later? BAM! Her now diagnosed Tourette's is a gift from God, and her seemingly agnostic grandparents and herself have found Jesus, and the world is good. It was like watching a news segment that starts with Brian Williams and ends with Bill O'Reilly. The stark contrast and abrupt shift was unwelcome, at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was just OK until the end when it turned awful. Icy goes to a revival and things take a weird religious turn. Either the author has a religious agenda or she came up with that ending just to get the book done. I had to MAKE myself finish it after that. I can't believe all of the good ratings on this book. This is the second book in Oprah's Book Club that I found awful and I'm just not willing to sit through another one of her bad picks. Seriously, don't waste your time with terrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of reserach","review":"Not much research had been done by the writer part with regards to Tourette syndrome. It was briefly discussed in this book. I could not helped myself from ommiting the last few chapters of the book.It seems to me that the writer had directed all his/her attention in discussing chapters and chapters on how the church services had helped icy sparks in her recovering process. Had this amount of effort being directed on the topic on \\"Tourette syndrome\\", it would be definately be a much better book to invest your time and money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Book with Horrible Ending","review":"I agree with Heather. I forced myself to get through this book, mostly because once I start one, I hate to end it without finishing it. The characters in this book were \\"okay\\" but everything seemed so overdramatized and quite frankly the most touching character was Patanni, in my opinion. I kept going through the book hoping for at least a great ending to tie it all up and make it worth it, but alas I was subjected to three chapters of bible beating and \\"Praise the Lord Jesus....\\" eighty thousand times. Plus, I think I know the words to every Christian hymn, and I'm not even Christian! Just a highly disappointing ending, one that left me feeling even more disconnected from the main character. Rent it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Icy Sparks","review":"This book was shockingly funny. I belong to a book club and this was a selection and I must say it was very funny from beginning to end even though I am not too sure whether I liked the ending or not but I do recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Icy Sparks","review":"I fell in love with Icy Sparks and her loving family. Icy represents a part in all of us that sometimes just cannot help doing what we know is wrong and yet loving ourselves regardless. The reader is a witness to her disorder, which at the time, doctors did not how to treat. Lessons of life for all of us are inscribed in this masterful novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is extremely boring","review":"Sure you could read this book... Or you could repeatedly push toothpicks into your navel. Sure you could read this book... Or you could walk outside and start screaming abuse at passers by. This is what you will feel like doing after reading this book.Save yourself the time and money of reading this book. You can't possibly imagine the prolific boredom you will experience if you attempt to read this book.The author could not hold my attention for more than a few sentences and even they were hard to bare. To summarize: This book would make a great doorstop if it were heavy enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A disturbing journey","review":"This book is a disturbing journey into the life of a young woman with Tourette's syndrome. The character developement of this girl is thorough. The way the author describes the tics and the other indications of Tourette's are very believable and well done. Overall I think that this book is definitely worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big let down","review":"i bought this book because it was one of oprahs book club recommendation,although it's a small book it took me over a week to read it, it justed didn't hold my interest, it seemed to drag on and on. i just don't feel like i came away with anything, a sad story it's true but that's about the extent of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance","review":"After the first few chapters I really struggled to continue reading. I agree with a number of other reviews that it lacked depth and purpose after those first few chapters. I have purchased many of the \\"Oprah\\" book club books and found this the most disappointing or all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly sentimental and amateurish","review":"I agree that the subject matter is compelling, but the writing was a big disappointment. It seems that the author just gave up at certain points, such as when Icy gets out of the mental hospital. She's medicated to the point of oblivion for a couple of weeks and then suddenly she's ready to go home? The ending left much to be desired as well. It turned into a syrupy bit of self-congratulation at the end, with Icy \\"embracing\\" her difference. I was extremely irritated and disappointed by this book, but I do think that people who liked Forrest Gump would enjoy it immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book, poor ending","review":"I really enjoyed most of this book, but the last couple of chapters went downhill quickly. I did not like how everything turned to religion in the end. Icy was a very likeable character and I wanted to know more about what was done for her diagnosis of Tourette's Syndrome, if anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I found this on a bargain rack and was surprised to see it was an Oprah's book club pick. I was excited to find it so cheap. Having only read one Oprah's book club pick (Wally Lamb's She's Come Undone, which was excellent), I guess I wasn't well informed. The reader for the book was pretty awful, and the dialogue is unconvincing at best and unbelievable at worst. The story is disjointed, with characters popping in and out at random and the plot is very predictable. I only give it two stars because as an audio book, it was mildly interesting. I would have never stuck it out in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to force myself to finish reading this","review":"I bought this book before a week-long vacation and had to force myself to read it. I thought it was absolutely miserable. I felt no compassion whatsoever for the main character. I normally like memoir-type or first-person point of view books, but Icy Sparks did not interest me whatsoever. I wasn't fond of the writing style. This book proved to me that you can slap an Oprah's Book Club label on any garbage, but it doesn't make it worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ICY SPARKS DID NOT CREATE SPARKS","review":"Read the Amazon.com and Kirkus Review book reviews before you consider purchasing this title. I did not find Icy winsome or interesting and the church revival meeting, where Icy encounters Jesus, and has an \\"epiphany\\" about loving herself was just too much. I think the book had potential, but I was disappointed not to see it realized. I would NOT recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragggggggggs On","review":"This book was too slow. The chapters needed to be more inviting, that is, into the life of Icy Sparks. Even though the author does give some good detail into the mind of Icy, it still lacked alot. It took me longer to read this novel then others, it just didn't excite me. The end was a disappointment. The only thing I did enjoy, was the character of Icy's friend, \\"Miss Emily\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not a page turner.","review":"I bought this book in an attempt to read more. And, generally Ienjoyed the books from Oprah's book club (the bluest eye, black and blue, she comes undone, and now icy sparks). However, this book was very slow paced and bored me at times. I thought that it was way too sentimental and I don't believe I learned anything about Tourette's Syndrome that didn't already know. I especially despised the over religious ending and wondered where it came from and why did it have to continue so long. It took me a couple of weeks to finish this book and I wished I had saved my money and borrowed it from the public library.However, I did enjoy Icy's interaction with Peavy Lawson. And there were some funny aspects concerning Mrs. Stilton and Wilma the evil nurse aide. I was thankful that the book was only 300 pages long so that is another positive for Icy Sparks. Lastly, borrow this book DON'T buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Lacking In \\"Real\\" Appalachia","review":"This story was very touching and warm. The writer does an excellent job of putting us in poor Icy's seat in the classroom and on our knees beside her in the cellar. However, I was disappointed in her inability to capture the real heart and language of rural Appalachia. The writer puts words in the mouths of these folk that could only come from an outsider. I realize that the dialect would be incredibly difficult to write (or read for that matter). Yet, the writing drifts in and out of the dialect in such a distracting way that it merits mention. The words, stories, expressions and characters of the natives of the rural Kentucky Appalachian Mountains are remarkably colorful and deserve equal attention as whatever story they are being used to tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book In A Long Time","review":"This book touched my thoughts and heart in a way no book has done in a long time. If you love to read about trials and triumps in a person's life, you will love Icy Sparks.It begins with a little girl, only 10 years old, who lives with her grandparents on their farm. Her parents have died leaving her with her grandparents.The farm is located in the mountains very isolated from other people. Icy suffers from(what we know now as)Tourette Syndrome. Because of her strange actions, she is eventually taken out of school and sent away to a state hospital. I believe Icy grew by the experiences she had while hospitalized. She also made friends she would not have had that helped her as she grew to be a woman.The story is sad when Icy is treated in cruel ways and mean things are said about her. But, I wanted to stand and cheer when she gained victory over the obstacles placed before her. She is a true inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Book","review":"What a triumph of the human spirit. Icy is such a great character, and her development shows the talent of this writer. She is a child with turrets during a time when little is known about this disease and it is considered a disability. Despite her differences and the adversity she must face, she manages to make a difference in those lives who allow her to come in. She is such a sweet, smart girl, and has so much to give to readers, and to those characters lives she touches. This is a book that will make you smile, and be thankful for what you have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, Bland and Forgettable","review":"I was very excited about reading this book as I was intrigued about how the author would protray a Tourette's syndrome sufferer. After 300 pages of bland dialogue and transparent characters, I do not know any more about the disease than I did before. Rubio's descriptions on Icy's tics are very thin and mainly consist in her using the phares, \\"Croak\\" repeatedly. She does not make us feel the true impact of the condition or allow is to understand what it is like to be a sufferer.All the characters in this book are such predictable sterotypes--the kind grandparents, the sympathetic nurse, the mean school children. Even the other patients in the hospital have been seen before in many different guises.Having recently moved from the South, I was looking forward to reading a novel set in rural Kentuky, but this portrays so little of the personality of the region that it could be set anywhere. All in all, a very disappointing read and I wish I had saved my time and my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dag Nabit, this one didn't do it for me","review":"Read this on vacaction - it was an OK read. I learned more about a disorder that for some reason we didn't study much in psychology courses (maybe it was too new when I was in college). I had a little trouble connecting with the characters and culture the author tried to represent. I typically enjoy books that expose me to different dialects and cultures. I do like southern novels but some drive me crazy (like the Ya Ya Sisterhood variety). This one, \\"dag nabit\\", just didn't do it for me. I would give it a 2.5 if amazon would allow half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was rather disappointed ....","review":"This book definitely left me wanting ... wanting a better plot and certainly a more satisfying ending. I liked the author's 'style' but the this book was not worth the [money]..paperbacks are far to [pricey] these days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah was wrong about this one!!","review":"I have read and enjoyed other Oprah books but this one was so bad that I found myself laughing out loud or rolling my eyes in disbelief over the author's one-dimensional characters and overall ignorance about Tourettes syndrome. This book was written on an adolescent level; it lacks any depth and substance. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit on page #50","review":"I hate it when a book is so bad that you just can't read another page. I felt like this book was going to get somewhere but it was too boring to try to get to that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Icy Sparks","review":"I didn't even finish this book because I found it too boring. Maybe if I would have kept reading it would have picked up a little, but I wasn't feeling patient enough. I wouldn't exactly reccomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfocused and Pointless","review":"When I first heard that Oprah chose a coming of age story about a child with Tourette's, I was excited. I have not read a fiction book about Tourette's Syndrome. Unfortunately, this book was a huge disappointment. The story seemed to ramble without a clear point, then ended abruptly with an irrelevant conclusion. Bad storytelling aside, I did not appreciate Rubio's depiction of Tourette's. In my mind, she treated Icy more as a freak rather than a child who was confused by her special need and treated poorly by others as a result. I was hoping that, being an Oprah book, this would open people's eyes to special needs issues. Instead, I am left hoping that people do not take Rubio's depictions of special needs and Tourette's to heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watery Fizzles-might be more apt","review":"Interesting premise but poorly written with a weakly executed plot. Yet another addition to the southern-poetry of rural- poverty genre; this one doesn't work as well as others. At times the novel seemed like an excuse for Ms. Rubio to trot out her zingy one-liners--I returned the book to the library so I can't provide any actual examples. An easy enough read--so if you're curious about the story go ahead and give it a go, just don't expect anything spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ice Sparks","review":"This book began with great promise but didn't go anywhere interesting. The character seemed interesting but there was no development of the main character in a way that made me care about what happened to her one way or the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Teenagers!","review":"Icy Sparks was great. I am a 14 year old girl who likes to read \\"adult\\" books because \\"teenage\\" book are not interesting. Icy Sparks taught me that it doesn't matter what I look like or what I do. A must for teenage girls!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, dull middle, contrived ending","review":"I have to agree with the many readers who wrote that the book completely loses steam and then comes to an abrupt and unrealistic ending. The initial descriptions of the oncoming Tourette's, rendered in Icy's voice, are good. Unfortunately, the dialog is not very compelling and after we meet the rest of Icy's world, the book becomes tedious. And the ending makes no sense at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Terrible","review":"This is one of the worst books that I have ever read. I should have quit after the first few chapters, but kept thinking that it might get better. Don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"second half - what a bore!","review":"The first part of the book was very interesting...but, the second half was too boring for me to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"On the surface, this novel brings you into the twitching and croaking body of a girl suffering Tourette Syndrome, but the book's real magic is its power to actually induce narcolepsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"This book started off on a good note and was interesting for the first 20 - 30 pages or so. After that, it seemed to merely be an attempt by Rubio to show that she could write descriptively, ad infinitum, without contributing anything to a real plot. Icy's story became boring quickly. Many of the characters Rubio introduced served little purpose and simple events were granted far more description than warranted. Some of those events were valueless to the story.The aim of the book, (exploring Tourette's Syndrome) missed its mark. Icy Sparks is a forgettable character as were most of the characters in this story. Peppering a story with multiple characters for the sake of merely having a large cast does not serve the reader except to confuse and frustrate.However, since this was Rubio's first attempt, I intend to read more by her in the hope that she's honed her craft. She certainly displays a strong potential to be a very good author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book is just flat out terrible. The first 30 or so chapters are just about Icy, and her dealing with having Tourette Syndrome, but then at the end, it just takes a religious turn. Rubio writes it so it sounds like it is religious propaganda for the Pentecostal church. She basically says that anyone can get healed there, and that Icy finds God and then suddenly gets healed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senseless babble","review":"A completely redundant portrayal of a very uninteresting girl. I kept waiting for it to get \\"good\\" and it just never happens. The story goes in circles. Don't let all of the good reviews on the cover fool you, this book is a flop. You are wrong Oprah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living Icy's Life","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Icy understands what happens when one can no longer take for granted the simple functioning of one's nervous system.I highly recommend this book, and really enjoyed the way Icy's story (and how she got her name!) was told."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL, SENSITIVE AND HEARTWARMING","review":"Set in the 1950's, the story is that of a Icy Sparks who at the age of ten becomes aware that all is not right with her world. Suffering from Tourettes Syndrome, she is taunted by her classmates, humiliated by her teacher and shunned by those who do not understand her affliction. The story gives the reader a clear indication of what it is like to grow up financially poor and lonely, but to be rich in strength and character. While I will agree that some of the characters were weak, I found the story, itself, to be extremely moving, inspirational, heartwarming and certainly well worth reading. If you only see the negative aspects, you are missing something very rare and wonderful about the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"This book is what I would describe as a \\"squirmy\\" read. It made me very uncomfortable. I had almost no sympathy for the main character. It sort of reminded me of \\"She's Come Undone\\". In both books, the main character was so miserable and bitter it was hard to feel bad for her. I think L.A. Law did a much better job portraying Tourette's. I felt bad for that guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this was a great book!","review":"One of the things you have to keep remembering about this book is that it takes place in the 1950's. You really get a feel for what kids/adults with disabilities had to go through back then and how far (hopefully) we've come with understanding and caring for those who happen to have a disability. I cried at times and I laughed at times! I also liked the fact that Icy learned to control her disability without medication (I know this isn't always possible) and it was evident that she became worse when she was distressed in some way. Really enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just \\"OK\\" for me.","review":"This is the first novel I have read in about 15 years. I am really not into reading novels. I prefer non-fiction, however I was going on vacation and chose this book to read as a time filler. It was interesting but very long winded and too much detail in some of the chapters. I found myself skimming through to get to the relevent parts. I could have stopped reading it in the last few chapters and not even wondered how it ended. Not what I would call a \\"can't put it down\\" book. I did finish it and felt glad to be done with it. I really cannot recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story, easy read","review":"I liked this author's writing style and felt like I knew the characters. The Revival part became a little annoying as it seemed to go on for too long in the story. I enjoyed reading about Icy as a young girl, turning into a young woman and falling in love for the first time. I am not upset that there wasn't a whole lot of info regarding TS in this book as it takes place in the 1950s and evidently in this backwoods part of Kentucky, nothing was really known about it then, which is why Icy ended up in a mental institution for children. It might have been nice if the MD at the institution could have diagnosed this and gave more info regarding this condition, but I won't hold it against the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and trite","review":"I bought Icy Sparks because Oprah recommended it. Now I wonder what she could have been thinking. This is some of the most contrived, trite, cliched and redundantly written prose I have ever read. Pursing lips, heads whipping back and forth, fists thumping chests, pointing fingers, stomping feet -- Argh! Halfway through this book, I got the feeling that the author was determined to write a book about a character with Tourette's Syndrome and strain her way through it no matter how stiff and unrealistic it became. I very rarely stop reading a book, but I am tempted not to finish this one. The only reason I'm staying with it is to learn what poor writing is like, and hopefully, not to make the same mistakes. Gwyn Hyman Rubio is a wonderful writing teacher -- in reverse. (If she can get a book like this published, I know there's hope for me.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting.","review":"This book took a total turn in the end and I ultimately didn't even finish it.

To the person who wrote the following, are you just clueless? He writes, in part:The title of the book is More Than Money, but judging from the relentless, shameless plugging of his own book on his own show, it's clearly all about the money to the pudgy-faced Mr. Cavuto, and selling his book. This book is literary pablum, and I'm being generous by even using the word literary, etc. etc.This reviewer is so completely WRONG, I have to say that you must be completely stupid. And to insult Neil Cavuto by referring to his face, I wonder what you look like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair and balanced","review":"True to FoxNews' promise of 'fair and balanced' reporting, Cavuto presents extraordinary people from the right and the left, and gives his thoughts on why they have achieved their successes. This book is inspirational and interesting - I kept thinking: if these people could be successful in spite of all the obstacles they faced, I certainly ought to be ashamed for feeling powerless in my own life. I did find myself wishing for an in-depth biography of people like Herb Kelleher, Roger Ailes and Barbara Corcoran - and I kept wishing that I knew these people - and Cavuto himself - personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just think Neil is cool.","review":"I watch this dude every time I get a chance. He's cool. His show is intelligent and balanced. It's relaxed but not lazy.

I am honored that my book is connected to Neil's. I would like nothing more than to be on his show-- heck I might even offer up my controversial social-policy opinions or something like that.Anyway, Neil is the man. Watch him. Buy this book. Seriously, buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste Of Money","review":"The title of the book is More Than Money, but judging from the relentless, shameless plugging of his own book on his own show, it's clearly all about the money to the pudgy-faced Mr. Cavuto, and selling his book. This book is literary pablum, and I'm being generous by even using the word literary. Fortunately, I was sent a promotional copy of the book for free which is precisely what it's worth. I completed the book in a couple hours and really did not find much inspiration in what I read.

I really enjoy listening to this album, especially Suckpump. Another good thing about these cd's is that they come together for the price of one. The only drawback are the tracks of soundbytes and other noises, I just see these tracks as filler and Teknowhore has most of these filler tracks. My favorite tracks would have to be Head, I Reject and Get Out.

I went to see it wioth my surf club and we had a great time. Even non-surfers would greatly enjoy this movie, it's funny and at the same time it really taught me some life lessons, not just surfing ones. I would reccomend it to anyone.

And it *is* the ULTIMATE sport!

The footage that you see is really spectacular, but....It's more than the waves, it's more than the beauty of Tahiti, more than the great lakes of Wisconsin, even more than the shipping channel of Texas. It's about a journey of life. This documentary on surfing is very touching. Thank you to Dana Brown for bringing such a magnificant video into our generation.I am very impressed by the time and energy spent making this video. So much so that I have taken a back seat on the opinions I have about my future and life. There are some movies that you just watch, then there are movies that are life changing. This is that movie. You will be amazed....I have never touched a board in my life. I know now that I will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alternative title: \\"Step Into a Cesspool of Sentiment\\"","review":"Seriously this is spilling over with random opinions and ramblings of personal experience.

This is an overly-sentimental piece of sh*t. Some, and only some, of the visuals are really incredible (the tow-in scenes)..the rest is a feel-good, surfers-are-awesome waste of time. I love to surf...for my own reasons. It's not because I need to feel like a part of a big \\"community\\". For authentic, thought-provoking surf films, check out \\"thicker than water\\", \\"brokedown melody\\" and \\"september sessions\\".

High concept production with a kickin soundtrack to match, just try to watch it only once.Excellent additional features, interviews, outtakes, how a surfboard is made, and on.

I would have enjoyed a greater depth to the killer surf locations and technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"newer is better","review":"Step into Liquid is much better than The Endless Summer in every way.

I mean all of the footage comes from other surf movies that are much much better, and it does not go into enough depth about the strapped crew. It says that laird hamilton and dave kalama are the onlt two apart of the crew, but there are about 10 more surfers in the actual crew. I have to say that also the guy who made this film did not do it very well. I mean you would expect Bruce Browns's son to make a better surf movie than this. (Bruce Brown made one of the best surf films of all time \\"The Endless Summer\\" series. Sorry but the person who made this film should know more about surfing before they make a film on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never really thought of suicide until after this movie","review":"This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen in my LIFE.

I felt like I had encountered Dave Barry, Carl Hiassen, and Art Buchwald all rolled into one very funny writer.I won't repeat all the accolades written by other reviewers. I will say that I finished the book on 7/30/08, and we were boarding a plane for New Zealand/Australia on 10/26/08. A wonderful trip inspired by a great travel book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Join the 'roos!","review":"Absolutely outstanding tour of down under. Definitely a page-turner. I couldn't wait to see where he was going next. His wit and candor is unsurpassed. Certainly makes me want to take a trip to Australia for several months!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Insightful","review":"In a Sunburned Country is combines comical anecdotes with historical informaiton. Although less kneeslappingly funny than \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" it is a solid account of Australia. By all accounts, Bill Bryson is all praise for Australia, and as a result the humor is less cutting and sarcastic than it is in some of his other novels.I would suggest waiting for this book to come out in paperback before purchasing it. It is hilarious in parts and extremely informative in others. It's a solid pick for lovers of travel literature [or Bill Bryson]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"This is one of those rare reading treats that is both very informative and very entertaining. If Australia weren't 20 hours away, by tedious and uncomfortable air flight, you'd want to leave today. But its remoteness is really what saves Australia and makes it unique -- as Bill Bryson very deliciously makes clear. My only real quibbles are the lack of a good overall map of Australia, making resort to a world atlas necessary, and the absence of an index and table of contents. Incidentally, the rather rudimentary maps that are included are on unnumbered and unreferenced pages at the front of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chipper, entertaining travel book","review":"Bill Bryson is always entertaining, because he's a good storyteller with a) a genuine appreciation for quirky characters and b) an un-cynical gee-whiz attitude. In other words, he gets a kick out of stuff, and the reader can't help but share the feeling. It's like listening to Click and Clack on CarTalk.In this case, Bryson dashes around Australia appreciating its marvels, in particular its happy, open-hearted people and its physical and biological weirdness, its size and its ongoing relative obscurity vis a vis the rest of the world. He seems to try to take on the question of the aborigines and to feel guilty for not really doing so -- they and their tragedy are too much for his chipper little travel book to encompass, so he more or less gives up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Surprise","review":"The day after I'd ordered it, the new Bryson was given a mediocre review in the N.Y. Times. I'd've ordered it anyway since I'm a big fan but, in fact, my vague disquiet arising from Maslin's negativity simply added to my utter joy as I read In a Sunburned Country. It may not be as non-stop-laugh-out-loud as some of his others but it's far superior to A Walk in the Woods & I certainly guffawed every couple of pages. As often happens with him, things are most amusing when he just shares his thoughts: his variations on Waltzing Matilda are worthy of being compared to the bawdier works of Robert Burns. He does indulge in some more sober contemplation similar to his cantankerous observations in earlier books but since I agree with most of his opinions, I used those moments to catch my breath for the next upbeat section. As often happens with his material, there are parts I can't 'share with friends' because I'm laughing too hard to read the passages. It's Bryson at his very nearly best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!","review":"This book was amazing. His American view on the life and times of what Australia considers a day to day life is informative in so many ways, yet laugh out loud humorous."},{"rating":"2","title":"a \\"must read\\" for anyone visiting Australia","review":"Bill Bryson offers the introspection of a professional journalist and the personal introspection of a guy who finds himself in new situations that serve to test his endurance. How often I thought to myself while reading the book\\" Hey, that could be me!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging introduction to Austrailia","review":"Bryson has a knack for using humor to liven his sometimes mundane travel stories. I learned a lot about Austrailia while having a lot of fun just being entertained. His tales always contain many anecdotes that breath life into them, where many travel guides are mostly a collection of facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryson's Best","review":"I've read several of Bryson's books, and this one is probably my favorite. On several occasions I found myself laughing out loud at the situations he describes. His love for the land and the people is evident here, but that doesn't keep him from poking fun at what he finds in both. The Australia he describes is both hilarious and a force to be reckoned with, a home away from home and a place of danger.The previous review I read warned that this book was not for the tourist. Bryson clearly didn't intend for this book to be a travel guide, but I would challenge that notion. No, In a Sunburned Country isn't going to tell you what to see, when to see it, and how to get there. But it is a delightful insight into the land and people down under that any potential visitor would profit from reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read.","review":"It was a delightfully painless travel read. Very well researched, a lot of background but the the anecdotes were so humorous that it was very hard to put down. Yes, Bill Bryson is information And Entertaining.Thank you, Bill. Now do the same for New Zealand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read","review":"Quirky and fun, like many of Bryson's books. I read it while I was traveling in Australia and it was better than my tour books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read and Go","review":"I bought a copy for my wife and I to read on our trip to Australia. It was so fun to read it together on the plane and really gave us a great perspective of this long ignored country. Bill Bryson is a great writer combining factual information with the humor of his adventures in researching for this book. Through this you gain a love for this country and the people within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep them coming!","review":"Bill Bryson's account of his trip to Australia is fantastic! He travels the country, sharing fascinating tidbits of history in every location he stops in. This book was about 98 percent as entertaining as \\"A Walk in the Woods\\", although that book is still my favorite travel book of all time. Still, after reading this book, if I had the money and the time, I'd go to Australia tomorrow with this book as my guide!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed The Length and Breadth of Australia","review":"This is an amzing book. I bought it before the Olympics, stopped when the Games started... and didn't pick it up again (a few thousand other books and activities got in the way.)Look, if you want to get all the details on Australia or any other subject that Bryson has covered, then buy the typical guidebook.If, on the other hand, you want to share the experiences and interests of a brilliant, humorous, and above all else, curious, human being (who can write with the brief clarity of Kurt Vonnegut), then buy this book!As a younger man, before the metal in my back, etc etc, I would have wanted to run or bicycle across countries. Now, walking is fine by me. In fact, reading this kind of book is enough exploration for my life now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one thing could have made this book better","review":"The book didn't disappoint. Bryson was pretty much at his best. I sure could have used a Katz fix, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"Picked up this book after having heard it was funny, informative, and easy to read. Within the first few pages i became disillusioned! It's hard not to be really, when Mr Bryson refers to spiders as insects, and in his initial segment to point out \\"some facts\\", states that Australia is a single island continent. I'd be curious as to which continent New Zealand belongs to then? Maybe Australasia ceased to be in the day he lost crossing the date line? Having spent over a quater of a year in Oz some of his comments managed to make me chuckle, especially regarding Red Back Spiders, but on the whole i was disappointed. At the price, i'm not inspired to buy another of his titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio CD review: His prose is annoying when spoken aloud","review":"You get your money's worth here--there are a ton of CDs in this audio book. Unfortunately, I found Bryson's prose (which I enjoyed a lot when reading silently, as I have done with his other books) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud. To me, he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts, and sometimes there is a sort of \\"moist\\" sound when he pronounces words. Hard to describe until you hear the CD, but trust me on this one. I think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book, and not the CD. I would stick with the written word on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted time","review":"We are visiting Australia soon and a friend, who, like us, had enjoyed his A Walk in the Woods and Everything You Wanted to Know ..., recommended this book about Australia. It was not really worth the price. Noted only a few things in the book which prompted me to want to visit or look further into them, like the abuse of the Aboriginals. Otherwise, prettty much a waste of time. My wife decided to give up on the book and didn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheated","review":"This book has the exactly same content (word by word) with another Bill Bryson's book under the title 'Down Under'I searched both books thoroughly and neither of them said anything about another book with the exactly content as itself.I bought both and felt CHEATED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay Retail for This Book! Just Get It!","review":"If you have ever been to Australia, or if you have always wanted to go, this book is a must. With unfailing good nature, Bill Bryson captures the essential wonder, delight, tragedy and awe of the land Down Under. I finished this book with the same mixture of delight and regret that I felt as my Qantas 747 took off from Kingsford Smith airport to return me to the US. Bryson captures the paradox of Australia with wit and clarity and with a distinctive point of view. A delightful read, perfect for the summer and for anyone who has been captured by the allure of Oz."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Que Sera Sera\\"","review":"I checked this out of the library and read it on the way to Australia to visit my daughter during her study abroad semester in Brisbane. She read it while we sailed the Whitsundays and dove on the Great Barrier Reef - well, not when we we actually in the water. Before whe started reading it, in conversations I regularly sited Bryson having commented on many of our topics, by saying something, \\"Just like in the book,\\" or, \\"Bryson talks about that in the book.\\" A little like Seinfeld having done so many topics, that we live parts of them in our daily lives. Anyway, we left the book on a plane. So, I'll buy a copy for the library and one for me - money well spent. It was a great introduction and punctuated much of the trip. A bus driver in Brisbane was actually whistling \\"Que Sera Sera,\\" which,I think, was mentioned in the book. I'll find out when I read it again. I'd read Bryson's Sort History of Nearly Everything a couple of years ago. It's also a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet Another Positive Review","review":"I'd rate this somewhere between a 4 and 5. I read this book before a recent trip to Australia and found Mr. Bryson's comments about both the country and the people to be right on the mark. Additionally he has a great sense of humor. I saw Australians reading the book, perhaps the ultimate endorsement. Althought I only went to major cities, Mr. Bryson made me want to go deep into the continent. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheated","review":"This book has the exactly same content (word by word) with another Bill Bryson's book under the title 'In a Sunburned Country'.I searched both books thoroughly and neither of them said anything about another book with the exactly content as itself.I bought both and felt CHEATED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected much better.","review":"Disappointing.The book seemed rushed, and Bryson too easily reverts to stereotypical Australian characteristics as his subject matter.He provides very few intuitive insights into the foibles and quirks of the locals, as canbe found in so many of the other books that he's produced. That could possibly be put down to the fact that he has not lived in Australia, and as he appears to have been in some haste to get through his travels in this country, it's perhaps not surprising that he would come out of it with nothing more than a superficial view."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bookshop tour","review":"Billy Bryson is a talented writer. He just needs to get out of his car more.I just finished this book, and although the writer's patter could make acupuncture interesting, the lack of effort in this one is staggering.Billy prefers to write about huge walks in safe city suburbs, visiting bookshops and coffee shops, oh and museums.Maybe all those things are impossible in the US..Maybe it is all those dangerous critters that kept him on the narrow path..I really don't think he needs to travel to write at this level. It seems he could do this without treading outside of his study.Most of this book is paraphrased from other books ( a large bibliography is tell tale), and the personal content is stuff not worthy of print.In A Sunburnt Country he barely steps out of his car, except for when he doesn't have a car and is walking the streets.I do not recommend this to anyone. It is a lazy effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"did the sun get to his head?","review":"I can only suggest that if you've heard that Bryson is funny, you really want to check out his earlier books \\"The Lost Continent\\" (about a trip through the US) and \\"Neither Here nor There\\" (about a trip through Europe). His keep-it-moving gather-no-moss travel style is ill-suited to Australia, which is simply so sparsely populated over so much of the continent as to be absurd -- and yet he never comments on the absurdity of his choice. This book is, by comparison to his earlier efforts, a big old snoozer -- skip this one in favor of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and self indulgent","review":"Where has the earlier Bill Bryson gone? While I found \\"Notes from a small island\\" amusing and light hearted, and \\"I'm a stranger here myself\\" a well written collection of anecdotes, I've had to put this book down apart 1/3 way through.Gone is most of the humor and light style of his earlier work. This book seems intent on rehashing the same points time and again, and on giving a cultural and historical lecture.I definitely do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite get it","review":"Bills writing isn't in dispute. But he does miss the magic of Australians. In reading this I was both offended and bewildered, wondering what country is he in? Sadly this is such a two-dimensional view on Australia that it grieves me to read it as an Australian. I'm saddened this is what an outsider thinks of my country."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for an awesome country","review":"I really enjoyed this book. II was so surprised when my grandparents bought me a book about Australia. I have always wanted to go there. This year our class is doing an international track where we do projects on our country, and so I'm putting this book on display."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it with a map","review":"I loved it. The history, the current state, the humor, Bill does it all. I feel like I've been there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Bryson Gem!","review":"I can honestly say that I couldn't put this book down. It really is a great read, full of typical Brysonesque humour that left me giggling like an idiot at the most inopportune times (train, bus, etc). Bill obviously loves Australia & initially was strangely complimentary to the land down under (Call me suspicious but I though maybe the Aussie edition was watered down). However after covering enormous distances in difficult conditions whilst fending off a multitude of dangerous creatures, Bill finally warmed to the task of 'taking the mickey'out of the locals and local events (e.g. sheep shagging. Hey Bill I don't knock your hobbies! ). This is a fun book and well worth buying. Grab a copy before they're all gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one, mate!","review":"I've been reading a lot of Bill Bryson, and let me tell you, plain and simple: this is his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Land of Oz","review":"I'm an Australian living in Los Angeles and whenever I hear of a friend planning to visit \\"the old country\\" I buy them a copy of this book. It's a fun read (I must read it again myself!) and great preparation for their trip. Bill Bryson is easy to read and maybe it's his years spent living in UK but he seems to have developed an Australian-style sense of humour (Australian, British - we all sound alike to you!) which makes this book an even better introduction to the Sunburned Country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Travel Stories","review":"Bill Bryson is hilarious. I was given this book as a gift right before I left for my first trip to Australia. My only regret is that I didn't have time to read it all before planning the trip. Bryson gives great hilarious insight into several key destinations on the continent."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very entrtaining read","review":"I gave this book a big rating for a number of reasons, firstly as an American Bill writes with a turn of phrase more like an English writer which I really enjoyed, then as an Australian who has visited most of the places he wrote about I found it a very humorous read, his description of all the dangerous creatures that could do you harm had me laughing out loud, of course they exist but no-one ever allows them to limit their enjoyment of the outdoor activities. I found the interesting facts about the multitude and diversity of ancient fossils that abound in the remote areas of this amazing country. Finally, I would like to thank Bill for hours of enjoyment having read most of his very entertaining books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryson is a delightful travel guide!","review":"Bill Bryson is rarely reverent, but nearly always wonderfully humorous and very informative. He gives you the details when they are necessary, and the humor in generous quantities!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe to Read in Public, but Good Anyway","review":"While not as funny as his previous books, it is so well-written that it is still a joy to read. Missing, however, is the danger of strangers thinking you to be insane as you read the book in public laughing hysterically to yourself. Too bad. Not quite 5 stars, but I'd give it 4 1/2 if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Bryson's least funny book.","review":"I'm a huge Bill Bryson fan, so I preordered his latest book and was pretty disappointed. The research, as always, is meticulous, but there wasn't one page that had any big roaring laughs on it, which is what makes his other books such standouts among travel literature. No weird encounters with sheep shearers or people at laundrymats or anything. I really felt that Mr. Bryson was just plodding through a pretty boring writing assignment--either that, or he has truly become very middle-aged. Next time, I hope he brings along Steve Katz or maybe one of his own children to lighten things up again. Read this book if you want to learn a lot about Australia's explorers, Aborigines, minerals, plant and animal life, but if you want to really have fun, read any of his other travel books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOL","review":"I was given this book while visiting Sydney. The title of the book in AUS is \\"Down Under\\" I guess they didn't want to offend anyone. Anyhow, I spent many days laughing out loud while reading this book....absolutely brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must read\\" before a trip to OZ","review":"You MUST read this book before your travels to OZ. It could even help you plan your itinerary. Bill Bryson's writing and wry humor illuminate this vast continent for us visitors. Bill's interesting history, geography, side-splitting anecdotes and an unabashed love for this country make this book a great introduction to OZ.Things have changed a bit since this book was first published (Australia is in the news more, and used extensively in the U.S. in marketing campaigns.), but the basics still apply and give one a real appreciation for this fascinating country."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Land Of Sweeping Plains","review":"Bill Bryson has done it again! In A Sunburned Country was a delightful travel book that allowed me to picture each step as if I was there myself. I have always loved Australia and everything that comes with it. The comic nature of the book is really light-hearted and keeps the reader's attention. Although, he still does get serious at the appropriate times when talking about serious issues. The beginning was one of the main points that drew me to this particular book. It really made me think of how much people outside of Australia don't know about it. The descriptions of some places such as the train Bryson rode on found the Brightside of places that most would just pass up due to the containment or how undesirable they may seem. The vivid descriptions of places such as the Tree Top Walk really made me want to go and experience it for myself. I hope sometime soon I will see the places I unknowingly would pass up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mildred Kaye on Bryson's \\"In Sunburned Country\\"","review":"I am a fan of Bill Bryson's, and this book did not dissapoint. With his usual wit, Bryson covers aspects of his visits to areas of Australia as he has taken on the USA and other areas. One begins to appreciate that under the delightful accounts of his travels lies a solid body of research.My favorite of Bryson's book is \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything.\\" This book is a testement to the fact of the scholarship underlying Bryson's writings. It is easy to lose track of that because his delightful approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read!","review":"This book was so funny that I laughed out loud when reading it! My husband overheard me laughing, & asked what I was reading that was so funny. From that time on, when I put the book down, he picked it up & read. We want to vacation in Australia sometime in the future, & plan to use this book as a travel guide. I recommend it if you enjoy quirky books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything will kill you","review":"This should be required reading for anybody heading to Australia. He is an astute observer of human behavior, and relates his findings in the most humorous way. His description of the game of cricket is the most accurate and hilarious I've ever read, and his constant reminders of how everything in Australia will kill you provides nice continuity throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite travel writers are Bill Bryson and Alan Epstein","review":"Bill Bryson is a very funny travel writer and he takes you to the most out of the way places, and into situations that are comical and real. Another great travel writer who transports you to a foreign country into the life of the people is Alan Epstein, whose most recent book \\"As the Romans Do: The Delights, Dramas and Daily Diversions of Life in the Eternal City\\" is a real gem . Somehow I can imagine myself enjoying the situations Epstein describes more easily than the ones Bryson gets into, although they are both witty, & culturally and historically fascinating. Either way, if you are an armchair traveler you will not be disappointed, it just depends on whether you want to go to Australia or Italy.By the way I gave \\"As the Romans Do\\" five stars. Not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding humor in the small things","review":"I found this book on the humorous side. Bryson was able to take the small unnoticable things and find some sort of humour in it. Like the idea that Austraila is the home for most of the world most dangerous animals.Bryson travels all over Austraila and has many personal encounters with the \\"locals\\". Some good, some bazaar"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"After much anticipation, I was disappointed at the flippant tone of this book. As an expat Australian living in the US I devour any books about Australia. There are several inaccuracies - sentences that appeared to be tossed off for effect rather than content. I agree with the previous reviewer - a quick best seller for the author, without much input."},{"rating":"2","title":"A happy local","review":"I am a great fan of Bill Bryson's work and have laughed my way through many of his books. When I heared he was writting a book about my country I was both facinated to read his assesment and more than a little worried that we may have been portrayed poorly, or savaged by his cutting wit.I loved the end result. It's clear that Bill is a \\"fan\\" of Australia but he does seem to have developed an excellent understanding of the country, it's people and idiosyncrasies.I can highly recommend it both as an interesting read in itself and as a guide to anybody trying to come to grips Australia and our mystifying ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out for that...!","review":"Wonderful book. For those of us who tend to be armchair travellers, Mr. Bryson does all of the research AND all of the difficult travel! And he's funny, besides. What could be better?As I read this, I could picture myself on the cross-country train, getting stranded in the desert, seeing the Big Lobster, and getting stung by something I'd regret. That, to me, is the mark of a good travelogue -- you are there.Some say they found \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" preachy, and that this book is refreshing in that it's not preachy. I'll take issue with the term elsewhere; the difference here is (as Mr. B points out) that there's no need to warn the Australians of what they could be losing -- they do a very nice job of conservation themselves, thank you. Unlike us. But that's another story.Read this book. If you want a good laugh, if you want to go to Australia, if you don't want to go to Australia. It's very definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the usual cliche","review":"At last, an American who doesn't trot out the usual vapid cliches about Australia! Bill Bryson obviously loved his stay in Australia and has made a great effort to learn about this wonderful country. It's a pity that the professional reviewers included on Amazon's page don't seem to have actually read the book, because they're still trotting out the same old perceptions - there is a creature that will kill you at every step, and that old chestnut \\"where men are men and sheep are nervous\\", open up to a new world and read Bill Bryson, he got it right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Bryson - Let the Reader Beware!","review":"Being an avid Bryson fan, I wanted to chime in with those warning readers to be careful with Bryson in public places -- reading the description of his jet-lagged snooze while being shown around Sydney by a publishers rep, I was convulsed with one of those omigod-I-can't-stop bellyachers that left me in almost as embarrassing a position as Bryson had been in. Listening to another book (I'm a Stranger Here Myself, I think) while driving from LA to SF, my son and I were laughing so hard that I missed the fork in the highway and wound up in Bakersfield, where I did not want to be.Sunburned is a great book -- very interesting and entertaining -- but should definitely come with a warning label!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative.","review":"As a homesick Aussie living Canada, this was a temporary band-aid. This was a really funny book, I laughed out loud constantly. I learned a lot from it also, it made me want to seek out more information on the topics he touched on. I learned great conversation pieces, and I always wanted to read bits out to people around me. It has only made me love my country even more and I think it is an excellent introduction for any prospective visitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and quite funny","review":"Bill Bryson has an excellent way with words, especially with his descriptive writing. For a travel writer, I suppose this is a must. He's also a humorist, and I laughed out loud on at least a half a dozen occasions while enjoying his adventures down under. Particularly amusing were his descriptions of a Cricket match, of a particularly bad hotel in Darwin and and of a drunken night in the Outback. He also gives a fine overall view of Austrailia, of which he covered much, but alas not nearly as much as he wanted. Though some might gripe that he spends too much time ruminating over the poisonous wildlife and looking for a cold beer, overall this is an exceptionally fun book to read. He includes many historical facts about Australia and even devotes some space to the unfortunate condition of the Aborigines. But not too much to spoil the fun. Bryson's travel writings remind me of an apolitical P.J. O'Rourke, and for that he's worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm emigrating to Australia","review":"Australia is a facinating continent, illustrated by Mr. Bryson's funny, and sometimes poignant stories. Much of Australia is uncharted and unmapped, as told by Mr. Bryson, and confirmed on my own with a discussion with an Australian Army officer this last weekend. I found the story about Mr. Bryson's trip to Ularu upsetting, reading about the \\"resort\\" that seems to have sprung up in the middle of nowhere to serve tourism. Mr. Bryson has done an exceptional job melding cultural and natural history into an interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I read this book while I was back-packing Oz. An absolutely hilarious book with great insights about an amazingly strange and beautiful country. Enjoy life...get to Australia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finished reading this book . . .","review":"On a white hot sunny afternoon in July, which seemed to fit the excruciating description of Bill's trip with his friend Allan to Alice Springs. I particularly enjoyed the Perth and New South Wales bits for their greeness and freshness, and what a rousing introduction for me into the world of travel books after six years of what has mostly been high-brow literature! I relished every anecdote, but here is a warning: if you are a fan of the high-brow literature Bryson's prose is disappointingly without song. He is funny, and a tremendous source of information, but he abuses abstract adjectives like 'splendid,' 'comfortable,' and phrases like 'of course.' Perhaps these terms are the trademark of travel writing; since I am new to the field I can't say for sure. All in all, though, this book was 'splendid.' I am off to ship it to my father in Ohio. I am hoping he will find it 'splendid' as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"kindle review","review":"I enjoyed reading this book because as an Australian I was interested in seeing how a person from another culture viewed my country Bill Bryson was easy to read and treated it with a sense of humour which made it an enjoyable experience"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Bill Bryson books!","review":"My husband and I spent a month driving over 3000 miles in Australia. After reading \\"Sunburned Country\\" we realize we didn't begin to see Australia! Well, there's a LOT of it we wouldn't particularly want to see after reading the book, but oh, how interesting to read about what else there is in that vast country. Fast delivery of book, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A down to earth view of Australia","review":"Bryson as always presents a much more down to earth view than your normal travel guide, visiting places well beyond the lightly trodden track."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a Sunburned Country","review":"Bill Bryson writes a very humorous and informative discription of Australia and its people. The story takes you through all the interesting places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"Bill Bryson delivers again - well-written, educational, and laugh-out-loud funny. I've never been to Australia and I am not all that familiar with the geography of the cities and sites in relation to each other. I first listened to the audiobook. I love that Bryson personally read the book but I was getting confused about the geography so I decided to pick up the actual book. To me, the book was better because I could keep referring back to the map to get some perspective. If you're a Bryson fan, this book will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny but not the best Bryson book","review":"4892. In a Sunburned Country, by Bill Bryson (read 2 Jan 2012) This is a 2000 book detailing Bryson's quite extensive travels in Australia. It is often funny, especially in the early chapters. There is a map which shows nearly every place mentioned in the book, I was glad to see. He got to every part of Australia except Tasmania. Often the travel seemed really tiresome and there are a lot of uncomfortable places that he went to. But one gets a pretty good picture of what travel in Australia would be like--not that I would want to do such travel. Not a profound book, and a good history would probably be better reading. It is the fourth Bryson book I have read. Of the four, I thought The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid was the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryson's the best!","review":"If you are going to Australia like we did, throw away the Frommers or Fodors and read this instead. Highly informative and entertaining. It will help you understand the country and its people. Glad I read it before we went."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a Sunburned Country","review":"Bryson is a hoot! Read this in Australia while I was experiencing what he was writing about. Now I want to go back based on Bryson's descriptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarcastic and Fun","review":"Bill Bryson's personality and distinctive voice shines through this text very clearly through his spicy humor and intense observations. He goes through the various locations and wonders of Australia and it is a clear and fun read which provides a hidden perspective of the people of Australia and their history without this being a historical novel or a tourism guidebook.There are some parts in the book that were a bit spiteful or left parts hanging without returning to the topic, but overall it was a fun read to get to know the living environment of this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off I Go...","review":"I really don't need a book to convince to travel somewhere, but after deciding that I wanted to go to Australia next I grabbed this book and the Lonely Planet guide to mix it up. On my last trip out of the country I met a single-serving friend on the flight back that highly recommended I read any of Bill Bryson's books; so a year later I took her up on the recommendation and purchased this after reading reviews on books about Australia.I like comedy with my travel writing and this guy is kind of like a self-effacing comedian. He explains his travels in detail, warning you where not to go, what not to touch, the history of an area and a culture, and all with a humorous touch.I would recommend it to anyone who wants to travel to Oz, expand their knowledge of the place, or just read a funny, well-written narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"Whether you plan a visit to Australia or not, this book is simply a fun read any way you look at it. Bryson's descriptions tend to be off-the-cuff rather than stylized and professional, making his experiences much more real to the reader than the average travel book. His descriptions are fascinating. Before reading this book, Australia never had any particular interest for me. Now I can't wait to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road to Recovery","review":"After the nadir of \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" this book continues Bill Bryson's recovery that started with \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself\\". While not matching \\"The Lost Continent\\" or \\"Notes from a Small Island\\" on occasions it comes close.Bryson retains his obvious affection for the people and places he writes about, and there are a few of the laugh out loud moments that made \\"Notes From a Small Island\\" such a hazardous read in public places. Otherwise it's fairly droll, and as so often with such books, tells us as much about the author as the ostensible subject of his books. Trouble is, by now regulars know the author pretty well and that particular subject is beginning to pall.Such quibbles aside, this book is still better than the vast majority of similar writings, and can be recommended.Just one question though. Why didn't he title it by the accurate quote which he himself notes should be \\"In a Sunburnt Country\\"? Too archaic for our American cousins?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryson Does Australia Proud, Mate","review":"Reading Bill Bryson is like sitting in a pub with an old friend who has just returned from a trip and listening to him tell the stories of his adventures. As much as you hope your friend had a good trip, you also hope he had some problems because that is when his story-telling really shines. Whereas travel writer Paul Theroux can be nasty about things he doesn't like or difficulties he encounters, Bryson tends to look at things with more of a wry smile and he has the true traveller's ability to be amazed at not only grandeur, but simplicity.With In a Sunburned Country Bryson takes us to Australia and it is a great trip through the cities and the outback. Filled with anecdotes and comic asides this book is well-researched and well-told. It will leave you wanting to see Australia and to take a trip with Bill Bryson. Wherever he goes he finds adventure and I would gladly accompany Bill Bryson on a bus to the office because I am sure we would have a great time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic travel writing","review":"When I grow up I want to be a travel writer like Bill Bryson. He's funny of course but I so admire his ability to take the mickey out of people in a charming way, although I do sometimes wonder if they see it that way. I'll read any travel book he writes gladly, whether I plan to go there or not. This andNotes from a Small Islandare two of my favourite ever books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great yarn and reasonably accurate","review":"A great read, not a great literary book perhaps, but definitely a diverting holiday read. Not the book you want if you wish to plan to visit Australia, but even for an Austalian a laugh every other page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one from Bryson","review":"I read this book right before a trip to Australia, finished on the first leg of the flight. The whole time traveling around the country (great place by the way), I found myself seeing and hearing things right off the pages. My wife got so tired of listening to my chuckle and me trying to explain what was so funny that she read it on a train trip we did in our second week of the trip. If you've got a trip to Oz in your future, get the usual travel guides but also get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I'm sure there are tons of reviews like mine. Anyways: I loved that book. It's very funny and loaded with information. Since I'm planning to go to Australia in December, I'm glad for all the tips and hints the book comes with. However, as always coming from Bill Bryson, it's a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really funny read.","review":"I read some of the reviews which gave this book only one star and was stunned to find that most of them came from Australians who are very pleased to read books which send up the idiosyncrasies of other countries but can't cop the criticism of their own.Lighten up and just enjoy ! This is such a funny book that I had to stop reading it in front of other people as I was chuckling so much at his SOO true descriptions of people, places and events. I loved every second of it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to go to this place !","review":"I enjoyed Bill Bryson's Sunburned Country, immensely. I was in hysterics immediately as he described succumbing to jet lag and falling asleep in a friend's car and waking up covered in liberal dribblings. His whole journey was most splendid and entertaining.Bill Bryson has the ability to take you right to his place of observation and makes you want to ring up and book yourself on the next plane.As usual, his pages are spattered with lots of anecdotes and all sorts of interesting facts - I mean what country goes and loses its Prime Minister to a morning paddle ?The book is fascinating to everyone with an inkling of an interest in travel and/or anyone who enjoys having their ribs tickled at regular intervals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny!!","review":"I read this book before and during my trip to Australia. Although the bood has a lot of boring historical facts, Bryson presented them in a hilarious way! I loved this book and would reccommend it to anyone who has a sense of humor about Australia."},{"rating":"2","title":"More things that will bite ...","review":"In A Sunburned Country makes it seems as if Australia has more things that will bite or sting you, with fatal results, than any other place on earth. And, although Bill Bryson doesn't mention it, Australia even has a toad that will make you crazy if you lick it.But you'd have to be crazy in the first place, to lick a toad, wouldn't you?You don't have to be crazy to buy In A Sunburned Country, though. It's as funny as his other stuff. Maybe even funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bryson is off the mark","review":"Bryson's book is an account of his trip to Australia, an account which has been embellished by exageration, extrapolation, inventions and parodies. An example is an event which Bryson suggests was an A-bomb detonation, but was in fact the impact of a piece of man-made space junk. The reentry of this junk was monitored before impact; and the impact site was surveyed and photographed; and so the event is not the mystery Bryson claims. A second example is Bryson's parodying of poetry by one of Australia's revered bush and war poets: Andrew Barton Paterson, CBE, but Bryson omitted any inclusion of Paterson or his work in the book's list of references. This book is funny in places, but the inaccuracies and the infantile quality of the writing (and repeated focus on excretia jokes)will ensure that it will be soon forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!!","review":"It was interesting watching the process that shapes the characters in Ms Pierce's universe and you wonder how they take step after step towards maturity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad (but too many coincidences)","review":"Tris and Niko are visiting Tharios for a conference of mages. Well, Niko is there for the conference. Tris is more interested in the local glassmakers, where she runs across a journeyman glassmaker whose magic is running amok.I enjoy this book because I like Tris and Niko, and Keth, Dema, Chime, and other characters are fun to read about. However, the story suffers from too many coincidences. Tris just happens to walk by Keth's shop at exactly the right moment. Keth's globes just happen to relate to Dema's current investigation (and only that). Niko's conference just happens to be on scrying, which relates both to Keth's globes and Tris's studies.In general the Circle books are not as good as the Tortall books, but it's not a bad book and I do enjoy rereading it on occasion. Also, one of the characters in Shatterglass is a little glass dragon who purrs when you stroke her. It's practically worth reading for her alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finale book in the circle opens quartet","review":"This is a good, entertaining book. The reason I didn't give it five stars is because Tris has never been my favorite character. The plot is good though and the cultures that the author comes up with is really interesting.Tris and her teacher, Niko, are visiting Tharios, the capital of the city-state of Tharios. Tris goes exploring and discovers a glass maker who appears to be sucking all the surrounding magic in to his glass. Tris discovers that he has glass magic warped by lightning magic. Too bad for her, she is the only mage in residence with lightning magic, which means SHE gets to teach him. Teaching a new mage is not something the prickly, stubborn, and anti-social Tris ever wanted to do. As if things couldn't get more complicated, there is a serial killer loose in the city!"},{"rating":"1","title":"plagerism!","review":"Now, I am a huge fan of Tamora Pierce. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE her books. You're wondering about the low rating and confilicting title? Tamora Pierce STOLE this plot, (not word for word, but close.) From \\"Demon in the Teahouse\\", by Doorthy and Thomas Hoobler, which was published about four years before Shatterglass. Read that book, and compare it to \\"Shatterglass.\\" Find that they have the same ending, almost same characters, and same \\"clean\\" principle? So did I. I am wondering why somone didn't catch this earlier, but in case you don't know, plagerism is ILLIGAL. My respect for Tamora Pierce has been shattered. (No pun intended.) I am waiting for the authorities to confront her about it, and am wondering how she thought she would get away with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A teen's view","review":"This book was in NO WAY as good as any other of Tamora Pierce's books. I enjoy her books very much, so I was SHOCKED when I read Shatterglass. The story is rather boring, with only a few good parts. A man (ghost) that is killing yaskedasu AKA Prostitutes, and a man who whines, and a weather mage have to stop him.The plot is that Tris, the weather mage going into a store, seing a man make a living glass dragon, and then because the man tries to kill it, Tris takes it home. This man, Keth had lightning strike him, so his glass magic is deformed. He is able to make glass balls that show a murderer. If Keth and Tris, can figure out how it works, they can stop the murderer.In all, I must say that it was confusing, strange and above all BORING. She has written many better book. A dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"glass working facts","review":"Althogh I really enjoyed this book, there are a few things I would like to point out. When glassblowing, it is immposible to get molten glass in your mouth if you inhale on the pipe. All you end up with is a blocked pipe.

This one which is resurfacing from 1993 is an unusual Australian compilation of Mantovani's work, unusual in that it spans three decades of Mantovani's prolific recording career: the 50's, 60's and 70's. The tracks that are rarely, if ever, found easily on currently available CD's are Anniversary Waltz, The Old Fashioned Way, Spanish Eyes, The Very Thought of You, And I Love You So.

While nothing can ease the pain of having your whole house and everything in it wash away in a thirty foot wall of water, this book has such a wide collection of best loved songs that it makes things seem a little bit better.

Situations don't flow, conversations are contrived, and nothing seems congruous. I kept thinking, \\"Just a few more pages and you'll fall into it...\\" but that never happened.In fact, I turned the last page expecting there to be more, and when there wasn't, I honestly thought some pages were missing. I understand this is a series, but there was no meaningful path of the book.Awful.

Although the book is clear, it requires that the reader is acquainted with some topics of numerical optimization (with penalty functions), convex analysis (very basic) , the Karush-Kuhn-Tuker theorem and Lyapunov stability. Most of these topics arise in a course of control theory.Chapter 1 and 2 are introductions to the theme.Chapter 3 is the most important chapter that introduces the contributions of Kelly et al.

That's saying a lot"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're not an evangelical, skip it","review":"Although this book has interesting comparative charts of various world religions and christianity, and basically good summaries of those other religions, the entire slant is toward evangelizing people of those other faiths. This is evident in the text, but you needn't go that far: praises on the back cover come from two individuals that sound like they represent evangelical agencies, one man from Jews for Jesus, and the pastor of Southern Gables Church. The book contains hints on how to \\"witness\\" to those of other religions, ie., try to convert them, and attacks on things \\"secular\\" including the theory of evolution. I'm a modernist, I don't live in the 8th-century, and am not into such things, so I'll keep this on the back of the book shelf and avoid much of it to get at the basic summaries of the non-christian religions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You Would Expect From The Title","review":"The rest of the title is \\"Understanding and Reaching Followers of Islam, Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism, Secularism, The New Age, and Other World Faiths\\". The subject is how to understand why people have adopted these other faiths and how to attempt to convert them to Christianity. This includes page-after-page of possible dialogues and how to handle these is a way to accomplish the task. Literal belief in the english translation of the Bible is also used extensively and broad-brush depictions of others is used - \\"Few Jewish people study the Old Testament very much.\\" etc. From the Amazon synopsis and the other reviews I expected a much more objective discussion of religions - but was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another book of intolerance.","review":"I got this book as a gift from my sister because she knew I am interested in studying world religions. It's too bad she only looked at the cover and didn't bother to read it a little before buying it. This book is NOT an informative book on world religions. It's an Evengelical intolerant guidebook for witch hunters.Being a Wiccan, I was very offended by what the author wrote about the Wiccan religion. Not only is his \\"information\\" incorrect, but the entire book is biased against all religions except Christianity. One of the things he writes about the Wiccan religion is that \\"It promises power, mystery, self-gratification, and rebellion against Christianity\\" and this statement is completely false.This author is all about telling why Christianity is the \\"right\\" religion and that all others are wrong. Included in each chapter is a guide to converting people of each religion. I personally find this idea sick and twisted, and it should not be in a book about world religions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Summary of World Religions.","review":"The authors of the book give a decent overview of many faith systems. They are encouraging Christians to do a lot of research and reach out with the Gospel, they even offer some tips for doing so. A lot of the book lacked real depth, however. The big flaw was it's constant urge to find common ground with other beliefs, when it should have been deconstructing the opposing world views conception of reality instead of attempting to start with an impossible blank slate. But, as I said, a lot of good information about other religions for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"School Book","review":"The book came in fast and I was in possession of it before fall classes started.

However, the account was terribly superficial and the author demonstrated no true comprehension of Buddhist beliefs. It seems to me, as an evangelical tool, this chapter failed. I found that the tactics recommended for proselytizing to Buddhists were laughable and couldn't imagine them succeeding with a practicing Buddhist.I would encourage anyone wanting a more sophisticated presentation of Buddhism from a Christian perspective to read some of the offerings of Brother David Steindl-Rast, Father Heinrich Dumoulin, or Thomas Merton."},{"rating":"2","title":"God is Good","review":"Im so excited to be able to listen to these incredible angelic voices again!!!

Other books detail locations much better but again the book is not designed to be in depth. He references those books like Hurricane Treasure. My only worry was when I got to the part about detecting the Treasure Coast at high tide looking for treasure. I have talked to many people and done my research and nowhere else have I read to detect the high tide and chase the waves back in. He then goes on to mention to be cautious when waves are high and that it's fun detecting wet sand when it's not windy. Metal detectors LOVE high winds including nor'easters and hurricanes for the best chance at finding treasure and providing the cuts he had just finished mentioning. You can't love cuts and hate the winds that provide them...

Then, unlike my previous experience with Floyd albums, my enthusiasm to listen again waned. I found the lyrics to be unbearably dull. EVERY song on the album has the same rhyming scheme! (AABB, I think it was) When you notice every song follows this rhyming pattern, it becomes unbearable. Couldn't Gilmour use some imagination and mix things up a little? I know Gilmour is a talented musician, and with such an excellent supporting ensemble, like Tony Levin (my favorite bassist), this should be a good record. However, without Waters' lyrical and eccentric abilities, it just falls flat after a few listenings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lapse of Reason? Too right!","review":"Oh dear! Ok so 'Signs of Life', 'Learning to Fly', 'On the turning Away' and 'Sorrow' are pretty good. That's only 4 songs though (and one of those is an instrumental)!'A new Machine' (parts 1 and 2) is just filler; plain and simple. 'One slip' could have been better if the words weren't so rubbish ('a restless eye across a weary room' indeed!), 'Yet another movie' should have been called 'Yet another song' and don't even get me started on 'Dogs of War' - the worst Pink Floyd song EVER - by a long way! 'Terminal Frost' sounds good at times, but also sounds like it belongs on someone else's album!You'd do better buying \\"Delicate sound of thunder\\" than buying this - most of the tracks feature on that album too. Floyd after Waters have done 2 ok albums: \\"Delicate sound of thunder\\" and \\"The division Bell\\" - AMLOR is NOT one of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Money, It's a Hit....","review":"Never did totally hate it, but it definitely felt like a calculated attempt at cashing in on the band's name.

Gilmours'girlfriend is the best lyricist the band has ever had.

When compared to the majestic poetry of a line such as \\"I will I will she sighed to my request and then she tossed her mane\\" those old lyrics seem like they were written by an ego maniac on some mid 70's binge.I want good, clean, safe product and thats what momentary lapse is."},{"rating":"1","title":"For The Love of Dave Gilmour...","review":"I gave this a listen. It is little more than another of Gilmour's boring solo albums. It's pretty sad when one of the better guitarists has to fool the public by using a prestige name in order to get his solo album heard.

I do agree this is not their best album... Nevertheless, and despite the 80's sound on it (specially on the drums), the lyrics are great. Sorrow, for instance, is a masterpiece (though I like the PULSE version a little more). On The Turning Away has a great solo, very Gilmour-like. I would not say this is a bad album. It was a new start... which would be concluded later on with The Division Bell. I guess you only need some time to get used to it, if you're new to Pink Floyd.For more experienced listeners, though, it is notable that the sound somehow went back a little. I think the Meddle sounds more 'alive' and 'Floydian'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilmour followed perfectly","review":"What is wrong with some of you Floyd fans, Gilmour did an exellent job on this album and I believe that this is the last Floyd album because the Division Bell was so immature although the songs on it were catchy, but the lyrics were weak and it was still not Pink Floyd in style. AMLOR has a certain darkness to it when you listen to it (and when you look at the CD Booklet) and it really reminds you of the past Floyd days. Waters said it himself, Momentary Lapse Of Reason has good tunes on it. Even though the Division Bell nailed no. 1. I thought it was an immature album. Great job on this one Dave!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Momentary Lapse of Great Music","review":"Learning to Fly, One Slip and Sorrow are my favorites.

But the rest of this album doesn't appeal to me because it's so lame and uneven. \\"Terminal Frost\\" and \\"A new machine part 1+2\\" are pretty much filler, \\"On the turning away\\" is very pathetic but hollow, \\"Sorrow\\" is unlistenable for me because of this ugly guitars. David Gilmour doesn't leave out a chance to trap into art-rock cliches. Stay away from this album and buy some of Floyd's '70s work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good!","review":"This album is, in my opinion one of Pink Floyd's better albums. All of the songs are just really great and it keeps the Pink Floyd style, combining a tad bit of 80's pop sound, I personally like it. No, it's not quite like DSOTM, or The Wall, but it is really good and David Gilmour sounds terrific on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nice revival of pink floyd","review":"i'd have to say that this is a great album. many people don't like the massive 80's production, but the way it was produced still has a distinct style to it. i can't say it's a floyd style because it's so different from past albums. i'd say it's a great album but not one to listen to all the time over and over. signs of life is a nice little intro that leads into my favorite song on the album, learning to fly, which is a nice well written and structured song. the dogs of war is one of my floyd favorites as well. a new machine and terminal frost are also very good, they definatly have some of that good old floyd style to them. Sorrow i actually don't like all that much. but overall, i'd say it's a pretty good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethereal","review":"I had the pleasure of hearing A Momentary Lapse of Reason during my first year of college. I was relatively new to Pink Floyd then and I've got to tell you, it was this album that got me hooked. \\"Learning to Fly\\" was and still is one of the most incredible songs I have ever heard. Although in the past Pink Floyd's music belied their search for the meaning of life in a muddled, drug addled way, they were finally able to embrace the enlightenment that comes with time and maturity. That being said, the mystical moments displayed on this album ring genuine to me. \\"Learning to Fly\\" is Gilmour's enlighened moment, drawn from personal experience. \\"On The Turning Away\\" breaks through towards the end. And Sorrow is just a masterpiece. This album was the epiphany that led to The Division Bell. David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Rick Wright's playing on this album is the result of the serenity and wisdom that comes from \\"having been there and done that.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dehydrated","review":"\\"Without Waters\\" that is. I doubt that Roger could have done much to help this mess of a CD, since his contemporary CD \\"Radio KAOS\\" is barely any better. This CD has one good song, the catchy \\"Learning to Fly\\", and even it starts to lose its pizazz after 20 or so listens. Most of the hardcore Pink Floyd fans I know tend to be of the \\"Worship Our Philosophical Musician Gods\\" mindset. They seem to find deep philosophical meaning in laughable lyrics, worship the singers as near-deities, and rationalize themselves into thinking that awful songs are splendid masterpieces. Being of a more objective mind, I find almost nothing to like about this CD other than the aforementioned Learning To Fly. It's inoffensive enough to serve as background music. Can't say much more for it than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite of mine","review":"Maybe I belong in Pink Floyd Fan Jail after saying this, but on the day the reissues are released, the first one I sprung for was \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\". Basically because it's one that I never bothered to upgrade from cassette until now but also because it's a damn good album too.\\"Signs Of Life\\" leading into \\"Learning To Fly\\" is just a great album moment from my youth. \\"Lapse\\" was the first Floyd album I remember coming out after being introduced to their old stuff as a youngster. As the tape deck was phased out, so was this album. So I'm listening to it for the first time in a good five years, possibly more.No, it's not \\"Wish You Were Here\\" but it was the Pink Floyd that was around when I was growing up and I very much enjoy listening to this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lapse of Reason is Right.","review":"Really this isn't even a Pink Floyd album.

Then I listened closely to the words and wondered where the imagination and creativity of Floyd had gone. To make matters worse, I saw the Waters-less version of Floyd in concert that year, on their highly touted tour. The show was like an AM radio greatest hits session. I walked away more disappointed than ever.The magic isn't gone, but you need to listen to Obscured By Clouds, Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, and The Final Cut to find it.

Learning To Fly is good, Sorrow is okay, One Slip and Yet Another Movie/Round And Around are tolerable, On The Turning Away is lame, Signs Of Life and The Dogs Of War are totally pointless, and I won't even say anything about A Lame Machine (Part I) and An Even More Lame Machine (Part II)...too late. If you are a diehard fan, you know that you have to get this eventually, but don't waste your money if you're a casual listener. It's not even good for 80s music - that says a alot. Usually I try to write about the good things in albums, but it's near impossible to do with this. AMLOR should have been calle A Complete Lapse Of Coolness...yeah - take that. I don't know, maybe I'm a little hard on David Gilmour and gang here - no...nope. If you're wanting some later Floyd, then The Division Bell is what you want. AMLOR is kind of an un-good version of TDB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Momentary Lapse of Inspiration","review":"Can Pink Floyd be without Roger Waters and still make awe-inspiring albums? Apparently not. I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan, but this is the lamest excuse for a progressive rock album since Yes in the middle 70s. The lyrics are inane, the songs drag, and David Gilmour's voice gets on my nerves after 15 minutes into the album. \\"The Final Cut\\" is not inspired either, but this one has even less to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"post pink floyd rubbish","review":"In 1987, I bought this with naive anticipation. I knew this was the first Waters-less PF album, but I didn't really realize what they had lost. It does vaguely sound like a PF album but somehow it's profoundly boring. It is worthwhile in the sense you can properly judge the importance of Roger Waters; however, it is a tedious listen. You may not like every PF album, but nobody can deny Waters pushed himself lyrically and musically. Gilmour struggles to recapture a former sound causing himself to (artistically speaking) \\"run in place.\\" I've always tried to pinpoint the major weakness on this disc, from Gilmour's girlfriend's uninspired lyrics to the band's weak songwriting, but it's become futile. I've come to the conclusion that there is no single weakness; it's simply a recording that should never have taken place, and in my mind it's not even part of the PF discography. The Final Cut is just that. Anything that is post 1983 is post Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely TERRIBLE","review":"Why the remaining members of Pink Floyd didn't start under a new name, rather than poisoning it with this rubbish I have no idea. If I were Roger Waters I would be embarrassed to even be associated with the (now commercialized) name Pink Floyd , who unfairly subjected us to this torture they call a record. Give me ASoS or Umma Gumma anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real Pink Floyd album","review":"David Gilmour and Nick Mason are the only credited members of Pink Floyd that appear on this album while Rick Wright is listed as a session musician. However, PF without Roger is the least of the problems with this.Gilmour was a great frontman for the Floyd in the early 1970s who contributed great classics like Green is the Colour, The Nile Song, The Narrow Way, Fat Old Sun and Fearless. But on this album, he completely caves in to the crappy musical style of the 80s -- heavy on synthesizers, female backup singers, etc.In fairness, many great 1970s rock groups produced a lot of crap in the next decade as well and it seems that even THE Pink Floyd weren't immune to this.I give this CD 2 stars because I don't see it as a complete failure--the song \\"Sorrow\\" is kind of interesting and I could see it as a half-decent song if it was recorded with that 1970s classic Floyd sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK!","review":"Definitely Pink Floyd's worst album, the only songs worth listening to are \\"Learning To Fly\\" and \\"On The Turning Away\\". \\"One Slip\\" was bearable as was the beginning of \\"Sorrow\\", but in general this album was garbage. Nothing but session musicians will you find on most of the tracks here. After Waters left the band, PF should have just broken up; this is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"THREE Re-masters?? COME ON !","review":"I bought the 1997 \\"re-master\\" and it sounds awful - very harsh and brittle and compressed. If these sound engineers don't know what they are doing, the buying public should not have to pay for their incompetence! If a re-mastered re-master of a re-master comes out, the original re-master should be recalled by the manufacturer as a defective product and replaced at no charge! The only way they are going to stop making these multiple re-masters is if it starts costing them money because money NOT MUSIC is the only thing they understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Floyd albums without Waters","review":"This album shows the true talent of David Gilmour.

As someone indicated earlier, the first side (for those who bought the LP more then 10 years ago) is not so bad. There is decent stuff like Learning to Fly and On the Turning Away. The rest is just forgettable drivel taking snippets of other ideas from their past albums and trying to market what people expect to be the \\"floyd\\" sound.The reason why people enjoy Floyd is because of their inventiveness and the lyrics. People also say \\"Well, we don't need poets like Waters, what we need is music.\\" Just remember that an album is more than just it's packaging people."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love every song on this CD","review":"My father's been listening to Pink Floyd for a while, and he gave me his copy of this CD when I became determined to get my own copy. I love every song on this CD. Though, considering what other Pink Floyd songs I've heard (Welcome to the Machine, Wish You Were Here, and that's about it), and what I've seen in other reviews of this CD, it may be that this isn't exacly the regular Pink Floyd sound. I'm not entirely sure, but if it's true, you have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring","review":"this sounds like a david gilmour solo record. sure i'd be the first to tell you that roger waters is an egocentric ass, but without him, there is no pink floyd. no, let me clarify that--without waters and gilmour TOGETHER, there is no pink floyd. so, i guess that means pink floyd is dead...let's put this one to bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"learning to fly: instructions are included","review":"In my opinion, \\"learning to fly\\" is the best song in rock & roll history. The highs and lows of the beat render great power to the flow which seems to carry the listener to a high peak on which converging hard rock guitar and percussion meet with subtle melodious blues rythyms and firm standing vocals. Simply put, it's smooth and powerful. It's understated and reserved, yet reaches into ones being, syncronizing with the inner vibrations of our own vitality, lifting us to high places above our dreary places. OK. To put it another way...IT'S PURTY DURN GOOD AND HEY, IT GIVES ME A THRILL! and by the way, \\"ON THE TURNING AWAY\\" is an indictment of all who care about the poor but do nothing to help, also presented with flair and verve. IN ALL, IT'S EASY LISTENING FROM START TO FINISH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"This album is fairly good and has some great songs on it (learning to fly, sorrow). It also has some not-so-great songs on it such as Dogs of War. But, hey, the second part of The Wall wasn't perfect either. If you want an album dealing with insanity (DSOTM, WYWH, The Wall(aka The Big 3)) this isn't it. This album doesn't deal with anything very powerful. Even though this doesn't have the Barret or Waters sound, it is good. The Gilmour sound is different but is good and many younger listeners fell in love with it. TDB is more catchy, but this album is more Floyd. A proper Floyd collection should have Saucerful of Secrets, Meddle, Animals, The Big 3, and this. Consider getting Division Bell, but it is not as neccesary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cesspool of [poo]","review":"This is NOT Pink Floyd. Never was, never will be. This is David Gilmour doing a solo album and trying to do the 80's pop sound that was SO loved at the time. Hasn't aged well. I don't think Nick Mason and Rick Wright did ANY songwriting on this album. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The disc for dad","review":"One of their worst no doubt, perhaps not as abysmal as some make it out, but does that really say anything? This late 80's backfired comeback is drenched in lifeless production, half-cooked experimentation, and exploited past glories (particularly how Gilmour tries in vain again and again to relive the heights of his \\"Comfortably Numb\\" guitar solo throughout these hollow compositions), producing their definitive over-50 album for tailgate parties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over synthesized mess","review":"I have all the old LPs but had lost track of Pink Floyd since \\"The Wall\\". What a mistake to purchase this crap. The division bell is even worse. The singing is less than pleasant, forced and strained from a worn out rocker. The music is a jarbled New Age sounding studio mix of repetitive beats. Water's was correct when he said Pink Floyd was a spent creative force. If there is a message in the album or a theme its obscured by clouds of senseless notes and endless whaling guitar riffs. I think Gilmour wanted some retirement money and kicked out the last two PF albums to grow old on easy street. Or he followed the path of Sid Barret and slid off the deep end."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this, Genisus?!!","review":"Guilmour cant write, I admit Learning to Fly is good, and ON the Turning Away is a treat, but the rest of this is crap. Dogs of War is Guilmour's horrible attempt at topping Waters songs on the Final Cut (floyds best album). It sounds like Genisus, posibly the worst classic rock band ever. I don't care what anyone says, this was not Pink Floyd. Although the title does fit it well if you think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON","review":"I AM SO PLEASED WITH THIS CD. I'VE WANTED IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

However this one is quite bland. The songs all melt together, so I can't even say which are good and which are bad. It is obvious that after Water's left, the band did have to reinvent itself, just as it did after Syd Barrett left after \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn.\\" This album is easy to overlook, and I don't suggest getting it unless you want to complete your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Floyd? Where?","review":"I like the work that gilmour has made. Really! I hope you like too. But to use the pink floyd's name in a albun like that...

I would not recommend this album, but I guess if you like their later stuff, get it cause you'll probably like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the album could have been better if.....","review":"The Album could have been better if Roger Waters were there, but it is a good album anyway, but it does not sound like Pink Floyd, Gilmour sang all the songs and it was a hit by that time in the 80s.The song One The Turning Away was Number 1 in the Brazilian Charts for 10 weeks. For an album sound like Pink Floyd you need Gilmour, Waters and Wright singing together."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Floyd's","review":"Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall get more ink, but Momentary Lapse of Reason is Floyd at their best. With sweeping sounds and an etheral ethos that has you swaying and mellowing, Momentary Lapse of Reason is an album you can play over and over.The composition is beautiful. There are no odd songs (songs that do not fit in with the rest). Absolutely stunning. A Floyd Fan Must (tm)...-Scott"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so and definitely not Pink Floyd","review":"I'd have a lot more respect (though no more love) for this album if it was released as a David Gilmour solo album (which it is in all but name) but having recently listened to this album again, it's aged even worse than I remember. It is on par with Gilmour's second solo album which is to say it has brief moments of beauty but is mostly forgettable. This album is as much a pop album as About Face was but at least that didn't masquerade as a Pink Floyd album. I find all of Floyd's albums from Meddle onward to still be relevant today but this is dispensable. Check out On An Island if you want to hear Gilmour's talents (or Division Bell which is far better than this)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living proof that Pink Floyd still had it goin'!","review":"I've heard too much smack on how PF didn't sound good or couldn't make it w/out Roger Waters. That's all hogwash to me. I got this one and in my honest opinion, the band still had it and as strong as ever. Even David Gilmour's writing was dead on and had serious meaning behind it. Ok the songs maybe sound more modern for the year it was released but they sounded just as good (maybe even their best) in years! This one had meaning unlike the more popular (and I don't know why) \\"The Wall\\" or \\"The Final Cut\\". Even more so, Roger took the remaining members to court for continuing with the name Pink Floyd. Nick Mason and David Gilmour won the case and made another damn good album! If you like Roger Waters, just pass this one up and get one of his solo albums instead and take some valium along with that garbage. Check this one out, it's worth a good listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"I have to admit that I was a big Pink Floyd fan back in the day. Had all their stuff and loved all of it. I kind of lost interest after \\"The Wall\\" broke out as a huge hit. Recently I purchased \\"The Final Cut\\" and my love of Pink Floyd was reborn. So I figured I would go ahead and buy the next one. Well, I knew that Roger Waters had left and I was curious to see if David and the boys could carry on without him. They can't! This is just a mindless album. It is a desperate attempt to try to parody earlier recordings. However, after two tracks it starts to blend into one long David Gilmour solo that just does not seem to be going anywhere. Periodically there are shameless attempts at pop commercial singles. I have never been more let down from a band then I was by the so-called \\"Pink Floyd\\" on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's only one word to describe this album: PATHETIC!","review":"This is just David Gilmour another solo album, hidden under Pink Floyd name, so it would sell. No lyrics come close to Rogers (which is a great lyricist) and even the melodies aren't Floydian. This is not the sound of Pink Floyd. I mean if both the music and the lyrics are awful then it isn't Pink Floyd! Sorry David, but you should start doing somthing else than lyricwriting (and don't let your wife help you, because she isn't even good in it). David is a good guitarist and it's a shame that he can't write better music on his own. Don't buy this CD but if you want something after Roger, Devision Bell is better, because some of the songs are listenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"May Help With Sleep Problems","review":"How appropriate that beds are on the cover, as this is the first of Pink Floyd albums that qualifies as just a collector's item for Floyd fanatics and will positively put anyone else (and some fanatics like myself) to sleep. There are so many great Floyd albums, don't buy this one unless you are curious about the \\"bad Floyd album\\" and want to see if it could really be that bad... it is not that it's terrible, but just for Floyd, it is extremely mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Floyd Album","review":"I just disagree with anyone who has to say taht this is a good Pink Floyd Album. it just seems to have traces (fleeting glimpses) of Floydism.

When I listen to songs like Julia Dream or A Pillow of Winds or even Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast, and then I listen to this monstrosity! It makes me want to cry. The Final Cut should have been, since then it's been a downward spiral. They gave up on art and opted for being ROCK ICONS, a damnable pity if there ever was one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Floyd's album","review":"Waters and Gilmour need each other. If you could mix \\"Final Cut\\" and this record at the same time, you'd have a masterpiece! But Gilmour, an excellent musician, was not inspirated as a composer here (and he's an excellent melodist too!). Except \\"On the Turning Away\\" (fantastic), the remaining songs are very acessable and pop. \\"Dogs of War\\" is, in my opinion, the worst Floyd's song. But, fortunately, \\"The Division Bell\\" is a redemption."},{"rating":"1","title":"It says Pink Floyd but......","review":"It is not \\"real\\" Pink Floyd. I like what another reviewer said: Pink Fraud. When this cd was released I was one of the first in line and I kind of liked it. I really wanted it to be good and I wanted to ignore the facts. The fact is: the emotional, talented, egotistical, visionary, great lyrical and essential part of Pink Floyd is gone. What was left is three great musicians with huge lifestyles that need to remain the same or get better. I guess in a way I can't blame them. They have something to market and it will sell. They have had a few bright spots, but other than that they hover right around or below mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A permanent lapse of creativity","review":"Once Roger Waters left Pink Floyd, there was simply no reason for the band to carry on (other than the money, that is). Guitarist David Gilmour, as he showed previously on two decent but hardly vital solo albums, is a good singer and a fine guitarist--but only a mediocre songwriter. Waters's vision is missed by his former bandmates in so many ways that it is difficult to fathom. For example, give a listen to the turgid \\"Dogs of War\\" and compare it to anything on the masterpiece album \\"Animals.\\" Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's interesting to note...","review":"...that not only do most of the anti-Gilmore folks exhibit some serious spelling issues, they also claim that The Final Cut was one of Pink Floyd's best. Now, I love Waters-era Floyd with a passion, but even I have to admit The Final Cut was pretty trashy in comparison to masterpieces like Meddle, Animals, WYWH, DSOTM and The Wall.A Momentary Lapse of Reason is the best of Floyd's post-Waters releases. Learning to Fly, Sorrow, and On the Turning Away are all great songs, One Slip is catchy, and A New Machine is excitingly strange (not really a \\"song,\\" but still good). The only track I didn't enjoy was The Dogs of War, which for some reason struck me as being a little cheesy. Waters-type subject matter, but without Waters to do the lyric writing. All told, AMLOR isn't Dark Side of the Moon, but it's worth a listen, and it's certainly better than most of the stuff being recorded nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"For what it's worth","review":"First of all....Who cares if Waters is or isn't in the band? The band carried on after Syd left, why can't they do the same after Roger. They were both talented people and both couldn't handle the floyd, so let it be. Nextly I'd like say this is a good album. The music is so real, maybe too 80's at times, but a little of that is okay now and then.I do wonder why Rick Wright (the keyboardist) was left out of the album picture? He is mentioned in the credits so I found it odd. It did have Nick and David though...curious. If anyone has any ideas tell me....please."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album gets far too little love","review":"Dark Side and WYWH are very nearly perfect albums. This album is not that good. Piper is just a singular piece of work. After those three, Momentary Lapse is easilly my favorite Floyd album.Learning to Fly, One Slip, Yet Another Movie, On the Turning Away, and Sorrow are all great, great songs. Signs of Life and Terminal Frost are solid songs. Both parts of A New Machine are transition pieces, and not really songs. They aren't great, but they aren't bad. Dogs of War is the worst song on the album, but it hardly merits the hatred it gets. It is just a mediocre song on a very good album. Really, 5 great songs, 2 good songs, and 1 OK song makes a very good album.As an aside, I have heard Roger Waters' 'Amused to Death' album, and I can honestly say that I don't think either post-Waters Floyd album would have been improved by his presence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate","review":"Recorded after the loss of Waters and the loss of interest of Wright and Mason, A Momentary Lapse in Reason is a Gilmour solo album, basically. Bohemian works like Learning to Fly and Sorrow are passionate enough to work well. Sympathetic weeps for humanity such as On the Turning Away or Dogs of War come off as flaky and pompous. Waters knew how to display intellectual tendencies without coming off as pretentious. He also knew how to make music that is timeless while this album, with its high pitched keyboards and its constant unneeded guitar solos, sounds unmistakably 80s. The more personal aspects of Gilmour's music, heard on his self-entitled solo album and Pink Floyd's The Division Bell work best. Only for Pink Floyd completionists."},{"rating":"2","title":"babble ball","review":"Our dog absolutely loves this ball. It keeps him occupied for hours.

The battery is replaceable, which is great as so many noise-making toys eventually stop working.The only difficulty I have with this toy is that it is hard plastic (to keep the inner workings safe I assume) and still a bit large for some smaller breed mouths, so when it rolls under furniture someone has to retrieve the ball.

I also setup motion detection to upload photos to my FTP server for photo monitoring and in the event something happens at the property, I have stored photos. For another rental in the high mountains of rural Virginia, with NO high speed, I only use the FTP upload feature for still photos. It works perfectly through a HughesNet satellite internet connection. I love these cams!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and Short-Lived Power Adaptor","review":"I have no complaints against the installation or operation of the camera. It is designed to work as expected. Its AC power adaptor, on the other hand, will cease to operate in a couple of months. So far, I went through 3 adaptors in less than a year and a half. It took me a while to locate the cheapest original adaptor online at a cost of about $32 a unit including shipping. It also took me a longer while to locate the Panasonic support that deals with part warranty (not the camera or the part sales division). Incredibly, the support folks had no idea that the adaptor itself has a two-year warranty. Therefore, they did not know how to deal with it. They played dumb and deaf whenever I followed up with a call. In short, I would rate camera 5, adaptor 1, support service 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Max 1 frame every 3 seconds internet viewing","review":"Title says it all. This camera offers a maximum of 1 frame every 3 seconds internet viewing. I can view motion over the LAN, but that doesn't provide much value since this is intended to be a remote/internet camera.

ZoneMinder has native support for it. I got a camera with firmware version 1.40, which is more recent than currently posted on the Panasonic web site.These Panasonic network cameras don't use DHCP by default, which makes initial setup on a non-Windows platform difficult. The trick is that the camera will try to claim the highest address on the local block and then retry downwards.For example, if your local network is 192.168.1.0/24, then the Panasonic BL-C1A will try to use 192.168.1.254 first, and then 192.168.1.253 second, and then 192.168.1.252 third, etc. You can enable DHCP during initial setup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for Mac users","review":"I could only use this camera when hard wired to my computer.

Installation and use over a local LAN is simple. Setup for viewing over the internet is more complex and can be frustrating if you have never done it. I use a free dynamic dns service for other cameras I own. I simply added this camera as a new host onto the existing account which provides for the port forwarding. For myself, I used the provided Panny software to manually setup a STATIC IP with the port I wanted to use. I have an ATT Yahoo DSL 2wire router which then must be accessed to allow access to the Petcam's selected port. This is pretty much a pain, but once you do it once, it takes about 10 minutes.For convenience, I ran a powerline ethernet adapter from my 2wire modem. I can use the Petcam from pretty much any location with a plug for a powerline adapter and the power supply for the camera. Low light capability for this camera is pretty good. Again, for the price, this is a very good camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic Pet CAm BLC1A","review":"I thought the camera worked great.

The series is broadcast in HD (not the SD streached you see for some shows) and there's the ability to watch with closed captions.When they put this to DVD/Blu-ray they made it 1:33 (Regular TV square size) and NO closed captioned. What a slap in the face that was. I mean this is 20th century format they are using.

The science is superficial, and fails to cover essential details, such as the precession of the moon, whether the planets precess, how metals and heavy elements coagulated discretely in the crust of the earth permitting mining, etc., when the Earth was formed in a molten state and the heavy elements like Iron sank to the core. Credibility is hurt by factual errors, such as showing a Boeing 747 as the Air Force One that carried President Reagan to Japan, when his plane was actually a 707. Not worth the money to purchase - rent it and forget it. Better, wait for the BBC to produce the definitive series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A scary and perilous universe? History thinks so.","review":"Short on real information, the History Channel instead chose to focus on the perilous nature of the universe. The chapter on the sun, for example, features experts discussing how dangerous the sun is and the many ways the sun might kill off all life on the planet earth. What about more detailed information about what makes the sun tick.If you enjoy the thriller on the edge of your seat type of programming, this is good. If you are looking for something more educational or scientific about our amazing universe, this is NOT the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Widescreen!?!","review":"I've been looking forward to watching this series on DVD. However, I get it home to find out that it's a widescreen show presented letterboxed in a 1.33:1 format rather than as 16:9 anamorphic. So I either have to watch it vertically compressed or in a little box with black all around it. If you know what I'm talking about this will annoy you to no end. If you don't, you probably won't care. But in the age of widescreen HDTVs, there's just no excuse for this kind of shoddy DVD production anymore. I know that the History Channel ran this on their HD channel, so they could've easily made the DVDs anamorphic widescreen. Ridiculous. I feel ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best DVD series about SPACE so far","review":"The information is up-to-date and interesting. The best thing about this collection is the three-dimensional computer graphics. They are amazingly beautiful and realistic. They makes me understanding the subject easier than reading the books. One computer graphic is indeed worth a thousand words and two-dimensional pictures! I gave it only 4 stars because of the 2 reasons listed below.1. No English subtitles/caption except on disk 1. This is bad because there are many scientific terms I don't know. I can't search for them on the Internet because I can't spell them.2. At least there is one location where the information is incomplete.

Preliminary reports are that this Blu-ray disc set is going to be 1080i, which is probably what it was broadcast in. I agree that this series was beautiful on broadcast HD, but should look much better on Blu-ray disc because it will lack the compression that the Cable and Satellite companies utilize. However, just because it is Blu-ray, does not mean it is 1080p."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not That Great","review":"I would have to agree with the reviewer who wrote that there is too much whiz-bang stuff in this series. With all the comments about the quality of the graphics, I was disappointed with the video as it was projected on my home theater screen. Maybe it's terrific on a smaller screen, but I was looking for the airsick bag on several of the episodes. There's also a tendency for the editors to repeat the same graphics material way too many times to illustrate a point. It was starting to look like the nightly news where they use the same footage over and over again becuase there wasn't enough material for the editors to work with. Overall, it's just not that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been called \\"The Universe for Dummies\\"","review":"There are some interesting presentations in this series, and some stunning visuals. That's the only upside. The downside is, it was written assuming the audience are idiots - it's so 'dumbed down' that it's of very little information value - and there are plenty of factual inaccuracies that had me shouting at the screen.If you already have even a basic understanding of the universe, watch this ONLY for the visuals, because you certainly won't learn anything from this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Science Programming","review":"If you're looking for educational science programming, this is a very poor example. The writing is merely a series of factoids, but there is virtually nothing that educates about science or history, and in many cases the program presents incorrect information. Don't waste your time or your money with this series.A vastly superior series is the \\"The Planets\\" produced by the BBC in 1998. Although it is quite old now, Carl Sagan's series \\"Cosmos\\" is also much more educational about science and history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Una edición no muy buena","review":"El DVD viene en formato 4:3 y no 16:9 como están grabados los programas, la calidad no es tan buena como se esperaba.El pack si bien dice en Amazon que tiene subtitulos en español no trae nada ni siquiera CC para inglés."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple Series","review":"Why is the DVD version in Full Screen 1.33:1 format and Blu-Ray is in Widescreen 1.85:1? It appears that this is a new way to force DVD obsolescence and move everyone to Blu-Ray. That really annoys me.As for the series, it is very elementary, although enjoyable to watch.

Shame on you, History Channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of This World!","review":"I've ordered this show on iTunes and now I want to add this as a permanent collection on my DVD rack, so here I am. This show is great on a number of levels. Following along the lines of great shows like Dogfights, this series takes a new, refreshing, and bold look at our solar system, stars, galaxies, you name it, with great computer graphics and special effects. I've longed for a show that realistically took me among the clouds of Jupiter and Saturn, and here it is. It's also great for the family, because even though its focus is on science its presentation is on a layman's -- or even children's -- level. My 8-year-old daughter has even shown a newfound interest in astronomy. So consider buying this show; not just for you, but for the entertainment and enlightenment of those around you. You won't regret it. To the creators of this show, if you read this, know your work is greatly appreciated and keep 'em coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Astronomy for the Lowest Common Denominator","review":"Why is it that the rest of the world (BBC anyone?) seems to make science programming that challenges and educates the mind, but over here, science-related programming is targeted at children and poorly-informed adults?Watching this, I couldn't help but \\"reverse-engineer\\" the History channel's perspective of its target audience. I deduce they regard us as slack-jawed buffoons, too focused on \\"American Idol\\" to have the patience to sit through a real science show.As a result, this show talks down to the audience with drivel such as \\"That's a big explosion; you don't want to be anywhere near that thing when it goes off.\\"If you have any knowledge whatsoever about the solar system, Season One will be tedious to sit through (the wider Universe is not covered in depth in Season 1).The video quality does not seem to be in true blu-ray quality either.

First, this tape is recorded in EP/LP (long play) speed. Therefore it is easily visible to notice the inferior quality of the recording. The documentary is only a hour long, there shouldn't of been a reason to apply it in long play mode. I was appreciative of the time spent on his second triumph-the war on povery and his staunch opposition to the Vietnam War. But when the video gets near the end and ventures on the Memphis sanitation workers strike in March/April 1968. You see footage from his 1966 Chicago equal housing campaign.The bottom line is that I wouldn't recomend this video.

That would be not only robbing scenes from other movies, but putting them together haphazardly, and filling the movie with actors who spend the entire movie chewing the scenery. What little effort is made to develop characters simply develops them into characters you hope will not escape the crazy guy with the knife...Are we sure that this script wasn't written by a room full of monkeys with typewriters?

The story has another plot going as well about four people that have committed a bank robbery and are on the run. One of the robbers in an attempt to get away car jacks a women and her young daughter and takes them to an abandoned house where he waits for the other bank robbers to arrive. The story gets really creepy and confusing and you just want it to end. I just discovered Anchor Bay Films and I'm quickly becoming a fan, but this one just didn't do it for me. The prequel to this movie \\"Bereavement\\" is a much better movie, but it still lacks the gripping conclusions that I love in a good horror film, but the storylines are much more cohesive than Malevolence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malevolence......","review":"I don't quite see the connection to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Friday The 13th in this movie!It by no means comes close.

We then see a group of bank robbers who are now seeking refuge. They end up taking a mother and daughter as hostages going to an abandoned home. We find what seemed to be an abandoned plant not so abandoned for a madman is living there. Plot is boring at times and the acting is not too good. This is an easily forgettable movie.

Listen to the cuts here from \\"Ogden's Nut Gone Flake\\" and you will wonder why Sergeant Pepper stole all the limelight from the late 60's. Great combination of ballads, up-beat power pop (Marriot's prep for Humble Pie), and very clever lyrics throughout.

My favorite part of the book is when Corky goes to practice the second time because Corky doesn't hear the screaming ,and the room doesn't spinning when they are doing the pyramid.This book is about these three girls. Corky is trying to get back on the team after her sister Bobbi died. Every time the team starts a cheer Corky hears screaming in her head. There is an evil spirit haunting Corky. When Corky is in the science lab retaking a test and her teacher is gone everything starts flying all around the room.I recommend this book to anybody who likes books with scary parts in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is so good you won't be able to put the book down!","review":"As I was reading this book I could feel and imagine what was going on.

The sound is musicaly stunning with powerful lyrics. Thursday shows there musical talent by not only playing there usual screaming heart felt songs but also having a song made entirely with piano called This Song Is Brought To You By A Falling Bomb. That song is probably the best song on the cd next to the compelling war all the time which is about 9/11 and war in general. Now that i have heard this cd I will have to wait another few years before thursday release an even better album."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ALBUM YET!","review":"Thursday is an amazing band, and i never thought they would be able to follow up full collapse with an album even a fraction of how good war all the time is. this album is definetly worth every penny you spend on it. i listened to it literally 17 times yesterday cause i was in a crappy mood, and it just make me so much happier. its one of those play it till it breaks, buy it again, and do it all over again albums. its that good. im never taking war all the time out of my cd player Thursday is amazing! support them and buy their albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as Full Collapse but still excellent","review":"Although War All The Time isn't quite as good as Full Collapse, it's still lightyears ahead of most bands in the genre. The one thing that War All The Time has going for it is superior mixing. Geoff's vocals sounded a bit weak on Full Collapse and Waiting, but were much better on the live ep. On War All The Time I feel that they are at the right level, not overpowering the guitars, but not sounding weak and distant. Infact they are a lot more representative of what Thursday sound like live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music to cut yourself to. Emo must die.","review":"This is gonna be brief.

I first heard of Thursday from a friend of mine who said they were one of the best bands that hardly gets coverage. Not long after, they began to garner quite a following before I decided to give them a listen. And what do you know, they sound exactly like every other whining, raspy, and \\"more melodic\\" band out there like Staind, Saves the Day, Dashboard Confessional, etc. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for putting real, raw emotion into music, but anything I've heard by Thursday just doesn't seem genuine to me. I don't get the whole \\"emo\\" thing either. My musical tastes vary from bands like Weezer (their old material anyway) to Slayer to Black Flag, but anything I've heard that comes under the \\"emo\\" label just turns me off. Stick with your Slayer and Pantera albums kids, this emo thing will pass just like nu-metal did."},{"rating":"2","title":"groundbreaking","review":"maybe im just really excited and full of giddyness(sp?) on the first day its out, but from the one and a half times i've listened to this through, it doesnt seem to get any better. thursday seemlesly bridges the gap between hardcore and melodic emo. the song \\"war all the time\\" probably best encapsulates the sound of this album; the lyrics are some of the most powerful out there, the swirling guitars create an atmosphere that seems untouchable, and rickley's voice soars over it all, combining to create a masterpiece of a namesake. go buy this album. (the artwork is also amazing and new and fresh)"},{"rating":"1","title":"one long continuous boring track","review":"listen, i truly loved full collapse. I thought it was an original and inventive second, breakout record. So I was expecting more from the followup. This is the type of record that you listen to all the way through and when its over say to yourself, \\"What? It's over? That's it? What happened?\\" There's no impact on this record. Nothing stands out. Its bland dissapointment and annoying that so many people love it because they feel obligated to."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 and a half stars...","review":"Wow, what a surprise! I had the first Thursday cd and was very disappointed with it. They sounded like every generic screamo band around at the time, with a really annoying screaming guy in the background.But for some reason, I picked this cd up when I saw it for $5 after hearing some decent songs off of their latest EP. This is the biggest turn around I've ever seen in a band. This cd is excellent minus two tracks (eerr not sure of the names) that seem to revert back to the old Thursday. The strongest tracks are Division St., Asleep In The Chapel and War All The Time. They have some of the best lyrics I have seen in a long time, with catchy fast-paced rhythms. Oh, and that annoying screaming guy is still there, but seems to have learned the appropriate moments to add some screaming without totally overdoing it.This is easily one of my most played cds of the year. Go buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Band in the World!","review":"I love thursday so much! deftones were my favorite band until i heard thursday. their music is off the hook and i just love how every band member plays something so cool and then they all mix it in together and create MUSIC. THIS IS MUSIC. i love all the little guitar parts, the singer's awesome voice/scream, and the freaking drums and bass are out of this world. i RECOMMEND this album. and if u've never heard of them, listen to their first albums"},{"rating":"2","title":"THURSDAY IS THE BEST BAND EVER!!!","review":"Thursday is the most amazing band i have ever heard. Last year i heard the song \\"Cross Out The Eyes\\" on Full Collapse and i didn't think it was good. But then i gave Thursday a 2nd chance i FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM now i love \\"Cross Out The Eyes\\" but my favorite song will probably have to be \\"Standing on The Edge of Summer\\" or \\"Understanding (In A Car Crash)\\". it was the greatest thing i have ever heard in my whole life. Now they are my favorite band. and when War All The Time came out i couldn't wait for it to come out! i bought it and it was excellent...not as good as Full Collapse but still very good! let's just say Thursday is the best of the best and they will always be that way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"Not much to say except extremely dissapointing. Full Collapse was an auspicious debut - forceful and well-written - with a voice all its own. The new album though, is boring. There are no songs with the same build or power as something like \\"Paris in Flames,\\" the urgency seems to be gone and the writing is dull and pretentious. Not one song on the album matches up to the better songs on Full Collapse, not one.Hopefully this will be a sophomore slump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Okay, this album is NOT awesome, it is NOT spectacular. It is all in all, a disappointment. Usually a band will progress as it puts out CD's, hopefully each one getting better. Unfortunately, Thursday took a step or two backwards. The cd is just BLAH. Its got a few catchy little riffs, but in general, it has no dynamics. No powerful chorus like in FULL COLLAPSE, and not near enough screaming. If you like it, good. I love Thursday, at least there last album, but they gotta do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, for the secular \\"punk\\" scene","review":"This cd is pretty good. The guitar is great compared to any other \\"warped tour\\" type band. The drums are good, may not be that originall, but they still work and flow well with the other instruments. the vocals, well, the crying gets annoying after too much of this, but the energy involved is great. the lyrics are very good and intellegent, which is hard to find lately. But all the songs being about war/suicide and death does get old after a while. Overall its good stuff and its worth the $12."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good listen","review":"If you like thursday get this cd...I won't waste time comparing it to their other albums because thats apples and oranges..I think it can stand on its own. Its got all the kick ass elements that get you pumped and bring you down all at the same time, from raw and hard guitar riffs to smooth effects driven melodies, vocals are really strong in this one...go for it you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing- thats it","review":"This is an amazing thursday cd...actually, this is my favorite one yet. Every song on this cd is incredible. I'm pretty happy that for this album, thursday decided to get off the emo a little bit and get into something important. The guitars and the drums and the voice....everything just comes together in perfect harmony. Unlike what someone said, they do not sound like atdi at all, i dont know how u can make that comparison. Anyway, all in all, great cd, thats all u can really say, listen to every song and enjoy this fine work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falling Down to Greatness","review":"I started writing this review many a time. But I've realized that no review i write can convey the emotion I am feeling with regards to this records. All I can say is, that it is absotively brilliant. From start to stop there is not one horrible song. One song is done completely to a piano and I like that song as much as the others and I listen mostly to hardcore music. Obviously this rewiew falls short of conveying the emotion I am feeling. All I can say is that I rarely find an album in which every song is worth hearing. This record is good. If you liked their other stuff, you'd like this probably more but it can appeal to anyone, your hardcore kid or your screamo kid, or your indie emo kid. One of the best of 2003!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"I just dont know what any one seesin thursday's music...Perosnaly? I think their boring and way to repetitive. The only decent thursday album was \\"waiting\\" thats a good cd but their third album \\"war all the time\\" sounds pretty boring and i fellasleep listining to most of this songs! If you wnat good thursday get \\"waiting\\" but dont buy this one! Laters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying. Very annoying.","review":"Give me an electric guitar, a distortion pedal and a member from N'Sync who is really really mad about something and there we have it....Thursday! Every song sounds the same and the singer has got serious issues with his vocals. Clean vocals over distorted guitars is such a fashion now I cannot even imagine how people stand it. \\"Steve Pedulla is a talented guitarist\\".....yeah right, give me a break! Fine he may be talented but why is he making such garbage??? Thursday is a disposable band. No Talent.Highlight: Helping Prozac sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is considerably worse than full collapse","review":"I think I gave full collapse 4 stars, and in retrospect, I have no idea why. It deserved 3 stars, and this deserves 2 stars. Thursday's problem has always been that they are basically boring. I have trouble listening to Thursday songs all the way through, so that makes listening to Thursday albums damn near impossible. Even the best full collapse songs (cross out the eyes, how long is the night?, standing on the edge of summer, understanding in a car crash) get old before they end. There are no songs on war all the time as good as any of those songs, and the title track is the only one that comes close. For the workforce, drowning, and asleep in the chapel are the only other songs on here that are likeable for any amount of time; the rest are simply bearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"God-awful","review":"When I first heard \\"War all the Time\\", I thought it was a joke. A whiney little tin voice trying to have a range, mopey little lyrics and wailing, it must be a joke, right? Unfortunately, no. It's a whole CD of mopey gross manic-depression \\"emo\\" shlock that makes you want to puke if you're over the age of 14."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dunno what I should say. Leaves a weird taste in my mouth.","review":"Not really good but not bad enough for everyone to go around BSing about this OK band. There's nothing to the album and songs. Lyrics are okay but there's no melody or good beat.Good Artists and Songs:My CHemical Romance (love most of their songs) Helena and I'm not Okay are pretty good but greatly overrated.)Senses Fail (voice needs getting used to but once you do, they are great)Thrice (love about every single one of their like 50 songs)System Of A Down (download Chop Suey[the best] Toxicity, Tentative, BYOB, and Vicinity of Obsenity)And for the Okay Artists: Jack's Mannequin, THe Academy Is, Brand New, Funeral For a Friend, Panic At the Disco, From FIrst to Last, Sim 41, etc.Also, Blink 182, The Killers, and Hawthorne Heights are GREATLY overrated. They're marginal to okay bands but everybody loves them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting, very very interesting!","review":"I heard about Thursday from a Vans Warper Tour sampler and when this CD came out I immediately bought it when I saw it in the store. The band is very interesting and what I mean by interesting is that the band has that interesting emo sound that isn't whiny or too depressing. Its hard not to like it! I love emo for everything that it is and I hope it doesn't get too annoying too quickly because it is the best new sound out there. If you are a fan of At The Drive-In or Sparta, you will notice a little bit of both in Thursday. The songs are hard and edgy and the lyrics make you think and go Wow, that is good! Buy this CD now, you will not regret it! A perfect album for a drive in the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of 2003","review":"My original review praised this album greatly, putting it as one of the best of the year, but even that seems to do no justice to it. After listening to the album for a couple months now, I still exude the same enthusiasm as when I first heard the massive opening chords of \\"For the Workforce, Drowning\\" and it never lets up. Each song is well contrived and flows from verse to chorus with impecable quality. In a year of releases from bands big and small, Thursday's follow up to Full Collapse absolutely stands out as a gem. The whole album is a vast improvement over the slightly overrated Collapse in terms of lyrics and musicality. Standouts include every song, the politically charged title track and \\"asleep in the chapel.\\"As stated by a few others, if you're looking for another Full Collapse, this isn't necessarily it, (its much better) but what it is a quality album from a quality band. Give it a shot for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff.","review":"the fact that i find this to be an amazing album should really say something, becuase i was never a thursday fan before. anything i heard from their other stuff just didn't hit me.but this album...it ROCKS. the music is a lot more hardcore influenced, and geoff sounds really good. the lyrics are typical for the style (don't let the song names fool you, the songs are still about typical emo things).anyway, this was a very nice surprise. i bought the new a perfect circle cd on the same day, and i liked this 10 times better than apc. definitley pick this one up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressive release!","review":"It is the responsibility of all artists to evolve. There is nothing worse then artists coming out with records that sound exactly the same (ie Goo Goo Dolls or any other pop act). Thursday's last release \\"Full Collapse\\" was a great album, but I can understand how some just \\"didnt get it\\". This cd however has what was great about \\"Full Collapse\\" and adding a larger level of musical maturity. From start to finish the cd impresses me song after song. Geoff's voice has never sounded better and the band has never had such musical depth. I have been a Thursday fan for a while now and Ill be the first to tell you that Thursday is only going up. Those new to Thursday, pick this one up first and start moving backward. Make sure to catch Thursday on tour with Thrice and Coheed and Cambria this fall. Their music is great but their live show is in a league of their own. *****"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"wonderful, deep, meaningful, awesome guitar parts. Another great album by thursday. they just keep getting better and better. The best songs are the two slower ones, this song is brought to you by a falling bomb and war all of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different racord label, still the same band","review":"Once again Thursday has come out with more great songs. I think the 5 stars speak for themselves. Still, not as good as Full Collapse but a great cd nonetheless"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"Thursday is one of the few bands that actually stay with their original sound. As far back as I can remember their 1998 release \\"Waiting\\" has pretty much the same sound you would hear on later albums only difference is, that same sound has improved with every album. The energy of \\"War All the Time\\" has toned down a bit from \\"Full Collapse\\" (which had a good amount screaming in every track) they are just controlling it a bit more now. I feel their lyrics improve and gain more depth with every album. Bottom line: Good Vocals (main and backup), Sweet Guitar, and exceptional lyrics. (if you're a fan of simple music like simple plan, thus the name, stay away from Thursday)"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happended to thursday!?","review":"jeez, the debt album: waiting, was probably one of the best screamo records out there, then full collasped came out, even better!!!! But sadly, war all the time doesn't follow the same guide line as fc, or fsf. It's basically low end emo, sometimes screamo with a bit of punk and pop. A complete copy of taking back sunday if you as me! So i end this review with two words: COMPLETE TRASH! The End"},{"rating":"2","title":"just a m a z i n g","review":"yes it is. it is soo good it is creepy. you can tell what geoff's trying to say in each of these songs and the music goes very well with his voice. the lyrics are inspirational but the way he says them is just unbelieveable. i also recommend full collapse but thats another story.some great stand-out songs(but they are all good) on this album are: For the workforce, drowning(superb lyrics about the repitition of going to work everyday), division st., This Song Brought To You By A Falling Bomb(oh this song is AMAZING, great lyrics and good piano),War all the time, Between Rupture And Rapture(very catchy), AND *Marches And Maneuvers* such a great thought-out songso buy this cd, and youll be glad you did,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh come on...","review":"A lot of people are saying that full collapse was so much better blah blah blah, but no. This CD is truly excellent. Full collapse was a great Cd, but this has a different kind of style. They have some more somber melodies like track 7 (falling bomb) and the title track, war all the time and the last track are great examples of how thursday doesn't follow the classic intro, verse, chorus, verse, solo, chorus pattern. This Cd is great and shows some more of thursdays amazing musical abilities. The only difficulty I have with this is that some of the lyrics are hard to grasp. ...Workforce... i can understand and signals... I can too but M. Shephard is a telling title, but not a tellling song. Great Cd though."},{"rating":"2","title":"they just get better and better everytime","review":"when i first heard that thursday was gonna make a new album i was stunned and i had to have it.They have inspired me so much.Waiting was such a good cd and Full collapse was awesome but when War All the Time came out i gave it a try and i havent stoped listening to it ever since.This cd goes beyond five stars.The voice of Geoff has really progressed his voice is maturing and has very thought ful inspiring lyrics.I suggest you buy this album immediatly with no hesitations.Just grab the darn thing and pay 12$ and u now have the best cd made this whole year by far.The songs taht grab my attention are For the Workforce Drowning, signals over the air,division st.,marches and maneuvers and war all time.Check these guys out live you will be amazed how good they are , the whole crowed gets into it and it feels awesome.Check these guys out!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow-Thursday Gets Better","review":"First of all, I have been a Thursday fan since Waiting and I completely disagree with the people who call this album contrived. It is a masterpiece. The lyrics are amazing. My favorite songs on the album are asleep in the chapel, for the workforce, drowning, signals over the air, and war all the time. These are some great tracks, give it a listen. Don't forget to see them live, they truly are amazing live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thursday is amazing","review":"Before buying this cd i didnt know if it would even come close to full collapse because of how great that album was. After listening to war all the time i figured out i was wrong. Thursday has not yet recorded a song that i have not liked. In fact, i dont even know which album is better, they are all just amazing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"War on a Thursday","review":"It seems that alot of indie/emo/hardcore bands are finally getting signed to major record labels. Thursday being one of the first was able to put out their brand new album \\"War all the time\\" with Island. There were many skeptics that said that these underground indie heroes might lose their edge by getting sucked into the mainstream. However after listening to the album it could'nt be further from the truth. Thursday have stuck to their formula with \\"War all the time\\". There are still wailing guitar riffs mixed in with melodies and complex emotional lyrics from Geoff. Given the album did not hit me with the same impact as their debut \\"Full Collapse\\" did. But that could be mostly because this is kind of what I was expecting from these guys now. If your a fan of Thursday, you need the cd. Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Emotional Album","review":"To start I'll just say that this album is fantastic. Extremely emotional with great instrumentation and extremely passionate vocals. The music has a somewhat chaotic feel at times which gives an urgent and energetic feel to the music which is great. There are some political themes in the album but mainly its a very personal album that talks about the war of everyday life. All of the songs are really good even though not all of them flow into the next one as well as they did on Full Collapse. However, in comparison to full collapse, the vocals have improved as have the lyrics and production. Geoff still writes some of the most personal and intriguing lyrics out now. He writes in a way that can be understood but aren't completely cookie cutter. Overall I would recomend this album to anyone who wants an energetic rock album with creativeness in both lyrics and the actual instrumentation. I would also highly recomend Full Collapse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be better if the lead singer could actually sing","review":"I can't believe people actually like Thursday.

The author writes well and worked hard. He is less of an expert than he thinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, no new insights","review":"I have read a number biographies of P.G. Wodehouse (those by David Jasen, Frances Donaldson, and Joseph Connolly, among others) and am a big fan of his work. This book adds NOTHING of value and has a smarmy tone that was, to me, quite off-putting. (I have also seen McCrum, in person, speaking about Wodehouse, and he's even worse in the flesh.)If you are interested in knowing more about Wodehouse's life - read the excellent \\"P.G. Wodehouse, A Life in Letters\\" edited by Oxford don Sophie Ratcliffe and/or the David Jasen biography, \\"P.G. Wodehouse: A Portrait of a Master\\".Give this a miss is my advice, or, if you really feel you must read it (because it has gained the, in my opinion unearned, reputation of being the \\"definitive\\" biography) take it out of the library - don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and balanced","review":"An excellent biography compared to those that precede it. First, it covers Wodehouse's entire life with almost equal interest. It doesn't just cut to the juicy bits. Second, and most importantly, it feels balanced. It gives as honest a view as possible of the most controversial aspects of the subject's life. I think this is as close as a biography of Wodehouse comes to understanding one of the funniest and prolific writers of his time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wodehouse biography ever done","review":"Every Wodehouse fan is probably asking whether they need yet another biography of the master, after Benny Green, Joseph Connolly, David Jasen, Frances Donaldson, etc, and the answer is definitely YES, if the book is this one.Whether you're a Wodehouse devotee, as I am, or would just like to get acquainted with the life of a major 20th century literary figure, McCrum's biography is well worth your time. He firmly anchors Wodehouse in his time and place. He clearly explains less well known aspects of Wodehouse's contribution, such as his effect on the development of the American musical. He doesn't shy away from the mysteries of Wodehouse' life, such as his asexuality, but at the same time, he refuses to overspeculate or overanalyze. He lucidly charts Wodehouse' development as a writer.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent toy","review":"very durable vehicle,cool accessories, awesome figure, whatmore could you want? this toy is not cheap ... but is VERY good quality.

Pistone rehashes some of his time undercover, and then goes on to re-report the same mob news that's been reported over and over for the past decade. Really, there's nothing here to justify the cost. No new photos, very little new information of interest, save Pistone's opinion on more modern mobsters and a few undercover snippets from his other later operations. His clear opinion that the Commission Case led to the dismantling of the modern American Mafia is a bit overstated, as well, being mentioned continually during his ruminations on the state of the modern mob.

These references clearly show the truth behind John Poole's assertions about the dangers US Soldiers might face against an Asian adversary.Phantom Soldiers is not only useful in helping soldiers to understand how Asian armies fight. It also provides many tactical lessons that US leaders can use to improve their own capabilities. John Poole offers insights into the art of tactics that go way beyond what is taught in standard field manuals. Many of the lessons come directly from soldiers who learned them first-hand in conflicts like Vietnam, and the Pacific Theater in WWII.

I gave it two stars since you may gain an insight or two from this book but the sheer pain of trying to read this book is not worth the time. This is not due to the Landmark/est lingo but is due to the poor writing style of the author.If you are looking for a book to provide some insights similar to Landmark Forum or the est training purchase the out of print book \\"The Book of Est.\\" The book of est is written from the viewpoint of a person attending the est training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore Transformation Buster","review":"I was introduced to this book by someone I respect.

This one is especially unique because the story is told through the perspective of a child. The novel is entitled, 'In My Enemey's House' because...she is! She is posing as a Pole (treated like rats at the time, but not nearly is bad as the Jews were treated), and goes through an organization, where she is sent to stay with an important Nazi officer and his family. In fact, a game played by the children is called \\"Jews Out,\\" which was actually a non-fictional game played at that time period. How do I know this, do you ask?

She had to trade papers with a Polish girl to save her own life, and she had to hide out with her brother, Yehuda, sister, Fanny, and part-cousin Shmuel.

Carol Lea Benjamin did a terrific job of describing pack behavior and the unique differences between canine and human needs. She is realistic in the assumption that most households have two working adults and she allows you to explore effective options in dog-rearing without a guilty conscience. The reader walks away with the information and confidence necessary to assume the alpha role. Most significantly, Carol Lea Benjamin stresses the importance of problem identification and prevention, which makes this an essential reference for people who are rearing puppies. In my search to ensure my two Jack Russell puppies are raised properly, this is the one book I have been unable to put down. Excellent work."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THESE OUTDATED, DISCREDITED METHODS!!!","review":"I'd give this zero stars if I could. Physical punishment has not been in use by humane, modern trainers and behaviorists for at least 30 years now. It will make a fearful dog aggressive and an aggressive dog even worse and a normal dog prone to aggression. There are much better ways to safely and effectively correct and train your dog without damaging the relationship you have with your dog or risking your safety. Shouting, yanking, and stringing up your dog by a lead are downright cruel, can and do cause injury and lead to more behavioral problems--and all are completely, utterly, totally unnecessary.AVOID Benjamin's advice and all similar harsh, old-fashioned methods if you love your dog and want an obedient, happy pet that trusts you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book is misnamed. Its supposed to be for professionals, yet it contains exactly the same overly-general advice in all of her pet-owner books. At one point, in the discussion on aggression, she states that if the dog is really out of hand the reader should seek the help of the professional! Duh!I've enjoyed and learned from Ms Benjamin's books over the years, but found nothing new in this one - its all recycled material. And way too vague to be truly useful to the advanced trainer, much less the professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should say \\"How to dominate your dog\\"","review":"Punishment, punishment everywhere. I recommend that you skip Carol Lea's books -- she way overemphasizes the outdated dominance model.All of these behaviors are natural dog behaviors. We're asking them to live in a very unnatural environment with what are, to them, very unnatural rules. Skip this book and choose ones that treat dogs as dogs, not as furry humans trying to take over your world that must be dominated at all cost.I'd pick Jean Donaldson's books or Terry Ryan's Toolbox for the Problem Dog before this kind of book any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent, aggressive approach to training","review":"There are better ways to train dogs and other animals that do not advocate \\"stringing the dog up\\" by the neck when it misbehaves. When I read this in what is a widely acclaimed book, I removed it from my recommended reading list. This jerk and puke method of training is outdated and ineffective. Operant conditioning is the way to go for long-lasting results that does not cause your dog to fear you.

The book is written with a good sense of humor; for example, her final comment about ticks. She also recognizes that there are some \\"problems\\" that can not be solved, they are just part of being a dog, while other problems that people say are just part of being a dog can be solved.

His emphasis is not only on strategic imperatives but also on the moral, cultural and historical situation.The only problem I find with the writing is that Brzezinski tends to become diverted into dissections of many what-if type scenarios.

No trans fat, vegan, Kosher, healthy ingredients. So what's my gripe? If you look at the nutrition label on the back of the cookie package carefully, notice that a serving is 1/2 a cookie.

So, if you eat the whole cookie (I dare you to stop at 1/2. I know I can't! I tried.), you've eaten a 420-calorie cookie. Wow. That's a lot. Sorry to burst the bubble. I take one of these to work every once in awhile to eat for lunch (and 420 calories is a large lunch for me), but that's the only way I can eat them.

I try to limit refined sugars, wheat flour, and dairy products in my diet for health reasons, but oh, how I miss cookies. The ones I bake myself just don't taste that great, but these chocolate chip cookies from Nana's help me keep to my prescribed way of eating. I don't know what I'd do without them! I like to freeze them, and sometimes I top one with a bit of Rice Dream \\"ice cream\\" on top. Yummy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this cookie is awful","review":"Are you kidding me??? The 90 positive reviews must be the owners relatives. This is the worst gluten free product I have ever eaten. It is dry and it is mealy. The only way it was marginally tolerable was to smother it in chocolate icing. My wife told me to complain to the company and I told her I didn't want them sending me any free product."},{"rating":"2","title":"two kids under four years old both enjoy these cookies","review":"these cookies are good tasting, ( Child approved), no bad stuff ( parent approved), easily portable ( convenient), soft and moist ( don't make a lot of crumbs in the car seats) 3.5 ounces nice size for a satisfying cookie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Lemons!","review":"We have tried lots of gluten-free goodies with our daughter (who can't tolerate dairy or wheat) and she absolutely loves these.

They were both disgusting. The texture was similar to a protein bar. The flavor of the chocolate one was very weak, contrary to the label, which states that it has a rich chocolate flavor. The other one was very spicy, with no sweetness to cut the spice. Not a pleasant experience. I didn't finish either of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not remotely worth the calories","review":"I am wheat, gluten, and dairy-free and generally avoid packaged and processed foods, but there are a number of tasty, safe, gluten-free products out there. This is not one of them. I detest these cookies. The texture is awful. Dry. Like eating a cake made of sand. Save yourself and eat a piece of fruit instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"These cookies are TERRIBLE!","review":"I love any good peanut butter cookie and thought this vendor, Nanas, looked to have pretty good reviews. But I'll tell ya... it's bland bland bland, tastes likes dried paste, horrible. There's a list of ingredients on each package of the stuff they 'don't' put in there like eggs, sugar, etc. Well maybe they should realize that those ingredients are 'what' makes a good cookie. I won't try anything from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO REFINED SUGAR","review":"Taste's great and for someone that can not have refined sugar, what a great treat.

With my gluten-free diet (and expecting family members with dietary restrictions), I ordered a box of these renowned Chocolate Chip Cookies for inclusion on the dessert table at my son's graduation BBQ.PLEASE NOTE: these \\"No Wheat\\" cookies DO CONTAIN GLUTEN--in the form of barley flour and malted barley. In my ignorance, I excitedly purchased these without carefully reading the ingredients. WHY would these cookies be advertised as being free of Wheat, Sugar and Dairy, and yet, contaminated with Barley??? Yes, they are, indeed \\"wheat-free\\"...

Gluten Free doesn't have to be icky...","review":"The only good thing I can say about the Lemon Gluten Free cookies is that they really do have a good lemon flavor! The texture was like sand.

THANKS TO THEM AND !!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really sandy","review":"I'm sorry to say that I tried the Lemon flavored cookie, and it tasted like someone had taken beach sand, flavored it with a little lemon juice and sweetener, added a teaspoon of water, packed it together, and sold it as a cookie. It was so incredibly gritty that my tongue felt a little raw afterward. It was so crumbly that I couldn't even break pieces off of it to eat them... every time I tried to break a piece off, a big part of the cookie just fell apart. It was like when you're building a sand castle and the sand isn't wet enough... it doesn't hold together. I couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feed your Chocolate Beast!","review":"My husband and I are slowly becoming addicted to these cookies. While they are, to me, just ok right out of the package, they are delectable warmed up in the microwave for 30 seconds and eaten with ice cream on top! Preferably one that has some kind of chocolate in it to boost the chocolate flavor. A great alternative to sugar free products, which can cause stomach upset, for those of us that want to stay away from refined sugar! Just don't forget that these are not a low calorie food, read your labels carefully!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for destressing","review":"I recommend this CD to anyone who might be trying to cope with the regular levels of everyday stress. I like to listen to it when I'm going to sleep because the words on track 1 are in a very soothing voice, and I am usually asleep before track 2 starts! During the day, though, tracks 2 & 3 are really good for a few minutes' relaxation because they blend music with nature sounds for a calming, meditative effect.

We must choose to either take God at His Word (literally) or to spiritualize his words into myths that fit our fantasies. The author takes the Calvinist position on end times, calling the Church \\"Israel\\", telling us the rapture will not happen, that we're living in the millineum now, and that the Jewish Temple will never be rebuilt. Such vast contradiction of the Scriptures is thankfully rare.We must be very careful to compare what men tell us with what God says in the Bible. That's not hard to do and protects us from delusional men who would have us put our faith in them 'instead of' God."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive guide","review":"This book is more of a type that you would get to read up on an area in depth. If a traveller understands the setting and background of a place, they can enjoy that place much more.

The following is copied and pasted from the Amazon listing upon which I relied:\\"Line Pro Cut By Arnold For Homelite by Homelite\\"This description led me to believe the merchandise was prepared by Homelite and was identical to, or substantially comparable to, the line that was originally sold with this equipment. In fact, the line I received was quite different from the original line and is not workable with my Homelite Versatool cutter. Because of the inaccurate description upon which I relied, I cannot use the line and was required to return it to the Amazon. In the process of communicating about this listing error, vendor Arnold changed the listing to \\"by Arnold\\" in place of \\"by Homelite. They also withheld a significant portion of my refund. When combined with the cost of return shipment, this was a costly experience to me due to inaccurate description. I will not do business with this vendor again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two great artists-pure pleasure!","review":"Boy did they name this album correctly! Hei-Kyung Hong has long been a favorite with Metropolitan Opera audiences, but unfortunately she doesn't sing much outside NY. This album shows what an exquisite artist she is. Jennifer Larmore is more of a known quantity, and she is phenomenal as well. I am such a jaded operagoer (and I'm 26!) that I was shocked to find tears come to my eyes during a couple of the selections--most notably the Butterfly and the Hansel & Gretel. I bought this album when it came out and it has taken up permanent residence inside my Discman. If you are bored with the \\"cookie-cutter\\" sameness of many of today's singers, BUY THIS NOW.

It is as good as Stateless, although some of the added songs on this aren't as memorable, with the exception of Blue Hotel. All in all it has great music and great liner notes about the inspirations of the songs, which give you some insight into Lene.

It is best appreciated as a follow up album. The bonus tracks are mostly very good and New Toy is one of her best songs.

You can here some of the styles developed from that period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show--Not so great DVD","review":"I loved the show and watched it regularly when it was broadcast.

I don't know why it was not renewed for a second season. The only reason I can think of was at the time there were just to many cop shows on, including the very short lived series \\"Cop Rock\\"...it did not get any stupider than that. I do know that shows can be resurrected at times, case in point \\"Cagney and Lacy\\". That was a show that ran for about 6 seasons, but after the first season it was pulled, but enough people evidently wrote to the network for them to revive it. I hope that will be the case with the new show \\"In Justice\\". That was an excellent show, kind of the flip side of Law and Order, yet it disappeared with no explanation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another underappreciated gem!","review":"This is another great Bochco production. Everything Bochco learned working on Hill Street Blues he refined on this show. Great storylines, great dialogue. This show was cast very well too with the likes of James B. Sikking, Klea Scott, Michael DeLuise, Richard T. Jones and Jon Tenney. CBS should have let this show grow. It's too bad the networks demand high numbers right out of the box. They forget their own recent history, many shows took a few years to develop big audiences and numbers, like Cheers, The Simpsons, X-Files, and they have turned into cash cows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware - defective DVD's","review":"This is a good show that has been ill-served by defective copies. I bought two new, sealed copies of \\"Brooklyn South\\" from Amazon sellers and each disc in each set is marked and smeared. Maybe it's a bad coating, I don't know, but the discs are unplayable.

This book \\" I am not but I know I am\\" is a great reminder that God the creator of the universe is looking for everyday, ordinary people to help Him. This book really encouraged me as I thought Mr. Giglio did a superb job at speaking to everyone and reminding us that in God's eyes we are all significant and important. He did a great job of mixing scriptures and stories from his life, which I found very interesting.I highly recommend this book and hope more people will realize just how significant they really are to God.[...]I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyed!!!","review":"The title of this book is what intrigued me. It definitely gets your attention and draws you in. Reading this book definitely was a blessing because it got me to focus on the I AM instead of myself (i am not).If you are a person who tends to be a \\"control freak\\", someone who thinks more highly of themselves than they ought (see Romans 12:3), then this is a book for you. Specifically on pages 33-35, where Louie Giglio breaks down who I AM is versus who i am not, will be an eye-opening, humbling revelation.I hope everyone who reads this book will come to realize that I AM is the answer to every question, frustration, problem, conflict that you will ever have. No matter what the situation is, I AM is the Orchestrator of it all. I AM is in control, i am not!!!I also appreciated the (OBSM)>One-Word Bible Study Method, which I have incorporated into my personal Bible study.I received this book for free from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM","review":"I am real fan of Gigilo and I am never disappointed in anything he does.
