I gave this to someone as a christmas present. I later borrowed it from her, because I had never seen it. I must say I was embarrassed that I gave it to her. Freddy Mercury has a voice that you either love or hate (and I love it), but on this he sounds like he is singing underwater. The show itself is good and I like Freddies camp style (which is why I give it two stars instead of one)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Hurts","review":"This DVD is so bad that it's physically painful! I have a top of the line Yamaha AC-3 receiver and NEAR speakers. If I dropped $80,000.00 on a better system I fear that it would only serve to lessen the pain. I had friends over to watch this concert and they left. Not that there is anything wrong with a man in skin tight Hot Pants!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't blame DTS","review":"This is definitely NOT the DTS version. The sound is definitely less than desirable and quite shallow. That said, be on the lookout for the DTS DVD-Audio disc of Queen's \\"A Night at the Opera\\". (I think it's coming out sometime in the beginning of 2002). I've heard a couple of tracks and it is absolutely breath-taking. And even though it's a DVD-A, they still have the original \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" video on there that will blow you away. The guys at DTS definitely know how to do surround sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good show, poor quality DVD","review":"Really honks you off when they resurrect these old shows and try to make them current. Audio is redubbed which sounds decent but the video portion is very weak. I wouldn't have bought this one if I had seen it beforehand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I thought the sound engineering of this DVD was the worst I ever heard. I tried both DTS and Dolby 5.1, both were totally under-whelming. The separation is poor, even the frequency response is poor. I have cassette tapes that sound better. This is not what I buy music on DVD for. I am very happy with the Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Elton John, etc. But Queen totally disappointed me.The THX introduction sound bite was impressive, the DVD was not. Too bad, it seemed like a nice concert, and a good performance by the talent. Bad sound engineering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the 1/2 star?","review":"Aside from Freddie Mercury prancing around stage like a BaBaBooie in diapers with too much mascara, this has got to be an illegally released production! Everything about this concert was awful. The sound was as if recorded on a mini cassette recorder. The video was no doubt shot using three consumer grade VHS camcorders, and then edited together by a blind man on crack. Even the packaging was done in a cheesy rip off kind of way using an audio CD or CD-ROM jewel case. By allowing this to be released, the Queen estates, are encouraging what might have been a good rock band, to be ridiculed by any potentially new fans, and some of us old ones. Give your money to charity and bang yourself in the head with a hammer rather than buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Rock at its Energetic Best!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This show is great.Filmed professionally pre-live aid,it offers a glimps at one of Freddie Mercury's best performances.

Even staying on key was not nowhere near what one would have expected from Queen. Freddie is also nowhere near his normal best and struggled to keep and reach certain notes. The person/persons that did the mix for the 5.1 surround sound was not at all successful and the second last track is atrocious. I was severly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for the Queen fan","review":"Worth the price alone for the footage of \\"Love of My Life\\". Buy this one if you like Queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but not really \\"Queen\\"","review":"By far, this isn't the best you will ever hear from the greatest live band of all time, but it's good enough, I guess. The Montreal audience is pitiful, failing to respond to almost anything and not knowing the words to \\"Love of My Life\\". There is the \\"Killer Queen\\" problem where film and sound are different. However, if you're just looking for kind of a 'Greatest Hits Live' DVD, this is just fine. Lacking old classics like \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" and \\"Liar\\", however. If you can get your hands on a performance from earlier days, I would recommend that. Still, this is a great DVD, and if the concert would have been performed to a more enthusiastic audience, I would have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Will Really Rock You!","review":"I got this tape last year as a gift. I put it on and was returned to Madison Square Garden where I've seen Queen many times as a young lad. The show starts off with a blistering version of \\"We will rock you\\". The boys then mix the musical sets from old and new tunes. During \\"get down'make love\\", Roger performs an incredible drum/timpani solo. Of course Brians guitar solo is delightfully magical. Freddie as always steals the show, exhibiting his incredible vocal range. Songs include an acoustic set including \\"love of my life\\". From one guitar and one voice to an all out assault of your senses by these rock and roll gods...er...Queens.-A truly remarkable show captured on video. A must for any fan of classic rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you were expecting great sound better buy a cassette","review":"Most than half the movie I resisted the temptation of turning off that awful sound and began a break dance on the DVD.Freddy would hide of shame.This DVD are live performances, with bad shoot places.If I have not bought it, I wouldnt finish seeing it, thats sad because I personally would give ten stars to Queen itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it, you will too","review":"I *love* this DVD. It features Freddie and the gang, rocking and jamming, and is an incredible show. Brian, Roger and John all have terrific set pieces in this video where they strut their stuff, but if you REALLY want to see strutting, get this thing and watch Freddie. Absolutely amazing - from one hit, to the next, to the next, to the next, Freddie sings, dances, prances, poses, strides, flirts, shudders and gives a mezmerizing, marathon performance until the very end, when he has nothing left to give. You can hear his voice finally buckling under the strain in the last song. Thrilling and touching, this performance is a smash!I enjoy this DVD again and again, and I think you will too. GET IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"This is well worth the money. It has lights, sounds and feels like a larger pinball machine.

They are branded Nino. However, they are very well built and were set up nicely. I have not retuned them yet as the tone straight out of the box is very good. These are very similar to the Meinl Headliner natural bongos.At $40.00 I believe I got a good deal and at this price feel they are priced right for a starter kit. As these were a gift for my 7 year old son I can live with the cute elephant and Nino branding. If I had paid higher I would have expected them to be Meinl branded as listed on Amazon. If you want to pay $80.00 for Meinl bongos you can find Meinl branded bongos similar to this....overall a very good deal for the price I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camera case for Olympus C755","review":"Good deal I got from Amazon.Plus the packaging is good.May not be the best of the cases around, but it holds the camera pretty well and also allows you to carry a pack of extra batteries and memory chips.Material is soft and provides a good cushion to the camera on the inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect bag for a simple get away","review":"I already own a larger bag for all of my other Olympus 765 UZ lens and batteries and the such. I, however, wanted a smaller bag so that I could carry just my camera and an extra memory card and battery. This bag is great! Plus, the price is just right. It fits my camera with it's lens cap just fine and I can fit a couple of memory cards and a extra battery in the top zippered compartment without hassle. If you want a small bag for a small outing then get this bag. I can only speak for the 765UZ, but it should fit the other cameras listed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top heavy","review":"Bag is ok but you must be careful if your moving around a lot. With extra batteries in the top zip compartment it is really top heavy and tips upside down while on your shoulder if the camera is out of it. The velcro does not hold it closed well either. My memory card fell out of the bag during one of these episodes , Thank goodness my husband noticed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another cd for \\"Porgy and Bess\\"","review":"I really like the music to Porgy and Bess but this one is a totally different variation.

The idea sounded great, the writing was a huge disappointment. Even taking into consideration it is over 30 ears old, it is so farfetched and the main character is one of the dumbest \\"heros\\" I've seen.

The character development is exceptional but there's enough action to keep you entertained as well as interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set that gets tons of compliments...","review":"We bought this flatware a few months ago and we are still delighted with it. Unlike the previous reviewer, we do not find it at all uncomfortable or awkward to hold. It is attractive and looks as fabulous now as when we bought it, despite frequent use and dishwasher cleaning. I highly recommend this set. It is a much better value to find a retailer that sells the larger set (63 pieces can be found for $299)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set","review":"I bought this set about two years ago and still love it.

Sure I got bored with the first album after it was seriously overplayed, but in 2002 I started listening to Naked and Famious again. I played it on my own show and people began to rave about the Presidence once more. Then I picked up II and it was GREAT. The songs haven't lost their touch, although Puffy Little Shoes isn't that great of a song; if you need an album to just jam to, and you're not looking for anything serious...This is tha album for you! Although you can catch the agony of the one-hit-wonder in Froggie, and sure singing about getting a golf club (Toob Amplifier) is goofy, but this is a good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Fun songs, Prez's always come through! 1st album is still my favorite.

Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Giallo Surprise","review":"From the title, you may be thinking that this is another 'Morti Viventi' excursion from Italy but, surprise, it emerges as a gripping, giallo who-done-it taking place at an ancient etruscan dig. Director Armando Crispino slowly builds his film around red herring set pieces practically bouncing Alex Cord and Samantha Eggar off walls. With some extremely gory effects for its time , the film ,along with Mario Bavas' 'BAY OF BLOOD', is an early version of the slice and dice genre so prominent in the late seventies. I am looking forward for this release because BCI has given us such excellent transfers of Euro-horrors in the past. The Eurovista release has numerous splices and scratches which disrupt the action, hopefully , this edition will give the film the reputation it deserves in the giallo canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible dvd! Don't buy it...","review":"I liked the movie a lot, it's no zombie movie (see the cover art), but a giallo (Italian thriller with lots of gore). But this dvd (on the Eurovista label) is horrible!! It looks like a very old videotape, with scratches, parts missing etc. The widescreen is too wide, parts on top (heads of the actors!) and bottom of the image are cut off. I regret buying this dvd, especially because it was very expensive. I read that there's a much better version (Red Code label), I'm going to buy that one. That version is also expensive, but you get a better dvd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring.","review":"I'm a huge fan of horror, Italian horror and giallo but I could not get into this movie.

Not me, who apparently had to spend a lot of years struggling to peel various fruits and vegetables, sometimes with a knife, sometimes with other peelers. But when Cook's Illustrated recommended this inexpensive peeler (and said don't underestimate it based on its cost) I tried it. And was amazed. It peels easily, the peel coming away from the fruit/vegetable and the main part well preserved while your hands stay clean and out of danger. This is truly a product that makes food preparation easy. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best peeler","review":"Best peeler I have ever used. So good I have purchased this in multiples.

JWK is not who I'd like to see as Scarlett but gave a bearable performance. (providing she wore contacts, which she did not) TD was an absolutly, not very good Rhett. There was nothing resembling Rhett Butler about him or his acting. The bloody rape and murder scene was completely unneccsary and ruined the entire thing. Generally, anything considering the plot of this mini-series is bad. I did however enjoy Jean Smart and Anne Margaret. They where the light of this awful mistake.

She is way out of what we relate with the Scarlett O'Hara that we see in Vivien Leigh. And Timothy Dalton, boy, he is much better off with Rochester in \\"Jane Eyre\\" than with Rett Butler !

The Scarlett book sequel was slightly different than expected by Alexandra Ripley but the movie was just way out in left field-not so much the story but just the actors...do watch it if your a fan just like I am but don't hold your expectations too high, in this movie Scarlett is not likable, not beautiful, and not endearing to us and the feeble attempt she makes at talking like a southerner is irritating...why the directors chose English actors is a mystery to me??? Timothy is handsome and big of course and he fits Rhett decent-not Clark Gable of course but still I know none of us expect either of them to equal Vivien Leigh or Clark but it would have been nice to at least seen a good attempt for a novel that was a sequel to such a phenomenal book like GWTW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This movie was horrible! Not only did they distort the book, but they made it into something sordid. The first half of the movie remaind more or less true to the book, but it just went steeply downhill from there.

Scarlett continues to share her triumphs and loses, but copes with them as she always has. \\"Tomorrow is another day,\\" becomes the theme as Scarlett battles for her lost love, and regains her self confidence.

I have watched my VHS tape about 100 times and the DVD about half a dozen times so far. I think that in some ways, this story is more romantic than GWTW. Of course if you make comparisons, no one can replace Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, but I must say that Timothy Dalton had my blood pressure rising!!! The story line was very interesting and I feel that is certainly brought the original story to a conclusion after 55 years. Didn't we all want to find out if Rhett went back to Scarlett or did she marry Ashley?? The supporting cast was great with Julie Harris, Stephen Collins, Jean Smart, .... Joanne Whalley is very pretty, and fit into the role of Scarlett very well. How interesting that the two actresses to play Scarlett were both from England- I really liked this mini-series, and would recommend it to even the die hard GWTW fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue-eyed Rhett, brown-eyed Scarlett?","review":"I was sorely disappointed in this mini-series. It was not true to Alexandra Ripley's book, which in turn was not true to the original GWTW. The whole murder and trial plot line was bizarre. Why did Belle Watling appear in Charleston? Rhett with blue eyes, Scarlett with brown eyes? Whoever wrote the screenplay was not familiar enough with the original material to realize what details were just not meant to be messed with. Okay as a television drama, but it doesn't live up to its association with GWTW. If you love Gone with the Wind, the characters of Rhett and Scarlett, or just want to see the screen adaptation of the book Scarlett, avoid this movie, you will be disappointed too."},{"rating":"1","title":"No word to describe how bad this movie is!","review":"IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE A MOVIE BASED ON A BOOK AND NOT FOLLOW IT AT ALL WATCH THIS BOOK!In the words of Clark Gable in GWTW this movie was \\"Awful, Just awful!\\" It had no right to be ever associated with the great work of Margaret Mitchell that many generations have grown to love. My mom first shared GWTW with me when I was about 8, and I enjoyed it even then. Last Year in 8th grade I read the book and gradually became an obsessive fan, or Windie as we call oursleves. I checked Scarlett out of the library and read it and I enjoyed it although it did not compare in its magnitude to GWTW. Then my friend (who is also a fan) decided to rent the movie and we were completely confused as to where the ending came from.

I had read both GWTW and Scarlett and seen the first movie, so i picked it up, and watched it. i have never wasted my time or money so badly. first of all, it took about 6 hours to watch. i thought the first half of the movie was ok and that it followed very closely to the book. but the second half was horrible. when cat was born that whole scene was disgusting, and cat was shunned aside to make room for lord fenton. they might as well not have even had cat in the film. they changed the whole plot line with the murder of fenton and the trial. that never happened in the book. they also cut Grainne out. timothy dalton was an ok rhett butler but he lacked the charm and arrogance. but joanne whaley kilmer looked like michael jackson in the film!!! it was so terrible. there was waaaaay too much adult content for this to be rated pg 13. it shoud be at least R."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not dissappointed but not satisfied","review":"After watching Scarlett and having read the book twice, I am here to tell you the movie and the book are competly two different things. THere are numerous mistakes in the movie. Scarlett didn't have green eyes and her eyes are the thing that draws men to her, they could of atleast put eye color contacts in and I was dissappointed in the Rhett they chose and how they presented him in the movie. They made him too soft. In the book, the trial of when Scarlett is commented of murder doesn't even happen. Its like they didn't even try to keep it faithful to Gone With The Wind, let alone the book, Scarlett is portrayed as a strong-headed woman, in the movie during the end she is portrayed weak and ends up letting a man beat and rape her which Scarlett would never do and THAT didn't even happen in the book. As a movie, it was ok but as a sequel to Gone With The Wind, absoutly a failer, and trying to be faithful to the book, they did an awful job."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I bought it...","review":"I can't believe a movie this long could go nowhwere.

First of all Vivien is gone and so is Clark, Joanne Kilmer does the best she can and so does Timothy Dalton. The scenery and the costumes are beautiful althought they can never rival the brilliance of Selznicks demands on the set, the sequel brings a closing to the saga of the fall of the south and the Scarlett's emergence as a woman.Although the movie is very different from the book, it gracefully wraps up the story and the passion that is Rhett and Scarlett."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequel to Gone with the Wind!","review":"I first read the book. I thought it would be fun to see where Scarlet and Rhett go from where the first movie left off. I loved it from start to finish! When it became available on DVD I bought it right away. After the initial adjustment to different characters playing the familiar roles, I became lost in the movie just as I had with the book. I didn't want it to end!

I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not do Alexandra Ripley's Work Justice","review":"The costumes and scenery were great--and it was nice to see so much of Charleston represented, as I used to live there. However, I somewhat doubt that any of the actors involved read \\"Scarlett,\\" much less GWTW! I wonder if whoever wrote the screenplay even bothered to read either work all the way through. It surely doesn't seem like it.It is all very sad because Ms. Ripley's book is really good!

The Scarlett portrayed in the movie does not do justice to the character of Scarlett herself. Nor does Rhett. In my opinion the movie adaption of the book was right on. The book was horrible to begin with. The characters are just not the way they are supposed to act. As a movie by itself it was good, but as an accurate portrayal of Scarlett and Rhett, they couldn't of done any worse.

It was a complete waist of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not think this movie was on the same level as GWTW.","review":"This movie and book should never have been a sequal to Gone With The Wind as it was not in the same class as GWTW. The acting in Scarlet was just tolerable and the theme was totally unrealitic. Scarlet rates in my opinion right along side any Harliquen romance novel on the market today.

Personally, I fall into the former. Regardless of personal taste however, there is absolutely no denying the explosive originality and craftsmanship.Wispelwey's cellistic and musical personality is incredibly compatible with Beethoven's faceted music.

How wrong he was.I found the writing to be tedious and over done. Much of the time I spent reading I was thinking \\"who cares?\\". While the characters were well developed much of the book was spent on details that didn't seem to matter to the story.I would have just stopped reading it about 1/2 way through if I didn't have a hang up on not finishing a book I start. My recommendations on this book are to spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"affecting blend of humor and pathos","review":"One of Boyle's most accessible novels, this one sort of took me by surprise. Though much of the narrative is focused on creating a detailed (and probably quite accurate) parody of life at a literary retreat, the underlying story of a man stranded far from home grows increasingly poignant. Boyle manages to articulate a range of emotions all the way to the genuinely moving climax. Not as powerful or cohesive as some other Boyle novels like Drop City, but well worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An good novel, but not nearly as good as Boyle's other books","review":"T.C. Boyle's books are always a joy to read, because of the author's expert use of the language. East is East, however, doesn't quite match up to the rest of the Opus.

Nevertheless, I've heard plenty of abridged versions of books on tape that have propelled me toward the whole book. This one repelled me. The characters are tired cliches, the situations aren't terribly original, and the writing (the expressions used, the occasional metaphor) is sub-par. The main character, Hiro Tanaka, is oddly inconsistent. (I suppose you could say that about a lot of people, but why waste your time reading about them.) The fact that much of the action occurs in the artists' colony on a Georgian island is particularly a source of displeasure. Please, authors, stop writing about yourselves and your craft and your trade! Two points off just for that. Don't buy this book without giving it a good look-over first.

Two songs are good, one even sliding into a stereolab moment, but the rest of the album is abysmal. Previous tricky music has been sexy without trying, and this unfortunately tries without suceeding. Maybe tricky's problem is his lack of a strong woman these days; the album needs a bjork or a martina.

If you liked his other cd's, you'll definitely love this one; you'll even have to admit it's his best till now. (It'll probably take a short period of 'getting used to', but that's only for the better! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"the screaming of Jesus being impaled would have been better","review":"Tricky should put down the Crack Pipe and get with the rest of society. This Cd was a sell out to white America. I can only offer this comment, Tricky... if this is all you have left Musically, it is time to end it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricky ...","review":"Get this if you like pretentious self absorbed whack vocals over pretty good beats (mainly because of Muggs). Tricky tries to talk like he's an innovator, but he's just a ... MC from an innovative group. The talent is behind him. They'd be better without him."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Hip Than Trip","review":"With assistance from his new friends, DJ Muggs and Dame Grease, Tricky's sound is mutated into a funkier,digestable mix of sounds. The album is totally intense with the crystal clear cut sound of \\"For Real\\" to the album climax, \\"Hot Like a Sauna\\" with an angry rapper Mad Dog and a sly singer Kioka. Other guest artists that are on the album include Bob Khaleel and D'na. The final track to the music is \\"Scrappy Love\\", a scary cut with a confused drum beat and wandering vocals. A jump away from previous Tricky albums but still a pleaser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but sweet","review":"A very organic venture for Tricky...With a less synthetic sound than what I was used to hearing from him. He still maintains his gloomy sound, however, which keeps the mood of this album in-tune with his other releases. The raps on a few of the songs like \\"hot like a sauna\\" have an angry energy to them--not always staying to the beat keeps you paying attention. One complaint--it's a short album and when it was over I was hoping for two more tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the Bom Bom Diggy . . .","review":"Despite its relatively short length, this is top drawer Tricky, along with everything else pre MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. MAXINQUAYE must still be considered his best, but I reach for this album just as much. Tricky IS tricky, the way he manipulates beats and borrows lyrics and makes them his own. He's got some thumpin' help on board for this album, too.\\"For Real\\" and \\"Contradictive\\" are different approaches for Tricky; a different kind of mellow with acoustic guitar and piano touches. Elsewhere, Tricky rocks as hard as anything from ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES and gets bugged-out trippy on the haunting \\"Wash My Soul\\" and \\"Scrappy Love.\\" \\"I Like the Girls\\" contains an X-rated hyperspeed rap that is so wigged-out. Tricky, at this point at least, is still the master jester of head-trip music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play it a few times, you'll get into it.","review":"As with ever Tricky album since Maxinquaye, you have to listen to the album a few times before you get into it. Can someone tell me when the Baby Mambos CD comes out, the title etc etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been worse, possibly","review":"At least we got one good song. And: I am fortunate enough to be buying overpriced Japanese releases which include, always, bonus tracks: in this case, as with Angels, the bonus tracks were as a whole better than the album. Not as overdone and histronic. Though in the case of Juxtapose you could also chalk it down to them lacking 'Mad Dog' Bionic, the weak weak English *rapper* ruining half this album by his very presence. I cant stand that kind of lawn-sprinkler ratchety delivery. Should of got Roots Manuva instead though if he had Tricky would have lost heavy in the lyrical content department. Seems like he just gets more lightweight every time. PS: I wish he didnt feel the need to perform Rage Against the Machine-style when he plays live. Saw him here in Tokyo and it was worth it for only one song, the Chll rob G cover off PMT. Pick up the baton or drop it completely T."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still more interesting than anything you'd hear on the radio","review":"If my one-line summary sounds like a less-than-emphatic endorsement, that's because it is. This album has grown on me after repeated listening, but it's still nowhere near as good as Maxinquaye or the first half of Pre-Millenium Tension. I'm a huge huge Tricky fan because I appreciate how far he's willing to push the musical envelope and I find his whole vibe to be completely hypnotic. Still, this album seems tossed off at times and it never really settles into a satisfying groove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell out album","review":"I have a hard time understanding the other reviews I've seen for this album. I consider myself to be a hard core Tricky fan. But this latest album was an enormous disappointment. I listen to Tricky because he's different (very different) from the rest of the Hip Hop, rap, ambient, industrial crowd. Maxinquaye is an excellent sample of what i expect from his brand of genius. His work with Massive Attack is also indicative of his ability to entertain without marching to the same beat. I'm used to music that only HE could perform. This album sounds like it could be effectively performed by anyone. The first 7 songs on this album fall into the latest (and sadly the most lucrative) brand of music: Disposable. Most of these songs are the kind that would get played 100 times a day for 2 months & by month #3 be considered \\"played out\\". This is one that will get shelved, maybe traded in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Westerns","review":"These films are something else. Sparse and direct with great dialogue- no fat whatsoever. Randolph Scott defines what it is to be a man. Good looking women, handsome men- lots of dust and lumpy rocks. Thoughtful with gun fights, intrigue and ambiguous, complex villians. A great night in. Very much recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just great!","review":"For years I've been waiting for Boetticher's films on DVD. It was worth it.

These movies will stick in the mind - stick in your craw, if you will. You'll find yourself thinking about them and your feet heading for the DVD player so you can watch them yet again. Others have reviewed the movies so no need here. Just buy it. Buy it for your friends. I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are not kidding!","review":"Don't use the Rain Bird in a tight area if you have the sprinkler mounted on an Orbit 1/2-Inch Metal Ring Sprinkler Base for instance. Although you can adjust the pattern controls to spray in closer than 25 ft. the pattern will lay down water close to the sprinkler head at very high pressure and could rip up your new lawn. The Claber 8709 does a better job close in. If you mount the Rain Bird on a taller sprinkler stand it may do better in a tighter space but that will be expensive. I think it better to use the Rain Bird for open spaces, as it was intended for 25-41 feet. The oscillation controls are hard to move. They are an older designed. Newer products have easier to use adjusters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our kiddo loves these","review":"OK, so she has no real idea what the shapes are - but our 18 month old loves these bath toys - in and out of the bath.

Jo is a true example of someone who fully understands and accepts meaning of life and makes best out of hardships that we tend to ignore and deny."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Was So Exciting!","review":"For me, as a German Artist, it was impressive to read about the writer's experience during 9/11. Although I witnessed the terror attacks on TV, it was nothing compared to reading this first-hand account. It touched me very deeply. When I visit Ground Zero I have a better understanding of what happened to the people of this city and continues to be a part of their every day experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and Honest","review":"How lucky the readers of this book are that Jo Singel did not keep her journal to herself forever!!! You can sense the release of Jo's spirit on each page as she so candidly pens her deepest thoughts. I could visualize all of the people in her life through her descriptive portrayals, and would have loved to have met them all. Her love for her son Jonathan is fierce, and will bring any parent to tears. This book will inspire anyone who reads it to be honest with themself and follow their heart. Yes, Jo is a woman, but everyone can relate to Jo's feelings during her search for meaning and purpose in life!! She reminds us all that being honest with our thoughts and feelings isn't always easy, but in doing so, we not only help ourselves, but others, too. In the words of Jo's Uncle Jimmy, \\"You all love one another. You hear?\\" Those were his thoughts and feelings, but who wouldn't benefit from those words? Thanks, Jo, for a great book!!!! Keep writing for us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about an \\"open\\" book!!!","review":"Never have I read anything so candid and insightful.

She wascourageous to reveal the secret of her life and thedeepest emotions. By doing so, she not only helpedherself to reconcile with her past, but also helpedmany who may be in the middle of the struggle. Iappreciate her candidness and reflection on life inthis book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that touched my heart","review":"what a wonderful gift this book is to anyone who reads it. I am in awe of Jo's willingness to share so much with her readers...to allow herself to be so vulnerable. In doing so she allows her readers to connect with her in a soul to soul way that is very rare in books or in life. Her description of her \\" diving moments\\" reminds of my own - and how critical it is to be conscious and present in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outward journey to an inward destination...","review":"...is the only way I can sum up \\"The Dandelions of Woodlawn Avenue\\" by Jo Singel. Through her stories, letters, poems and journeys we hear the voice of a woman who experiences the world as a child with the wisdom of a sage. The book shows that one's destination inside the soul can only happen once we journey out to the edges of our universe. Should be on every shelf between Mitch Albom and Leo Buscaglia."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dandelions of Woodlawn Avenue - A Friend","review":"The author shared her deepest feelings, much of which I could relate to, regarding her family, and friends. I wanted the book to go on and on. I didn't want it to end. I would love to see this made into a play or movie. Everyone has feelings about their family, but are hesitant to share."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired mystery","review":"After reading this book's description I really looked forward to sitting down with it . . . and was terribly disappointed when I did. Unfortunately this tale runs out of gas in less than 100 pages, which is doubly unfortunate as the book goes for over 200 pages. There really isn't much of a mystery, the plot is contrived and simple, the characters are wooden and one dimensional and the flavor of Ireland advertised on the cover is no more than a few scenes in a few pubs. To me this read more like a made for TV movie script, (How to Write a Mystery in 3 East Steps), rather than a novel. This one didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kindle version is useless.","review":"This is not a comment on the printed version. The Kindle version is so poorly formatted it is basically useless.

This book may or may not speak your language, but it is the REAL THING. If you feel a calling to investigate your origens, deeper and divine self, and unconditional love this book will not let you down. There are meditations to do and work to be done. This is, as it's title states, a workbook. If you decide to take the big step into your higher self by cleaning out old and foreign energies, this book will be a wonderful teacher. I have been using the meditations for about two weeks now and have already noticed dramatic changes.Like most books of this nature, if it is attractive to you, then it is meant for you.

I can feel the love and compassion from the Pleiadians when they join me in the various processes, initiations and healings. You get the large wiew described in a juicy and poetic language along with how to grow and why. You are introduced to a special kind of healing chamber whith a large number of variations. This might be your portal to extatic and peaceful living!I can also warmly recomend Barbara Marciniacs channeled material.

I enjoyed reading Marciniak's book about empowerment and I like the Pleiadians, even if it turns out just to be a thought form, but this was a little too far-fetched to me. Roses, all these \\"techniques\\" the author claims to have channeled just sounded ridiculous. All the power to you if you want to practice this stuff and it helps you in some way, but I think this author in particular has just jumnped on the Pleiadian bandwagon and is selling rubbish.

(Those hoping to use solely the flashcards would be even more disappointed.) Instead, I would rely on a good review book. The \\"flashcards\\" themselves are more like notecards with bulleted information on the back; however, they are oddly organized and are sometimes difficult to understand because of their brevity. Within the nineteen categories, the cards are arranged in a strange order - for example, the \\"blood\\" flashcard comes after the flashcards with the components (plasma, RBCs, WBCs) and some cards seem repetitive (there is one called \\"pathway of blood\\" that is nearly identical to \\"human heart\\", save for a diagram on one).

Now that I have this CD, I listen to it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad I have this album","review":"If you're a Neil Diamond fan or willing to listen to his music, then this is indeed a must have.Neil's music and lyrics from my understanding has never promoted profanity, drugs, crimes, vulgarity, etc. Frankly, I think that a lot of singers and songwriters can learn something from him. I admit I've never meant Neil personally, but I'm told that he's a fine man.I've always loved this music since I was little. My parents got me into Neil Diamond, and since then I now have three albums including this one.Therefore, I think it will be fair to say, I liked Neil Diamond right from the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disregard mhollan1 comments, please!","review":"This is one of Neil's all-time best. There are not many artists whose voices are so infectious that they can transcend over pop ballads, rock songs and traditional hymns as Neil so fluently does throughout this album. \\"Songs Of Life\\" is one of the most beautiful ballads ever written, and were it not for the classics \\"Hello Again\\" and \\"Love On The Rocks\\" it probably would have been released as a single and climbed the charts on its own merit. The inspirational rockers \\"Amazed And Confused\\" and \\"Hey Louise\\" are great sing-alongs, and \\"Summerlove\\" is a wonderful smooth jazz number. To anyone who has ever listened to Neil, this is the most important to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERIOR !","review":"A very good piece of work.

Decent Album","review":"This semi decent soundtrack is good as long as you haven't seen the movie... otherwise the schlock of the movie will make this CD of work a bitter pill to swallow, and your thoughts will be filled with terrible, terrible acting by Lucy Arnaz and Lawrence Olivier. I would suggest buying another Neil Diamond CD made before this one. The Diamond CDs only get worse as the years go on, and the Jazz Singer Soundtrack is the last listenable thing made by Neil Diamond. \\"America\\", \\"Love on the Rocks\\", \\"Songs of Life\\" and \\"Summerlove\\" are pretty good tunes. Those tunes make the disc worth owning for a hardcore fan.. However, \\"You Baby\\", \\"Hey Louise\\", \\"Acapulco\\", \\"On The Robert E Lee\\" and \\"Jerusalem\\" are utter garbage. \\"Amazed and Confused\\" is unlistenable. \\"Adon Olom\\" and \\"Kol Nidre/My Name Is Yussel\\" are just things put on the album to take up space. I would suggest Stones, Moods, or Greatest Hits over this..they are money well spent.. the Jazz Singer is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"strong music supports the movie","review":"Neil has been able to create strong songs on this one, and happely for him this was neccessary cause the move wasnt really a smash hit, as the story was weak as i can remember, cause i was still very young at that time...but anyways...the music is great, strong songs with 'america' one of his everlasting new classics, the touching \\"hello again\\" , the joyfull 'acapulco' and so many others, real neil diamond gems to be enjoyed with a great glass of old red wine, on a hot summer night in yr beautiful garden..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Every Minute...","review":"of this soundtrack!

It is a visual rubbish heap. There is the impression of wanting to save the planet; rather than staying with a number of points and principles that will enable simpletons like me to understand it.The deluge of information for the likes of me is mind-deadening.

My boys are 5 and 6 years old and can't get enough of this game. It's fun and we're all learning something too! The playing time is quite short so it's easy to squeeze in a round or two before bedtime and also gives everyone a chance to win a hand. Our only wish for improvement: more! More cards would make this even more fun.We took this game to Family Game Night at the boys' martial arts school and it was a hit! I'm actually ordering one right now for a friend of ours who played it that night and has a birthday this week.I highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"Bought this b/c a friend recommended it.

When she first started reading was not yet there but she was able to ID the states easily and could even name the majority of the states on a blank map on a napkin on our southwest airlines flight! I was shocked. She knows where the states are and the names. Now that she is strong in reading she can read the capitals and nicknames and is even starting to remember the capitals for the states outside of playing the game. Great game for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic learning game","review":"Fantastic game! Great fun in learning states, capitals, US geography and more.

Great game!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for young children","review":"I bought this game for my 9 year old. He was way too old for it. We both found it boring and non-educational. The questions relating to the faces and colors on the card do not help with learning anything about states. It may be fun for small kids but after 8 probably not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"My kids LOVE this game and so do me and my husband! It isn't a long game, so the kids don't get bored with it. We usually play a few times in one \\"sitting\\".

It is a bit hard for him to play, as he can't read many of the words on the cards and 'speed' is really important in this game. BUT...the rest of us absolutely love it! :) My 8 year old is very good and is learning so much from playing. I agree with the ages listed (8-12 years old), as I think anyone younger than about 8 would have a hard time reading the cards.

Now, 4 years later, we wonder where they went. This is a great CD to be listened to at any time. It is very upbeat and includes the first hits from Shania Twain (who now has about 60493 hits), Hootie & the Blowfish, Alanis Morissette, and the divine Joan Osborne. This disc is recommended for its wide spectrum of styles and variety. You will love this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Updike","review":"OF THE FARM is not for the feint-hearted, nor for those looking for sympathetic characters. It is grueling, a word by word march on strained relationships and bad decisions. But, that's also what makes it worthwhile, Updike prying into the human condition. Joey is undoubtedly Updike himself, leaving Olinger, marrying poorly, and living by the ocean in order to breathe. The mother is selfishness personified. The new wife lacks compassion. The only redeeming character is the young stepson, too young to know exactly what is going on around him. Still, intense Updike is great Updike, even if it brings a twinge of pain to turn to the next page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiny & Terrific","review":"A must have for fans of Updike and new readers. This small novel is amazingly detailed and shockingly deep. The ideas touched in this story will have your brain kicking you. Updike has that ability to trap you in small menial suburban problems and make them glorious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Updike or Not","review":"I am not a huge Updike reader. Of the Farm is rich in description of character & scenery but not much of story. So is it worth a read? You bet it is. He reveals more about emotions & how to handle them than any shrink is willing to do. After all the purpose of a book is to read it at least once, not come back repeatedly for hundreds a dollars an hour getting nothing done except getting the shrink's car paid for & detailed. I enjoyed the book. Actually the farm is the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but still worth reading","review":"This book is not John Updike's best work. However, it is still an enjoyable read. His skill as a writer goes unparalleled as usual, and his writing in this rural drama is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of a great series","review":"It's too bad, really --this is a pleasant enough little read, but compared to Winslow's other riveting and meticulously researched Neal Carey novels, this is just passable. Consider: Buddha's mirror taught me more about the Chinese Cultural Revolution than any textbook, and California Fire & Life made me the best fire expert this side of Red Adaire. But this book has obviously NOT been researched, and perhaps even written in 3 days. Did he need the money? Was the publisher hounding him? This is just going through the motions. It's clear that the author is bored with his detective, has no more to say about Joe Graham (who barely makes an appearance here) and confused about how to deal with Neal's domestic life. Don't look for any more Neal Carey novels; the author is written out on that subject. Read \\"A Cool Breeze,\\" \\"Buddha's Mirror\\", \\"The Death & Life of Bobby Z\\" and \\"California Fire & Life\\" for the best of Don Winslow. And P.S. When he's in top form, NOBODY writes better."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is one you can't put down","review":"When I first received this book from my fiance he told me I would have to read this.

The costume is durable, but the shoe straps on he bottom broke - but they weren't really needed to keep the foot coverings in place.

It basically looked just like the description shows. He seemed to enjoy wearing this costume. He commented that the mask should have been larger because in the photo it covers the whole face and head, but in reality it does not.

However, Carl Mikuli creates an obstacle in this book. Mikuli, being one of Chopin's dear students, thought that because he was a student of Chopin he knew Chopin enough to change his music. While editing Chopin's works, he would change notes, fingerings, and other important articulation tools to the liking he believed was Chopin's. When comparing Chopin's original transcripts to those that Mikuli edited, there are huge differences that make the music quite different to what Chopin had hoped. I personally recommend Chopin's works edited by Paderevsky (or Paderewsky), for he kept every single aspect of the music Chopin wrote, even specific dynamic marks. The Paderevsky editions give a clear understanding of what Chopin wanted for his pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, it's not the Paderewski","review":"Speaking of correcting misinformation, this is definitely *not* the Paderewski edition. The Mikuli and Paderewski editions are certainly not the same, although if you look in the commentary in the back of any Paderewski Chopin score, you will find that the Mikuli is one of the many sources that were consulted for the Paderewski.Dover used to publish a reproduction of the Paderewski edition years ago, and it was wonderful.

Proctor and Bergman are deft commentators, skewering everything from our fascination with plastic to the disposable society that creates and throws away everything from light bulbs to celebrities. Spending time with the Theatre has always been akin to hanging out with the frat-brother that got the full ride to Harvard. At turns hilariously sophomoric, frighteningly insightful but always entertaining, this is classic Firesign.

So if you don't like experiments so much as a more traditional vintage sound \\"Travessia\\" will probably work for you. \\"Clube Da Esquina\\" experiments but focuses on offering great music and succeeds at that. \\"Minas\\" is not successful musically or experimentally, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure !","review":"This movie takes you on a grand, childhood, adventure.

While, the company that bought Jensen (when it went bankrupt) was kind enough to send me an electronci copy of the manual, the product has some serious flaws.

I lost my last one (which I'd had for the last 4 years) and wanted to try this out.I don't know what it's made out of--plastic? Foam? It's awful. Sure, it exfoliates, but it feels like I'm scratching my skin. Little bits of purple stuff come off into the tub.My REAL pumice stones (new one included) have all been phenomenal. You can boil them to disinfect them. I can pumice the fragile skin on the top of my foot and it doesn't hurt. I can go to town on my heel and it comes out soft as butter and doesn't hurt at all. That's what a pumice stone SHOULD do.Don't waste your money with a cheap, scratchy thing that crumbles with each use.

Since I was already diagnosed, I could easily point out what kind of syndromes apply to me right now. Sudden Changes, clumsiness, stressful peer pressure; these are exactly what I have suffered for ages. And according to my doctor, I have some difficulties in reading implications, which still gives me a real headache!So the point is you need to read this book whether you are diagnosed or not sure you have AS, autism, PDD, and any kinds of developmental problems.

It was a sparsely written book that appeared to stretch out the very little information to a few words per page to make it a 46 page book. There was information that could explain the syndrome and associated symptoms to young children but was too simplistic for an adult to gain much aid from. Even the pictures were simple and the combination made the book appear to have beena hurried and poorly planned venture on the part of the author and/or publisher. I cannot recommend this book for a broad overview of AS or High functioning Autism. There was not enough information to make this book a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this book.

I own over 500 DVD's at home and this is THE single most hazardous box to hold a collection of DVD's.Each DVD is inserted in a sleeve and all these sleeves are glued together in an \\"accordeon\\" type of holder. I use term \\"glued\\" very loosely: 1 tiny drop of glue at the top of the sleeve and another tiny one at the bottom.Then you slip this \\"accordeon\\" sideways \\"inside\\" the \\"bottle\\". If you try to lift the bottle by its \\"neck\\", chances are all your DVD's will slip to the floor faster than Jeannie could blink!...Even getting a DVD out of this \\"accordeon\\" is hazardous; picture 20 DVD's held in a barely glued cardboard Slinky and you will have a pretty accurate idea!!!Word from the wise: forget about keeping the DVD'S it their original holder...

Unfortunately, though, the scale is a huge pain to use: you place an item to be weighed, hit HOLD, then the \\"shipper\\" button to select the carrier, then the \\"service\\" button to indicate delivery type. Only then do you see the rate. It then requires three keystrokes to prepare to weigh another item, after which EACH of the steps above must be repeated since the settings aren't persistent from one weighing to the next. Bottom line: this scale is functional but not really useful; it's clear that the people who designed this don't actually ship packages very often, and that they didn't solicit feedback from anyone who does."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Royal Pain In The @#S!","review":"After returning 2 of the RC40 scales, I have yet another defective unit.

Not having current rates available makes the RC40 no better than a scale costing $5.Although I must admit the RC40 makes a very nice (although expensive) paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!! Worthless!!!!!","review":"I purchased this for Ebay. I thought it worked just fine... but the post office kept telling me that I was putting too much postage on my packages. Those were the \\"up to date\\" rates the scale was giving me! Then I had to reformat my computer and that meant re-installing the RC40 software on my computer (which was not a hard thing to do) BUT from then on, this thing will ABSOLUTELY NOT download the new shipping rates from the internet. It keeps telling me that for a regular letter, the postage is $0.34... and we all know that's not true. This is a waste of good money. You're better off buying a cheap $10.00 scale for weighing and just look up the rates on the internet. Don't waste your time or money on this thing. Oh yeah... I emailed customer service at Royal and never heard from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking junk.","review":"I've never written a review but this product deserves it.This product is junk.

Thats a loss of 2.4 oz every customer we sold a pound of chocolate to. This may be good for a postal scale and not beyond that.I was measuring ingredients to make soap and they were measured inaccurately as the digital scale is insensitive to a small addition until it is 0.4 oz or more of change. messed up the whose recipe.The scale only reads 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 etc and the odd digits are missing. Although you rarely see an increase as you add to the scale in that order. It usually goes up by 0.4 or 0.6 at a time. When you remeasure it, it is a different weight altogether.At first I was excited.... this has really turned out to be too good to be true. Yes it is too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible customer service","review":"Scale a little difficult to set up. Had problem with downloading rates from internet. Called for support help.

Called back first number said he couldn't help me. Very frustrating. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Finally got it set up. Very complicated for mailing regular daily letters. Must push several buttons to get weight and postage for one letter. After you get postage for one letter you have to push five buttons to get back to the starting point. Tried pushing buttons as suggested, it does not work. I am sending this scale back. Mainly due to lack of support in getting familiar with the use of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weighs OK, no support, downloads gone","review":"The scale performs its basic function well enough, which is weighing packages. I've even weighed packages over 40 lbs successfully. But it's very annoying to use. Actually finding a rate on the scale, if you can get them downloaded successfully, requires pushing a number of buttons in the right order. Plus you can't alter the rates to match any discounts you might have gotten from the shipper. I quickly gave up on trying to use it to find rates -- the web is faster and more accurate. A major annoyance for me is that you can't set it to stay on until you shut it off. It will shut off after one minute of non-use, and you can't change that. Good if you use batteries, but I have mine connected to an AC adapter, so I'd like it to stay on until I shut it off. Finally, it looks like software downloads for these are no more.... Oh well, at least it does weigh accurately and is still working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Royal pile of stinking dung","review":"Anybody who got theirs to update should consider themselves lucky.

Most musical selections -- be they vocals or instrumentals -- are perky. A listener to this album who wants an authentic 1920's musical selection across the bias should enjoy the selections, which play all together for slightly over 1 hour. There are a couple of songs included on this album, whose arrangements and vocal styling I find to be formatted somewhat tediously, but all represented musical styles may be acceptable to some folks. I find this album fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The swashbuckling continues","review":"Carter's fantasy, an open tribute to Edgar Rice Burrough'sBarsoomsaga, continues in this fourth book of the series. The first sentence in the story reads, \\"I had only minutes to live.\\" That sets the headlong pace for our hero, accompanied by a winged man from a long-lost race, a chitinous Kalood who has learned the emotion of friendship, and a \\"bold and daring young princeling.\\" Together, they set off after Niamh the Fair, a princess chronically in need of being saved. Little things like the giant serpent from the ruined temple of an ancient death-cult decorate their landscape, assuring plenty of fun for all.You get the general idea. It's all there: the hero so honorable that he stumbles over his own nobility, the bumbling romantic confusion, powerful but deranged bad guys, and swords-and-zapguns combat.

She had skill in acting, dancing, and always had a cool outfit (not to mention).This movie is kind of different from the first, but not any worse.

In the first week of use the input feed coupling on the side of the box came apart from the box. Plugged the coupling back in, but continues to come out. The problem appears that the design of the coupling is such that it will not handle the pressure if there is a cut-off on the hose. So when I turn off the water when I move from one area to another, the coupling cannot handle the pressure and shoots off, spraying water all over the box, patio, furniture... Looking at the coupling appears it just has a flimsy plastic notch to hold onto the box - very poor design. Returned box for a refund as this appears to be a design defect inherent in all boxes. Too bad, nice concept.

Its also pretty easy.The other problem is that unless you fasten it to something or put heavy rocks on top, it will likely just fall over when you're pulling your hose out.This would be a 10 if the parts that mattered were metal and didn't break, and if it didn't fall over when you pulled your hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic junk","review":"Like every other cheap plastic hose caddy I've owned in the past, this one leaked.

The box does tip over sometimes when your pulling the hose out and you get 1/2 the hose out. The box also has to sit perfectly level or the plastic twists and the lid won't close tightly. Also, the wind up reel and automatic winder sometimes get out of sync, which causes you to move the spindle to a place where the unit will work properly again. The worst thing about this box is that the spindle the hose wraps around is made of plastic and will break, as mine did, rendering the box useless. $[...] bucks, down the drain! Get a metal hose winder or a more sturdy one than this piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Support","review":"When a company abandons the customer support department it is a clear indication that this company is on a downward slide and is headed for failure.

It is big and heavy and does not always stay in place when you pull the hose. You actually have to manually turn the hose handle to get the hose out. It does not prevent kinks in the hose. Also, you have to buy a o-ring to prevent it from leeking at the water source. I'm only giving it two stars because it does keep the hose contained which was my main objective. This is the kind of product I suggest buying at a store so you can see it's size first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart track garden hose systems!","review":"Easy to use.

I've used it very little (probably less than 8 times) before it failed. Save your money and buy something that is a better design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best around for the price","review":"Amazons price of 48 dollars for this hose reel is the best I have found, and includes front door delivery. I wanted an enclosed hose reel since the sun can destroy a good hose in a year or two. This keeps the yard and garden neat and protects the hose. This is the second one I have purchased, the first a slightly larger model. This model doesn't have any means of securing it to the ground, so when it is empty, it jumps around a little bit while reeling the hose in until you reel a little weight in it. I solved the problem by placing a few large rocks around the base of the unit, which makes it blend in better too. I only wish that someone made a metal unit, but I have never found one.Some previous reviewers may have made the mistake of leaving the water turned on and pressured when not in use. Expansion might make the connections pull apart, but I have not had that problem since I turn the pressure off at the house valve when not in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 3 months then hinges broke inside","review":"It was a good for about a month then the hose dessert starting getting stuck...

I recently bought a house and the prior homeowner left behind Suncast Hose Reel box.The first use, I turned on the water, nothing happened...so I leaned up close to 'inspect' at the exact moment the side hose disengaged and shot water in my face, soaked my hair and clothes, the deck and anything within a 8-10' range. Sad thing here is that I thought it must have been an operator error and the plastic coupling had not been pushed in all the way...so I tried again. I sloshed back to the hose. I'm rethinking the 'gift' from the prior homeowner.Thanks to L.C. for the Water Wiggle memory...didn't it have an upside-down yellow cup with a face?"},{"rating":"2","title":"garden hose rewind","review":"This product worked extremely well.

When winding up the hose, it often gets \\"snagged\\" in the mechanism on the outside of the spool inside the box. Just spent 20 minutes trying to unwind a hose that got caught there. Also, this really isn't very sturdy. You need to stabilize it in some way in order to wind up in the first place...the light plastic just isn't strong enough to wind up a rubber hose on it's own. Good idea. Terrible execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like a hose reel....","review":"I have had two of these now. They last about a year or two, then break.

For those of you who really like mystery and suspense, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! The writing is terrible and if you really like mystery and suspense, these are not the authors for you. Although I should qualify that and state that after the first two stories, I did not read the last two because I was sure they were probably the same style as the first two. The stories have no real plot other than \\"tired and bored city girl meets hunk and has sex with him.\\" In fact the first two stories are so short on plot, suspense and writing ability that you could swear they were written by the same hand. Even the author's beloved sex scenes are poorly done and sound like the ramblings of an adolescent.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. It is awful!

It would be redundant to go track by track, since like Creedence Clearwater in the same time frame, they were Single Machines who also put out great albums as well.If you want just the best for a good price, this is it.

Just before Brent died things were getting bad on tour. And after Brent died, there is not one Dead show that it worth viewing or listening too.

They have SO many hours and hours of Great footage and music. Why they chose this is beyond me. If you are a true die hard Dead Head, don't bother buying this one. All around... just bad.

Five hours later, I'm still having them constantly and have been drooling a lot! I read online that flouride rinses help with the pain, so have tried that.

They are not a band rehashing the same old new wave influences. They are a hard rock trio with male/female vocals. They are more inspired by the hard rock of the 1970s. It's sexy music. It makes no apologies. \\"Fashion\\" is almost as hard rocking as Cream. Earl Greyhound would at the end of the day seem like another good time band like Young Heart Attack.

To think this man started to believe his own lies, and after treating the women in this book so gentlemanly as his mother had taught him; to then turn around and so nonchalantly do what he did to them with no care in the world is frightening.

The conversations were merely segways to get to more loving. Even when Bridge realized he loved her and Fallon wanted him back-she didnt try to talk to him, there was no push or pull. Instead the writer has them have kinky sex.Extremely disturbing. I wish I would have loaned it from the library first before buying. Do NOT recommend reading if you want an actual love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Very Strong Read!","review":"This book had great potential but I feel that it fell a little short. This may be due to the fact that this book only totals 192 pages and most of these are filled with sexual activity. I have no problem with erotic stories but I do like to have a \\"storyline\\" between the two characters that are supposed to be \\"finding\\" love.Bridge and Fallon have great potential but the storyline is very thin and not well fleshed out so their romantic encounters although HOT left we at times feeling rather cold. If there was any emotional growth between the two I missed it.There are plenty of good erotic reads out there that offer not only steamy love scenes between the characters but storylines as well. If you are in the market for love scene after love scene with little emotional depth of storyline than this is the story for you. If on the other hand you need more than this look elsewhere.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad it's not accurate","review":"Two very big problems with this computer are accuracy and settings. My wheel circumfrance is 2038mm. Using that circumfrence setting, according to the instructions I compared the GT Computer to my GPS. The result....at exactly two miles by the GPS the GT indicated 3.38 miles. Of course the indicated speed was off (high) as well. I might have been able to eventually calibrate the computer using the GPS except for an even more frustrating problem. Whenever you attempt to reset the wheel circumfrance it automatically defaults to 2124. So you can never recheck the number you set to confirm that you set it correctly and if/when you do correctly calibrate the computer you must write down the number in case you ever need to reset. Also, all other settings (such as clock) go to default settings. So you must reset everything anytime you change any setting. However, the clock is accurate!

I got a wenger later on and it worked PERFECTLY. so much better it was absurd. If you want a great reccomendation, go with a solid steel gerber knife. I got a gerber Winchester knife and it lasted me for three years. it was like 8 bucks i got at walmart. a victorinox costs like at least 20 and lasts 1 day??? i think not. like i said... go with a solid steel real folding knife, NOT SWISS, and make sure that it has a steel handle.

I bought it to replace one that I lost to TSA last week (that was an Explorer) and I couldn't be happier. It's a little bulkier than the Explorer but it has a bunch of additional tools that might actually be useful, and since I generally carry a roomy purse, the slight difference in width isn't an issue at all. I've attached my key ring to it and I'm prepared for just about anything. I don't know that I'll ever need the pen but it's nice to have just in case. I KNOW that I'll never use the fish scaler, lol, but the little ruler markings on the side of it will probably come in handy here and there. Maybe it's the Girl Scout in me; even though I haven't been a scout in about 45 years (and haven't been camping in maybe 30 years) I still like to be prepared. I just have to remember to put it in my checked bag next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swiss Army Knife","review":"The knife was exactly as described, shipping was fast, and I thought the price was very fair. I would certainly by from this seller again with confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality is superb!","review":"I've been carrying a Swiss Army knife for over fifty years. I just rec'd this one today and couldn't be more pleased. Seems like everything else I buy these days is increasingly bad quality wise (think made in China junk here.) It is so refreshing to buy a product that actually seems higher in quality than ever before. Fit and finish and functionality is absolutely superb. Is it an incredibly useful, sturdy tool or a finely crafted piece of jewelry? Happily, I can say its both. Well done, Victoronix!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Champion Plus Swiss Army Knife","review":"I suppose the best thing I can say about this knife is that I find myself using it all of the time. I didn't realize at the time that Victorinox makes many other versions of this knife. Some have locking blades and some have less or more features. I use the saw blade a lot for trimming branches along hiking trails and to my surprise it has never bent out of shape from becoming wedged like all my other saw blades. It also cuts through very easily. I'm not a knife expert but this knife exceeded my expectations. It's a handy little knife to have around."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I have several knives, some which I can't locate. I always know where this one is because it's one of my favorites. With the exception of pliers, this knife does all that I generally need and it is comfortable in the hand. Although the little pen isn't very easy to use, I like to know that it's there if needed. The hook has come in very handy for grocery bags that tend to dig into the hand. I try to oil the blades regularly to keep them moving with ease and I also sharpen the blades but don't over-sharpen them. I have had to return Swiss Army knives in the past for replacement from the very reliable company, but this one is holding up just fine. Although it contains more tools than others, it isn't really much larger and doesn't weigh a ton. I'll eventually get a case for this. Made great gifts, too, when Amazon offered them at incredible prices!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife!","review":"Only reason I cannot give it five stars is that it is missing the pliers from the SwissChamp, but then this isn't the highest end knife and the price is right. Get one of these and it will last you your entire life (until you lose the tweezers and the scissors get dull)."},{"rating":"2","title":"As reliable as physical objects get...","review":"Price was fantastic, packaging is very nice, the amount of tools packed into the tiny space is amazing, and even more amazing is the utility, ability, and reliability of every one of the tools, particularly the knives and the scissors. The pen and toothpick are nice and useful touches. I would be perfectly willing to pay $100+ for this, and the fact that it's so much lower than that makes it really worthwhile. The BEST backpack accessory you'll ever have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product & Service","review":"I bought this when it only cost $27 and it was an absolute steal. This is the perfect Swiss army knife, not too bulky and fits in the jeans pocket easily. It has the right number of tools for every purpose, from packing, camping to emergency cooking. Personally, I think that the SwissTool is more useful (but more expensive) due to the pliers, but if you like the traditional Swiss Army Knife, then this is the best one to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just under a 5 star rating...","review":"The only reason I'm giving this four stars is because its missing a plier attachment.

Dad, suprisingly, said no. My Mother, much to my luck and suprise, wanted one since she was 4 1/2 (go figure). She bought two of these quality knives online. The bad part about them (4 stars reason) was that with regular order, it took about a week for them to arrive. And that's the bad news over. The good news is that this knife is good for just about everything. It is sturdy, very handy in a tight spot, and can help you solve just about everything. True stry: I'm in class about to take a test and my pencil isn't sharpened. This knife is in my pocket. It takes about 5 seconds under my desk for the pencil to be perfectly sharpened =).

No problem. My friend and I were at the beach the other day and he got this small annoying splinter in his finger. He kept complaining about it for hours and hours. I totally forgot about the knife I had in the car, but when we got to it, I pulled out the tweezers it had and took out the splinter in a matter of seconds. Never thought I would use that tool but I did.I also really like the small glasses screwdriver it came with. I was always too lazy to go out to get when I needed one, but luckily, the knife came with a small durable one.

I can't see living without this tool. I feel secure just by having it in my purse knowing I can help myself through challenging situations. I can cut wires and rope with ease.

The album starts very strong with Garbage's rendition of \\"Kick My Ass\\". \\"Gravity Of The Situation\\" is country-ish, but actually sounds very good (I'm not a country fan). \\"When I Ran Off & Left Her\\" is probably the best song on the album, and should also stand as one of Soul Asylum's best efforts, recalling the solid middle chunk of \\"Grave Dancers Union\\". \\"Supernatural\\" is not up to Live's usual standards but is nonetheless a good listen. \\"Withering\\", performed by Cracker, and the Indigo Girls on \\"Free of Hope\\" are also very good. The only disappointment is \\"Sad Peter Pan\\". Who knows what happened on that one? I like Smashing Pumpkins and I like most of Vic's songs featured on this album, but that one doesn't work.

You can't help but love his songs!!","review":"I am not into country as I listen to more rock than anything but I do know excellant talent and Wade Hayes has IT! He also knows where credit is due!! This CD is one of his best but check out his other CD's as well he just cannot do a bad song on any of them. Just listen to the song on his CD HIghway & Heartaches \\"When The Wrong One Loves You Right\\" and will hear of how Wade Hayes is in the same league as Elvis. What a mix and every song is unique in its own right just as Wade Hayes sounds like he is, as he sounds like as such a nice person.I just wish I was as lucky as others to have met him to thank him for such touching music not to mention some very upbeat get you going cheerful catchy songs he has written that.Warm wishes, Jolene Flemming"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a new English translation","review":"A number of the reviewers here note that a new English translation of Cosmos would be most welcome. That translation is here and has been nominated (2006) for the National Translation Award given by the American Literary Translators Association. Danuta Borchardt, who translated Gombrowicz' Ferdydurke, has now translated Cosmos. Perhaps the novel's enthusiasts will find Borchardt's translation rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mediocre translation of an excellent novel","review":"A fascinating book. The narrator's peculiar neurosis and the tragic real world around him to which he is so tenuously attached are remarkably described. The grim humor of the night \\"pilgrimage\\" is also excellent. Perhaps Gombrowicz learned about this kind of comedy from its master, the Cuban writer Virgilio Piñera, who was a collaborator in the Buenos Aires translation of Ferdydurke.That being said, however, I'm glad there is new translation straight from the original Polish, as this translation presents some problems. I didn't notice the cutting up of Gombrowicz's rambling sentences as described in the review above, as I don't speak Polish. However, certain word choices made by the translator are mystifying. The word \\"berg\\", for example. Some kind of note explaining what the hell this means would be helpful. The meaning of Leo's statement that he saw \\"sucking\\" at that spot out in the forest is similarly unclear to this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China","review":"If you do not want to put a part that is made in China into the most delicate part of your car, its transmission, do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry, Please get back to the good stuff!","review":"As a devoted Harry Fan, I bought this the day it was released and could not even listen to all of it.

I thought something new from this prolific composer-performer would be nice, since I've heard the When Harry Met Sally... soundtrack a million times. I let him listen to it alone first, to get the full impact and to be able to analyze every move made. When I asked what he thought, he said, \\"Eh...\\" Eh. Okay, so I had to listen to it. My reaction? \\"Eh...\\" It's theoretically and technically strong, as can always be expected. There are interesting chord progressions and the musicians are phenominal. But it's not Harry as you expect him, and I guess I'm hooked on When Harry...

We have seen problems ranging from skin burns to liver damage. Public alerts have been made regarding this dangerous essential oil therapy by NAHA (The National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy) as far back as 1996. Please use extreme caution if you do decide to try the therapies, or even better, read Ms. Austin's rantings on how there is so much obesity in the world today because the people who were killed in Auschwitz have reincarnated, and are overeating because they were starved in another life.

But once and awhile you come across one that adds unexpected depth and uniqueness. Reinterpretations brilliantly evidences that fact with not just one, but twelve remixed songs of Kitaro - the legendary Grammy Award winning composer and musician. With modern electronic beats and timeless instrumentality, Reinterpretations somehow transports you to a world you've been in before and yet also one you dream of escaping to. The album's hypnotic melodies and rhythms possess that unique ability to soothe your soul as well as provoke you to dance. Some of the tracks are woven with an eastern sound that make you feel like you're at a surreal rave during ancient times. The best CDs make you forget that you're even listening to one. Reinterpretations does just that by being a harmonious expression of the human spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea - poor execution","review":"I first heard about this CD from a review in the local paper. It mentioned dance beats to Kitaro's songs. I thought to myself..what a great idea. Instead, I was very upset to have wasted my money on this. The dance beats are NOT HOUSE or TRANCE (which would have been a better idea for a CD), but rather Jazzy (Fusion?). Of the songs that Kitaro has...they picked some lames ones to use for this album. There are 12 songs on this CD and not one of them is worth ever listening to again. I have been a Kitaro fan for YEARS...and NOTHING really good has been part of the DOMO label for Kitaro. I keep hoping to hear his melodic sounds and his soft high pitched keyboard that he uses in the earlier works...what happened to that? I wish Kitaro would compose songs like he used to.

The book is filled with an abundance of facts, dates, and sources and will be a wonderful selection if you enjoyed your college history textbook. This is a book to learn facts from, not to enjoy an emotionally jarring narrative. If you are looking for a truely enjoyable narrative of Native American life that is historically accurate yet fills in the unknown blanks with reputable intuitiveness, I suggest James Alexander Thom's Panther in the Sky. Trail of Tears would make an excellent source for research."},{"rating":"1","title":"A much better version . . .","review":"If you want to read a much more unbiased and factually correct version of this story, please readCherokee Tragedy : The Ridge Family and the Decimation of a People (Civilization of the American Indian Series, Vol 169) by Thurman Wilkins.The tragedy of the Trail of Tears was that all the Cherokee leaders were trying to do what they thought was best for the tribe. It was, obviously, a no win situation. Ehle is much to skewed to one side over the other and this bias makes this book unfortunate. I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trail of Tears","review":"I didn't like the book because it was boring and went into too much detail on rituals of the Cherokee Nation. I would not recommend it to anyone to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price for a great book","review":"Book was in pretty good shape, very nice price. I would buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-done and a must read for anyone interested in the early history of this Republic","review":"Ehle has written a well-done history of the Cherokee and the early history of our Republic. He is thorough and has an engaging style, telling the story from third- to first-person perspectives. It is an odd style, but it works. Ehle has, I think correctly, portrayed Major Ridge as being the key figure in the early 19th century Cherokee world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woefully inomplete and biased","review":"The \\"Rise\\" of the Cherokee nation is nowhere to be found in this book. In fact the \\"Fall\\" is well underway before chapter one, and continues to this day with the publication of tripe like this.Any fair depiction of a clash of cultures needs to see each culture in it's context. Ehle doesn't seem to attempt this. His descriptions of Cherokee and settler life make no attempt to relate to their specific histories, but merely poke at them with a judgemental 20th century stick.Two stars are simply because he has thrown out many names that anyone with a serious interest in the subject can use as tools for research."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most accessible book on the subject","review":"I've read every book on the Trail of Tears, and this one is the absolute best introduction and overview. Most books on the subject romanticize the travails of the Cherokee (thus perpetrating the \\"noble savage\\" iconography of the 19th century), or gloss over the non PC parts (such as Cherokee slaveholding) but Ehle is not afraid to offer an insightful and comphrehensive overview of the early 19th century Cherokee Nation.This book is written in an extremely accessible style: more like a novel than an academic history, and thus can be enjoyed by just about anyone. It offers valuable information about the political turmoil, in the US and in the Cherokee Nation, that surrounded removal."},{"rating":"1","title":"full moon is full of filler songs","review":"with any rodney jerkins based album youre going to have repeats --- songs that sound like others and with this album theres no difference in the pattern lisntening to this cd i thought i was listening to the lead off single with each new track that came on. . . i was dismayed to find that what about us is #9 . . . there are many low points but rather than criticize brandy and hurt her or sonya's feelings ill say the highpoint is track # 3 brandy really actually shows that she can sing --- even though shes under the weight of all those sound effects --- on a personal note i am glad to see that she has taken such a positive direction in her adult years and is to be commended to being a vegan being married and getting a new stylist --- i can sum this album up in a simple sentence. i like brandy which is why i have the album . . . the ONLY reason"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Moon","review":"I remember this album when I was in the 9th grade. I fell in love with the entire CD. I was anticipating for this album. \\"Full Moon\\" is both a declaration of independence and a full-circle revelation of a woman who once emerged a full-fledged star but is now ready to be recognized as a spiritually and emotionally developed woman. The entire album soars mostly because she wanted it that way. Full Moon is her most personal album to date,a statement CD from a young diva who is always on the rise, never content to rest on her past successes,even though,she reveals,she was not always sure of herself when it came to recording music. Brandy has already made her most heartfelt and mature work to date(in 2002). This album has been certified Platinum.

Other artists, no offense, can't sing but instead have great managers who can make them famous. The first song on the album (after the intro), \\"Full Moon\\" sets the pace off for the rest of the album with hot beats and killer vocals that are inviting enough to make you wanna get up... and dance! Interestingly enough to include in my review, each song has a different transition from one to another, much like interludes... but, not. The singles \\"What About Us\\" and \\"Full Moon\\" are should be enough to make you decide to purchase this album. But there is more to this album than just these songs.

But on others, like \\"Anybody\\" she sings \\"I don't want anybody to know what we do alone\\" and sings of other secretive matters. Lyrically, a standout track, but musically, it's not that great. In fact, besides \\"What About Us?\\" the bizarrely original track, and \\"Full Moon\\" the second of the singles released, not many of these songs are good musically. She's releasing anything worthy of a video that way, and the rest is filler.Is she trying to sound like all other black/bi-racial R&B singers, or did she create that flavor?

I have to say, as much as I want to like this album, I can't. The album is overproduced with garbled and mixed up songs in terms of production, thanks to Rodney Jerkins, who hasn't produced a good song since 1999. This leads many of the songs to sound the exact same. Take \\"I Thought\\", \\"What About Us\\", \\"All In Me\\" and many others and you have the exact same songs with different lyrics. There are too many songs, 17 songs and you feel bored at the end, especially since this album has no consistency whatsoever. It puts all the ballads with a few exceptions at the end of the disc, and during the middle you will feel lost with songs that sound like they are the exact same. Overall its very disapointing and if I had to pick one jewel in this crown, I would say the ballad \\"Come A Little Closer\\", which is a wonderful song. Overall be careful when purchasing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible comeback.","review":"Brandys third album is just absolutely TERRIBLE.Aaliyah's third album was much better, and i suggest you check out \\"Aaliyah\\" instead of \\"Full Moon\\".Do not waste your money on this album, you will definetly regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brandy cant sing.","review":"Save your ears..and dont buy this album, my ears have been permantly effected by Brandy's \\"Full Moon\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brandys career is over.","review":"Anything else Brandy releases will FLOP. \\"Full moon\\" ruined hercareer forever..(Thank God)."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO LONG IT\\"S HARD TO TELL","review":"This cd is ok. I think most of the reviews are overrating Brandy's FullMoon. It is not a MASTERPIECE by far. The music on this cd is too overbearing and it dosen't give Brandys Voice a chance to shine. This cd is also way too long. You will have to listen to this cd a many of times before you can decipher which song stands out the most. Most of the songs sound alike. There are a few songs that manage to stand out and they really rock. Those songs are HE IS. Listen to this song, it is very good and Brandys voice is so beautiful. This is my favorite and I will be listening to this song for a long time. The other song I enjoy is FULL MOON, it is a good party song. But Like I said this cd is too long. Maybe I will find some more favorites, but for now it's just them two. If you are a Brandy fan, buy this cd. This cd gets 4 stars because I can see the effort on her part.

I believe this was a good CD overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont Hate On a Very Good album!","review":"Brandy's Highly anticipated album \\"Full Moon\\" shows a maturity and growth that fans have been looking for since her previous album \\"Never say never\\". As for many of the reviews i have read about this album it has been negative. Brandy's new sound is great. Ya sure the ballads aint great(but they are good) Her more upbeat songs make this album Shine. Tracks like \\"i thought\\",\\"Can We\\",The hot single \\"What about us, and The innovative Two-step style of \\"All in me\\" are some of my favorites on the album.

I say she has really grown in to a grown woman. I think this album is more of a mark for her being an adult but its not her best, her best work I would have to say is Never Say Never the multi-platinum chart topper of 1998. She has come a far way from fighting over a man to know talking about her man needing her and her not needing him, but its all that comes with the role of being a super girl turning into a Super Woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"brandy fan","review":"I've always been a fan of Brandy's, not as big as Janet, but I love her just the same.

Please do yourself a favor and buy this awesome disc w/Aaliyah, you won't regret either purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Brandy's third album, \\"Full Moon\\" is, I think, her best work so far. The songs have a much more adult feel to them, and she stays away from the bubblegum sound that some of her songs in the past had. I think the best track on this CD is \\"I'd Die Without You,\\" a duet with her younger brother Ray-J.Stand-out tracks:\\"I'd Die Without You\\"\\"Full Moon\\"Brandy did a very good job with this album.

When i first got this album i listened to it in my car for 2 weeks straight! Her voice is so much richer and full of tone then on previous albums. \\"He is\\" is def. my favorite. Those of you expected another \\"i wanna be down\\" are down right foolish. Brandy is matured into a mother and a wife and no longer needs to talk about meeting boys at the mall and waiting for phone calls in her room. I think i've grown right with her we are around the same age, I think she has a wonderful carreer ahead of her for years to come. Any one who likes Brandy and is a true fan will love it.

It has a mixture of uptempo dance songs, midtempo songs and slow jams. The best uptempo dance songs are What About Us?, I Thought,Apart and I Wanna Fall In Love. The best midtempo songs are Like This and It's Not Worth It. The best slow jams are He Is,When You Touch Me,Nothing,Love Wouldn't Count Me Out and Die Without You with Ray-J.

Not good for kids aged under 12!","review":"I was really disappointed with this movie. I love horses and was really excited to watch it, because it was rated G and therefore, I thought, less scary than the book, which I love. Well, I was watching it with my little sis, age 6, an she 1)couldn't understand the dialogue- I couldn't!-you need to be good with British accents- and 2) didn't understand what was happening. She went to bed and I watched the rest, telling her I would re-watch the rest with her in the morning. I'm glad I saw it first! They show dead horses, and there is upsetting animal abuse in it. Beauty goes to war, where a bunch of guys get stabbed-what the heck- and they throw in a slobbery romance. They did not focus on the horse at all, it was not very well made, and the only reason I give it two stars is because the horse was pretty, and the little boy and his horse theme in the beginning was cute.Should be rated PG-12, if that existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This version is not for young children!","review":"After hearing so much about Black Beauty, and studying horses with my 5yr old we got this movie at the library.

After talking with some friends I have found out there are other versions of Black Beauty that are wonderful and good for children to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the book's fans","review":"It is a fair movie with nice horses, but some of the scenes get kind of weird and it isn't at ALL like the book.

It is terribly boring, the situations are unbelievable, and none of the characters are sympathetic. For most of the movie, I just kept hoping it would end. Try a different version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read it and threw it away","review":"I'm sorry, I bought this hoping to really learn something unique and innovative. I was severely disappointed. I hope after driving multiple companies into the ground that the author takes up a new line of work that doesn't involve his philosophy on business. If this book was truly about winning business battles then it would seem that the author has little success in real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and boring","review":"The cover of this album is really cool, but the music inside isn't as cool. I love early Echo & the Bunnymen, but they've been going downhill for the last 15 years. They were so unique and extraordinary in those early days. Today, a hundred bands could make product like the songs on this CD. If you like Echo & the Bunnymen for their first 3 or 4 albums, you may be disappointed by this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Forgive Me","review":"I was bored with this pretty quickly.I've been listening to Echo and the Bunnymen for 20 years and consider them, probably, one of my most important musical influences. I'm not sure that I'll be returning to this one anytime soon. It sounds to me like Will and Ian recorded this in two different worlds.Buy \\"Porcupines\\" instead.I am so very sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor lyrics.","review":"The music is great!

Unlike many on here, I actually liked their last effort, \\"What are you going to do...\\"This CD, however, is just so unremarkable. I only long for the \\"old\\" Echo insofar as I long for songs that, from the first time you heard them, would stick with you, get under your skin, demand that you play them again -- immediately.That's what made Ocean Rain great. Even (so called) filler like Kingdom just totally stuck with you. Subsequent albums, though often maligned, still had their fair share of grabbers.I have listened to \\"Flowers\\" three times and find myself trying to get into it. For the first time, my appreciation of the band is, well, forced.Tonight they play live -- perhaps the songs on Flowers need the conviction of an Echo and the Bunnymen live performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one song worth listening to more than once","review":"If you grew up listening to the Bunnymen, you will try hard to convince yourself that this is a decent album. It's not.The only song worth your time is \\"It's Alright.\\" Nice pace and catchy. The title track would get a rating of tolerable. The other songs you wouldn't remember if you listened to the album ten times and then listened to it again the next day. In other words, the other songs have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. They're not interesting in the least. Seems to me the Backstreet Boys have more soul.I, for one, am quite upset that I shelled out fifteen bucks for this tripe. This album is a good reason why Napster was so successful- people just don't like buying albums when only one song is worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunned","review":"I am stunned at how bad this album is. It's nothing but palty and, as another reviewer commented, dead boring. There was some hope after the \\"What are you going to do . . .\\" aluum but this new record only re-affirms how the Bunnymen utterly ....

Even Ian McCulloch's lyrics disappoint. I'll always listen to \\"Heaven Up Here,\\" \\"Ocean Rain\\" and the self-titled CD, but this is the last new release I intend to buy by Echo and the Bunnymen. It's just too painful listening to what once a great band descend into bland, middle-of-the-road pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite group","review":"Ive been listening to EABM for years-great cd-I now have them all.fast delivery thank you.Have a great New Year and I will look to this seller in the future.Az"},{"rating":"2","title":"3 1/2 stars really -- very solid tracks, if a bit retro","review":"I'm pleasantly surprised how well this CD stands up over repeated listens. The baritone singing blends well with the lively and sometimes impressive guitarwork. Its well recorded too. Its difficult though, not to notice that virtually all of these tracks are in the same vein of everything they have done before. On the one hand, other 80's bands should be jealous that Echo and the B can sound this good almost 3 decades later. But they still sound like a band from the 80's, allbeit an 80's band expertly using modern recording techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't get it any better !!!","review":"Echo & The Bunnymen made the greatest comeback. This album is full of pure Echo sound, beautiful and psychedelic. They hadn't made something that good since Ocean Rain.

As with his other works, the inaccuracies and errors make this book useless for any serious investigator. Absolutely unreliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformative and unreliable","review":"Joel Norris' book has been criticized as being dated; however much more important is the fact that his information is outright wrong. For example, he characterizes the Zodiac killer as a killer of children who earned his monicker because of the zodiac symbol he carved into the flesh of some of his victims. This is totally untrue. Norris' misinformation cannot be excused on the basis of historical perspective. It is my impression that the author had little interest in getting his facts straight and likely derived much of his information from flawed single sources, without any cross-referencing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Weak, Overall","review":"Basically, Norris describes various killers and their crimes, and then goes on to make broad \\"scientific\\" statements about the psychology and biology of serial killers, without much real evidence at all. If you buy into the theory that webbed fingers and large earlobes are good predictors of psychopathic behavior, maybe this book is for you. Otherwise look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"PsyD student","review":"I thought this book was a lesson in how to write \\"off the cuff\\" and not back it up with scietific data. There are no references to any research articles and his only expertise seems to be in his claim that he has interviewed a few serial killers. For example, where does he come up with his phases of serial killing? What validity is there to an aura phase, at which point the serial killers senses become heightened? This book is rubbish if you are interested in a scientific, rather than an imaginative, view of serial murder."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mind blowing look into the mind of a serial killer","review":"If you wanting answers into why serial killers kill, and or reapetedly, you need not to look any further. This book gives an insightful and explanitory look into the mind and body of the infamuos serial killer. I recomend this book to any that wants an answer to the question \\"Why\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Fun Movie","review":"I was surprised to find myself enjoying this sci-fi/action/thriller of a movie. The suspense kept me glued to the screen wondering what would happen before the predictable ending. If you're a tele-transport/time-travel film buff you'll enjoy this movie for its potential technological suggestions if nothing else.The acting was as acting is in these types of films. Sure, at times it seemed like a made for tv movie, but with a bit of imagination you'll feel as if you sat through a real feature film. If films are meant to entertain then this one did the trick. I give the time travel concept the award for best feature of the film. The bad guys were probably the best actors, or maybe had the best parts.In either case I don't think you could go wrong watching this movie on a night when your mood wants a bit of this and a bit of that. Warning: there is no sex, drugs or loud music in this film.Careful reading too much about this movie. Better to go in blind than to know too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"An average of 3 & 1/2 stars for a stinking movie like Termination Point?","review":"I don't expect a movie to destroy a real jumbo jet but the plane should NOT look like a toy on the screen either. It must be really hard for Jason Priestley and Lou Diamond Phillips to get acting jobs - to have to settle for this poor excuse for a movie. If I could, I'd give this movie a minus 5 stars!!

Only Stu get's any developmental attention. In short I spent more time looking at my watch waiting for my suffering to end than enjoying this movie. However Kris Katan is inspired as the dead guy brought back to life.

Even with some great stars in it, and some good animation - all the best parts were in the commercial for the movie. Leave this monkey in the zoo - unless you have to have Brandan in your collection.

I thought this might fit the bill, even though it was panned by the critics. Those critics, they have a stroke if the movie doesn't have some deep, hidden reference to post-Jungian etc. etc.Well, this time they were right.Strangely, the fantastical parts of this movie are the most tedious, suffering from slow pacing, although there are some interesting visuals.

However, the direction obviously got lost in the story telling. A cast that should have been able to work magic were given poor dialogue and even worse situation comedy.

What do you about a flick when the most interesting character is a corpse played by the normally noxious Chris Kattan?

If you are a Tim Burton fan, you will go nuts over this one, but keep in mind he had nothing to do with the project. I understand it didn't do well at the box office, but don't let that make you think that it's because it's a bad movie. That's just because Fox didn't want to advertise for their 80 million dollar feature(yeah, I'm still clueless on that one). I have a feeling this will develop a huge cult following once it's been on DVD/video long enough. I just hope it's in THX with some nice behind the scenes features.

And it actually sounds like a pretty interesting storyline, don't believe it. The saving grace of this movie was the performance by Chris Kattan.

The ensuing adventure, in which she meets a boy, finds a castle-like building (I remember having to look up the word 'corrider' as a youngster), was a magical trip through the imagination that has helped fuel my passion for reading books to this day.

Though the criminal mastermind had died in 1933's \\"The Testament of Dr. Mabuse,\\" Lang developed a spiritual heir who would continue the Mabuse tradition. \\"1,000 Eyes\\" is a throwback to Lang's early German thrillers with a modernist style - depicting a world in which nothing is what it seems.

I'd been using cassette adapters to listen to Audible from my PocketPC in my car stereo. The cassette adapters wouldn't stay in the tape deck of my car stereo, so I bought this.For the first month, the irock worked flawlessly. After a while, I noticed that I'd only get the right stereo channel. Since I'm sitting to the left (being the car's driver), I needed to turn it up a bit to compensate. I was willing to live with this...After a while longer, the irock would cut out altogether. The red LED would come on, but the radio station at the chosen frequency would still come through.I haven't abused my irock. It sits on my car seat at all times. This is a bummer because I really like listening to Stephen King on the 45 minute drive part of my commute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work in NYC","review":"I've tested this thing in the NYC area.

Unfortunately, THE IROCK DOESN'T WORK WELL.In the gym: I *physically put the irock on top of the radio's antenna* and the music is still garbled and full of static. It seems like for it to work, there has to be *no* other transmission on the frequency you select (and the irock only offers 4 frequencies). I'm in Boston - if you're somewhere without radio stations, maybe you'll be in luck.In the car: Most cars have their antenna integrated into the rear windshield. The irock comes with a power adapter for the cigarette lighter. Which is nice. But it doesn't let it reach to the back window!

The electronic noise produced by the XM SkyFi makes the signal from the irock unit too poor for listening. I also tried the irock with my MP3 CD player with better results.

I would never recommend it or purchase it again. I ended up throwing it away. Why? The sound quality is weak and terrible. What's the point of listening to music, only to make it sound like it's coming out of an AM transistor radio? Plus, it was clumsy and bulky, and the cig lighter adapter made it even more so.I ending up buying an AUX adapter for my car's stereo, and I plug my MP3 player into that. The sound is INFINITELY better, and there's no batteries to run out, or cig lighter adapters to mess with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just got one; Works fine","review":"I just bought the 400FM yesterday.

Perhaps I'm lucky, with a good radio in the car (it's a stock unit in my Dodge Neon; nothin' fancy) but I feel this is easier than the cassette adapter I had for one day before I returned it, because it required two connections from the CD to the dash (one for the power, one for the adapter) and I couldn't move without getting tangled in wires.

It works as advertised and generally would be a reasonable buy.I travel a lot and I used to carry this device with me to different cities in my laptop bag. The design is not well thought out and does not allow for shielding of the On/Off button. As a result, the device can be inadvertantly switched on while in the bag. This is a significant problem for battery usage.I also think that the workmanship leaves a little to be desired.I have used the device for a little less than six months before the linking cable developed a small break in the wire. This left me with the alternative to throwing it out and buying another or spending the time to replace the cable.On the whole, I was not impressed. This is a frist generation device. As these devices become more pervasive their quality, design and variety will improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"Picked this up on sale at Radio Shack over the weekend and was very disappointed at the quality, so I ended up returning it. First of all, the sound quality is TERRIBLE, much worse than your typical FM reception. Second, it didn't work consistently for me, and I was too lazy to try to figure out why -- this kind of thing is supposed to work out of the box. The build quality also seemed quite flimsy so even if it worked for you, it would probably break after a few weeks.

I had a hard time finding a balance between how high the volume should be on the receiving stereo, and how high the volume should be on my iPod. If I run the iPod right into a stereo with a component cable, it sounds great. Going through the irock however, just sounded hollow. and that was with the irock sitting right next to the antenna. Take it a few feet away, and forget about it. You could hear audible static on all frequencies.Basically, it came across more like a distant AM station at best.

First, it has a very limited amount of selectivity for the FM station. Second, my unit has a problem with picking up engine noise through the cigarette lighter. This manifests as a loud whirring sound when the engine is running. This sound is absent if the engine is turned off, or if you are running off the internal battery. This second problem is not present on both of my cars, which leads me to suspect that some vehicles have filters in place to prevent the problem. Battery life is nowhere near the nine hours I have seen advertised. Finally, the signal sometimes \\"drifts\\". I think that this is because of the mechanical tuner.I recommend this unit for in-home use.

I use it to play MP3s on my iPaq. The option to use either the AAA batteries or the lighter adapter is a great touch.The only thing holding back the last star is I'd like to have seen an 'auto-off' feature to conserve the batteries.

Finally, I thought, I can use my XM radio and iPod in my truck. And for only $25? Turns out, though, that it's too good to be true. While I can now use both XM and iPod in the truck, the sound quality is so bad that it's not worth the hassle of setting everything up. To be fair, I live in a major city with FM stations at 88.3 and 88.9, which pretty well obstructs the useful range of the iRock. I'd say the sound quality is on par with AM radio at best.

No doubt it has to be Fran Liebowitz who takes the prize, but that is in no small measure thanks to Martin Scorsese who has managed to present his subject in a most natural environment, where you feel as though you are present in the proceedings, and the director (although you see the back of his head) seems invisible.Such is the extraordinary force of her personality and humour, that there is never a dull moment. That in fact is quite some compliment since I have never actually heard of Fran Liebowitz before (unfortunately). I shan't attempt to describe the contents of this extended interview, since those who already know Fran Liebowitz need no introduction, and those who don't - well you don't know what you're missing (unless you don't happen to like the New York \\"take\\" on life).I thank Mr. Scorsese for helping me make up for lost time, and if ever he should think of a sequel, count me in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For silk painters at all levels","review":"This book delivers what it promises:* Classic techniques of silk painting, with creative projects to do at home.* Comprehensive technical instructions, including everything you need to know about materials and equipment.* Features exquisite silk painting creations by leading contemporary artists.* 25 original and easy-to-achieve projects presented step-by-step.* 0ver 300 specially commissioned color photographs.This is a GREAT Silk Painting Craft Workshop Book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Phone","review":"The i530 flip phone comes equipped with today's technological demands including speakerphone, One Touch Direct Connect, Downloadable ring tones, and enable GPS functions.

The phone doesn't hold a charge, and will hardly charge up even after buying ~5 different chargers and several batteries. The phone barely works in my apartment (and only right next to the window with the window open), and not at all where I work or attend classes. I have heard countless complaints from people who have tried to call me and they receive a message the phone is not in service and/or the service has been discontinued.

Now I am having problems with another two of my phones with no reception and battery not charging. I keep spending the $35 charge for swapping them. And nextel customer service is a joke.

I barely got a story and no laughs. The plot was contrived with some characters only serving a purpose to move the story along. As a character, Katya had no redeeming qualities. When good things kept happening to her, I kept routing for opposite to occur. The only reason I finished was because I held out some hope that Katya might evolve as character. Sadly, Katya was as self-centered at the end of the book as she was in the beginning. All of the other characters in the book were one dimensional....this book might be good as Lifetime movie on a rainy day and you are too lazy to go to the video store for a better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confession...","review":"Normally I thoroughly enjoy British humor and I buy loads of books. This book was almost painful to read.There is no character development and each diary entry is more shallow than the one before it. I had to reread and reread pages over and over.

I just could not get into it. I put it down after two chapters and gave it to the goodwill.

I had to force myself to sit down and finish it. Although Katya's thoughts and actions did make me laugh out loud a few times, I had a hard time caring about what happened to her. This may be why I found myself reading the same page over and over, and still my mind wandered."},{"rating":"1","title":"We have been had!","review":"This is supposed to be a diary of a journalist? Why so many errors in grammar (which takes in punctuation as well as syntax)?

The difference is that Fielding is a quick, clever writer who creates characters that truly draw you in. This is NOT the case with Lang's Katya Livingston. She is not a heroine for whom you can cheer; yet Lang does not make her compelling enough to be the sort of character you \\"love to hate\\". Instead, Katya is cartoonish, flat, and, quite honestly, boring.If you are looking for a fun little read ala Bridget Jones, be advised that \\"Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber: The Katya Livingston Chronicles\\" is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"This book to me was so irritating. The diary format was okay but I prefer chapter style. The character was so over the top I couldn't wait to finish this book just to be done with it.

This book to me was just...irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, weak, weak.","review":"Worst book I've read in a long time.I had high hopes for this book: thought it'd be like \\"Absolutely Fabulous\\" in book form. I mention it just so you'll know that I have no problem with unpleasant protagonists or British humor. I liked \\"Bridget Jones\\", too.I had to force myself through this. The tone is one of shrill forced hilarity throughout, like sitting next to a table of obnoxious drunks when you're stone-cold sober. It's positively embarassing to witness an author straining so mightily to be clever, and failing so completely. Every line turns somersaults trying to be all zany and outrageous -- but they just fall flat.Barely even a smirk, let alone a belly laugh. Don't waste your time. Read Joe Keenan's \\"Blue Heaven\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blend on \\"low\\", three minutes...","review":"This book reads as though some halfwit editor put pages from previous chick lit bestsellers in a blender, pressed \\"frappe\\" and published the results.Actually, that's not quite right. What it really reads as is a far less charming knockoff of the Shopaholic series. I think someone needs a copyright attorney, stat.I got less than halfway through before I realized the book had no plot, was filled with unpleasant or uninteresting characters, and was a big fat waste of my waning summer vacation. I desperately encourage you to read something else.

However, the further one reads the clearer it becomes that the same 3 jokes are being repeated over and over and over again. She drinks...A lot! She worries about not having sex...a lot! She abuses and takes advantage of everyone around her.... a lot! What I had hoped would be a quick and fun read quickly turns to tedium. I would suggest buying this book for a flight that is going to take several hours ...but once you're done with the flight you should know that there is no point in reading any further..you've gotten some laughs and really have covered every aspect of the character that you're going to learn..even if you do sludge through the rest of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katya is insane","review":"Katya Livingston is hilarious to say the least.

I'm so disappointed!","review":"After being endorsed by Cosmo, I told my book club that we HAD to read this book. To make a long story short, they swear they will NEVER let me pick another one!Katya Livingston is the most conceited, dull, and flat character I have ever had the displeasure of reading. I truly struggled to get through the first few chapters of the book hoping it would get better, yet it simply did not. For me, a good book is centered around a strong main character, and there is nothing about Katya that is even remotely likable.To be honest, I put this book back on my shelf unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! Worst book I've read this year!","review":"If I could give it zero stars I would. Hated it!Normally I thoroughly enjoy British humor and I buy loads of books when I'm over there - but this pathetic rag....

I'm now setting my sights on something more enjoyable...the Today show's pick 'The Emperor of Ocean Park.'Folks - trust me, save your money and your time on this one unless of course, you enjoy reading about an unlikeable person whom you couldn't care less how they fare through life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This is quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read.

Without morals or a sense of guilt she wreaks havoc on every person she encounters. With friends like her, who needs enemies? I kept hoping something would happen to cause her to \\"see the light\\" and change her ways, but alas, it never did. Still I kept reading with the hopes that Katya would develop some scruples.

The idea for the story isn't original, since every other book I've seen these days is about a British 20-something keeping a diary, but I bought the book because it sounded like it took an old idea to a new level.I was wrong, [the cost] wrong.Katya isn't a likable character. She isn't even the type of character we love to hate. She is self-centered, obnoxious, untalented, and thinks WAY TOO MUCH of herself -- and those are her ENDEARING traits.I can't even summarize the plot because there wasn't one. Katya just complained and moaned and was generally [uncool] for about 200 pages. I have never been so glad to see a book end.Don't buy this book in hardback. Don't buy it in paperback.

I love books, all types of books, and like different writing styles. I hated this book the entire way through. I kept reading thinking it would get better but it didn't. I love characters with a dry sense of humor and love sarcasm, but this book just didn't have either despite trying desperately to try to have the character come off that way. The character was unlikable and the writing was, well, boring. I regret spending my money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only there was a ZERO star!","review":"This may be one of the worst books I have read in years. I don't expect much from chick-lit -- it's a good way to pass an afternoon with no drain on the brain. This book was just insultingly stupid. Why the author (let alone the publisher) thought this drivel was worth killing trees is beyond me. If you want to read the boring diary of a self-centered egotistical whiner, this may be the book for you, everyone else take a pass!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Check it out at the library","review":"Honestly, this book isn't worth buying, but if you feel that you must read it, support your local library and get it there.I loved the idea of the book and was hooked from the back cover description, but tired of it after about page four.The character, as she is supposed to be, is a narcisstic bitch, and stays true to form through the entire book. That seems to be the reason why it's so dull. There is no character growth, no change throughout, nor even an interesting story line to the book.The reviews on the book claimed it to be \\"a quick afternoon read\\" but it took me nearly 3 weeks to force myself through. I kept putting it down for more interesting books before I finally just made myself finish it.I wanted to love it, but I just couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was awful....","review":"Everypage was about the same thing.

Don't waste your money on this bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it -5 if I could figure out how.","review":"Save your money!! This book isn't the least bit funny. I bought it because Kelly Ripa said it was hilarious. Thinking it would get funny at some point - I plowed all the way through. It is a good concept - the musings of a woman who couldn't care less what people thought about her and would be willing to climb on the backs of the people she stabbed in the back. After all how else would one climb the social ladder???!!! Turns out that I couldn't care less about this woman's whining and lack of ability to hold down a job. The concept really could have been funny. It sounded like a career girl's version of THE BROKE DIARIES but bears no resemblance. Save your money. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time!!","review":"I hated this book. If I could have given it no stars I would have. I think I deserve some kind of consolation prize just for getting through it. There was no plot.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"So not worth it","review":"It wasn't like I was expecting anything deep when I bought this book, but I hoped for some more substance than this offered. I guess a plot would have been good. This book gets SO irritating after a while, the character never changes, and is completely unlikeable and annoying. One of the things that's supposed to be funny about this book is Katya's complete lack of a conscience, but it got really old after a few pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"I enjoyed Bridget Jones' Diary and thought this would be fun. It wasn't. I kept reading thinking it would get better. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a top 10 pick!","review":"This book is an imitation of Bridget Jones' Diary - but not nearly as good.

Please - no sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I Got This Used...","review":"....because I'd be pretty upset if I had paid full-price for this drivel. I like a fluffy Brit-chick book as well as anyone, but this is clearly the work of someone who had a friend in the publishing business. While the character is certainly biting and at times humorous in her self-centeredness, the story goes nowhere. There is no learning or change in the character, no progression in relationships, and very little satisfaction when the book is done, except that it is DONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I LOVED this book!

I've read many books on Soul discovery, while I enjoy the information about the soul's reincarnation and how we are all somewhat connected. I was disappointed that in giving information about the natal chart it did not cover the planets Venus,Uranus, Jupiter and Moon. Through other outlets I found out that I have Venus in Taurus,Uranus in Libra, Moon and Jupiter in Scorpio; with list of attributes that correspond with them. I would have love some additional information about those from the book. It only covers Neptune, Mercury, Mars, Saturn and Pluto.

Perhaps Maurice Joshua.

I think the Pet Shop Boys mix is probably the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not feeling it","review":"I usually buy Madonna's maxi singles without hearing them simply because there's bound to be at least a few remixes I end up liking. But this, to me, is just a poor choice for a single to begin with, and the remixes I have heard....what can I say...I'm just not feeling this one. The PSB mix is flat and thin, sucking what little energy the orignal had right out it. And the Oakenfold mix is just so obviously his - I knew it after about 20 seconds when I heard it on the radio. His remixes have an unmistakable sound, much like Junior Vasquez mixes, and often use what sounds like the same rhythm tracks and drum fills. The bottom line - remixes should make me want to go straight to the dancefloor, and these just make me want to head to the bar. AVOID."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Unless you REALLY like the song and are an avid Madonna collector, pass on the single for Sorry. The original is great, but it's already on the album, so track 1 is almost worthless. Track 2 and 3 are good, but it goes downhill from there. Track 6 is horrible. I'm listening to it now, and its not a dance mix.If you want a good single, turn to Hung Up. And if you can find an inexpensive copy of Sorry, give it a try, but don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vicki, Mom","review":"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas - worked all of ten minutes!

Nor are the also pagan notions of immortal soul, going to heaven (when you don't die), and a triune Godhead.Those who observe this unbiblical package of paganism do not practice the religion instructed in the Bible, nor do they represent the one and only religion of the Creator God, contained in it.I believe anyone writting about the religion of the Bible should first read it, then if they believe contrary to it, disclose that and admit to a theology that has its origins elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent true crime, riveting story of murder and denial","review":"I would not put this book in the category of \\"In Cold Blood\\" and \\"The Executioner's Song,\\" if it didn't belong there. As a true crime fan, I can truthfully say this is one of those rare books that after you've finished, you vow to read again on a regular basis. Instead of a sensational account of lurid details, this book peels back the layers of unsuspecting communities, agonized families and struggling police departments. The book concerns a serial killer in Northern California, whose murders shock a small, wealthy community to its foundations. Along the way, his crimes become entangled in the politics of the missing children's movement of the 1980's, and lead to a breathtaking account of police undercover work that is equally audacious and brilliant. If you are fascinated by true crime, I promise that you will not be disappointed with this excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"I did not expect this to be such a great book, and only picked it up as I am familiar with the SF Bay Area. What a surprise! I am a true-crime book afficiondo, and this is one of the best books I've ever read. It takes the reader through each event in an easy-to-follow format, and it was difficult for me to put this book down. A very sad story, very touching, brought tears to my eyes at the end. Presents both the police standpoint and victim/parent standpoint in a compelling manner, making me have so much sympathy for the victim/parents' frustration, yet believing the police did all that they could at the time. A must read book--I found it at my library in paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling Account","review":"I was a youth in this town as these murders were taking place.

Tell me I didn't waste 95 mins of my life watching this DVD! I think I had pretty realistic expectations going in that Say It Isn't So wasn't going to be anything exceptional and I do normally enjoy the sick Farley Brother sense of humor, but Say It Isn't So is so painfully un-funny that it's hard to believe it ever made it past its first test screening. You'd think with actors like Heather Graham, Chris Klein, and Sally Field, you'd have at least a semi-watchable movie, but there couldn't be anything further from the truth! Say It Isn't So is one of those movies that is so bad in just the wrong way that it isn't even laughable as a bad movie. ... If you're looking for a good gross-out comedy I'd recommend some of the Farley Brother's other endeavors, including the much-overlooked Kingpin or even Dumb and Dumber.

Orlando Jones (a.k.a. The 7-up Guy) as \\"Dig,\\" the pontoon plane-piloting double amputee, and Sally Field (a.k.a. Gidget) as Heather Graham's foul-mouthed, conniving mother, got me laughing out loud at least a dozen times. Heather Graham looks great, as usual, but is basically relegated to the \\"straight man's\\" role. Chris Klein, though, emotes exactly the bumbling, sympathetic humor that made his performance in \\"Election\\" so great. He has a real comedic talent for playing an unlucky, Chaplin-esque everyman that we can all love, even when he has his arm stuck up a cow's butt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very lovely and funny comedy","review":"It is a great sentimental story, with a great plot and numerous events and surprises, filled with lots of good ideas, great dialogues, beautiful pictures, superb houses, great music from the Corrs etc. The movie does not skirt the Tourette Syndrome, and gives an excellent, although partial, description of it.

The original version of this album is incredible. I am lucky enough to own a copy. The reason they re-issued the album is because they shared the same name as a band from Sweden. Beacuase of this they were forced to change their name to The Kovenant. After the name changed, unfortunately so did the bands sound. This not being a good change at all.

Definitely recommended for 1 year olds!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There Are Better Toys","review":"My daughter wanted to play with the balls more than the actual helicopter. There are better toys out there in my opinion that hold a child's attention better. I also found this one to be annoying because you can't shut it off manually.

He LOVED to push the balls through it, but he didn't like it for long when it was turned on. It is TOO loud. I thought about tossing it quite a few times, but I thought I'd give it another chance with our 2nd child. The 10 month old baby loves this thing. It drives me CRAAAAAZY, so I now decided to keep it turned off. He still loves it...so I think it's the colors and design that attract him. He loves grabbing and throwing the balls. Oh, and yes, the balls of this toy are some of the first \\"toys\\" he ever played with. The colors drew his attention. So, though we will be keeping this toy, I would never recommend it to anyone.. but I would recommend buying some colored balls with no batteries needed :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot recommend","review":"I can't really think of any reason to recommend his toy to other parents. The volume is very loud and there doesn't seem to be any value to most of the things that it says. One opening for the balls is on the side of the helicopter so that knocking it over sends the balls rolling around the house. It's one of the few toys we have that can make a mess even when no one is playing with it. Maybe our \\"exit door\\" is missing? I'm not sure; I've not seen a picture of how the other side of the toy should look. The toy does teach a few concepts but mostly what sticks in my head is the annoying music. In addition, my kids don't enjoy playing with it. I recommend you skip this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vtech Explore and Learn Helicopter","review":"My 8.5 month old loves this toy! He's still a little young for the \\"educational\\" aspects of this toy, but he loves playing with the balls and dancing to the music.

I tied up the string, so there is no chance of my son swallowing it and choking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never shuts off!","review":"Mu son received this as a gift for his 1st birthday. This toy never shuts off. There's a switch and you would think that the middle position, which is a solid circle, would be for shutting the contraption off. But no, it has to shut off itself and God forbid you should, move, bump, pick it up to put away, breathe too hard etc... it will just come alive all over again. This thing has gone off at night when I try to put it away or literally when I touch it. I like toys that can be turned off. Lastly, just when you think its done talking it just keeps going lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Interesting, SUPER Annoying","review":"Not only does my daughter not really like this toy very much, it also is probably one of the most annoying ones she has. The music and voice drives me crazy. She doesn't really play with it at all, she just turns it on to hear the music and then walks away to play with her other toys or read her books. If I turn on my music for her, she completely ignores this toy. I think its time to donate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I got this as a gift when my son turned 5 months old.

They are made of a very hard plastic, and my 1 year old was able to fit the small red ball in his mouth. Thank god I saw him do it and was able to get it out before he choked. The plastic is also hard enough to inflict damage if your child ever decides to throw the balls. Minus the deadly choking hazard, the toy is great fun for the child, but annoying for parents. The toy goes into song whenever it is moved, even the slightest touch. As a result you have to be vigilant to turn it off, otherwise it can start in the middle of the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Typically this toy broke the day after the returns date expired.

You'd think a piece was free, touch it to test, and it would snap off. Very frustrating. So on to the glow-in-the dark project...which needed a hand for each part(all 10 or so), since none of the bits would stay together on their own.

First of all, the glow-in-the-dark skeleton would not go together (we've put together many other dino skeletons) so we gave up on that. Next, my 8 year old grandson & I did not find it rewarding to peck away at a hard lump and rarely find a \\"bone\\". To speed things up, I used a screwdriver--we got to the point where we'd be happy just to find a few bones.

Our show was word for word what you would have seen on stage when it first opened on Broadway. It had all the original songs such as \\"Show Me The Key\\" and \\"House On The Hill\\"But after hearing the Original Broadway Cast so much during our production it was great to hear a New cast and new things added for this London version of The Secret Garden!

It's fanastic. But, I will say that I do not think it's fair to compare the Broadway and London versions of this show, because they are drastically different, music wise. The score and lyrics were heavily re-written for the London production. I honestly don't see why the creators felt they had to change a thing from the OBCR, but all the changes are marvelous! What we are left with is two truly great versions (and recordings) of a wonderful, wonderful show!With so many used copies (of both on here), why choose?

It has not come off my cat in the month I have owned it. I was also able to attach his rabies tag and a tag with his name and our phone numbers in case he gets busted again.The harness was easy to put on and his tags are displayed on top.

After I loss my son I felt like I was walking in a cloud or a haze. Everything seemed surreal. No one anywhere seemed to understand what I was going through. A friend who had lost a sister gave me this book. I didn't think i would be able to read with all the pain I was facing but I opened it and started reading. I found so much comfort and wisdom in the words of these two women. The experiences they each went through were incredible and shared with such caring. They covered every aspect of the grieving process and included many exercises and ideas for getting back on track with life at our OWN pace--not the pace of someone else. I can't imagine a more helpful book. Everyone who is grieving, or knows someone who is, should have a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THE 3-STAR REVIEWS","review":"I highly recommend reading the thoughtful reviews of people who did not give this book the highest rating. Beautiful title, beautiful cover, but the first story (told by the second author because she's got the PhD?) is about her own sudden loss of a wonderful man, father of her son, a \\"dear friend and loving co-parent\\" whom she adored so profoundly she had long ago divorced him! I was angry because I bought the book to try to help a 51-year-old in Blackpool, England (divorce capital of the UK - 80%!) who'd suddenly lost his wife of 32 years. He suffered so terribly we almost envied him - we knew it had been one of the rarest of marriages, but now we could see, raw and exposed, the beating heart in the phrase \\"the love of one's life.\\" Trying to take the book seriously, I could imagine profound, life-long grief for the author's little boy, but only dollar signs for his divorcee mother. (The other author's story is more believable.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great.","review":"Personally I didn't find this book helpfull. I think it would be a great book for people who know someone experiencing the loss of a love one, to read. However the book didn't help me at all in terms of grief. While it does tell you about the stages you may go through and what you may experience, it doesn't focus enough on personal growth ( which i believe is exteremly important after an experience like this)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Editing","review":"Noel's and Blair's book actually had some unique features that I thought would be helpful as a new widow, but the many errors in editing, grammar, spelling, and organization were distracting and, after a while, offensive to me, considering the subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"The book was more geared to people who lose those close to them suddenly, i.e., accident, etc. I was looking for something more on terms with death caused from illness."},{"rating":"2","title":"As essential as food, air, water -- and love","review":"There aren't many \\"firsts\\" these days. Most books being published are like so many others. This book, \\"I Wasn't Ready to Say Goodbye\\" is a first and it is valuable beyond my ability to describe it. Suffice it to say that it is truly excellent. It understands. It supports. It comforts. It shed lights. It holds your hand. It is there for you, in a time of unbearable anguish and need, like no other book every written on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"The guide that will pull you through","review":"\\"I Wasn't Ready to Say Goodbye\\", by Noel & Blair is just beautiful! It is easy to read, yet covers everything a grieving person could possibly be thinking of or be going through. It is sensitive, yet realistic. (Sometimes those two don't go together well, but in this book they do.) The book is empowering and healing, but in baby steps. I think it is a book that will be a perfect for December's issue, when people who've recently lost someone are the most depressed and need help.Pamela La GioiaYour Life!

I now have turned to it again as I'm faced with the sudden death of my 17 year old son to suicide. The book doesn't offer much about the subject of suicide as it's more for understanding the grieving process and the effects of losing a loved one suddenly.

The first is, for heaven's sake, that they are down right silly. The second is that I love them.Walking the line between a murder mystery and a parody of a bodice-ripper, there are times I find myself laughing out loud. Peabody's somewhat prim description of uproarious events along with her own deluded self-image (outmatched by Emerson's view of himself as a quiet and reasonable person) makes for great fun.Even more fun for me is the casual but fairly accurate account of Egyptology of the day - along with many sly references to Flinders Petrie which would escape the casual reader with no background knowledge of the man and his work.Great literature? Oh, probably not. But will I look forward to and rush out to by the next installment? Youbetcha"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greetings to the cat Anubis","review":"Unfortunately, I have read this series out of sequence due to access and feel encumbered by not being aware of the depth of some previous characters who have been resurrected for this saga.Ms. Peters is a perfect intellectual/romantic personality - rare in the Victorian age and rarer still today.Another outstanding work from Ms. Mertz/Peters. I can't get enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best in the series!","review":"I thought it was refreshing to have Amelia and Emerson alone this time. I love how MS.Peters works the Master Criminal into the plot. He always gets poor Emerson so mad! I loved how they fell in love with each other again.( It was worthy of a sniffle.) I hope she writes more soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's still the best","review":"Although I felt this book was a little slow in getting off the ground, it might be due to the fact that this was the first Peters book I had read, and it took me some time to adjust to her form of writing. In the end, I have to say, \\"Bravo\\" to Ms. Peters, for she is a giantess among women mystery writers, and her style equals that of Agatha Christie. Amelia Peabody is undaunted, unfazed, and gutsy- exactly the kind of woman all girls want to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"My First Real Disappointing Amelia Peabody Book","review":"I just did not like this book, it just did not have much of a point. Even the usual witty repartee between Amelia and Emerson wasn't enough to salvage this book for me. The whole plot seems pointless with Amelia and Emerson just meandering around Egypt's various famous archaeological sites. As much as I hate to admit it, I really missed Ramses, and that whole England bit was far too boring. Let's hope the next book redeems the series for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay I'm addicted!","review":"The first couple in the series were hard to read. She writes very formally. British style.

The emphasis is back on Amelia and Emerson and this book is much in the style of the very first. There is humour, romance and adventure, and thankfully they left the kids at home. I did love Ramses' letters (why did he grow up and get serious?) and the part where he writes about being rescued by Nefret is hilarious. This is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Park the Kids and Find Your Man","review":"Elizabeth Peters parks the kids in England and kindles Amelia's love life in THE SNAKE, THE CROCODILE & THE DOG. Well, the best laid plans do not always work or do they.To enjoy this title in the series it helps to be familiar with the Emerson's history as a couple and their relationship to various secondary characters.Amelia and \\"Father of Curses,\\" who dislikes his first name have some time to enjoy each other during the winter dig in Egypt. Then old friends, villains in disguise as friends, dead bodies, stolen artifacts, beautiful slave women, and mayhem make their way on to the stage.The pace is fast and secrets impeded the action, which makes this one of the funnest books in the series.

It's a bit of a morbid story with cute little twists. The characters are neat (interesting developments). There is a romance or two.

Wish you could buy it in the states!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No DVD for English audiences?","review":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet is one of the most inspired and creative directors alive. Anyone who has followed his films and likes them would agree. The \\"making of\\" extras on \\"The Longest Engagement\\" reveals how a director and a cohesive team of actors, technical experts, and artistic visionaries can collaborate over a long period of time to produce true works of art. \\"Amelie\\" is probably my favorite movie, because of its sheer beauty and how it touches my soul with a simple, human story. \\"City of Lost Children\\" also survives countless re-watching to explore its bizarre depths.I was totally amazed that this earlier classic was not available on DVD for English-speaking audiences.\\"Delicatessen\\" is indeed a strange and quirky movie, but it is essential viewing if you enjoyed any of Jeunet's later works."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT, FUNNY, WARPED, WEIRD, and OUTRIGHT WONDERFUL!!!","review":"This offbeat comic film about a post-apocalyptic future in which money is worthless, grain is money, and people can end up as food is nothing short of a triumph!

However, it turns out that the premise the topic could provide some dark humor was wrong. Any probability for humor was obscured in the movie itself. This resulted from the fact the movie tried too hard to be smart and cutting edge. It failed with the result something I just could not even watch for more than a few minutes. Yellow light bathing everything, no thank you. Meat colored walls, again no thanks. Plain boring story and too ambitious a concept, not interested. I would argue that it is too abstract to enjoy unless one is has that high an opinion of themselves. However, that might just be me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannibal movie, where's the gore?","review":"For anyone thinking of buying this movie, I was fooled into believing it was a horror film or at least a horror comedy. It is neither funny or scary. I don't know what to call this mess, because their is no gore in the picture. I think that an apartment building appearing normal during the apocalypse is a funny idea.

When I placed them in my cart they were $64, then a few days later went down to $55, which is where I bought them, then on down to $52. Today they are back up to $64. My advice is to listen to them on Amazon and if you like them put them in your cart and wait for the price to go back down. I do not think you will find a better price anywhere.

Some of the underlying tunes on the rest of the CD are pretty good, but the singer's voice is gratingly annoying, as if he doesn't know if he's trying to be Kurt Cobain or Billy Corgan, or both at once. The songs are corny and unlistenable. Whoever calls these guys grungy are obviusly mistaken. The only way they possibly sound \\"grunge\\" is maybe a wimpy, watered down version of Mudhoney. This is an even bigger disappointment than Cake's \\"prolonging the magic\\"... at least I can skip a track here and there and not want to gag.

You can almost imagine yourself in the front row of a Broadway theatre. I have seen the movie version of this but not the musical, and after listening to the CD, I am dying to see it live in New York of London. Julie Covington is wonderful as Evita. Her voice is lyrical, with a slight sophisticated accent. If you are trying to decide whether you should buy this CD or the soundtrack with Madonna in it, just listen to the snippets of songs and compare. Madonna's voice is lower (because she couldn't sing as high as Julie Covington) and not as moving. You will be MUCH happier bying this CD instead of Madonna's."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely THE BEST version of this work","review":"This is definitely the BEST production of this work - Julie Covington not only sings the songs, she acts them - because she is an actress first, she captures every facet of the character of Evita: from social climbing tramp to ruthless political schemer to the dying heroine desperate to be loved. None of the other women who have played the role prominently seem to have grasped the way the music conveys what is happening inside this woman - they sing the songs without integrating them into the whole piece. It's a shame Covington declined the role on stage - it would have been wonderful to see what she would have made of it. Colm Wilkinson is also the finest Che of the lot - Patinkin is simply too \\"sissy\\" for the role in my opinion - Loved him in \\"Sunday\\" but his Che is no good - can't imagine how he and LuPone won Tony awards for their performances in this work - perhaps the Tony voters never heard this version?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evita,original cast - a sad story told in song,replete with majesty.","review":"This is a story told in song and music.Some tracks shine out,some are dull by comparison - but these are needed to provide context.The whole thing carries a sad,simple unique charm - and is well worth listening to.The best track of all - the lament at the end - is sadly missing in the Madonna version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can Someone Answer me on this?","review":"I see that Colm Wilkonsen is credited for playing Che. I sold my copy of this concept recording but I could swear mine had David Essex listed in it and his picture as well for Che. Is this possible. This Was NOT the londan cast recording (with Elaine Paige) that i had, it was the concept album with Julie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Un-rehearsed","review":"I love \\"Evita\\" but I hate Julie Covington and all the singers on this album. They can't sing at all! It sounds like very little effort went in to the making of this cd. The performance sounds un-rehearsed. The singers also mouth the lyrics too much and that makes the songs lose much of their harmonic quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT ROCK-OPERA","review":"I'm a true EVITA fan. I've a lot of Evita's Cd including the American Cast. Vienna Cast, Korean Cast, Spanish Cast, Movie SoundTrack, Original London Recording to name a few. This London Cast is the true Life Of Eva Peron. Julie Covington have a real nice voice, C.T. Wilkinson and Paul Jones too. You must have to hear her illusions in \\"Buenos Aires\\", the real way to succeed in \\"Goodnight & Thank You\\" and in the ORIGINAL format of \\"The Lady's Got Potential\\". Oh yes, the magic of \\"Rainbow High\\" and the charm in \\"Rainbow Tour\\" when she says: \\"THERE YOU ARE I TOLD YOU SO MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHERE WE GO THE WHOLE WORLD OVER JUST THE SAME YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD THEM CALLED OUR NAME AND WHO WOULD UNDERSTIMATE THE ACTRESS NOW\\". Do yourself a favour, buy this diamond. This is the only CD that contains \\"Eva's Sonnet\\" and the complete and beautiful \\"Lament\\". If you have any question e-mail me. BUY IT NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"Julie has a really sweet and nice voice but it just isn't strong enought to portray Evita. Except for Colm Wilkinson, the rest of the cast and the orchestra playing the background music stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extraordinarily Boring...","review":"As an actor myself, I find this score one of the most remarkably boring ever created by Andrew Lloyd Webber - making it one of the most boring theatre scores I've ever heard. I suppose it did little for me after listening to the studio cast recording of \\"A Little Night Music\\" (Sondheim), but it nonetheless inspired little excitement. The monotonous repetion of \\"ideas\\" and melodic lines do nothing to build upon a thematic concept, which rests entirely in the hands of one woman. Though she obviously struggles with subtlety in dialogue and music, Patti LuPone remains one of the gutsiest, gruntiest Eva's out there (buy the original Broadway recording). LuPone appeared in the professional production in Melbourne, Australia at Her Majesty's Theatre as part of the original tour.Dated, boring and weak - nearly as musically challenging as \\"Phantom of the Opera\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"ROTTEN!","review":"Let me first say, I LOVE EVITA. I had read about the concept album, and wanted to find a good show-- It was rotten. Whoever played Evita did not get voice lessons! If you want a better version of the musical, cheque out the US version with Patti LuPone."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD!! BAD!! BAD!!","review":"The singers talk their way through this horrible cd. There is no singing! The orchestra also needs better musicians and the songs sound practically the same. Whoever wanted to dub Julie Covington's voice over Madonna's obviously doesn't like good singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major dissapointment","review":"I was very dissapointed to hear Julie Covington's voice wasted on a recording like this. She is a great singer but needs to find better songs to sing and work with a better cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"The singers who portray Eva and Che are terrible!!!","review":"The singers on this cd cannot sing! They obviously need to take some lessons and tone down their high pitched voices. I hate this cd! It is bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Performance","review":"Julie Covington has a really high pitched, emotionless, and very un sing songy voice. The singer who portrays Che has an annoying nasal twang. Evita is great. This performance is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointingly literal","review":"Well, I thought in the sub-title it said \\"an OPERA based on the life story of Eva Peron.\\" But this is not an opera at all. These singers have obviously never taken operatic singing lessons and the orchestra sounds like a pop rock synthesizer. For those expecting an opera, you won't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale and boring","review":"In contrast to the music fan from USA I thin this musical sounds over-rehearsed and stale. The singers sing without gusto and I think that is because of too many run throughs. The singing lacks operatic qualitites and is altogether thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insecticide?","review":"This CD changes the lyrics of many songs with insecticide. The Lady's got potential is completly messed up. this CD is a confusing wast of time. Some of the singers are OK, but some, well, aren't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Che is wonderful, Evita could be better","review":"Colm Wilkinson is wonderful as Che. His voice is a combination of operatic and more popular styles, which fits the music perfectly. Evita is not as good, but she does well portaying Eva as what she is, \\"just a back street girl\\". You have to realize, if you look at the music, that this is increadably difficult to sing. This is my favorite Evita Recording, because of Colm."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST RECORDING EVER MADE!!!!!!","review":"this cd is a complete disgrace to evita. Julie Covington is an awful Eva Peron. If evita was alive today, she'd want to die! Covington makes my mom sound like an opera singer. C.T Wilconson, before his Lez miz days,turns in a HORRIBLE proformance The only song he does well on is \\"Oh what a circus\\" Paul Jones is a flat, boring Peron. The only thing good abount this recording is the band. Bottom line, dont waste your money.I recament the Primire american recording, Patti Lupone And Mandy Patinkin turn in much better proformances, plus it's a more compleate version"},{"rating":"2","title":"So good, it was a one sitting read!!!!","review":"I was unfamiliar with Guy Jacobs work as this was the first book I read that he wrote. After stumbling across it on Amazon I decided to give it a read. All I can say is life changing! Jacobs is definitely a talent and that rare author who can create a tale so vivid and true that it is frighteningly good. His tales of love and life in general really hit home with the reader. I would definitely recommend this book to not only single males like myself but anyone who is searching for love and the meaning of life. Jacobs just became my favorite author. I only hope that he publishes more books in the future and does not disappear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Stuff","review":"Hard-Boiled Men is an excellent book. What I really enjoyed about it was the fact that the author put it all on the line. The book's hero Ben Wise is a real person that I think most people could relate to. His account of single life in Manhattan will surely strike a cord with both male and female readers. Most of all, this book is hilarious, painfully candid and insightful. Guy Jacobs' style of writing is somewhat similar to Bukwoski which may be a good or a bad thing depending on your taste in literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"rhino's version is significantly different from the original","review":"terribly disappointed to find that rhino has used the title of the original release without using the same material. the secret policeman series is taken from a number of live benefit performances for amnesty international. each of the releases has some overlap with the others. notably absent from this version, as compared to the original, are the pete townshend acoustic version of \\"pinball wizard\\" and the \\"two men on a bench\\" skit performed by john cleese and peter cook. on the other hand, it does include the eric clapton/jeff beck collaboration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Completely Different from the Original","review":"This edited version of the original (out-of-print) Secret Policeman's Other Ball is disappointing. Some of the choicest bits (including Pete Townshend's incredible acoustic of \\"Pinball Wizard\\") have been omitted.There are still some good sketches (\\"Cha-cha-cha\\")and music (Sting, Phil Collins, Jeff Beck, Clapton), but overall it was a very disappointing experience. If you want to support Amnesty International, send them a check. If you want to see The Secret Policeman's Other Ball, find a rental or buy a used copy of the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Loved The Movie, DO NOT BUY THIS!","review":"Please shell out the money for the 3 DVD set. Most of the funniest comedy bits have been cut. It's mostly the music, and that can also be found on the DVD set.Don't make the same mistake as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots Missing from original show","review":"I was at first thrilled to see that this was available. But wait--there's less! Apparently from what I can gather, the complete original show seen in the early 1980's or so has never been made available in VHS or DVD form. So don't get your hopes up. This \\"edition\\" is missing LOTS of the original footage. I can only imagine that some of the performers must not have signed releases for portions, or something. What I recalled as one of the funniest shows I'd ever seen was reduced to eliciting an occasional chuckle. Still some good stuff, but overall Not Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEVER WANNA STOP","review":"I BOUGHT THIS GAME FOR MY 4 YEAR OLD SON FOR CHRISTMAS AND AM I EVER GLAD I DID. HE AND HIS COUSIN HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME ALMOST EVERY DAY SINCE THEN.

I agree with the reviewer who said he/she kept looking at the clock to see how much more of this junk would be shown. The actors spend large segments of time just staring at each other, supposedly with meaningful expressions, but really rather expressionless. Their faces usually show vacuity instead of emotion (which is supposed to be imagined and supplied by teeny watchers). When they actually speak a few words, they mumble in low, almost inaudible sounds. The grandfather's accent my be unintelligible, but the other actors speak as if no one is supposed to hear them. Like TV, Hollywood's movies have fallen to the lowest common denominator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film!!","review":"The Dust Factory is a refreshing film! Never have I seen a storyline like this one. Very imaginative and creative. The two young stars give stunning performances - truly, academy award material. The sets and costumes take you away to another world - which is exactly what the director must have intended. You leave this film pondering the possibilities of what truly happens between life and afterlife - and those people most important to you. What a touching story and moving experience. The writer, director, cast and entire production team have created a superb film!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Dust Factory\\"","review":"A very imaginative fantasy, with a lot of appeal to all young and/or young at heart. I saw the movie presented of TV and decided it was worthy adding to our collection of mostly classic movie DVD's. The plot is easy to follow - but for you to find out if you should chose to buy this DVD. Suffices to say that, in all probablity, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow","review":"I was very disappointed in this movie. I thought it was slow moving and found myself contunually calling up the display to see how much longer it lasted. The Grandfather has such a heavy accent that I missed a lot of what he was saying but didn't want to drag out the movie by playing it back. I have seen many fantasies in my time but this one left me cold. Didn't like!

Scott and Leo team up to give us a highly entertaining behind the scenes look of a decade and more of one of the best pitching staff's in the history of baseball. This book is well written and is a must for any true baseball fan, particularly Brave's fans. Great book Scott and Leo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mazzone's Book","review":"Pretty good for a sports & baseball book. Especially this guy, who was a guru - just look at the record. Several years ago, he was asked and developed a work-out routine for the Potomac State College pitching staff, of which the Pot State Coach gave us a copy at our January Baseball Clinic. I'm not a paid coach, but have heard a lot of coaches talk about pitching, read lot of books, and coached say junior high boys for several years, and this routine was impressive. Think may still have it, but would have to hunt for a while. Believe it gave a day by day routine, e.g. starting throwing say 1/3 then 1/2, then say 3/4 distance and also increasing the time and worked on certain pitches. Believe their was a routine for everything, and their was a fair amount of practice pitching. The whole deal was very impressive to us all. He covers this methodology somewhat in his book. Not a Braves fan but you had to admire their pitching staff and this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah....","review":"I found Scanlon to be quite wordy. He could have said what he wanted to say in half the space. The major frustration with the book is that while Scanlon presents his theory of contractualism, he does not answer the objections to it. For example, in Chapter 8 (relativism), he discusses the objection to his theory but never directly answers it. After you've read 300+ pages, it would be nice if he could defend his own theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to work find","review":"I purchased this product to eliminate a buzz in my subwolfer.

Another person forced it to plug in, but that would become a problem when some unforeseen overage situation occurs and I might have to remove it immediately.

I will be returning this immediately.

The cord length seems longer than most surge protectors carried in the stores which helps me work on my laptop just about from anywhere in my living room with it plugged in. The battery died and I do not want to spend money at the moment purchasing a new one. This protector keeps it safe while still allowing me the mobility expected from a laptop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item for the money!","review":"The product works fine, no issues. The on-off button is tricky to find, for sure, but that has an advantage which is, you will not accidentally turn it off with your feet if you have it below your desk.I though I got a damage product when I first plugged it in, but it turned out it was the switch which was in the \\"off\\" position. Perhaps this is what may have happened to some of the reviewers when they stated they got a defective product? Just wondering. It will be good if they can add a led to the switch, so you know if the switch is on when the led is lighted.As noted by another reviewer, I also wish there were a bit more space between the outlets for larger power adaptors such as those for cell phones, baby monitors, etc.Overall for the price I paid for this, I am satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good at a cheap price","review":"Build quality is top notch, of the sockets as well as the cord.Only shortcoming is that the sockets could be a little farther apart from each other.

I was unpleasantly surprised to find that this was extraordinarily fickle. The slightest bump to the unit causes it to reset and, effectively, turn off anything I have plugged into it. I think my computer has already lost power about eight times because I accidentally tapped this ever so slightly. In order for me to even plug in something else I have to make sure everything is powered off, then plug something in.I did at first think it may be the outlet (even though I used something similar to this, without surge protection and had no issues), but after plugging in my old one I deduced it was this, and that is was \\"touchy\\".

Wald doesn't offer an exact answer, rather she describes many different characters who want to submit, who desire this so strongly, and who, jut like in real life, are often unaware of what they really want."},{"rating":"1","title":"D/S or S/M fans this is not your typical fare so be forewarned!!","review":"This collection of stories was, for the most part, not erotic at all. I have no idea why the synopsis and the other reviewer would imply that they were. I gave the book two stars because it is about Masters. People realizing that someone other than themselves was in control. But.... and this is a big but.... if you are looking for your traditional 'me slave, you master' stories then forget it. Most of the stories left me feeling flat. Many had unsatsifactory endings and strangely detached beginnings. Eroticism is not sex and I know the difference between the two but most of these stories were not even close. The book would be more accurate to be advertised as a collection of short stories of self discovery by people at crucial points in their life. So if you like pretty vanilla reading with a twist then go for it.... otherwise for all you guys that want the unabashed d/s eroticism the title illicits then you'd better not get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"This is still my favorite recording.

Even then, the genious vivid pictures you get from the discriptions from this book are breathtaking. A classic children's book that's been around since 1941, this entertaing story should take the horse-loving child to a new place of imagination exploration.

Similar to brides of dracula in that the story revolves around classic vampire genre with all the hammer superb atmosphere and acting. These films have lesbian undertones as carmilla kreinstein befriends then bites young towns women. a great film if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been better","review":"I've seen this well before it was reissued and hastly withdrawn from the market since the Hammer copyright is a very hot these days! I can tell you this,Ingrid Pitt is wonderful in a story with more holes in IT than her pray. See it once than move on to \\"Countess Bathory Story\\" AKA Bloody Countess (a MUCH better latter day Hammer affair. If you can find it) Only if Anchor Bay could speed up more of the Hammer catalog to DVD...."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I rented this because of the positive reviews, boy, was I disapointed! This film was boring, tedious, and did not make much sense. I found the female vampire to be unconvincing as a vampire and not suited to the role. Skip this film, there are better 1960's horror movies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Vampire Lovers","review":"With the exception of Peter Cushing and The two lezzed up charlatans the movie is boring and slow moving, but once you arrive at the nudey scenes it is very much worth it,all in all it is more of a let's wait and see some action type of movie since the plot is obvious than a real scary treat.More like a Treat only which is good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"The vampire Lovers: A Tale of A Female Vampire","review":"I've seen some of this film. I am confused as to what this film is. is this the hardcore 91 minute version, or the softcore 87 minute version. I would buy this tape if i knew.From what i've seen, and heard this film is a waek adaptation of Seridian Le Fanu's vampire novel. It was rated Pg in a dVD double feature with Countess Dracula. I find that hard to belive.I heard that there is a DVD version of the 87 minute cut film, and I'm looking for It!-The Hammer Film Reveiwer HIMSELF!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vampire Lover's one of fun-loving Hammer studio's best features!","review":"So glad to see this classic coming to blue ray! One of Hammer's best vampire films. Ingrid Pitt is the best female vampire EVER, and reliable Peter Cushing is great as always, with Ferdy Mayne (Count Krolock in Roman Polanski's \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers\\", Jon Finch (Polanski's \\"MacBeth\\", Hitchcock's \\"Frenzy\\") the fabulous Kate O'Mara, great character actor Douglas Wilmer (Sherlock Holmes) and Hammer heroines Dawn Addams and Madeline Smith on board this film also features one of Hammer's best casts! I love this movie and some of the scenes, like Carmilla's seduction of the Governess, are still shocking even by today's standards. Nostalgic and fun, from an era when horror films were intelligently made, this is a must buy! Great movie! And Ingrid looks very good in her bath!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mabuse Malaise","review":"German producer Artur Brauner's \\"Dr. Mabuse\\" series runs out of steam with this tired crime thriller. The change in locale accomplishes little, though a good cast (headed by Peter van Eyck) generates some interest. Despite filmmaker Paul May's best efforts, \\"Scotland Yard vs. Dr. Mabuse\\" (1963) is a pale shadow of the classic Fritz Lang trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a disappointment","review":"I own two other books by Larry Ullman and am nothing but pleased with them; however, this one was rather disappointing. The coverage is overly simplistic, shallow and lacks substance. The authors also \\"stroke out\\" in the pointers section --which is a bastion of C programming. I suppose it's \\"fine\\" as a dumbed-down introductory text, but for anyone with even a little programming background this book is useless or even laughable. Definitely not one of his better ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent way to learn C programming!","review":"I needed to learn to program in C for my job. Unfortunately I was unable to find any community college or other in-person type courses that taught C programming. I spent several months struggling trying to learn C through Element K and other online resources. Having previously used the Visual Quickstart series to learn HTML, I finally purchased the C Programming Visual Quickstart Guide. It was the best purchase I have made in a long time! The two column format is FAR easier to follow than the traditional single column approach. The examples teach the content very specifically by highlighting (in bold) the relevant code in the scripts found on the right-hand side of the page. I am learning to program in C quickly and easily.

I originally bought one for my 90 gal tank, but soon replaced it with a skimmer that could handle the tank, I now have the SeaClone 100 on my 20 gallon tank with just an undulated triggerfish in. This product is only somewhat useful if you replace the plastic valve they give you with a brass one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Put your money back in your pocket on this one. Save up for a decent skimmer if you are going to buy one. Sure this thing is priced right but it is a case of getting exactly what you paid for. I have one of these and use it on a 55 gallon tank. I get some results but nothing like you would get with a better skimmer. I rate it a 2 out of 5 cause I do get some thick green/brown skimmate using it so there is my proof it does work. It seems to like to spit out microbubbles by the trillions so sump placement may be better than the hang on. I don't have room for a sump so I hang it on the back. However if you are determined on buying this thing or have the tools and materials to modify it to work better the price is right for the materials to use this beast as a foundation to mod. I can't take anything away from the Maxi-Jet 1200 pump that comes with it. I'll score the powerhead 5 stars...but the rest of that contraption still gets 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP!","review":"This product is so bad that it boggles the mind.

It was full of too many generalizations like \\"banks must provide on-line banking in order to survive\\" rather than specific considerations for eCommerce projects.

It is not. I hated it. You don't even interact with the Bratz as the description claims. The first 3 times I played the game it said I had all misses. And I picked the slowest song. The game did not even count the ones I got on time. It counted everything as misses. I'm exchanging mine for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even good!!","review":"What a piece of junk! My daughter begged for this, and even she was disappointed. The music is pitiful electronic tones (with no words); this game is frustrating even for an adult. When attempting to play the game, you can't even look at the Brat on the screen because you're too busy trying to push the right colored button and then the cord bar before the note gets to the top of the screen. The notes are pretty fast and the guitar does not even recognize half the time you actually do it in time. The game rates your attempts as Good, Bad, or Miss. My daughter was devastated when (after hitting the right buttons) the game told her she had 4 Bad attempts. Why on earth is Bad even one of the ratings!! The Energizer batteries I put in it lasted approx. an hour and a half. Not worth the money or frustration.Ours went right back to the store (at our daughter's request.)Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter disappointed with guitar","review":"I purchased this for my 5 year old. The television commercials made the guitar appear to be a karaoke sing along. The guitar does hook up to your TV set, but it loads a game that appears on the TV display. You have to press the correct keys as the Bratz Rock Angel sings. The graphics weren't very good, and even I wasn't able to press the keys quickly enough to win the game. Overall, we were very disappointed and returned the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy Guitar","review":"This toy was actually not what I expeceted. When I plugged it into the tv it was not even in color. It was definitely not user friendly being that it was hard to figure out what note my daughter was supposed to be playing. I actually was the first one to play and could not follow along with the notes on the screen because it went so fast. Not only that I felt that it was not interacting well with the user and did not provide good user-friendly on-screen instructions. This toy I felt was one of the worst interactive toys on the market. Anyone looking to buy this item please save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nine thumbs down!!","review":"I don't like this toy at all, maybe if you were older it would be easier (I am seven).

Sex and relationships dominate the novel, as well as Ben. Ben eventually goes to Harvard and majors in English or Literature and is something of a poet.

The only part of it that actually works is the rain gauge (so my only compliment is that that part does not leak)! The thermometer says it is always exactly 48 degrees, and the wind always blows north. If I hadn't spent so long assembling it and it weren't such a hassle, I'd send it back.

My son is 5, and he thought it was boring. Putting the weather station together was not as easy as it should have been, and he could not help with that part. I'm not sure an 8 year old could even do it. Once it was together, it seems to be durable enough to stay outside, and we'll see how it works. The book that it came with was fun to read to my son, but the iceberg was so cheesy, that I just couldn't bring myself to do it. A plastic bag? I could do that with spending the money for a kit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie...Hard to watch at times.","review":"I had heard a lot about this movie so I finally went to see it. Great story and cast. My only problem is that I am a huge animal lover and elephants have a special place in my heart. They are SO devoted to one another and they cry tears when they are upset or hurt.There is a part in this film that disturbed me so much I had to get up and walk out.(I hate any cruelty to animals and/or children, they are so helpless ).My frineds told me to go back as it had a happy ending, which I did and indeed it was a very happy, justifiable ending. I would recommend this film to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cliff Notes on DVD","review":"I read and enjoyed the book and was curious how the movie would play. Ugh. This movie was like taking the cliff notes and filming it. What a disappointment. Robert Pattinson as Jacob was a mis-cast if ever there was one. A more likely role for him might be blue jean model in a poster on the side of a bus. Reese Witherspoon did as fine a job as could be done I suppose.If you haven't read the book forget about this movie and invest the time to read the book. Whatever your imagination does to fill out the characters while reading will undoubtedly be better that what was done with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, THE MOVIE","review":"MY COUSIN TURNED ME ON TO THIS BOOK.

Let's just say I lowered my expectations just in case it was a total flop. I'm happy to report, however, that the movie is really great! I wasn't thrilled to see Robert Pattinson playing the lead role (why in the world does he need to do that smiling face when he's not actually happy...so annoying!), but he wasn't too bad. Christoph Waltz though, oh my. That man was BORN to be the bad guy - he's so incredible.All in all, I really enjoyed the movie.

However, what an incredible movie!!! I was a little fearful that Rob Pattinson's portrayal of Jacob would be too similar to his other character Edward Cullen, however, that could not be farther from the truth!! He has proven himself to be a dynamic actor!!! His connection with the elephant draws you in to such a degree that you can feel his joy, and his pain through out the movie. This movie was cast wonderfully and the cinematography was brilliant. The more intimate scenes are so tastefully done, which is so refreshing considering most movies are getting extremely close to being x-rated lately. I would highly recommend this movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reese and Rpatz are great.","review":"If you like the novel, you'll be happy to know that the movie is pretty close to it.

So much so that I could probably watch it a few more times! I also had no clue what the movie was about other than a circus and that it starred Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon.The movie is about an old man who tells the story of how he fell for the star of a circus. The story tells of how he comes to work for the circus as a vet, friends he makes there and his romance. I thought that Pattinson and Witherspoon did an awesome job of playing their characters. I laughed, I cried, and I gasped at parts in the movie, with it keeping me watching the whole time. The movie is set during the Great Depression and it is interesting to see how the circus survives throughout it.While Romance/Drama movies are not my usual genre of choice, I really liked this movie and think it was well made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"This was better than I expected.

Brought some tears to my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheres the beef?","review":"I thought WFE would be a terrific old fashioned Greatest Show On Earth type movie from hollywoods earlier era. But boy what a boring and predictable yarn this was. Hal Holbrook and Christopher Waltz make the film watchable. The lack of romantic chemistry between the two leads is pathetic. There simply was no passion on the screen at all between them. But the biggest fault of this film is that the director decided to put Rosie ,the elephant, in the backdrop of the story- Unforgiveable. Rosie is really what the film should center around. Instead we get a lukewarm love story. I really wanted this film to blow me away but alas it turned to be another quick fader. Could have been a masterpiece. Instead it is just a piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time and Money","review":"What a disappointment! The best acting in this movie was Rosie, the elephant..and she got tortured to perform. The viewers get tortured watching this slow-moving, poorly-acted film. I read the book and surprisingly, this movie closely follows the book... although parts were omitted as is usual for films based on books. The book provided characters with chemistry between/among them; however, Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson have no chemistry...period. They seem to be sleep-walking throughout the scenes...including the romantic scene, which is so dark that even a good imagination can't help it. Christoph Waltz has an accent that interferes with his English. After 2 hours, I began to understand his sentences. I would have liked to see more of the Circus! An Oscar should go to the elephant. Forget the rest of the actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water for Elephants streaming download (I thought)","review":"My wife and I have been wanting to watch this movie.

I have never read the book. I was not sure exactly what to expect either.I have to say I was completely involved in the movie. The 3 main characters played had great rolls and did a great job. I would recommend watching the movie--but this is not a movie that I would by and watch over and over again.I am an animal lover, and some of the scenes were a bit cruel to the animals, whether they were real or computerized.Rob and Reese didn't have the passion like I think they should have. That could have been better too.all in all, it was worth my money to rent it and watch it at least once. I can say it was not a waste of my time :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"much anticipated","review":"I had heard so much about this movie & the book.

The casting seemed really strange and 'off' with no chemistry between Jacob and Marlena. Besides Marlena looking harsh and old, not fitting the part at all. The acting for most of the characters was dull except for Hal Holbrook as old Jacob, and surprisingly my favorite was 'Charlie' or whoever it was who took old Jacob under his wing. the only believable acting.The theme of old Jacob's life at the nursing home was just as important to me in the book as his young life at the circus, and that entire part of his life was omitted. I would like to see it remade someday with different actors and follow the flashback method of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a waste of time","review":"Why all the bashing on Witherspoon? I think a lot of the time it isn't bad acting as much to blame as bad writing and directing. I've seen her be great and dreadful, and can say the same for all actors. Granted, some of Witherspoons portrayal of Marlena is wooden, the character wasn't all that 3 dimensional in the book to begin with. And I love that she is playing a character 10yrs her junior, good for her. As for the Hollywood Lib whatever some people are commenting on, does anyone really take their political cues from celebrities?

Had I not read the book first the element of surprise would have been there. I enjoyed the book so much better. I know they couldn't include everything in the book into a 2 hour movie. They stayed true to the book with no noticeable changes in the movie. I think Pattinson and Reese were good choices for the lead. I think the chemistry between Reese and Robert was good which made it believable. They made a beautiful couple. The guy playing the circus owner was excellent also.

Don't know why it was necessary to twist the ending visa versa in the movie. Also, the great fire at the end was totally written out of the movie, even though they reference it early in the film. Robert Pattison made the mistake of admitting he got his first film job by lying about his attending acting school. He should have done less lying and more training. His pretty face is as wooden as a cigar store Indian. He seems totally lost, sort of comparable to Keanu Reeves. When you put him next to a quality actor like Christoph Waltz he shows very poorly. Ms. Witherspoon was just okay.Could have been a great film, I blame the screen writer, the director and the person who cast the actors.

I know junk food and a great movie do go hand in hand. When I started watching Water For Elephants, I immediately feel into the story line. I was stuck to the movie from the beginning to the end. The actors played the characters so well, I personally feel they were made for these parts. Which when you have characters this good, it tells me that the directing was amazing. I feel that Reese and Pattinson had such a connection, which resulted in some very steamy moments together. The part that really caught my heart was the scenes of her abuse. It just tore me and really brought out emotions that were so strong. This movie can give you some very teary eyed moments.

Samuel L Jackson adds vocals to four tracks and does an admirable job; on 'Just like a Bird Without a feather' he more than holds his own alongside classic blues singers like RL Burnside and Jessie Mae Hemphill. John Doe--from the punk band X--adds a track as well that fits in much better than one might think."},{"rating":"2","title":"At least this snake isn't moaning on a plane!","review":"On this relatively good collection of mostly blues tunes, the main curiosity item is to see how well actor Samuel Jackson carries off the singer role. He sings four songs on this soundtrack CD, and acquits himself pretty admirably, although the standard comment about the day job does apply here. Otherwise the theme is the blues, but actually several of the tunes swim in that deep, dark water where blues, soul, gospel and rock 'n' roll meet. I thought the John Doe cut was excellent, and I also really liked the R&B leanings of the Bobby Rush track, and the Black Keys song is pretty great too. The score cues by Scott Bomar provide nice atmosphere in a Ry Cooder-ish vein (smoky slide guitar).

Is Gwenda hallucinating or was it all just a bad dream? Is the house haunted? If there really was a murder, who did it? Miss Marple advises the young couple to \\"let sleeping murder lie\\" but, of course they don't and Miss Marple can't resist offering a little assistance in getting to the bottom of the mystery.What I love about Agatha Christie stories is that they are honest to goodness murder mysteries without the sex and the bad language.

Gwen and husband Giles team up with friend Jane Marple to uncover clues to the crime that happened years earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeping Murder Review","review":"Of all the Agatha Christie books I have read, the characters and plot of Sleeping Murder are by far the most interesting of them all. Gwenda and Giles Reed are two bright-eyed New Zealand newlyweds looking for their first home in England--what they find in the house is an eerie familiarity and a haunting past. When the couple moves into their new home, Gwenda has strange feelings of deja vu. She has dreams of a woman strangled in the hall and she feels a certain aura of murder in the air. Miss Jane Marple tells Gwenda to \\"let sleeping murder lie\\", but she insists on thoroughly investigating the history behind her haunted house.

I tried to mess with the little dial on the side, but couldn't seem to get it right (no doubt this would work better with a desktop PC), but then came up with a simpler solution.

It is a great idea and the design is almost perfect. The major problem with the design is a single $0.20 trimmer pot ( variable resistor ) that is used to set when your device is ON versus OFF. It is VERY hard to set. My computer in Sleep mode consumes 50W and in normal ON mode consumes 100W. Tuning the strip to recognize the difference between the two power states required about 1/10 of a degree turn - hard to do. What is worse is that even after I got it working once, temperature variation in the circuit would cause it to stop working the next day. For many applications ( for example, computer hibernate=5W, vs ON=100W ) this device works just fine. I can't recommend it for computer Standby however. If they would improve the circuit with a multi-turn pot, it would probably work great. I might try this myself after the warranty period is over. Should have been a great \\"Green\\" product, sigh...."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Security","review":"Buying A Smart Strip I thought it was a good way to be green and protect my home theater system .But While Sitting in our family room with our home theater system off,Fully connected to the Smart Strip.

I spoke with Blitz LTD (Blitz Ltd owns the company of the Smart Strip)and was told to send the receiver out for a repair estimate and they would be put in a claim for me with the company. The repair company stated the damage to the receiver was due to a power surge, and Blitz Ltd denied the claim saying they had NO PROOF the receiver was connected to the strip.

One said that yes, nobody knows, but there are some rules but none of these were actually elaborated on or explained.

Alternating between the 'real' and subconscious every chapter is a neat trick that makes you ponder the very reality of the story. Which world is the 'real' world? Towards the end the story even turns a little Lovecraftian - Which was very surprising for a Japanese author.

Or perhaps Murakami was trying for the simplicity of good noir.

Murakami is especially inept at integrating exposition into the novel. The fable-like \\"End of the World\\" sections are better, but not enough to support this bloated attempt.

Everybody who was as disappointed as me, should read Tanizakis \\"The Key\\" to get a kick out of Japanese literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow.","review":"i haven't quit on a book in a long time. i'm a huge vonnegut and palanhiuk fan, so murakami was suggested to me. maybe it was because of the comparison, no wait, this book was just bad. poor transitions, bland descriptions, and i have to say just bad story telling. this was my first murakami, and unfortunately i can't try it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastically Brilliant..","review":"This book has to be one of my favorites of all time. It is not highly read for it is a translated book, but it shocked me beyong belief how this book is written, with a refreshing sense of mood and with a air of wisdom hidden amongst all. I highly recommend this book, but I must warn, enter with a open mind and it will seem more astounding."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"In my opinion this novel serves as a bridge between genre-fiction (sci-fi/cyberpunk in this case) and more serious literature. It's not the best novel I've ever read so forget about murakami being the greatest writer alive or things like that... He's very talented, no doubt about that, and provided with an astounding imagination but I'll trade this book any minute for a Tom Robbins' novel... Let alone Kurt Vonnegut.Still, it clealy deserves 4 stars (and maybe a \\"bonus\\" 1/2) and I gladly suggest this to everyone who's looking for a twisted (but brilliant) take at genre-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"another catching Murakami adventure","review":"The story might seem a bit crazy first (a guy neurologically trained to shuffle experimental data, a professor who does research on sound-removal, and his lonely grown-up grandchild), but Murakami knows how to make it sound realistic and breadth-taking. On the other side the story tells about some of the problems of every-day people, not in a soap-opera style, but between the lines of saving the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eggsquisite","review":"Another split story line from Murakami (do I see a pattern?). This is my second by him (Wild Sheep Chase was the other). This has a much higher speculative fiction feel to it. This isn't a bad thing.The main character's battle within himself of whether to play life safe or not is told in alternating chapters each taking a side. The characters are very exaggerated and quite funny. I've always liked librarians but have never met one like this.Murakami has been added to my \\"must buy authors\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Strange, and Delightful!","review":"I felt that I didn't read this book so much as I \\"watched\\" it. Like a movie or a fantastic dream, and written with Mr. Murakami's usual finesse. Believable characters, and indeed, a hard-as-nails world at the last train-stop of the universe. A world within a world, it echoes \\"A Wild Sheep Chase,\\" but expounds upon this in a delightful way. Yet again, Haruki Murakami proves that there are still original writers out there with style, imagination, and the talent to pull it off. Fabulously done! Subarashii! Rippa! Oishikatta"},{"rating":"2","title":"The epic high fantasy saga of a reluctant hero","review":"M. L. Rigdon's Prophecy Denied (Book One in the \\"Seasons of Time\\" trilogy) is the epic high fantasy saga of a reluctant hero and the high priestess he is fated to marry. Together, they must combine forces to uncover past secrets and save their nation. A high-spirited and thoroughly entertaining tale of two people's journey and a nation's a quest to survive, Prophecy Denied is especially recommended for fantasy fans and genre enthusiasts who will look forward to the next to volumes in this planned trilogy: Beyond The Dark Mountains and Quest For The Lance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written","review":"Rigdon presents a mesmerizing and original style of writing. The relationships of her central characters are fascinating. However, the story lacks complexity and momentum. Regardless, the dialogue is a work of art and I hope other authors will follow Rigdon's revolutionary style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre fantasy novel","review":"The plot was interesting, but the novel was hampered by the lack of character and world building. Both the protagonists and antagonists are flat and simplistic.Seems like a good story idea that was rushed to conclusion to allow for a multi-generational trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, realistic characters in a fantasy novel","review":"Ladnor of Sha has no desire to become Lord Protector. He refuses to join himself with Omirr's High Priestess to save their land. He doesn't believe in prophecies. He believes in determination and hard work. But Fate doesn't consider his wishes. His destiny is preordained. And that's why I like him. A reluctant hero gets me every time. The High Priestess is no slouch either. Both characters ring true and complex. As in most good fantasy novels, they're pitted against staggering odds--a province that's grown self-indulgent, an enemy who undermines religion and kills heirs to wrest power for himself, and a portent of the Dawn That Bleeds. The land of Omirr is on the brink of disaster, but what a land! Full of chargers who can kill with a single, savage slash, harpies, and fflorin--it's a world filled with wonder, and I loved turning pages, exploring its joys and dangers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"A good book. No grammar, spelling, formatting, or other mistakes. Well written. I often skim books for plot, but the descriptions in this book drew me in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yet","review":"All of Phil's cd's are wonderful, but this is his best by far.

Every time I listen to it, I have a new favorite song. I guess this speaks to the fact that there is something for everyone... (and everyone's mood) In typical Phil fashion he captures us with songs (and stories) that we can all identify with in some way. A nostalgic look back, an optimistic look forward, a soulful look inside. I highly recommend this CD - - and taking in a live performance if he's in your area! The inclusion of his band in the recording of this CD \\"brings it all home\\" for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was crazy!","review":"This is the first book of his I've read. I just got it because I'd heard so much about him.So it's amazing, the way he can make you feel that you are there, on an exotic vacation.But all it is, is drinking and sex! First they have a drink, then they have sex, then they drink somemore, get a haircut, have sex, drink, go swimming, drink, have sex. PLEASE.Well it is David and Catherine's honeymoon. But still! I don't think it was worth me reading... though I think he is a great author, the subject of the book was implausible and silly. You go on your honeymoon and end up falling in love and having sex with another woman? and your wife does too? crazy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"This book can make you hate Hemingway. Imagine being trapped on a vacation with two young lovebirds. That's all it is. I really wished I hadn't read it. Imagine Farewell to Arms if it only consisted of the love affair parts between him and the nurse. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dull book","review":"I am not much of a reviewer, but I thought this book deserved more than one person writing a one-star review. I agree with the other one-star reviewer who titled their review \\"3 moronic people eat, drink, swim and make love\\" -- except I would change it to \\"3 moronic people eat, drink, swim, make love, and get their hair cut\\". Perhaps it is worthwhile to read if you are terribly interested in literature or want to read all of Hemingway's stuff. After reading it, I believe that there was a good reason why Hemingway did not have it published while he was alive. Good luck if you are reading this book or have to read it for a course."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Garden of Eden? Hmmmm......","review":"This book starts out great, it romantisizes Europes beachs and 'charming' towns. The main characters are nice and everything is perfect. Then, the book decends into perversion and drinking/sex/drinking/sex and somewhere comes a side story about an elephant hunt. It's an ok read but not for younger readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should You Or Shouldn't You Read It","review":"Yes, you should. It is strange and it is racy and the safari stuff does not really fit but this is a great book. It is closest to The Sun Also Rises and if he had written 100 books about people who just seemed to hang around I would have read them all.Also, do not be scared off because it says \\"unfinished work\\". The ending works perfectly as is.4 1/2 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, engaging, but little lasting impact.","review":"The first posthumously published book I've read of Hemingway, it was an interesting side of him to read. Just a little naughty, without the slightest hint of perversity, Hemingway tackles this complicated situation with skill and precision. It's not the story of a swinger. It's the story of a regular guy trying to make sense of the unusual situation he has become entangled in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great departure that works brilliantly","review":"For those that are familiar with Hemingway and his work and who have not read \\"The Garden of Eden,\\" I think you will find the novel to be a significant departure from Hem's normal fare - and a refreshing one. Although strongly similar in style and form, the novel tackles issues of male and female relationships and sexuality head on, in a way that one typically does not see in Hem. Here, however, instead of blinking at the bright light of sexual relations, Hemingway stares straight at it and courageously exorcises some personal hang ups about the dangers of loving someone too much. I heartily reccomend this novel for a new look at Hemingway and his views on women and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garden of Eden","review":"This is Hemingway's worst book. It's hard to know if he was going for the \\"titillation factor\\" or if he was simply this jaded, cynical and without compassion. If \\"three ways\\" thrill you, this is your Hemingway book; otherwise, it simply illustrates how superficial and careless he could be -- and his writing in this one is pitiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 moronic people eat, drink, swim and make love","review":"Without ANY question, the most senseless and idiotic book I have ever read in my entire life..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamond in the rough","review":"I loved it. That said, I understand why it is in some sense unfinished - by which I mean 'not polished,' instead of incomplete. The story is fantastic and the characters some of the best Hemingway ever created. Perhaps the most enjoyable is the meta-writing: his writing on writing through the main character, who is forced to confront that many of his ideas about what he is doing and how it is to be done are too rigid - perhaps even totally wrong. Then again, the steamy affair and brutal exchanges leading to the climax ... masterful. None of his other books got me as hot or as emotionally involved as this one. Another 15 years and this might have been the best thing he ever wrote. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your heart goes wild, mad and broken.","review":"The best of the best.

Get a suntan and let life go"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hemingway lived longer than I thought","review":"This posthumous work might be my favorite. After not having read much of him in several years, this title was suggested to me by a friend as a hidden gem. Well, maybe not well hidden, but it was a work released without Hemingway's knowledge after his death and I tended to avoid those. What a terrible mistake! At once his most sensual and disturbing tale, Garden of Eden is a descent into madness and loss that leaves the reader on much shakier ground than much of his other macho corpus. It's a tale that will long haunt me and perhaps even drive me to read some of the other works that I've passed over. Why isn't this a terrific film yet?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Textual Feast","review":"Hemingway has long been known as a master of the English language and perhaps the greatest literary mind of the twentieth century, but with The Garden of Eden he moves into a new realm. With Hemingway's other works he tackles the masculine subjects many associate with him, in The Garden of Eden Hemingway brings to an erotic novel the same passion he brings to his other works. What he does for fishing, African safaris, and bull-fighting in his other works he does for fine foods, wines and living. This work is truly a textual masterpiece that needs not to be devoured, but instead like a fine meal or an aged wine needs to be savoured and deeply appreciated"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe his best","review":"I've read lots of Hemingway and this is the only one I've read more than twice. This may be his best book other than the simple, succinct beauty of the old man in the sea. The dialogue in this book is fun, naughty, deviant. There are more to the lines than the surface, as in most hemingway. A lot of psychological things are going on. This book provides a glimpse into the internal world of hemingway as he deals with women, his father, his writing, his drinking, his style. It allows you to sort of understand how certain things effected him, most notably: His father's suicide, his first wife losing a briefcase of his short stories on a train, and his mother dressing him up as a girl until he was 6. Hemingway was tough, but in this book, you see that he was also tender and very, very psychological. One of the great short reads of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sensual and frightening view of the Bourne's honeymoon","review":"This novel was intriguing, frightening and one of the most sensual books that I have ever read. The book could also be catagorized as a suspense novel, as this emotionally flawed and physically beautiful couple were so volatile and daring. I felt as if Hemmingway had allowed his Katherine of \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" to come back to life and live without rules or mortality. The tragedy of this relationship haunted me during the reading and for weeks after."},{"rating":"2","title":"dark, exciting","review":"Hemingway has to be the best at making the worst of a good situation. If you like his straighforward style, macho excursions, and dreary endings like I do, then this is the book for you. His characters lead you to a wider variety of emotions, from lust to pity to hate, than any other author's. This is a wonderful book, very honest about relationships and their faults. Be prepared to feel cynical for a while after reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"First 100 pages are worth reading, may skip the rest","review":"It looks like the second half of the book is compiled by far less skillful writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Installed on our company billboard...

The system was installed at great expense. The birds flutter away every time the audio option comes on, but fly right back down once it shuts up. I don't see any discernable results from the ultrasonic component. The product has reduced bird numbers by maybe 15% to 25%.

Unfortunately the land is already claimed by ants, giant ants, and they have a plan! The acting is typical '70s, the plot is actually fairly good (based on an H.G.

The evolution of this uniquely American form of motorcycle is presented, of course, tracing the American custom from its bobber roots through the elaborate showbikes popular today. But this terrific book also follows the evolution of the culture that spawned these oddly beautiful machines, from the dry-lakes racers who built the original bobbers to the \\"Easyrider\\" era long bikes that defined the hippie generation to the celebrity builders of today, people like Jesse James and Billy Lane.

My only complaint is, frankly, it does not have the room to cover a two-thousand year history of warring factions covering most of Europe at one point. It only devotes one chapter to the Gaulish and Iberian Celts who defied Rome. It mostly focuses on the Irish and Scots, telling the heroic stories of the Battles of Bannockburn, Clontarf, and Flodden, where the Irish and Scots opposed Viking and English foes, and often triumphed.

To our surpise, the pieces fit together so poorly that we could put a single piece in several places.After a failed attempt to assemble the border, we decided that maybe we could do this one from the inside out. Naturally, we failed at this as well as we found that all the pieces fit together too poorly to assemble the puzzle and maintain our sanity.The puzzle truly is beautiful and the poster included within is really nice; but in my mind they really cut corners on the quality of the puzzle cut making it unassembleable.I wouldn't recommend buying this puzzle unless you have saint-like patience or you are glutton for punishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to women; read it to lower your IQ","review":"I'd give it a negative number rating if I could.

This storyline was such a disappointment. While the author acknowledges that she hasn't experienced infertility, I felt she should have done more research into the actual medicine (i.e., one doesn't just do ICSI standalone, as she suggests). And of course, even here the infertile couple ends up with a happy ending (unlike real life).I felt this book was an insult to couples experiencing infertility.I put this book down with a sour taste in my mouth and a vow to not read any more of this author's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"The story is pretty good.

You have couple who wants to have a child for both the right and wrong reasons and the curiousity of one woman's pregnancy that makes the husbands in the community the primes suspects.

Granted, you can't be that wonderful of a writer when you spit out 60 books in 20 years. Hell, it probably took me longer to read it (1 day) than it took for her to write it.

They are thick, warm, but lack the softness of egyptian cotton and feel almost heavy like twill (soft twill, mind you), but they don't feel anything like my previous sets of egyptian cotton sheets I paid more money for.

Midler is very unattractive by today's standards and the plot here, such as it is, is very standard fare. Modeled on the Janis Joplin story, it completely misses the mark, and the music isn't even close to anything Joplin herself did. Interesting as a period piece that has not held up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Janis knock off flops without the right information","review":"Miss Midler stared in this movie, The Rose, which is some sort of Janis Joplin-like video about a star overwhelmed by stardom. This might be a good storyline and plot, but they had very much of the information wrong. Janis was not overwhelmed, she loved being adored by america. She wasn't a pathetic teen who didn't know life.

The remedy of a life of such pain ... the fame and fortune ... alleviated Janis' suffering .... but did not completley eradicate it. Midler's performance is incredible and the Oscar-nomination was very well deserved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaving off one star due to the directores missteps","review":"Pure, powerful, raw, intense and unforgettable. This movie really is all those. Bette Midler took a role that legally had to change it's main characterization and managed to give that years best (yes, even over Sally Field) performance. She is thee reason to watch and though the time period should have been more defined it still gives a sense of how music was changing to the corporate [stuff] we now have before us."},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged","review":"when i orederd this, it was for my mother in law, did not say is was damaged and in bad shape,"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A SIMPLE MAN\\"","review":"Simple maybe...but not stupid. Why did I say that? Because I am so tired of these reviews by people who can't seem to simply enjoy a movie. This movie was what established me as a fan of Bette Midler. I felt that her performance was genuine and heartfelt.You can feel the lonliness and lost feeling a rock performer might have when on the road. However, you also enjoy the passion she exudes when on-stage. These feelings are what pull at you. I also loved the brassy way she has of telling people to *#@^>-off! SO... this simple man would suggest that you sit back and enjoy this one, it's worth your time(and money)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all because of Bette","review":"If it wasn't for Bette Midler's honest, take no prisoners performance of the Janis Joplin-like Rose, this movie would most likely be receiving 2 stars at best. The film is overlong, drags between climactic scenes, and is otherwise a subject that comes across as been there, done that.However, Bette Midler is this film's saving grace, not only with her first rate concert performances (the soundtrack is even more essential than this film), but with the depth she gave to a typically one-dimensional stock character. Rose's slow dissent into drug addiction and self-destruction is not easy to watch, but comes across as very raw and realistic. Midler received an oscar nomination for this performance, and anyone who watches can see why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bette Lifts the Movie and the Music","review":"I first saw The Rose when it came out way back in the late 1970's. I loved it then, and its nice to watch it now and see it has stood the test of time. A young Bette takes this movie andRUNS with it, displaying a GREAT rock and blues SOUND. The best song WAS and is the title song, however. I don't think anyone else could have done the songs as WELL or played the Rose...If you love Bette, then you'll love this movie. It'sa fine additon to any movie collection.My only criticism, is the songs beyond the title song...Not that memorable and not good rock , but Bette's performanace lifts the wholemovie...

Some people complain of having a corkscrew as opposed to a phillips screwdriver, but you can use one of the blades to fit a screw (flat or phillips). Also, the corkscrew can probably be used in more ways than a screwdriver IMO. I like the matte finish as opposed to the shiny plastic finish.

There seems to be quite a bit of innuendo and colloquialism, and the subtitling is extremely literal. I seriously doubt the woman who subtitled the movie speaks any English.The story itself is confusing. We're not sure whether Andrei's is gay or not, or whether he's even having issues with his sexuality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take me out from the ball game","review":"If you like psychologically driven movies, then this is the movie for you! Bret Packard terrifed me. He is intelligent, handsome and possesses the evil of that which is at its best, darkly subhuman. Unfortunately though on most levels one can identify and see the falling-from-grace aspect that this character continously and willing accepts and projects upon the ill-fated participants in his life. For Bret Packard life is truly only a game and for the rest, life becomes a living hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"the people that created this & any other stupid tipes of horror movies have to get there heads exemond or maybe even operated on !"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting and original","review":"I loved the whole series by Stan Best.

The talent of Leigh and Rains are wasted on this thing. At the start of the film when Leigh meets Caesar Leigh plays the role of Cleopatra as a whimsical/foolish/giddy girl. Outrageous. Good costumes for a period piece but when compared to the Claudette Colbert or Elizabeth Taylor verions this is a disgrace. Don't bother...you have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitly a disappointment","review":"I just recently became a Vivien Leigh fan after seeing her in great films. I picked this up at my public library, looking foward to see her again. When I put into my VCR and when this movie appeared at the screen, I must say I was terribly disappointed. Nothing like GWTW or Waterloo Bridge. Her version of Cleopatra was ofial. And Claude Rains also gave me a bad impression, since it was the first time I had ever seen him on screen. I fell asleep half way through the movie, and when I woke up, I intended to fall back asleep. It was a horrible waste to my Saturday evening. But you can't be totally harsh because Vivien Leigh was going through some tough times during the making of the movie. But i'd recommended Waterloo Bridge, or GWTW, or any other Vivien Leigh film, but not CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivien is stunning!","review":"This movie is pretty cool but Vivien makes it marvelous!

I would like this movie for my DVD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maltin got this one wrong","review":"This is a fine rendition of the delightful Shaw play. A little rough around the edges when it comes to the supporting cast, but very enjoyable. Shaw's Caesar is a man of self-doubt and good humor, a vivid counterpoint to the haughty, aristocratic Caesar of Shakespeare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaw play","review":"The only way to enjoy this film is to think of it as a George Bernard Shaw play, which is what it is. It's wholly unrealistic and ahistorical. It's also quite boring at times. Leigh reminds one of Judy Garland in The Pirate two years later--going under, plagued by her demons, and overacting shamelessly. Rains is fine, as long as you think of Caesar as 5 foot three inches and wandering the desert alone, spouting often hammy lines. If you like the play, you'll no doubt appreciate the film. For most people, this is something to avoid. The Koreans, by the way, would do well to learn how to spell the actors' names and place them in the appropriate place on the box. The Korean subtitles can be turned off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain silly","review":"I had recently read a biography on Vivien Leigh which sparked my interest in seeing her work other than That Hamilton Woman and Gone With The Wind. I found the whole movie and the acting to be silly, cheezy, boring and can't for the life of me imagine Cleopatra being that silly little girl.Here's a movie I'm glad someone had the sense to remake, Now Elizabeth Taylor, there's a Cleopatra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essentially useless, but excrutiatingly enjoyable anyway","review":"This series of books (Big, Bigger, and Biggest Secrets) is a celebration of all things wonderfully useless.Do you need to know where Walt Disney is buried?

No again, but it'll change the way you think about the Happiest Place on Earth.I was in utter delight when Bigger Secrets came out, and I was overjoyed to find Biggest Secrets.

I went over this book during the holidays last week and ended up skipping a lot of unappealing chapters. Don't get we wrong for I have set low expectations. But it fell short anyway.

Don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Secrets\\" nobody cares about","review":"Poundstone's previous books are interesting, but this reads like a collection of out-takes. Who cares about Joan Collins' REAL birthdate? Antiquated, anal-retentive, non-applicable material; the only practical entry (all of 3 pages) is the entry about Lottery tickets and how they work. Should have been a cultural survival manual, but it's mainly nonsense. I wish the author would dig for more significant material; a stale twinkie."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok reading, but the first 2 were much better","review":"Its nice to see a more up to date edition in the Big Secrets series, but the latest one is not nearly as enjoyable as the earlier ones.

There IS a conspiracy out there, people, and books like William Poundstone's \\"Biggest Secrets\\" blow chunks all over the conspiracy. The world is ours to know!

I didn't think so, but this book tells you anyway. From the stuff you don't care about knowing, to the stuff that you probably already know, this one's got it all, which isn't much. A terrible read. Do me a favor, pick up a book like \\"One Flew Over The Cookoo's Nest\\" by Ken Keasy, or \\"The Choking Doberman and Other 'New' Urban Legends\\" by Jan Harold Brunvard (Both available here), you'll have a much better time with them.

It was Lindsay Anderson's feature debut and one of his better films. This Criterion DVD is as ever informed and packed with extra material, justifying the high price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undoubted masterpiece of a great period","review":"I have loved the great British films of the '60s about the underclass, and This Sporting Life is a masterpiece that any cinema lover who does not know it has to see; it will be indelible. It's a powerful film from that period and Rachel Roberts puts in one of the great performances of the era. In this regard I might mention that \\"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\\" is my personal favorite, and what ever became of Tony Richardson's \\"ATaste of Honey?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Special 2 Disk Set a Stellar Surprise!","review":"This is one of my favorite films, so I excitedly added this Criterion Collection version to my shopping cart without even paying much attention to the complete item description.

I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd edition better than the first!","review":"The first edition was revolutionary but the 2nd takes it to a whole new level. This booklet has been totally revamped. More Calming Signals are explained/explored and with full color photos too. This is a must have for every dog owner and at a great affordable price. Dog trainers should be handing these out to their clients so that more people can understand what their dogs are communicating with them and other dogs.So even if you already have a copy of the first edition, you're going to want this one too! It's better!It will be great to 'talk' with Turid about this new edition when she joins us for another one of her whirlwind visits at YahooGroup CSDogBookReview April 18-21, 2006.If you thought you'd like Brenda Aloff's Canine Body Language but the $39 price tag was scaring you, get this booklet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've recommended to all my friends.","review":"We had been fostering a Pit Bull rescue dog (Otis) who just couldn't seem to fit in with our three family dogs.

Once we understood the signals, we realized we needed to back away and let the dogs \\"norm.\\" It was remarkable. We now have four family dogs who are all best friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turid Sees into the Dog Heart and Mind","review":"I love On Talking Terms with Dogs: Calming Signals. I believe it is one of the best books I have ever read about dogs. Turid Rugass has closely observed dogs and seen their intelligence, and warm caring spirits. She has described her insights in a way that is easy for others to understand and implement with their own dogs. I have had a variety of dogs for the last 20 years, and I found her book to take my understanding of dogs to a whole other level. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to communicate more effectively with dogs, and treat them with kindness, respect and dignity."},{"rating":"2","title":"It opened my eyes to a whole new world","review":"This little book (and an accompanying video) opened my eyes to a new world (for me!!) I knew little of dog body language at the time, and most of what I had been told was erroneous. I use the \\"calming signals\\" knowledge routinely with my dogs, particularly because my Airedale, Border Terrier, and Blue Heeler live inside with me and can really cause chaos. I have learned to read what the dogs are saying to each other and to me. And it has motivated me to both read and study dog behavior -- a fascinating subject. This was the beginning of a better dog trainer and most importantly a much better dog owner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read","review":"There is some good information on dog behavior in this book but the book is very difficult to follow. I have read the Monks' of New Skeet books and German Shepherds Dogs for Dummies. I have read these books more than once and continually refer back to them for training information. I put the Turid Rugraas' book down after reading a few chapters and I doubt I will finish reading it. There are much better books on dog training that are easy to understand and enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarifying, easy and nice reading","review":"This quite short book is - despite its few chapters - very clarifying! With a clear language, lot of examples and a way to describe that makes you recognize the situations she describes you not only read the book quite fast - you also incorporate the ideas into your own understanding of the dogs around you!The only thing you don't like when you read the book is that you get ashamed of how you have misunderstood dogs during your life and thereby treated them in the wrong way!I recommend this book to everyone that have dogs in their family, that have met dogs earlier in life and all those that intend to meet dogs in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On Talking Terms With Dogs: Calming Signals","review":"I loved this book! I've read a number of dog books and this is one of the best I've encountered! This book really helped me understand dog body language which in turn helps with communication between dogs and people.

I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Calming Signals","review":"I play Agility with my Shelties and my trainer recommended this book for one of my dogs who is a bit \\"fearful\\" -- the book is amazing - with lots of color pictures capturing what the author is describing/talking about in regards to the signals dogs send out to humams and other animals, as well as their canine friends.

She is an alpha female, and badly in need of some coping skills. This small manual was well worth the price...don't let the brevity fool you. The author knows what she is talking about, and with some practice I was able to put these principles into practice and calm this dog considerably. It seems that the key to much of this is the ability to interprete the stress signals as they begin to arise in the dog. There are definate signs to watch for, and once you observe closely, you will see them as I did, and intervene before things escalate. Highly recommended from someone who used these techniques.Also take a look at her DVD,Calming Signals: What Your Dog Tells Youwhich I found highly useful in recognizing the body language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I found the information of body language to be interesting, but limited.

It helps me be a better, more understanding friend to my dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it, read it. Sure glad I bought others.","review":"Not a bad 37 page pamphlet as far as it goes . . . which is not very far. It came in a shipment of four books on the topic of dog to human communication, all about the same price. It has proven to be the least helpful by far. Dog Language by Abrantes is much more complete, is over two hundred and fifty pages with a seven page bibliography (vs. a ten item listing in this one.) This book thoroughly covers one word of the dogs vocabulary with dozens of variations. The anecdotal information is interesting but I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what do we do without an already calm dog to teach our dogs?","review":"I was hoping for more real world application than just \\"look away\\" or \\"poke at the ground\\" or \\"yawn.\\" When my dog is staring down another dog the last thing she notices is me looking away or yawning. The only thing applicable was getting in between the two dogs to try to calm them.Every section of the book described how she used her already calm and communicative dog to rehabilitate other dogs. What do us readers without one of those do?? The book description should include a \\"All methods require a calm and dog friendly dog to be effective.\\" I was hoping for advice and instructions on how to calm a dog not stories on how her dog has calmed other dogs. Those stories don't help in any way whatsoever.Also I wasn't thrilled about the 11 pages at the end of the book of advertisements and blank pages considering the entire book is only 85 pages with huge margins and half of it pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog training","review":"Definitely not worth the money. It is a book that is beyond the basic dog training world. The title is very misleading. The author's interpretation of calming signals is somewhat helpful but not for the beginner. I found many dogs especially my own, yawn for other reasons than just trying to calm situations around them. It is not very precise and confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"Quality a bit dated an while interesting enough, not much to it.

I was just not that impressed with this book and found the advise to be a bit vague; I would recommend reading any book by Patricia McConnell before this one.On a side note the author (and editor in not catching this) really irked me with her inability to spell the word losing correctly, it was mispelled at least 2x's; the correct spelling of losing is NOT \\"loosing\\" and loose and lose do NOT mean the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Talking Terms with Dogs: Calming Signals","review":"The subject matter was interesting however it was more like a pamphlet than a book, but it had a book price!

My dog ignores my yawning, licking, blinking and looking to the side. I guess if a strange dog attacks me I know to sit down with my back to it (yeah, sure). I'd love to attend her classes but this book is NOT worth owning. Borrow it and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than I expected","review":"The material was presented in an anecdotal style. It was not presented in a manner that evidenced a unifying underlying understanding of behavior. I did find pieces of the book to be helpful, and I have no doubt that the author has extensive experience and great skill working with dogs. However the information was presented in what seemed like a piecemeal fashion and did not have evidence based or objective material to support the authors own opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try a video instead","review":"From recognitions the author has received and positive reviews here--I bought the e-book.

I believe that this book belongs on any dog owners book shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"30?","review":"The signals are interesting and the pictures illustrate the behaviors well, but the book as a whole is poorly organized and provides very little context. The sections just seem to bump into one another. Almost all of the signals are described as having the same effect or purpose. To be fair I suppose that's the point of the book: calming. But really that's just too thin a topic without going into more detail on each behavior. There must be some difference between licking and curving, for example. What is it? I believe she also claims there are 30 signals, but only discusses about 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good insights","review":"Although I have not witnessed all of the behaviors mentioned in this book (working at a doggie daycare, I see a lot!), it is nonethless full of useful cues to what your dog is saying with his/her most important form of communication: body language.

After having dogs all my adult life I adopted a very traumatized rescue golden retriever. Because my dog had been an abused, starved, caged \\"puppy mill\\" mother for many years, she was frightened of everything and very concerned that I might harm her.This book helped me to see really clearly how my dog was feeling (by watching for \\"calming signals\\"), and it helped me to know exactly how I could help her feel more safe. Today my rescued golden is a happy, loving, and well-adjusted dog.Turid Rugaas is a kind, wise woman who loves and understands dogs. You will really enjoy her book. It is succinct, readable, and easily understood-- a real gem. There is also a nice DVD with the same title."},{"rating":"1","title":"More photos than text","review":"I suspect many buyers of this book may be intrigued by the words \\"calming signals\\" and purchase it with the hope it will contain some helpful advice for agressive dogs. If that's you -- don't waste your money on this. The information it contains could be summarized in a paragraph, and if you deleted all the photos in this little booklet, frankly, that's all that would be left. This will be the last book I will purchase online without having viewed a hard copy at a book store first to make sure it's worth it. I can't imagine anyone buying this book, given an opportunity to scan it first and realize that there's nothing there. There are a few tidbits from observing dog body language, but nothing of consequence to help dog owners with challenges.

I have to admit that I agree with most of the signals that the author wrote but already known the meaning.I think it as well has a okay part about puppy training but does not go deep enough. t states be nice and positive which is good. It not good to punishal physical with a puppy. That is right as well. The puppy should be reward for correct behavior.The issue that is should mention the puppy should be socialized in new places while watching the puppies communication.If you known dogs well and understand them, a bad book but if your someone novice probably a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

This film is another great example of a smart and savvy film. Tom Green co-wrote this flick, which is just soaked with intelligent humor and wit, whether it be the thought-provoking scenes like the one where Mr. Green chews through an umbilical cord..or where he licks his friends' compound fracture. This flick has a lot of serious moments, as well. One of the most dramatic scenes in this film is when his dad shoves Tom's artwork ..., and then orders him to pleasure him.So if you are in need of a thought-provoking flick, please pre-order \\"Freddy Got Fingered\\"....you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Horror! The Horror!","review":"Well, I had to succumb. I was attracted to this alleged film by it's notoriety as possibly the worst film ever made and a few of my friends who told me it was not that bad. My low expectations for it were not only met but were exceeded. This film reaches new cinematic depths. It's complete ineptitude lacks even the charm of \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space.\\" It's stabs at humor are beyond pathetic they're just desperate. Tom Green has to rank as the most unappealing screen presence, ever! I felt sorry momentarily for accomplished actors like Rip Torn and Julie Hagerty who signed onto this dross but, hey, they cashed the checks. Watching a few minutes of this slop is painful. Enduring the full length of the film is outright masochistic.

The funniest thing was probably the animated Zebra guy's song and dance routine, which would have been a lot more enjoyable, if I hadn't been so thoroughly annoyed with the rest of the movie which alternated between being boring and really, really disgusting.

For people who are looking for smart clever humor never see this. But if you want to see a bunch of random things that make you laugh out loud without thinking this is the movie for you. Tom Green didn't really expect it too even be released or get what he did in that movie passed the ratings people.

There is so much blood all over the place and if spinning a new born baby around by its umbilical cord covering her mother's face with blood is comedy, then Freddy Krueger's movies must be comedies too. Moreover, Tom cuts the umbilical cord with his teeth. There is so much idiocity in the movie like the scene of the elephant's eyaculation over Tom's father or the one in which Green cuts the stomach of a deer and covers himself with the deer's open body.

Yet, when all put together, I got no enjoyment from it and got dirty chills up my spine watching Tom Green pleasure a horse. I went to see this because I got a kick in the previews as Tom played the piano with the sausage contraption, but I couldn't even watch it long enough to get to that part. There is a great scene from a Family Guy episode where Tom Green is under a cow in a ballerina outfit, sucking on the cow's utter. He says something like \\"Do you like me yet?

It's got the ending where they realize their dreams and he rents a helicopter to tell his girlfriend he loves her and gives her a bag of jewels (which are obviously made of plastic). On one hand it's saying \\"look, movies like this are just really stupid.\\" And then at the same time it goes way over the top into insane stupidity. The kind of movie where a scene will just start with Tom Green sitting in a living room playing a keyboard with sausages tied to ropes that are connected to a pully attached to his fingers so that when he plays the sausages bounce around in mid air. You might find that obnoxious or funny. I think you would really have to see the movie to know for yourself. So, I wouldn't really recommend buying it first.

The best part was the 3 min PG version which was much easier to watch and had all of movie. Rip Torn is a good actor but every actor has to have the job they got wrangled into. Like Jeremy Irons in D&D. This even beat out Little Nicky for just plain stupidity without a point. The point of this movie as far as anyone could tell was Tom Green had father issues and had to work them out. It's to bad he couldn't do it in private therapy like everyone else.

I found this movie completely void of humor. I'm not really sure what the movie studio was thinking shelling out money for this tripe, other than trying to capitalize of Tom Green's fifteen minutes before it was up. There are so many things wrong with this movie, that if I were to try and mention them all I'd be here all night, and I just don't have that time. But I'll hit the big point on why this movie is so bad while I'm here. First off, it's not funny. I don't know why Mr. Green would think that people would get a kick out him crawling around in deerskin after he gutted it himself. I suppose there are people out there that like that sort of thing...

They did. And they did it sadly. This movie was just dumb. No plot, no characters that are worth remembering, no funny one-liners, no story, and especially no laughs. Tom Green will only ne funny if he is in a movie that has other funny people, such as Road Trip which was hilarious. But \\"Freddy Got Fingered\\" just proves that Tom can't do a comedy by himself.\\"Freddy Got Fingered\\" runs for about 90 minutes. It is rated R for strong and explicit sexual humor throughout and strong language."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will Tom Green get sick of being a disgusting idiot?","review":"Tom Green needs to grow up.

Sometimes it is, but not in this case. Get a life, Tom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This What America Media Has Come To?","review":"Is this really what our media is coming to? I can't imagine a movie more terrible than this one. People say that it's funny. It's not. It's perverted, to the extreme. The acting is bad, the storyline simple. What this guy does is absolutely gut wrenching. I have no idea how warped a person's sense of humor needs to be before they think swinging a baby by the umbilical cord in a hospital room is funny. I personally don't laugh at being offended. Granted, the movie does do what it was meant to accomplish. It will offend you. You will be blasted with profanity throughout the entire movie and with a relentless fear of how bad the next scene will be. Designed to attract teens, it does so, but the message it teaches is so wrong (in anyone's viewpoint, really) that it even pushes most of them away.If you laugh at offense, you'd better bring Kleenex to wipe away the tears.

Tom Green isn't offensive or edgy, he's dull. I guarantee you'll be sorry you watched this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?!?","review":"I like Tom Green. His off-the-wall sense of humor is definitely something that I can appreciate on a twisted, wierd, slapsticky kind of way. But, when I saw this movie, all I can think of through the first half and hour of this film is that, \\"He's trying too hard to be funny.\\" The first time I saw this movie, I could only stomach an hour of it. So, just to be fair, I watched it again. I had no change of heart. I think that this movie tried to push the envelope of being raunchy and humorous and lost a lot. It was a half-baked plot with below average acting. This was one of those movies that if you watched it, afterwards you would probably say something like \\"I knew I should've bought Solo or Amadeus or something like that.

I only laugh cause when I think about people who have no Idea what its about and see it for the first time I just wish I could be there to see their reactions. Shock is the standard here for sure. Laughter is uncontrollable unless you are uptight and can't laugh at anything taboo. Taboo is also the standard here. DO NOT SHOW THIS FILM TO YOUR CHURCH GROUP!!! Rip Torn is an incredible actor who delivers even in a film that I'm sure is banned from a lot of places. If you are offended by.............well just about anything, don't watch this movie.

It's basically an hour and a half of Tom Green running around screaming and generally acting like a complete retard. Between whacking off a horse and an elephant as if it was his lifelong dream to do so and getting inside a dead deer in the worst way possible, this movie will actually make you dumber by watching it.

Or when he went across Puget Sound. But this movie is really disgusting and terrible. Usually I like sick humor but this wasnt humor because I didnt feel it was original. I know I'm a nerd, but I do know a good movie when I see one. Like Election take for example. Their was sick things in that movie, but the begginning and towards the end were fantastic.

Watch it once before you die but if you watch it twice then you are going to hell. It really is terrible. Everything about it is abysmal. It is so limitless in its murky depths of a sick Tom Green world that it earns itself the five star treatment. There Tom you got it - now go away forever and never do anything like this again please.

Also, the plot of this film, what little there is, is surprisingly old fashioned and traditional: Green's character, Gord, just wants to grow up, get a life, and impress his father (Rip Torn, who is also hilarious). What is likely to get in the way for many viewers is Green's absolutely bizarre sense of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freddy ain't funny","review":"People are surprised when I tell them how much of a fan I am of Tom Green. I know that as bizarre as he acts, intelligence and wit lurks in the shadows. It is sometimes seen on his MTV television show, but not even close when it comes to Freddy Got Fingered. This flick lacks the candid-ness of the t.v show. The jokes are mostly stupid and solely in the film for shock value. Most of you will say, \\"Well, all that Tom Green is, is shock value\\". And feel that way if you must, but this time around,if it ever does, it doesn't work, and neither does the pathetic subplot or B rated star cameos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny hogwash!","review":"I cannot belive i rented this movie!

It even comes free with a lame cameo appearance by Drew Barrymore. Not that I dislike her, it's just everything about this movie is lame. One unfunny prank after the next consisting of NO plot and bad seemingly unscripted dialogue. Such as.. \\"My ear just popped.\\" ~ \\"I think I heard it.\\" Summing things up, it's kinda like Jackass \\"the movie\\" gone wrong. I saw Tom Green host \\"The Tonite show\\" for Dave Letterman.

Plain and simple, this is the most ignorant thing I have ever seen in my life. You will have wasted an hour and a half of your life by viewing this. Honestly, this movie was so stupid, people were walking out of the theater within 20 minutes. The movie is suppose to be twisted and shocking, but it is stale, dull, and embarrassing to behold this idiot skate boarding through a mall trying to escape mall police. I guess it is suppose to be funny when people call eachother \\"retards\\" constantly for the sake of a laugh. Tom Green's 15 minutes of fame are long over, and he is too old to be acting this way anymore. It is embarrassing to behold. This movie is better off forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"fingered","review":"This movie is fricken great.Very funny. I don't get why people get so anal about these kind of films.

I think Tom Green has mastered this skill well; that is, making terrible movies.I was going to make this longer, but I don't think I really need to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever.","review":"I have watched many, many movies, and I would classify a good number of those that I've watched as bad movies. But this is without a doubt the worst that I've ever seen. It was actually an exercise in willpower to make it through the entire thing, but once I started I felt a morbid urge to prove to myself just how much I could take. The material that Tom Green attempts to pawn off as humor in this piece of tripe is so obscene that it makes dead baby jokes look like the pinnacle of good taste. However, if you enjoy an invigorating swim through raw sewage, than by all means dive right in. I only regret that the rating scale doesn't extend below zero, as this one definitely deserves a negative rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"horribly horrible","review":"Tom Green shouldnt of done this movie..it was plain horrible and the scenes where hes flinging the baby aroung and wearing dead dear skin and playing with sasauges cant help this crappy...stinky and dumbassed movie...though the beginning where he skateboards is the best part...because hes good at it...not acting...is junk..save your money people"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please give me back my two hours I wasted...","review":"This has got to be the worst movie the comes to recent memory.

I'm lucky I only rented this movie..and I'm even luckier I didn't have to pay for this junk. I wouldn't be surprised if people were flocking back to local stores for refunds. If you're reading this and haven't seen the movie yet, consider yourself one of the lucky ones. I still like Tom Green...but this movie would've been better off having never been made.

You may like tom green in his mtv show, he is fun sometimes, and seems to have endless new ideas... on mtv. But THIS MOVIE IS A TOTAL DISASTER! It is not only cruel, rude and stupid.

I mean, he cuts the cord of a women's new born baby by BITING IT WITH HIS TEETH, then swings it around and blood flys everywhere in the room! And he masturbates a horse... yes, he masturbates a horse. And it brilliantly ends with a kid get cut apart in the propellar of a airplane.

What a huge mistake. Literally 5 minutes into the movie half the theatre was gone. Apparently spinning a newborn around by its umbilical cord is comedy--and that's the most pleasant thing I could mention. This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen, and not one of those \\"so bad it's funny\\" movies like Hudson Hawk or Plan 9. It was insulting, disgusting, horrifying, and just plain awful. This movie aims very very low, and overachieves in that regard. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there anything lower than 1 star?","review":"Quite frankly, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. There is no plot, and the jokes and gags just aren't funny. They're totally unrelated to what is going on in the movie. It's basically just a stream of Tom Green's sexual (both human and animal) fantasies along with other just plain disgusting things that Tom Green thinks are funny, all very loosely tied to a plot that goes about as deep as a kiddie pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such chutzpah to even put it in the title","review":"I like good romantic comedy, and I also like good farces. The latter is what caused me to check out FREDDY GOT FINGERED. Within the last year or so, a movie called LOST AND FOUND came out. It was an otherwise watchable romantic comedy, spoiled near the end by its effort to make a joke of a very unfunny matter - a false accusation of child abuse. Yet I heard no one criticize the movie for that. Let the movie makers get away with such failure to be in the same universe with good taste, and they'll get worse and worse. Now along comes the farce FREDDY GOT FINGERED, and they have the chutzpah to make the very title a false accusation of child abuse. The only up side this time is I didn't see where there would have been much of a movie to spoil anyway. Even for a lover of farces, the rest of the movie was forgettable anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie to ever be put to film stock","review":"NO PLOT ODD HUMOR and of course Tom Green.

But the plot isn’t really worth discussing. It’s all just an excuse for putting Tom Green in different situations where he can let his “talent�?run wild. These situations include Tom Green beating a crippled girl with a stick, convincing the State that his father has been molesting his brother, Freddie, for several years (hence the title, FREDDIE GOT FINGERED)�?Some of this is funny, sure, but most of it is just annoying (and the constant screaming and jellying of Tom Green makes it even more annoying). I agree with the critics who butchered this film (for the most part its not good).

The second family is struggling financially, but their vast love for each other reaches far beyond their doorstep, affecting those graced to witness this love.This is the classic story of renewing the strong bonds of family love and understanding the need to put the prioroties in life in the proper order."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cristmas Shoes","review":"This book makes you think about what Christmas really means. Does it mean that you should ask for the most expensive things and only use them once or twice, things that really don't mean anything to you. Or is it about showing your family how much you love them, and that love is not bought its made. It shows two different point of views, one of an eight year old and one of a 36 year old lawyer. It allows you to see that the eight year old is actually richer than the laywer because of his family; loving, caring, and doing everything together. The laywer is only rich because he only cares about his work.

It is neither a simple or a sad story but a story of courage, faith and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"The book is sweet -- saccharine sweet. It is also completely predictable, badly edited and, well, stupid. Could someone please come up with an idea that is at least approaching original? This one certainly isn't. It is full of cliches -- the good, dying mother; the workaholic dad who believes that money will make his family love him; the poor (and dirty and ragged) little boy who just wants to give his mom one last Christmas gift; the meddling mother; the long-suffering wife who doesn't want to be lonely anymore. The basic premise is a cliche -- how the workaholic was shown what Christmas is all about by a little boy who has nothing and is about to lose his mother. A cliched plot might be OK, if it were carried out with a little finesse, but, sadly, it isn't. Don't bother with this book.

Oh my gosh, you have to read this.\\" At one point she yelled out, \\"This book is a movie!\\"Needless to say, she had gotten my attention and my interest in the book was high. I took it on a business trip with plans to read it in my off time, but when I started it on the plane I found it just as captivating and hard to put down.

It taught me to cherish people in your life, because one day they might be gone. I think everyone should read this book. It is a heartwarming story that has the saddest, yet happiest plotline.

Of course, the review is not about how a generation chooses to copy Coldplay or worse....If you enjoy hearing a great, fun band and a positive message in the lyrics, Richie, Jim and the guys will do it for you. Beatles, CSN, Buffalo Springfield, Poco, Eric's early stuff...all this is indispensable, lasting music. Country, rock, bluegrass fusion from guys that bothered to learn how to sing and play their instruments before stepping into the recording studio. Great live shows, too. This is the best of the best for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weekender shorts","review":"Great shorts! Just the length that I have been looking for. Plenty of pockets and a great fit. Very good quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a 5\\" inseam","review":"These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5\\" inseam. The inseam is 6.25\\", a 25% longer inseam. I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Cargo Shorts","review":"I have purchased several pairs of these cargo shorts and have been very pleased with them. They are good looking, light weight and comfortable, and reasonably priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Euro-Western Bites the Dust","review":"After escaping Bondage for the first time, Sean Connery utilized his box-office clout to star in a dreadful Louis L'Amour adaptation. \\"Shalako\\" (1968) managed to round up director Edward Dmytryk and a fine international cast for a two-hour exercise in Euro-Western boredom. Zero chemistry between Connery and Brigitte Bardot - both hopelessly lost in the Almeria landscape. Not even the presence of Woody Strode can redeem this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stinks","review":"This was an all European production based on a Louis Lamour novel and that's the most decent thing I can say. Well, to be fair Connery does acquite himself well as a western hero. Everyone else is truly wasted. An oddity as a film at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"One to miss","review":"Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors (Molly Macquires). How he was ever talked into this movie. Brigitte Bardot plays Bardot. The New Mexicoesk landscapes and some favorite actors(Jack Hawkins) is about the only redeeming grace of this western that plods along. Somehow the pouty lips and wispy hair could not carry this movie out of the boring canyons."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not seem a McConnell book","review":"I totally agree with the 1-3 star reviews. I have read Code Complete and Software Estimation, and this book does not have the same level.Although the book does not deserve a 1 star, I also think that the average rating is too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference book","review":"This is an excellent book for people that want straight facts about the software engineering profession and industry. It is also an excellent source for a plan to understand how to acquire knowledge in search of a better career as a software engineer.For a long time I tried to find what was the real difference between computer scientists and software engineers because the general knowledge knowadays is that both professions are the same. This book finally gives a clear and straight explanation of the real difference between both.Another thing I liked a lot about this book is that it explains the false idea that knowledge in software engineering becomes obsolete too quickly to be useful or to form a body of knowledge.For all people working in the software industry this is a must-read book to really understand where they should be heading and why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite What I Was Expecting","review":"The main focus of this book in on the creation of a professional software development association or organization, similar to the ones of doctors and arquitects. The discussion is interesting, but not very useful if you have to deal with the problems and challenges of the day-to-day life in software development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should be - \\"Examples of Bad Project Management\\"","review":"I can sum this book up in two sentences;1. Think about your application before coding it.2. Steve wants to be treated like a professional, e.g. Doctor.I was expecting this book to help me do the things the title suggests however all I read where the reasons why projects are poorly managed."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PHOTOS,DIRECTOR COMMENTS VERY INTERESTING!","review":"The photos are fantastic,the comments much more interesting,worth buying it.You can really understand why it is more than what you see at first in the movie.I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a compliment","review":"They're comfy and look great with skirts, jeans, etc. Almost always get a compliment from a passserby."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first glance at the Scarred Lands","review":"This book gives brief descriptions of the continent of Ghelspad and all of its kingdoms and countries and with this, it is the first publication by White Wolf that gives deeper insight into the upcoming Scarred Lands Campaign Setting.Be prepared everyone! The Scarred Lands really rock!If you already own the D&D Third Edition Gazetteer or the Living Greyhawk Gazetteer, you will have no problems with this book. It is made up the very same way the other two mentioned books are and seemlessly fits into the 3E-rules. This is a D20-System Open Gaming License product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exasperating","review":"I bought this book with some enthusiasm, having read The Dancing Wu-Li Masters a few years back. I wasn't just disappointed. I was exasperated. Mr. Zukav appears to have just sat down at his computer and made up his own Theory of Everything and presented it as truth. By that method, any of us could make up a religion and write a book over the weekend. Readers who haven't read anything about the great world religions may think that something remarkable is going on in this book but for my money The New Testament is more radical, and the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins more inspiring. Zhukov should go back to writing about physics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talking in Circles","review":"Most of this book talks in complex circles and is difficult to follow. I found it very frustrating to to read, unless a specific example was outlined. Most of the gist of what Mr. Zuchov is trying to convey can be summed up in 10 pages. You get what you deserve, what goes around comes around, treat others as you wish to be treated, look inside yourself for the answers.I bought the book because I wanted to see if I can attain a \\"higher self\\" -- and that is the most important decision anyone can make BEFORE choosing this book. If you aren't committed before buying, this book may just cloud the issue further. A lot of gobblygook which could have been written in a MUCH more straightforward way. My question is -- how did the editors let this book get published with SOOOO many run-on sentences? Zuchov's writing style is pretty out there, and I'm a writer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Hard to Finish...","review":"I am by no means the well-read expert on the subject of spirituality. I am searching and always open to a good book discussing the topic. This book was totally lost on me. I found it to be mundane and it seemed to be pointless. It treated most of the topics (see the table of contents link) from a schoolbook theoretical view, offering me no practical knowledge.For better reading, I would refer the reader to Carol Adrienne's \\"The Purpose of Your Life\\" or James Redfield's \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\" (a novel).It is probably worth noting that \\"The Seat of the Soul\\" was a national bestseller (according to the cover) but I for one will not find it a memorable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age Fluff","review":"I'm afraid this review is going to generate a lot of negative Karma. I couln't buy Zukov's description of an apparently new religion. He treats his subject as if it is established fact rather than the fanciful theory that it is. It would have helped if he could have supported his premises with some real life experiences or better yet shown how great thinkers might have supported his ideas. What one reviewer called a poetic writing style, I found redundant and ponderous. I'm sorry but I'm not ready to pray for the dolphin soul in order to lift them to a higher state of consciousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"built on questionable assumptions","review":"Knowing that Oprah thinks highly of Gary Zukav, and thinking highly of Oprah, I bought a copy of Seat of the Soul and settled down for what I thought would be a good read. I was quite taken aback when I discovered that the book is about reincarnation, in which I have absolutely no belief. I can have no confidence in Zukav's statements concerning the spiritual realm, when I disbelieve his underlying assumptions. Therefore, the book was next to worthless for me. Luckily, there is a secondary market for this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dificult read, few good ideas","review":"I just finished Seat of the Soul and Soul Stories. While Seat of the Soul is the more difficult read, I found few good ideas and lots of \\"this is the way it is\\" righteousness. He lumps all animals into groups of souls, a dolphin soul, a dog soul. Where does he get this insight and why does he force himself to deal with the evolution of animal to human souls to eternal souls with such convoluted reasoning. I found myself reading and rereading passages just to try to understand his use of intention and personality and temptation. I got the same message repeatedly, and I found myself saying OK where is the depth of feeling and thought to justify all this obtuseness. Still I give it 4 stars for the attempt to get people to think of the consequences of their actions. But there are better books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get out of the box! A fresh look at spirituality!","review":"So, you can't quite wrap your brain around sprituality that goes outside the box, but you long for someone to sell you a line that will take you there? This is it! This book offers a rich and reflective view of spirituality that will leave even the most traditional and guarded thinking about a new paradigm for the soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the warning...","review":"I must say that I was intrigued by Oprah, however, after reading that a \\"past Mormon bishop\\" has found \\"truth\\" in it where he has not found truth before makes me sure that I don't need to waste my money. Thanks to all the no stars - I think you've hit the nail on the head!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a near total waste..","review":"Gary makes some sense on Oprah's show, but I got very little from this weird book. If I can't sell it, it will make some expensive material for bbq or backwoods. I'll share what I think is of priceless value: learn to \\"pray-read\\" bible passages, so simple anybody can do it. Find a nice quiet spot as you would for meditation, then repeat the words; for example, \\"I am.. I AM the Bread.. THE Bread.. Bread of Life.. OF Life.. LIFE\\" Bread gives us transforming spiritual nourishment. And the LIFE is the LIGHT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain BAD","review":"Believe the 1 star reviews! They are truly accurate. Not only are the ideas ABSURD re-workings of ancient philosophies,the book is so awkwardly written that it is painful to read. At first, I thought that maybe this was just a huge challenge to my inferior mind and that I just had to try harder... but,NO,the book is based on no substance or support and,really, by the time I read his \\"White and Black/Good and Bad\\" theory, I just burst out laughing. I couldn't believe I was actually reading this unsubstantiated \\"touchy -feely \\"garbage! Please, save your money and study Buddhism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do husband's mistresses give them this book?","review":"My ex-husband was given this book by his mistress. And interestingly, several of my friends ex-husband were also given this book by their girlfriends. Could this book be a new-age justification for adultery? I don't know about you, but I think the 10 Commandments have been around longer than new-age hoopla. I did read the book and the only benefit I saw to it was that it was a quick read and put me to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont like it...","review":"I dont like it the way it was written, it's too far from reality. You can say it's like introducing a new religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive New Age Garbage","review":"As a trained biologist who had read Zukav's earlier book I was interested to see what he had to say about evolution of the soul. But I was too offended by his amaterish and inadequate understanding of evolution to read very far into this book. Finally I threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Take Yourself Too Seriously, Zukav","review":"Zukav's views are derivative and yet very interesting. The book is worth reading, but after listening to him speak on NPR's \\"New Dimensions\\" I'm afraid the man is taking himself way too seriously. He has begun a project called \\"Genesis\\" (I think he has a God complex) where he is offering retreats (California, of course) to help people \\"evolve\\". I do however, like his initiative to enlighten people about the responsibility of free-will and the consequences of being unaware of your emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"too deep for me","review":"I saw this man on Oprah and liked his \\"way of thinking\\". Oprah mentioned his book \\"The Seat of the Soul\\" and that there is where she learned a lesson that had stayed with her through life. \\"The results you get from life are the direct actions of your true intentions.\\" Anyway, the book turned out to be way too deep and not very practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"A spiritual option on how to look at the world, nothing more","review":"Ok this is one of the many tries to give you the best information about the book, because every time I discover something new, although it has been some time since I've read it. It's a very spiritual (not religious) book and if you're not up for it in any way than don't buy it. I consider it more a book on how you can see the world we live in, but not to get to know your authentic self, for me that's McGraw or Wayne Dyer (the 2nd one is more gentle than the first, but has the same ideas). The things Zukav talks about, have been mentioned many times before, so it's not really original and last but not least because the story is build up from various little parts it can be hard to follow, so instead just get the same info from Oprah's website!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seal of the Soul","review":"Again, same order, same disappointment in'time to receive...believed it was offered to bereceived quickly...not happy with content, either.h"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Seat of the Soul by Gary Zukav","review":"I bought this as a gift and haven't read it myself. I was told, beforehand, how great a book it was. That was my reasoining for purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"//excellent reading and a wonderful means to improve my spiritual life, and to continue to grow to shine a light in the world.","review":"Excellent reading and a wonderful means to improve my spiritual life, and to continue to grow to shine a light in the world. Open to be whom I am meant to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"It gets to the heart (soul) of the issue, which is how we manage ourselves physically and spiritually. A must read if you are truly looking to better yourself and create a better world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cohesive system","review":"Zukav fails to develop logical arguments for his ideas; he simply states them. But if you are familiar with new-age vocabulary and on a personal quest for spiritual understanding, the text will make perfect sense. The greatest value in the book is in having all the metaphysical strands woven so simply, but satisfyingly, together. Pity that the language did not match the beauty of the ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book!","review":"This book was just a bunch of pyschological babble. I could not figure out what message he was trying to get across. I had to continuously re-read what I had just read to even come close to getting the point. I would not recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Substance - Completely In the Clouds","review":"Save your time & money! This is classic \\"new age\\" babble with no substance for the beliefs presented. Very sad actually.... I purchased this due to Oprah's special - what was talked about on the show had nothing to do with the substance of the material in this book. I say this is classic \\"new age\\" babble because there is no rhyme or reason to what is presented...just believe whatever you want (w/ no substance behind it) do whatever you want...etc.... Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If he weren't so self-righteously pompous","review":"I'm 90 pages in and I think I'm going to call it a day. It is refreshing to read about souls and karma and reincarnation - none of these being new topics to write about - but so unrefreshing to hear someone expound on so many deep models of energy and spirit and soul without once making a reference to another writer, or prefacing one thought with \\"I believe this to be so\\". It's not much different than a deeply religious person expounding their dogma \\"because they know it to be true\\". Period. You know what that's about in the end.OK, so his intuition, along with his pendulums and peyote have convinced him, and now he's convincing us. I just can't read material disseminated in this manner. The credibility is totally called into question. Or just believe blindly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit reading and act","review":"If you are seeking change and took the time to read this book then I suspect that you have read several others and are in the paralysis of analysis. Quit reading and act now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perplexed","review":"While the book is very useful in some respects, I can't help but feel this guy is a scheister (sp). It's not that I don't believe a physicist can be multi-talented; it's that I question his background and his ability to preach the way he does. I think his exposition on karma is good, but the rest of it is based on...what?I also don't know if I believe in reincarnation, being a practicing Christian. Ofcourse, we all live on after death, but do we really return, life after life? How does this man know? I'm just a little skeptical about some of his presumptions. Does he have a doctorate in psychology?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Different Take on Nothing New","review":"I had to read this book twice. That's not to say I was forced to, rather I had to read it a second time in an attempt to see what all the rave was about. Frankly, I didn't find it, even the second time around. To anyone who hass taken any time to explore their own spirituality either through reading, meditation, or direct experience through nature, church or coven this book said nothing you didn't figure out alread. It seems more like a short cut to spirituality for the lazy. Although I don't feel books should be burned, I don't find this one of any value seeing that it attempts to cram into your head what you should have to work to figure out, causing some really strange side effects like bibling this book. If you have the will power, I'd advise you avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Rate Philosophy Described Better Elsewhere --","review":"Now Oprah - please don't carried away here. Gary Zukav was not the first to discuss reincarnation and the immortal spirit that lives on after our body dies -- he doesn't even do a good rehash of the ancient and holy scriptures that provided the basis of his material. As one other reviewer suggested, Zukav does not cite any sources for his views, and just spews all his loose philosophy as if he was Moses. On the other hand, he does give a good description of Karma - what goes around comes around. In that case, we can expect that someone, some day, will steal one of Zukav's few original ideas, and make a lot of money after espousing it as his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enlightening...Don't waste your time..","review":"I read a lot of new age spiritual literature and this has got to be some of the worst. The author doesn't provide any support for his theories. Where did he get this stuff. I would venture a guess that he made it up. Don't waste your time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Seat of Your Pants","review":"I was very happy with Dancing Wu Li and looked forward to an insightful journey into our inner selves. Unfortunately, this book came up wanting. A few uncited William James, Augustine and eastern philosophy references, mixed with Jung and Thermodynamics does not show Zukov to have either the inclination or the understanding of philosophical thought that has come before. He provides no point of reference for his argument and no personal transcendent experience. In sum, a waste of money. More Karma is available with the astrological section of the newspaper. Don't buy this book and feed poor work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"Usefull book,that opens horizons,makes one, think about things that before seemed \\"natural\\".And also makes one, feel many more things...because the seat of our soul is a heart...I recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but unsurprising","review":"I found this attempt at an integration of new age ideas with hard science interesting but problematic. The book's use of words that appear to have a meaning of their own but which are only definable on a personal basis was a recurring problem for me. The book offers nothing new but does review interesting material."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must","review":"Have you been in pain over a break up OF A LOVED ONE, this book helped pull out of the pain and helped me forgive myself and the my partner, as i am responsible for all actions in my life, a book to read again and again as you grow bruce gilling"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"I agree with some of the reviews that the absolute of his writing may turn people off, however, if you can look past that aspect of his writing you will gain much insight from this book. Even if you are far from a new age thinker. Many of what was addressed makes sense, his approuch has helped me see things differently, a more freeing feeling. I see his intentions as helping create positive in all of us, how could his efforts be criticized. His absoluteness, I believe, is his Faith. Read with an open mind and absorb his message."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's very deep","review":"You have to read a lot of it over more than once, the dude is deep. Some of it is \\"way out there\\" but most of the book will open your eyes to truth beyond religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"No proof whatsoever","review":"The author does not provide any proof of animals having \\"group souls\\", vs. humans who have \\"individual souls\\". I believe my cats, and all higher animals have individual souls. The \\"group soul\\" mentality may help people eat their meat and continue to slaughter innocent animals for food. Nothing the author writes is proven - we're just supposed to take his word for it. Well, I don't believe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Inspiring!","review":"This book was very inspiring! Books like these give our lives meaning and help us develop a common undertanding in order to develop a more peaceful and compassionate world. Although I really loved this book, I wished it were a bit less vague and general and a bit more practical. I wish he wrote a little bit more like Toru Sato. I like the balance of practicality and theory in Sato's \\"Rhythm, Relationships, and Transcendence\\" even though it carries a similar message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falsely Represented","review":"After Oprahs show I couldn't wait to get the book! Was suprised that it was about reincarnation. I felt on Oprahs show that Mr. Zukav falsely represented what the book was actually about, by failing to mention the jist of what the book is truly about. I was very disappointed and unhappy with my waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused Man","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I expected a book about spirituality and God but instead got a book about New Age beliefs and not many references to God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to keep my concentration on ist message.","review":"My appologies to Oprah, but I cannot concure with her on the quality of the words within this book. And beyond the words I looked for a message and could find none. In the first few chapters Mr. Zukav recommends we listen to our inner voice to determine the truth of something. I did, and both of us cannot grasp the written message of the book. I read a book a week or more and have knowledge of readable writing that has a message. I recommend a do not buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual Path / Spiritual Truth","review":"Another great find. This is a book you can read over and over again and find a new meaning and a new truth in it each time. As you read the pages your own life and patterns begin to change. The wisdom within these pages is truely a blessing.I especially loved the chapter on Reverance.So if you love growth in your life, read this book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done","review":"The writing itself is terrible. I can't imagine a publisher allowing it to be released as written. Too many loooonng sentences, riddled with commas. Some of the \\"statements\\" are virtually uninterpretable. My high school English teacher would have given me a \\"D\\", at best.Many \\"quantum leaps\\" which assert something as fact with literally no information to support the position. The \\"miracle\\" that it became a best-seller is a serious indictment on the intelligence level of our nation's readers. It would seem that many people are without a base of existence and are desperately searching for a foundation.This is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Seat of the Soul","review":"This book is very difficult reading for a beginner to \\"New Age/Metaphysics.\\" Why? Because the scope of the book is too broad. The author seems to be knowledgeable in reincarnation but what are the sources of his findings? It seems to be a book based on his opinions which is not something worth paying for! I kept thinking the next chapter would clarify things but instead I found myself going deeper and deeper to nowhere. I understand that many aspects of reincarnation are based on beliefs but some facts need to be presented to offer validity to ones theories. If I were a skeptic regarding reincarnation, this book would not assist me in obtaining information to convince me that reincarnation is possible. Instead, it would deter me and encourage me to believe the whole idea is ludicrous! Luckily, I'm not easily swayed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seat Of Soul","review":"Excellent book with great insight as to where we as humans have a different vision related to life on our morther earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book!","review":"This book is a terrible bastardization of metaphysical principals and is couched in terms that are senseless. (5 senses vs. multi-sensory. Isn't five multi?) Not only are the labels Zukav attaches to profound phenomena bizarre, single paragraphs display unfollowable leaps of logic. Most of his ideas have realistic foundations in metaphysical thought shared by many religions, but here they are twisted into strange new age hooha. Skip this book. There are other far better things to read. Read buddhist texts. Read yogic texts. Read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"gibberish","review":"I agree with another reviewer that said if the author had stated \\"This is my opinion...\\" I could be more forgiving , however that was not the case. Unlike that reader I could bring myself to finish reading this giberrish after about half way through the book. If you have ever seen this guy on Oprah he appears to be nice enough but I get the impression he sees himself as some kind of new age prophet in his mind. He is all knowing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"If you don't read this book you are missing out on alot- He teaches you how choice and intentions affect our interactions and feelings with others and that we are more than just people with personality, that our soul goes beyond your personality-by dwelling at \\"the multisensory\\" level we really understand our connection to others and our true purpose. If you don't know your purpose, read this book.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Platitudinous non-sense","review":"Rehashed 60's lite,pseudo-philosophy, with no meat on the bones. Actually, no bones either. I guess some people have to start somewhere. But this is NOT THE PLACE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Easy Trip","review":"I was not suprise when this book ventured into the spiritualism quite a bit. Although I don't choose to go there, there is nothing deceitful about the title. I appreciate that. Can't say that I would recomend it for spiritual growth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"I ordered this book after seeing Gary Zukav speak on Oprah. I thought that I had read the book before since it has been around for awhile. I really enjoyed the information presented in the book, and felt it was very timely in thinking about some things that are going on in my life. A great reminder of things I already know, but there was also a lot of new information for me about soul development and our purpose in this life."},{"rating":"1","title":"a nice message, but kind of boring","review":"I enjoyed the main messages from the book. However, the book just did not excite me. I had a hard time sticking with it, as it became kind of boring. It seemed to offer a lot of \\"cotton candy\\" philosophy, but little concrete examples to help me apply it to my everyday life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renewal of Mind and Spirit","review":"As you read, this book will engulf you in questions that you suddenly understand the answers. I was amazed, I had to read, digest then read again because it gave me new ways to look at old beliefs and minds sets. A must read for the heart that is hurt, the mind that is tired, or anyone who needs to understand what they already know.My favorite book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable, at best...","review":"If this is the best that Harvard can come up with we're in big trouble. The infatuation with Eistein's theory of relativity applied to social and \\"spiritual\\" thought has got to stop! Nothing more than clever writing utilizing unfounded assumptions to mask preconceived notions. For example, if you don't smoke, don't drink and never had a sexual urge you'll find a lot of support for the arrogance and superiority complex of your highly evolved little self. The idea that the highest human value is to \\"value others above yourself\\" is the root of every misery known to man (& woman), and that marriage, monogamy and fidelity are the state of the \\"highly evolved\\"--let's see, was Jesus Christ married? Or, Oprah? Or, who DOES run \\"Promise Keepers\\" anyway? I read 3-5 books a week, and I'm a writer. Even a neophyte Taoist would find this book laughable, at best.

Boring too.","review":"I watch Oprah, read self-help books, love animals and people and have done a lot of soul searching.

I can't get myself to pick it back up to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selling Pantheist Schlock","review":"Zukav reconstitutes bits and pieces of eastern religions and blends their attributes into this book. It sounds mystical and enchanting to the reader;inviting the reader to think in terms, not ground in religious belief or doctrine, but of what one man THINKS and IMAGINES.

You will be uplifted by the clarity and matter-of-factness Mr. Zukav brings to the reality of the Soul. Whether you believe in reincarnation and an afterlife or not, this book touches our deepest parts, and explains their function and how to move closer to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is outstanding","review":"Gary Zukov is able to masterfully take very complex subjects and bring them to the readers level of understanding.

Get ready for a fast ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Difference between 5-Sensory Refiews and Others","review":"I'm on my 3rd reading of this enlightened book. All I want to say is that those that wrote negative reviews wrote from the perspective of the \\"5-sensory\\" human who must have physical \\"proof\\" of everything and is suspect of anything that cannot be detected by their 5 senses. I have come to believe, as Gary says, that the evolution of the human species has gone beyond that phase. As the pioneers of Quantum Physics have discovered, there is much, much more to the universe than can be \\"understood\\", measured and detected. Gary Z speaks from the knowing that only those who have been there can understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"A meandering road to nowhere!","review":"Provocative? Life-altering? Please! I did not find this book original or thought-provoking in the least. Rather, it was a colossal chore to read. He rambles on with clumsy, run-on sentence after another and then, never gets to the point, anyway -- let alone offers any real data or even pseudo-scientific evidence to support his dramatic claims. I honestly am at a loss to understand the cult following behind this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't apply the standards of corporeal proof....","review":"This is a marvelous and thought-provoking book, one which asks much of the the reader. Those who have posted negative reviews here have been unwilling or unable to give up the part of their training that demands \\"scientific\\" evidence.In my case, I was ready to receive these words with an open mind and a willingness to understand that our species is moving toward wholeness, after many years of filling up the spaces on this planet with our physical and personal selves. Those who are familiar with \\"A Course in Miracles\\" will hear the ring of truth in Zukav's book.And as for the 1-star reviewers....they'll be ready for this eventually!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zukav struck gold by capturing Oprah's \\"soul\\" and publicity","review":"O.K.....we all know there are hundreds of books on the market that \\"delve into your soul\\"....well, after Oprah's HUGE push for this book, I bought it thinking there simply MUST be some magical thing about this book. What I found page after page after page was simply one mans ideas and explanations for our existence. I would read a sentence referring to the \\"guides and teachers\\" that would help our souls review our lives (after our death of course) and would think \\"Now how does Zukav know this?\\" You could ask yourself this question after every single sentence in the book. This book is very simply ONE MAN'S ASSUMPTIONS OF OUR LIVES, OUR SOULS AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. Unless Zukav talked to a burning bush on a mountain one day........this is a work of fiction, nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"a connection: Zukav's \\"new Species\\" and Native Americans","review":"This book is an amazing piece of work for me as a Native American to read, in that it is so similar to many Native religions. However, we would make some division between soul and spirit, to me, Mr. Zukav has actually accomplished a non Indian translation of some very basic Aboriginal concepts. I would suggest therefore, that when he speaks of a \\"new species\\" he may really mean the oldest of cultures, those who sought connection to the spirit and took responsibility for their thoughts and actions-Aboriginal people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seat of the Soul changed my life.","review":"Seat of the soul is one of the most important books of all time. It provides very valuable insight and truth. Read it. I have a masters in philosophy and have read books such as these my whole life. This, along with In God's Truth by Nick Bunick, is one of the two best. Enjoy, my friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"Simply put, Gary Zukav is a scientist in New Age clothing. I found his ideas regarding the souls of animals distressingly Cartesian. Nor does Mr. Zukav give credit to the many religious and metaphysical authorities that so heavily inform his work. Many of the principles he shares can be found in the rich symbolism of the Bible and the Bhagavad Gita. Endorsement from the richest and most persuasive talk show host in the country has given this book an unfair advantage over other informative and relevant books on the same subject. I would suggest \\"Seth Speaks\\" and the entire \\"Seth\\" series of books to any one who is searching for the nature of the \\"soul.\\" I got more out of reading texts dictated by the disembodied voice of Seth than I did the mouth of a displaced scientist whose earthly function is to sell books and make television appearances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT a reference book!","review":"Pompous and entirely unsubstantiated drivel.

They have brought me so much peace and joy, it brought tears to my eyes to realize that I am not alone in this search. Zukav gives us so many deep definitions of what we search for such as truth, your spiritual partner, karma etc. as we evolve into our higher path toward home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and Unclear","review":"Although I normally enjoy most of the books that Oprah recommends - this one is a definite \\"do not buy\\". She praised the book on her show and I quickly ordered it from Amazon. I read some of it nightly but it is a chore to read and I am not left enlightened but just confused. I watched Zukav on Oprah and liked what he said but the messages he tries to bring out in the book are unclear and lost in babble that goes on endlessly. Although I enjoy reading and learning, this book left me perplexed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's now in a trash can in New Orleans airport.","review":"Fortunately, I had purchased the book second-hand for less than a dollar. Handwritten notes in the margins, highlighted passages, filled every page of the first chapter and a half. And then they ceased abruptly. Either the previous owner dropped dead, or woke up to the fact that this book is like McBeth's view of life -- \\"full of sound and fury, signifying nothing\\". I brought the book to the airport to occupy the time (and hopefully, gain some insight) while waiting for friends. As said above, I finally could take no more of Mr. Zukav's lofty drivel, and tossed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a Million Dollars","review":"I've read this book three times now and I'm sure I'll read it again.

New age pap: preachy, sanctimonious ultra-simplistic, just plain laughable. I could barely get to page 50, and it has large-ish type, wide margins & leading.Reading Great Eastern Sun is sort of like eating a fine meal - I feel better after reading it, really fortified by its sustenance. This was like eating a bad meal, it made me want to puke. Zukav wrote a book in '79 called the Dancing Wu Li Masters that I'd heard of, and his Seat was a NYT bestseller, so I thought it might be at least ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you loved Wu Li Masters, you'll hate this one!","review":"Gary Zukav has obviously lived in Marin Countytoo long. This new book is a smarmy amalgam ofNew Age hooey based on the unsupportedprecept that human beings are evolving to somehigher state. Actually, of course, we're ratherplayed out as a species and we're working realhard to make our planet uninhabitable for ourown kind. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless nonsense.","review":"I was tricked into buying this book. I was told it explored the human consciousness and that it was profound and deep. In reality it's made up nonsense. The writer knows very little on all subjects that he is writing about. The man clearly has little concept of what evolution is, cause and effect, soul, or karma. He uses these terms incorrectly though out the entire book. He talks down to the reader. And gives more illustrations of his theories than are necessary to fill pages. This book is very dogmatic. He describes bizarre metaphysics of his own creation.

Overall, I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"offensive, interesting, occasionally inspirational","review":"I found Zukav's authoritarian, black/white style of presenting his opinions about a complex subject intrinsically unknowable, as arrogant and offensive. I also was delighted to see his opinion that many of us suffer from \\"splintered personalities\\" - which is exactly what 15 years of studying \\"Inner family therapy\\" has taught me in my private counseling practice. One aspect of that which Zukav omits is that we each have a true Self - an aspect, or \\"part\\" of our personality which makes wise decisions if the other personality parts \\"let it.\\" I'm also puzzled that Zukav preaches vertical-path soul-focus, vs. \\"external power,\\" manifested as seeking fame, power, and money - yet his Web site address ends with \\".com,\\" meaning for-profit, commercial. He has a right to make a living, and ... ? Seems like a double message."},{"rating":"2","title":"the seat of the soul","review":"I am one of the people Mr. Zukav described in his book as one of the angry, depressed, etc. I found myself on practically every page and began to wonder what I could do to change my life. I have never found a book that touched me so profoundly. I have read many self help books in my quest for answers and 'The Seat of the Soul' is the first one to give me hope. Please, read this book if you too are searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty calories for Newageophiles","review":"Gary Zukav is, in my view, more businessman than author. His book \\"Dancing Wu Li Masters\\" struck me as little more than a reworking of Fritjof Capra's \\"Tao of Physics\\", revved up and repackaged for the popular market. Likewise, \\"The Seat of the Soul\\" is a lumping together of familiar New Age concepts well-lubricated with lots of touchy-feely phrasing to help it slide down the gullets of those who revel in the bland, feather-bed brand of spirituality presently in fashion. Not much here to get your teeth into unless you have a taste for Pablum."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age Dogma","review":"Gary Zukav is a writer who burns both hot and cold: Hot in \\"Dancing Wu Li Masters\\" and cold in \\"Seat of the Soul.\\" The first book succeeds because it attempts to enlighten the reader through carefully crafted explanations of complex physical phenomena. By contrast, \\"Seat of the Soul\\" fails because it offers nothing to support or substantiate the many claims made about the spiritual world. While this may be acceptable to those already indoctrinated into the received wisdoms of the New Age, the more sceptical reader will find it difficult to buy what Zukav is selling. The \\"Seat of the Soul\\" is one long, drawn out lecture and a disappointing companion to \\"Dancing Wu-Li Masters\\". But perhaps more disappointing is the fact that this and other examples of New Age tripe like the \\"Celestine Prophecy\\" rank among the best-sellers. It appears that the dumbing down of America is in full swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth and wisdom","review":"I have had this book for about five years, and have given away several copies of it to those near and dear to me. It speaks volumes of truth and wisdom, without being smarmy, preachy, or trying to sell anything. It is head and shoulders above most \\"new age\\" type books. I am buying it again, as I gave away my last copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH????","review":"I, like others, saw G.Z. on Oprah and was intrigued with his message. However, his book that I looked so forward to reading, is the most BORING I have ever picked up. He repeats the same silly drivel over and over, and talks down to you while doing it. The only thing I can say this book is good for is nights when I can't sleep- I don't need to take a sleeping pill. Sorry, but what a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inuitively Speaking","review":"Seek and ye shall find my copy of Seat of the Soul at the local book re-sale shop.

However, many of the concepts he proposes make tremendous sense in our world, and when I finished this book, it left me with a smile on my face. Very uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age Psychobabble","review":"I am so happy I borrowed the audiotape from the library. Not having spent money on this makes me extremely happy. You can believe in Angels, Reincarnation, Karma, or whatever you like, but there is not one iota of proof any of it exists. And the funny thing is if you ask for proof the New Ager will say we just don't have the \\"sensory capabilites.\\" Read Carl Sagan's Demon Haunted World especially his section on having a Dragon in his garage. This stuff is just plain silly. Accept reality. There are no angels, ghosts, goblins, alien abductions. We spend a short time here then we die. And we don't have a soul. The brain and the mind are one and when it dies, we die. Although a little depressing, I'd rather than know the truth than be bamboozled. If you read a book by Gary Zukav, read Dancing Wu Li Masters which is excellent layman's guide to physics. But how in the world did he write this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you saying?","review":"Gary Zuzak demonstrates a general misunderstanding of evolution, a premise on which much of his books rests. While the book will occasionally present an interesting idea, it lacks substance and coherence. Zuzak makes claims without supporting them and then uses choppy language to distract attention from it. He seems to make bold statements which lack meaning, and at times it seems that even he does not know what he is trying to say. In short, this book moves with the grace of an injured turtle."},{"rating":"1","title":"new age literature and disappointing.","review":"Mr. Zukav fails to point out in his book that the soul of man is only one facet of mankind' spiritual nature. He also limits his discussion to l) the body, and 2) soul. Nothing is mentioned of the spirit of man of which the soul is only one portion. His research appears to be very restricted. His book touches a little onoriental philosophy, a little on new age mysticism, and a little on elementary reasoning. The result is that a reader would come to a conclusion re: spiritual studies, that it is a type of kindergarden ciricula that is not worth pursuing.One would be far better off to read Rudolf Steiner and Helen Blavatsky as a foundation for future studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warmed over Platonism....again.","review":"These ideas in this book sound sweet and assuring but the author presents nothing substantial to back them up. The nave and the undereducated will be taken again, as they have been for over 2000 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and distressed with this book","review":"I am sad that my book club selected this sorry book for this month's reading. I am sad we wasted our money on the unsubstantiated nonsense Zukav dishes out. Most important it distresses me to see how many people believe this stuff. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pantheism in Blue-Jeans","review":"Another \\"feel-good, get-in-touch with your soul\\" do-it yourself guide. Zukav has obviously followed Mr. Deepak Chopra around and sees that if he spews this new-age drivel, he too can make quite a lot of money. Poor Oprah... Another book that feeds our culture of the \\"subjective\\"..we must do what \\"feels\\" good. Please think for a minute and try to grasp this most illogical nonsense! If you must have this \\"feel-good\\" message in your life, return this book immediately and pick up something by M. Scott Peck...at least he can ground his theories in the realm of the objective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiritual Twinkie","review":"I have to agree with the others who have panned this book. The only reason I give it more than one star is that it at least \\"explores\\" an area that every soul should eventually consider. Someone who finds Mr. Zukav profound or original may know how to read, but, in this area at least, has yet to read much worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book makes you think!","review":"The author describes many aspects of the soul. While his theories do not stem from the Christian belief system, it's more of a scientific approach with lots of speculation, discussing various possibilities of certain spiritual applications. It's a deep book to say the least, but it's very interesting and rarely ever has an author discussed the subject so intensely. One other book that I really like and highly recommend because it defines what the soul really is and has fabulous chapter on the healing of soul, is Dietmar Scherf's \\"I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression\\" which is also available at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"More new age pap.","review":"Very disappointing book. You can get it better by consulting religious texts of the Eastern masters. Zukav preaches karma and how it works, as if \\"karma\\" were some sort of accepted fact.

A very feely book which has no compulsion about contradicting itself but the words just keep on aflowing.

No mental stimulation here unless you enjoy sappy schtick."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age At Its worst","review":"Rambling soul babble ... On the bright side this book is likely to induce sleep.

He looks good and sounds good on Opra, but he is New Age to the core, which means he is anti-Christian. His ilk believe that all proponents of New Age will themselves become gods. Therefore, there is no need for Jehovah God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, nor any need for a Savior, Jesus Christ. I'm sure AMAZON.COM has all of Texe Marrs' books. Read just one and you will have an awesome fear of Gary Zukav and the New Age instilled in your heart and soul. Gary Zukav is just another polished guru working for Satan.

I was going to buy it for \\"intrigue's sake\\", but when looking at what it dared to say about Christ Jesus, I threw it back. It dared to say that Jesus was an \\"evolved being\\". Lie! It dared to say that Jesus should be seen as along side as Gandi and Buddah. Lie! Not even close.

Who says?\\" Even as one who is \\"already indoctrinated into the received wisdoms of the New Age\\" and one to whom much of Gary Zukav's theories sound reasonable, I can not take his total lack of support for what he posits. Not so much as a personal experience or reference to anything in the wisdom traditions. We have Guides and Teachers? Why not just Teachers, or Guides for that matter. Why not Junior and Senior Teachers, and Guides, Angels, and Fairies? Where did he come up with this stuff? ... I can't help thinking this would never had seen the light of day if it hadn't come from the Dancing Wu Li Master guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"Gary Zukav has a strong, intuitive understanding of the power and wisdom of the soul.

There is much to be gained from reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writes in Riddles","review":"Zukav pretends he is authority on some special insight into the way things ought to be. However, his credentials are limited. The words he uses in many of his sentences are confusing and contradictory as to attempt to provide different meanings to different people. Thus, unless one is a dolt who reads between the lines to gain some abstruse meaning, this book, as literally written, is a piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a disappointment","review":"I bought Seat of the Soul from Amazon.com because of the many positive reviews and its popular acceptance, the author's reputation, and because it is in the same genre as a book that I wrote (The Road to Damascus.)I expected more of it. I am not critical of Zukav because of any personal belief system that clashes with his, nor is there any inherent animosity for the ideas that he proposes. My disappointment results from his pedantic, declarative style, in which he presents his proposals without providing reasoning or sources to support his statements, nor any attempt at persuasion. He simply makes his statements as fait accompli, sans justification or explication, which in such an important subject matter I find indefensible. I confess that I quit the book half-read, which is rare with me.Joseph Pierre,Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for those soul-searchers out there!","review":"Gary Zukav does an excellent job at really getting at the heart and soul (no pun intended).

I looked a long time for something that would connect my logic, my intuition, and my spirituality. Bingo! This book will speak to everyone but at different levels.

But the commonality will be, or should be, peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"The book had a few points, but even for the open minded person regarding the subject it was missing some explanations, in other parts it was very repetious. Of course the author should be convinced of the topic, but to me this is still only one opinion or one theory how to look at it. I didn't care for his assumption concerning the animal soul, that animals have a group soul and dolphins committing suicide? All of the insights were stated too matter-of-factly. But what really put me over the edge and I can only hope Gary Zukav meant it differently, but I was shocked at the suggestion in the Karma section \\"not to judge events like the inquisition, holocaust or the death of child, as we don't know what the arrangements are for these tortured souls as they might find healing in the process\\"....Therefore we should just relax when a loved one dies, with wars or situations like in Darfur, because these souls might experience redemption???? This concept goes against everything I believe in!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not science, it's not philosophy, and it's not true.","review":"What's there to say? The book merrily takes for granted the truth of various New Age claims, most deeply, the existence of the soul. Meanwhile, in the centuries since Descarte's ill-fated dualism, science has understood that the mind exists as the computations of the brain, not as some sort of magical soul-essence.Why waste your time here? Zukov tries hard to paint a cheery picture of a comfortable world where humans are special, but does it at the expense of the rationality that distinguishes us. For a better understanding of what you are, try Steven Pinker's \\"How The Mind Works\\" or Daniel Dennett's \\"Consciousness Explained\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark most of the time","review":"I had high hopes for some enlightenment when I first picked up this book. I soon realized it was too far \\"out there\\" for me. What struck me most often while reading was how generic and almost wishy-washy it seemed. I did enjoy portions of the book (mostly the aspects that relate to Mr. Zukav's knowledge of physics), but much of the time I found these were things that were more common sense than great revelation.This book is definately too \\"new age religion\\" for my liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend a day doing good deeds instead of reading this book!","review":"I am shocked that this book is a bestseller. Have millions of people actually waded through this dense, academic language about simplistic concepts? Zukav intellectualizes about concepts that are basic to any beginning meditation student. Sentences such as \\"So powerful is the energy of the soul that it could not advance into a physical form without, literally, exploding that form.\\" are not useful to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this","review":"This book is kept in my stack of books I refer to all the time. It is my Bible and I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"out of stock? take my copy!","review":"I agree with the two reviewers who decry the complete lack of substantiation for Zukav's half-baked theories.When Zukarov said people have individual souls but animals only have one \\"collective\\" soul -- all dogs share one \\"dog soul\\" -- I knew the guy was crazy.Maybe I'll just burn my copy lest some poor fool becomes a convert to this delusional man's new 'religion' or whatever you call his way of life, promoted at his website. I'm no censor, but I could, free of conscience, take this one out of circulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage in, Garbage out...","review":"Pure mysticism trash. A cross between Dianetics and the Celistine Prophecy except this book doesn't even pretend to form a basis for any of the conclusions the Author draws. He just blurts them out and then tells you \\"you must believe\\". It would appear Mr. Zukav never asked himself \\"why\\"... like \\"why would I publish such garbage?\\" Contradictions galore; they fall off the pages. Oh, and my favorite sentence from the \\"book\\": \\"Our deeper understanding tells us that a truely evolved being is one that values others more than it values itself...\\" pa-leeeeeze. Why? What \\"deeper understanding\\"? How did you find this out? How do you know everyone else feels this way? Thinks this way? This quote is on page 21... and it only gets worse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment after Wu Li","review":"I recommend Zukav's first book, the Wu Li Dancing Masters on my website. I was eagerly looking forward to a continuation. I expected it to be about what we have learned about the soul and consciousness. Instead, he concocted an ecumenical soup of new age beliefs from astrology to reincarnation and wove it into an elaborate metaphysic, fluffed up with abstract words like \\"negativity\\", \\"learning\\" and \\"frequency\\". It is a merangue -- no substance, no backing, no examples, no reasons for why anything he conjectures is true, and no way to apply it practically.It reads like a channeled hynotic trance induction. It sounds good but says little.He explains that you should not think it unfair to see someone homeless and that humans are superior to dolphins even in a soul sense. This is a self-indulgent book, where Mr. Zukav treats his every intuition as divine revelation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off target","review":"Unfortunately, Gary Zukav's pedantic personal style comes through in this writing as well as in his live interviews. When I actually sat down to read this book, I found that it was not at all what it claimed to be. It contained much more about religion and God than it did about personal discovery and development. In fact, I found most of the book filled with unfounded generalizations, none of which resonated with me in any way. The few useful ideas that this book contains are very deeply buried in rhetoric. Unless you want some pop theology, look elsewhere for enlightenment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sure This is the Book I Intended to Order","review":"I am still evaluating this book. So far, I don't much care for it and doesn't seem to be the book I thought I ordered. It's a little complicated to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"World changing","review":"This book has been really helpful. I had some trouble getting into it because some of the writing is a bit cyclical and hard to read. But I think this is mostly because the subject being dealt with doesn't really have a good language to express the ideas. Therefore reading it from this perspective it is a really well written book that deals with concepts that don't fit into the English language so well.He gave a really good explanation of how humanity is evolving and goes in depth into what is going on in the world at present. It is a very exciting book and very necessary in this age of change when we can no longer rely on the maps that our father's have followed. We can no longer rely on external power and hording and greed, and it is time to develop our own inner authentic power so that we can heal ourselves and our world.It has made me see parts of myself much more clearly and honestly. It also explains some things that I had experienced in a really understandable way."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Seat of the Soul","review":"An acquaintance of mine gave me \\"The Seat of the Soul\\" with high praises. To accord any praise at all for this book is much more than I can consciously offer. The author presents a theory as if he were the sole owner of all that is in his book of \\"wisdom.\\" There is absolutely no acknowledgement of others who have explored the nature of soul. No documentation and no definition of what appears to be one of the author's central points, the \\"authentic personality.\\"Having said all this, let me say that I have no problem with much of what the author propounds in this book. It is his notion of the \\"multisensory\\" person whose soul is guided by its soul-force ranging for generations back in history that leaves me at a bus stop waving goodbye; and wondering why I ever got on the bus in the first place!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read!","review":"In this book, Gary Zukav apparently thought a lot about almost every aspect surrounding the soul. His thoughts are deep in some places and you may have to read through it a few times to get it, but that's not bad, instead it's challenging and makes the reader think and dig deeper. All kinds of subjects are related into the spiritual realm. Another book that I really recommend, which has brought tremendous healing to my soul and has helped me in my spirituality in every aspect of life, is Dietmar Scherf's \\"I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression\\" also available at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Being Opiated\\"","review":"Why is it that all these \\"New-Age\\" manuals talk about only two things? 1. How rotten the ego is and 2. How we must all be basically \\"robotical\\" in our human feelings?

Save your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pontificating style, told as if it's all substantiated fact!","review":"Zukav is obviously very impressed with Zukav. This book has no spine, not supported with facts but told as if it has all been substantiated."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Must Be Kidding!","review":"Having been a student of metaphysics for years, I'm amazed at the success of this book because it is merely a rehash of very old ideas--without their original complexity. This book should be subtitled: *Everything I Know I Learned from Plato* (most especially the dialogue titled *Phaedrus* There's absolutely nothing \\"new\\" about this \\"New Age\\" tome. A visit to Zukav's website may also give one the impression this is about making money, not helping souls. Hmmmm . . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Mr.Zukav's book reads like a college text book. It is very hard to get through and gives no new insights to the reader. The basic idea of do unto others as you would have them do unto you is the underlying advice. Why the author felt a need to write nearly 300 pages about it is my question. There is no personality to the writing, no backround to explain how he came to his conclusions about karma and evolution. This book was a complete disappointment and waste of money- hollow and worst of all very poorly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"DISCOVERING YOURSELF","review":"This is a wonderful book. I especially liked the following sentence where Gary wrote \\"Give yourself permission to choose the most postive behavior in each moment.\\"I noticed another reviewer recommending a book called \\"WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK: A BOOK ABOUT INSTANTANEOUS TRANSFORMATION\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!I have read the Kanes' book many times since buying it back in Sept'99 and each time I discover more about myself and how I relate to others and life circumstances. And my life has transformed from dreams to realities. My relationship with my husband and my work have become and continue to be FUN, REWARDING, ENRICHING AND SATISFYING.I wholeheartedly recommend the Kanes' book to anyone interested in having their own DREAMS BECOME REALITIES."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age Platitudes","review":"Zukav sets out to present a simple and logically-structured summary of New Age thought. No sources are quoted, no authority given for the pronouncements made here. The ideas range from trite to absurd. We learn about the group soul of animals, the role of dolphins, crystals, etc. I found this book to be lacking in depth and texture. I hope our souls are richer and more substantial than depicted here."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a crock","review":"There's not a single substantiated fact in the entire text.

If you're interested in this topic, go learn quantum physics first, then come around to his book - otherwise you may fall for his charming but twisted take on turning physics into spirituality.

I'm not interested in bragging ('cause who cares anyway?) but saying I'm not exactly illiterate or unfamiliar with struggling with unusual concepts. Yet entire paragraphs would go by without any real comprehension on my part or acceptance either. For all his mild-mannered appearance, Zukav is telling us the way the world is according to Zukav and either you \\"get it\\" or you don't. He lays down the law, the truth, and you believe because he says so. Sorry, really, I want to understand but in my heart I believe Zukav is either insane or conning us.

The text is virtually unreadable, almost completely devoid of any real information, and is generally a painful experience. The photographs are almost equally bad, ranging from grainy yellowish shots, to lovely ones in which box-front glare almost obliterates any details of the doll inside.

The demo songs on the cd howerver are edited, they dont say the bad words, which on the tape I have they do..I know not a big deal, but some people out there are well picky. I would say the video of \\"Giving In\\" is well worth the price of the single alone.

I hated \\"Station.\\" I put it down 1/3 of the way through and have felt no need to pick it up. This is the first time I can remember doing this in a lifetime of compulsive reading. Laxness experimented with a new style in this one-- demonstrating that experiments sometimes fail. I found his parody obnoxious, his politics overwhelming, the characters unengaging, and the tone of the book irritating. I gave it a \\"3\\" because its not pulp-- it's intelligent. Original. Unusual. Maybe someone will like it. He's really a great writer!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful drivel","review":"This has to be one of the worst books I've ever read!. I can't believed I finished it. I set it aside many times and felt that it had to get better so I finally finished it. What a waste of time! It's dialogue was so stilted and unbelievable. The main character is so cold and restrained and she is suppose to be so intellectual. She supposedly didn't even know that the 'witness protection agency' was real; she thought it was a 'made for tv' concept.I think the author should stick to her day job. Although I shudder to think she might be teaching my daughter in her college years.And what was with her political agenda being pushed in one paragraph half way through the book? It had nothing to do with the story and just seemed to be so out of place.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one!

She thought I would enjoy reading about a Manhattan mystery from a feminist perspective. However, given the utter lack of description of Manhattan or its characters, the book I read could have taken place in a dark box. I'm not sure why Cross even bothered describing a trip to the lovely Frick Museum, she certainly didn't transport me there or give me any sense of what the museum holds.I also felt the notion that Cross doesn't describe ANYTHING as a tip of the hat to her protagonist Kate(who doesn't notice her surroundings) as a one-note tune at best. It made the novel boring, boring, boring. So boring in fact, that I couldn't finish the novel. And I'll reading finish almost anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amanda Cross in poor form","review":"I hadn't read an Amanda Cross mystery in years, but I remember being fond of her feminist academic Kate Fansler, so I gave this one a try. I'm sad to say that this one is way off form. The plot is contrived in order to conform to a group of Shakespearean quotations - a conceit that has been far better by other writers - and although it is somewhat convoluted even I, who am generally not one to figure things out before the author explains, was able to see what was coming a mile away.Further, I have to say that the character development was wooden, the mechanism of the plot was creaky, the dialog stilted. I did enjoy some of the academic overtones, but that probably isn't enough to give this one a recommendation.Scott Morrison"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"For a 56 year old woman who finds out her father was not really her father, Kate is amazingly unchanged by the experience.

You can actually hear where his strengths lay like on track #9 which is an interlude. While it's true he doesn't possess the strongest voice it compliments the music on his album. I myself must agree with other reviewers in wonder of how he hasn't or isn't releasing more material as oppossed to less talented artist. Frankies vocals and beats are real good and his taking a page back to simplicity in his lyrics make it a feel good album. It's an overall pop it in the changer and mellow or make out joint.

There are women's panties all over the place and the occassional nudity. The story is ripped right out of Moonraker. There's a villain bent on destroying the world and repopulating it with his own children, which he will father with the chicks he brought into space with him. It's fairly funny, particularly the character Gusto, who has one of the most interesting voices I've heard on anime. If you liked the first one or like anime with lots of babes, this is a good pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"The guiltiest pleasure","review":"If the exploitation of women is something you object to, avoid this video at all costs. The makers of this movie have a serious panty fetish, and there is visible women's underwear in virtually every frame. Personally, I liked it. The women are well-drawn and sexy, especially Aika herself. Aika has a magical golden bustier which is actually semi-sentient and gives her offensive and defensive abilities. (This is so similar to the comic book Witchblade that I wonder if one of them plagiarized the other.) The story involves her recovery of a piece of lost technology (she works as an underwater salvager) and a villain's plans for it. It's all pretty silly, but generally funny. If you're a guy who's into anime and likes women in skimpy outfits, this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is NOT Hentai... but close","review":"First off, This isn't Hentai, but its so close it's sickening. (In a funny way) The plot is abolutly horrid, but I bought it for the fan service. You should too. The show starts and ends with a blatent shot of underwear and while watching it, a minute dosen't pass before you catch another few glimpses. It's a fantasy world where all women are beautiful and wear white thongs. It's almost sureal. Lets just say It's almost impossible to sit down and count them all. Of course it's got endless replay value whenever you just want to see some fan service, and it's great to show to your friends.

Although it may be very pungent smelling when opened, this cheese has a pleasant, but strong flavor that is slightly tangy with mild overtones of wine. Raclette can be served cold, but most often it is served as a cooked cheese, melting smoothly and providing a creamy rich addition to many food dishes. When heated under a hot grill or with fire, the sweet nutty flavor intensifies and the texture becomes stringy and stretchy. Raclette is a popular cheese to melt over broiled potatoes.

Mahajan reviews the important points of the NSS, then spends the rest of the book backing up his analysis with a brief history of US imperialism, attacks on Iraqi civilians during the 1990s, US disregard for international law, the drive to war in Iraq, and the oil cartels.That's a lot of information for a 200-page, heavily-footnoted book. But Mahajan makes it work. This book packs a lot of important facts and insights into a small package.

The style will make you want to read on.As for the subject matter, it isn't just about Ford vs. Nissan, or Japan vs. the US; this book is about people, their failings, prejudices, arrogance, stupidity, short-sightedness, intellect, brilliance, drive, ethics, love, culture, and power.It offers powerful insight into the world of multi-national corporations.

Using Honda and Ford as examples, the author examines what happened to US competativeness in the years after WWII. It's not about Ford and Honda - the real lession for anyone in business is you can't sell what the market doesn't want to buy. The author points this out by using the two auto companies. In the era depicted, Ford built the cars the engineers wanted to build while Honda built the cars the market wanted to buy. The results were obivious. Economic reality between the US and Japan has changed, but to look at only that is to miss the point. Chrysler went from broke to economic success by simply building what the market wanted to buy.

I know that Tommy is getting older and everything and he has always been a diverse person when it comes to music and I respect that. But, this album sounds like a mix of Lifehouse and Nickelback put together. Just look at who else is featured on the album. If you are into any of those people, then yes, this album is for you, but if you are a Tommy Lee fan and a Crue fan, then do yourself a favor and just hold onto everything he has done before. I am not mad that I spent the money on this and will never listen to it again, I support him and everything that he does, but this just isn't my boat. Good luck Tommy, I hope this all goes over very well for you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"My God...Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, what the hell happened??? I thought you were a ROCK AND ROLL drummer, a ROCKSTAR. There is only 1 rocking song on this album and it whines about how hard it is being famous, poor guy. The rest of it...I'm not sure what to say. I guess you are shooting to be a \\"pop\\"star instead... maybe the Avril Lavigne, Sheryl Crow soak up the sun, safe route is the direction you want to go. Bottom line is...if anyone is remembering the Tommy from Motley Crue or even Methods of Mayhem, forget it...he apparently has left the building. That being said, if you are into music that is non-confrontational, it is no worse than alot of the stuff that pop radio is playing these days.

This CD is so much better than all the other crap thats out there today(Black Eyed Peas?ARE U KIDDING ME?).No one appreciates Tommy muscially cause when you say Tommy Lee, everyone thinks of one thing(sex tape, jail). Tommy Lee is awesome on this CD and even on his previous CD \\"Never A Dull Moment\\". I have both and I recommend both. But I do like this CD slightly better than his previous 1. Tommy Lee is a respected musician to me. Not many others give him a chance, and thats sad.All the songs are awesome. I honestly like every single song. If I had to choose the one i like the least, it would be \\"Make Me Crazy\\", but that itself is still a really good song.I dont buy many CD's, but Tommy's are must haves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not the best?","review":"This album is good,but I was much more pleased with the efferts on \\"Never A Dull Moment\\" this one just seems a bit rushed in it's production,non the less it is a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Album to Complete Your Music Collection","review":"The Tommy Lee Album, Tommyland, the Ride, is one of the best albums of the year.

I NEED YOU is such a great song. If you liked I NEED YOU, you should try the JACKS MANNEQUIN CD in which Tommy Lee returns the favor to ANDREW MCMAHON and drums for a few songs on the album. The rest of Tommyland: the ride is also reall great, but i bought it mainly for ANDREW MCMAHON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhh....","review":"I can't say that this is a bad album, but not really that great either. In my opinion Tommy should stick to what he knows best, and that is the drums. But I do give him credit for branching out. There are a couple good songs on this album. Hello Again is a good tune, the acoustic version being the better of the two. Good Times is not a bad song either. But it all falls into the washedout boring style of pop rock bands like Nickleback is known for. A popular style in todays industry; yes, but boring none the less. There are no memorable / catchy riffs or choruses, nothing to tap your foot too. For each time I sat down to give it a listen to, I found myself falling asleep, daydreaming, or turning it off out of boredom.Tommy is a great musician, but he needs to stop hopping along on everybodies bandwagons, and start driving his own. Maybe then he will release something worth listening to. Until then, I'll stick with his fellow Crue member, Nikki Sixx, and is Brides of Destruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"The book goes in too many directions without a destination.

At times, I was only able to pick up where I left off of by referring to what stage the love relationship was at!!!

A politician, having put a hit out on himself, figures he has nothing to lose and decides to drop all the phony campaign rhetoric and actually say what he really thinks -- sounds like a pretty good film, right? Not when jackass Warren Beatty is involved. Gets 2 stars only because it is such a good idea for a film and it does have a few funny moments. Otherwise, this is a gigantic turkey of a movie. Just how long can one put up with the spectacle of Beatty rapping? What a sickening display. Not only that, but the film is also drenched in Hollywood's typical socialist prejudices. Beatty whips out the usual leftist claptrap about race, class, and privilege. Nothing is quite so precious as watching super-rich, limousine leftist-types preach to the rest of us about what an unfair society we live in. More proof that Beatty hasn't done anything worthwhile since Bonnie and Clyde."},{"rating":"1","title":"dark and stupid","review":"this is so stupid. the highlight is ghetto superstar the song which plays for 30 seconds. it was really dumb. i mean who would want to see a old guy rap about politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bulworth is the Best","review":"Bulworth opens some eyes to what is going on in American politics and big business today. It is also roll on the floor hilarious. I read the reviews posted on the site and those people that think that this movie is about simplistic problem solving missed the whole point of the movie. Everyone knows that there is a problem, Beatty is simply saying that we have wholly screwed ourselves over, and it will be a long time before we get it straightened out again because of the people in power. To me, the movie was more about being yourself, being a spirit, instead of doing all of the stuff that gets you fame and fortune."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE IVE SEEN IN THE PAST 5 YEARS","review":"I saw this movie first expecting to chuckle once in a while (to tell the truth, Beatty isn't a real great actor), But in the end I couldn't stop laughing for at least an hour. It was funny and VERY creative. The rap lyrics were better than the ones the the real rappers think up. Rap on Bulworth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulworth is a joke that I didn't get.","review":"Bulworth's release was delayed in Australia, and no wonder. It's a comedy that's not particularly funny, it's aimed more at American political issues (Australian's have very little interest in their own political issues, let alone other countries), and Warren Beatty's rapping/rhyming senator was indeed embaressing. He doesn't look like a white guy trying to be a black guy, he looks like a white guy trying to be a white guy trying to be a black guy. Halle Berry is an actress that I quite like, but in this she is just an irritating, motormouthed groupie hanging around the aging senator (why would a young, attractive, black woman be interested in a white, 60-something guy anyway). And why does Beatty feel he has to frequently use the foul twelve-letter swear word to get his point across? That alone seems a bit racist."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly awful","review":"Everything about this movie is bad. The politics are liberal socialist nonsense. Warren Beatty's \\"rapping\\" is embarassing to watch, and I believe insulting to blacks. Why is it that Beatty believes the only way to communicate and identifying with black people is to rap. Truly insulting. One of the worst movies I have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what?","review":"Middling political satire about a burned out US Senator who takes a contract out on himself and as a result suddenly feels free to say what he really thinks as he campaigns for reelection. As he does so he begins to feel liberated and regrets the contract. Interesting premise generally falls pretty flat and has an ending that is easily predictable one hour before it happens. The film contains a few funny moments, but unless hearing Warren Beatty rapping over and over is your idea of fun, you can skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubish.........","review":"I can not see th dvd since ther are an limited area code to it - so it is a totalt waiste of money.And the does not replay to me either"},{"rating":"1","title":"unmittigated garbolio","review":"As a political statement it really sucks.

I understand the point Beatty was trying to make, but he should either make it a very dark comedy, or make it a drama. Instead, he tries to do both, and it comes out corny.

Both those movies' reviews, like the reviews below, are either one star or five star. I guess I like unorthodox, unformulaic movies, because I like all of them. Bulworth is original and resonant and funny. (To the reviewer below who thought Beatty was trying to be hip in his rapping, when in fact he was square and unhip. He was TRYING to be square and unhip. He said so in interviews when this movie was out.) A little side-note, the pulse of this movie, believe it or not, was inspired by a Jules Verne story. Beatty personally asked the Verne family if he could take credit for it as an original story, since the plot had changed so much, and they said okay. But the Verne story was about a man who hired a hit on himself, so to give credit here where it is due. I read about this in the book THE GROSS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bulworth","review":"Bulworth explores the term \\"politically incorrect\\" with uproarious results.

I think the people who take Beatty to task for rapping and being insulting to black people, may have missed the entire point. He's not sparing any group here. The film skewers the media, special interest groups and Washington. I guess it's good that it seems to have stirred up some controvery, because this is a film that avoids playing it safe. It's wonderfully photographed, well scored and well acted by all concerned. Beatty gives a young kid the biggest laugh in the film when he's talking to an LA cop. One HUGE negative: the DVD includes no added features of any kind, other than the trailer, which is not a special feature. I would never ever buy any DVD that doesn't offer special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful movie that hit its target area.","review":"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

The film hits all the right buttons with Bulworth's explanation of why he only ventures into the black communities at election time.While Wag the Dog and Bob Roberts were interesting movies they were not funny. How many times does Robert Deniro have to phone in a performance and nevermind Dustin Hoffman doing his best impersonation of movie executive Robert Evans. Bulworth is a great movie while Bob Roberts and Wag the Dog had the potential to be great movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Over Rated!!!","review":"This movie seems to say that democracy is bad, but I will promise you it is better than the alternatives. Sure we have some problems in this country, but anyone who thought this movie was great should move to Russia, or perhaps Kosovo and see what life is like over there. The idea of a US Senator becoming a rapper is ludicrous, and degrading to the honorable office that is the US Senate. This movie stinks, and I would give it zero stars if that was a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political crap","review":"The worst movie ever. Warren Beatty looks clammy and old. Halle Berry is hot, but her acting is worse than Jean-Claude Van Damme's. I didn't understand the plot, if there was one.

No new ground, just fairly inane political, social posturing and commentary that was done better on All In The Family years ago.

Not only did it stereotype inner-city black youths but also the black family and black people as a whole. I tried to look for the humor in this movie but I failed to see it. I tried to look for reasoning behind it but I still don't have any answers. This movie was sappy, poorly written, and frankly, quite boring.

The first 20 minutes or so are funny, satirical, and to the point.The rest of the material is ridiculous. It feels like the writers had a great idea and had no clue how to develop it or what to do with it. I like Warren Beatty and Halle Barry, but this was a low point for both.

It is the story of a corrupt man who has lost all sense of balance and goes insane. He uses his political position to make speeches about corruption, generalizing his own lack of decency to other politicians. The movie shows him gaining acceptance in a depraved underworld of filthy-mouthed criminals equally lacking in values and social conscience. He falls in love with a hired assassin. I knew from the beginning that the movie would be a braindead social commentary, but I quickly switched to sympathy for Warren Beatty that he has degenerated from a legitimate actor to a director glorifying mentally unstable people."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a lousy read","review":"I could analyze all the aspects/characters as some but I won't waste my time.

These radios claim to go up to 20 miles (yes, the title of the item says 18 miles, but the product box it says 20 miles). After the extensive testing this my conclusion; the maximum distance I got in an almost flat area was around 5 miles, not even close to the claimed 20 miles, in a an area where there were some small hills the reception got lost almost immediately as you loose sight of the other person, the same for high hills. For you to get good reception you have to be within sight of the other person, in conclusion for one to get the claimed 20 mile range, the circumstances must be perfect, which in most cases where the radios are going to be used for, are almost impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"bought this for my family to use on a Disney cruise. worked great all over the ship and from inside the stateroom to about 1/2 mile off the boat. security channels worked great even though a lot of two way radios were in use. Compact & durable, I like the rechargeable NiCd or four AAA optionm,lasted all day on a single charge. Battery gauge is bogus, shows full charge up the second it runs empty. Charging system is not intelligent so you have to monitor charge time to preserve battery life and peak charge capacity. Estimate the range in urban areas is about 1 mile, what more do you expect for $40. bought it here from Beach Audio, got it surprisingly fast. good volume and clarity. a bit more complicated to set up than I expected so you need to take the time to understand and teach others how to operate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reading","review":"If you are interested in the Old West, Johnston's books are for you.

This book is a compilation of this conman's 'revelations' from God.The revelations are all self-serving, ranging from heavenly messages giving the dimensions of a home his followers were to build for him to a revelation telling him to live polygamy.This book details over a hundred revelations given to him from God. What a joke. The book is pretty boring, but there are parts that will make you burst out laughing at the ridiculous, outrageous lies he tells his followers as he shines in his free-form revelations.A must have for every Mormons, I am sure. But for the casual reader, I would suggest you have some strong coffee nearby as this book can put you to sleep quickly.If you are looking for a good book on mormonism, this is not it.

My 3-year-old and I have enjoyed several recipes out of that book. I decided to try and find another book that we would enjoy as well. After reading the online reviews for this book, I made the purchase. However, when it arrived, I was disapointed to find a lot of recipes that wouldn't fit my family's tastes. I thought the illustrations for the recipes was a clever idea, but didn't like the idea of flipping back and forth from the drawings to the detailed instructions. I'm returing this book and will again begin my quest to find a cookbook that my kids and I can enjoy together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but could be better","review":"This book is illustrated in a very cute design. I bought it for my twin daughters and was only able to use one recipe. I found it to contain recipes that included items my children (nor my the children of my friends)would ever eat.

While we really enjoyed making a few of the recipes out of this book (esp. the popovers) I have to agree with another reviewer that the format makes it someone difficult to use-esp. on the spur of the moment. The adult really needs to have time to have thoroughly read the recipe and gathered all the ingredients before the kids join you in the kitchen. Then you can flip to the illustrated instructions for the kids. This is a good idea but not always practical. It would of been nice to have the two meshed so that the kids could \\"read\\" the illustrations, while you read the directions. I also found the recipes limited in scope and difficulty, but it is great for cooking with preschool age children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best children's cookbook out there","review":"As soon as I received Pretend Soup, I immediately ordered the other cookbooks by this author. Our family is vegetarian, and none of these meals contain meat (but still would appeal to most meat-eating kids as well). There is a good variety, appealing pictures and easy-to-understand directions. The recipes are simple, but delicious. Even the ones my child did not like, we have talked about what he didn't like and how could we change it?At 4 years old, my son lit up with pride when he prepared his first meal for the family from this book. Now that we have all 3 of them, I routinely let him pick a recipe each week to add to our menu plan.This would make an excellent gift for a family with young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doggie puppet toy","review":"Our Chihuahua loves this toy.

The plot (of the movie as well as the book) has Professor Challenger (Bob Hoskins) leading an expedition to an isolated region of the Amazon, where it is believed prehistoric creatures have survived. Conan Doyle had based his book on the travels to the isolated Roraima region (the border zone between Brazil, Venezuela and Guyana where flat top mountains named tepuis predominate) by explorer Everard Im Thurn. This miniseries was shot in New Zealand (standing in for the Amazon), and the movie deviates from the book in only a minor questions: having a female character in the expedition (played by the fine Irish actress Elaine Cassidy), and, more controversially, a different ending. But the movie is very well made, very exciting, as well as informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"I've seen most of the versions of \\"Lost World\\"...but this one with Bob Hoskins has to be the most entertaining and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should be required reading.","review":"Magnificent contemporary historic work.

Now he argues that it is time to review the benefits o the collective, as we are no longer pioneers. What once was practical may now be considered criminal.However, he lived in a time quite different from our own and it is nigh impossible to predict that we would abolish monopolies and child labor.One of the points made is that we remember people that contributed to society or humanity but we do not remember people that just lived there life got rich and died.Predictions aside, it is interesting to get into HG's mind, which helps us to understand his other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cliff Richard & Don't Stop Me Now","review":"It is GREAT ,he sing like a GOD, I love the cover and the CD it self is like im listing to him in person, he is the GREATEST singer I know and ever want to know...I love Cliff ,You have to have this CD too.

The dark atmosphere, the forboding feel, the real characters, and of course, Aliens. But this book falls way short of the usually high quality in the Aliens series of books. Much of the book is spent building the two main characters. Character building is very important, but is way overdone and drawn out in this book. The reader gets tired of hearing the same things about the same people, through more than the first entire half of the book. For all this time, there is absolutely no Alien action. None! When the shaky storyline finally gets to where it's going, Aliens fans will not be disapointed, but not overly enthusiastic, either.For series collectors and serious fans, the book is an okay read, but is severely lacking what the other books have all presented superbly.

The main characters were so unsympathetically drawn, I was quite indifferent to their fate. I was much more concerned about the fate of their pets! The aliens came across more like nipping ants than the fiercest creatures in the universe. I also felt some of the plot elements were unlikely ( the aliens wouldn't be able to smell the difference between a robot Alien and the real thing?)

I began reading the first chapters with much enthusiasm but soon got bored and uninterested actually. I also felt that this book got stuck on less important details at some occasions, but that might be just me.I like the approach of this book but it didn't really convince, me perhaps I had to high expectations or another title would have served this book better...But I'm not alien to ideas of mankind being related to other planets, systems or nonearthly beings etc.I suggest you borrow this book from your local library instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful","review":"The book is very insightful and well worth the time to read.

In Walkin' Pussy, K introduces us to characters from all walks of life. From the old lady that preys on young men, to the bored wife at home, to the couple that has been married for years while still managing to find ways to \\"get their groove on,\\" K manages to capture the essence of them all.Although the book is not as erotic as the cover suggests, most of the stories are stimulating; some are downright tantalizing. K gives us an intimate look at her characters while managing to convey the \\"moral of the story\\" in the end. If you are not a prude, try taking a walk on the wild side with K.T.

It is not very easy to attach and it often comes unclipped. This causes frustration for the child and inconvenience for the parents. Also for the price, I was surprised to see a cardboard bottom on the pram."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk!","review":"Folks, As great looking this toy is...it is a piece of junk! It breaks easily, and it is rather dangerous. It is practically made out of a cardboard and cheap, plastic pieces...not worth the money. All in all its a great idea, but a very poor product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Colors!","review":"I love the colors and the quality of this 3-in-1 Doll Pram.I got one in a Polka Dot one too.My niece would definitely love this for Christmas.She already has one in a navy blue color before and it's amazing.Got it shipped so quick too!This is great for girls who love to play with their dolls most of the time and can get a little bit rough because the parts are durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosebud Basket","review":"My granddaughter loves it.

My daughter was very excited to get it! Soon after she started playing with it the wheels started coming off!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a favorite","review":"Our four-year-old granddaughter was instantly smitten by this pram. The wheels glide easily, and the multiple features of this pram/stroller/carrier make it very versatile for a little mommie. The only negative is the hinges that raise and lower the \\"hood\\". If you place them in the fully open/locked position they are too hard for a child (or arthritic grandmother!) to open and lower. But the great thing is that the hood stays up fine without placing the hinges in the fully-extended position. It is easy for our granddaughter to maneuver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosebud","review":"Our grandaughter loves her new Rosebud Doll Carrier very much.

I should have known before I bought it anything that comes in box with poles to put together can be a problem if they are not durable. Two of the poles came bent already, so we did put it together but I am afraid my 3 year old will manage to break it soon. I wish I didn't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be proofread!","review":"I'm reviewing algebra after not doing math for almost 6 years. I already had a basic understanding of algebra from high school so this book is good in that it's straight to the point. I'm only about 1/4 of the way through and there's already been 3 instances where the examples have completely confused me because there are mistakes in the problems. Don't believe me? Check out page 14, they're switching the signs when finding the remainder but they don't mention it anywhere in the lesson. On page 40 the exponent is a typo so the solution makes no sense! These are just a few of the mistakes I've come across and I'm sure there will be more so if you're buying this book be prepared for confusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chunky Little Book Perfect For Little Tiny Hands","review":"This book is a perfect first book for a baby in in its size, content, and set-up. Each picture is shown against a white background which makes it easy for the baby to focus without distraction on the featured color. Its size is perfect for tiny hands and the book is sturdy enough to last though multiple children (even with the inevitable chewing of its edges!).See also my review of Spot's Baby Animals. Both books were favorites of my grandchildren who are now in high school and are still a big hit each time I give them. The books are difficult to find in bookstores, so the chance of duplicating something the child already has is low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiny","review":"Thought this was a regular sized board book, but it is tiny! The description should have mentioned the size. My daughter does like it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third is the series is a bit weaker","review":"I think the third book in the Marketplace series is a bit weaker than the others to this point though this Mystic Rose edition is better than the previous version (I would have given only 3 stars). The biggest problem is the main character, Michael LaGuardia, who frankly seems like a poser to me but that may be the intention of the book. We do get a few more insights to Chris Parker and meet the Trainer of Trainers herself in the book. So it is well worth reading if you have enjoyed the previous two books and want a bridge to the fourth in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great positive thinking book.","review":"This book is an excellent source for individuals seeking the truth.

Vanzant has written another winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Becoming the Best You, Without Suffering!","review":"Vanzant doesn't try to fix you, or shame you, or tell you that she has a better way to run your life than you do.Instead, her loving, powerful words are broken down into passages that are small enough for you to read and use daily. Before you know it, bad habits are dropping away, faith is building, and life just seems to be more in sync with your dreams.Very Inspiring!If you love this book, check out WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK, by Ariel & Shya Kane. It also helps you tap into your heart and live at your full potential!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Day My Soul Just Opened Up","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone willing to break old destructive patterns and habits. I am doing the commentaries a second time, and it is better than the first time. I find that I am able to retain the lessons better this time, and even remember the meditations. Thank you Ms. Vanzant for listening to the Divine and giving people such beautiful lessons to help us evolve into their divine spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perception Shift","review":"My first thoughts were that this would be an inspiration book that would give me tidbit information that I could incorporate in my life here and there. Was I pleasantly surprised how Iyanla framed this helpful information. She allows you to look at her life and how she came to certain realizations. I prefer this method. It is always helpful to know that others are practicing what they preach. So I recommend you order this book with an open mind, really apply the principles to your daily life and your perception will change...because the energy you give off will be different. I will continue to re-read this book. I have bought this book for many friends because it is just that helpful! I see my actions and my perception of life differently and in a more spiritual sense.I say, all you need to come in with, is a desire to analyze yourself...forget about Iyanla as a great author,or tv personality. This book is about being a better you and purchasing this book is a great start!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have been reading this book for YEARS!","review":"I purchased this book in 1999.

It arrived on time, in great condition for a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star so far","review":"I can't seem to get through this book. So far I haven't seen anything new, just the usual null content New Age joy-juice. Her writing style is terrible, disorganized and distracting.It strikes me that this is the sort of book for people who wear little guardian angel pins. Easy-fix \\"what's in it for me?\\" type spirituality. Gee, you might as well watch TV to pick up your spiritual fix!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I wish I could say I found this book as good as its marketing hype. However, when you consider the writings of St. Teresa of Avila and others who are acknowledged to have realized a true union with God, this book seems, quite frankly, insulting. It seems to be a book contrived by a marketing expert who told the author that if she came up with a quick-fix formula for finding God and she would have a best seller. The 40/40 formula seems to actually diminish what I am sure was a sincere journey made by the author to find God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I thought","review":"I believe I own every book Iyanla has written but this one caught me by surprise. I didn't realize it was more of a 'checklist' and exercise book.I had thought it'd be like her previous books but it was more of a 'work list' to help you grow vs. her writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spiritually Sophisticated, Self-Revealing Jewel Box","review":"For me, it was time to advance to another level of spiritual awareness. Iyanla's daily exercises and words of wisdom opened numerous and profound doors until my soul just opened up! Do the meditations faithfully, openly and honestly, and expect life altering revelations. Yes, there's much content to absorb but somehow it all sticks. Remember, \\"there is something much bigger happening here.\\" Thank you for sharing yourself Iyanla. Thanks to my husband for this Christmas gift. This is the best 40 days and nights of schooling you will ever receive."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am fascinated by the depth of spirituality in this book.","review":"Last weekend I went to my favorite bookstore seeking a specific read I was clamoring to buy. Unfortunately, the book was not available and as I wandered the bookstore in search of something to read, I came across this wonderfully fascinating book. Iyanla Vanzandt has the uncanny ability to strike at the soul and depths of an individual. Her descriptive prose has made me re-read phrases and passages in order to try to commit them to memory. I've always believed myself to be a person of deep spirituality and understanding. I have felt that my knowledge was complete UNTIL Iyanla enlightened me. Her words have reinforced my beliefs and encouraged my to continue to \\"walk in the spirit\\". I will always walk with her words by my side."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 PLUS STARS!!","review":"I will be the first to admit, I took a lot longer than 40 days to read this book. Mainly because, my soul was so closed, that I had to read certain chapters twice! But this book is so refreshing!! I have totally changed my point of view on life's crisis that once had me bogged down, and my soul closed. Thank you Iyanla! I love you for helping me \\"Open up my soul\\".DYC~"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stunk","review":"This silly, shallow, stupid book was given to me by my lunatic ex- girlfriend and it stunk... hokey, feel good garbage with no depth or real meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry I bought it","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. It was recommended to me by a friend after a tragedy in my life. I was turned off very early on when the author refered to God as He/She. There is only one true God and it is written \\"HE\\". The fact that the author had to compromise her beliefs to please others and continually refer to God as the divine was truly sad. I tossed this book in the fireplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book of Spiritual pricipals to help you grow into Peace","review":"This is an excellent book on real spiritual principals, and spiritual law. I call it my bible. It helped me through a very powerfully spiritual transformation. The book's energy is so very healing all you have to do is hold it and open it randomly. It will give you the spiritual food(truth) your soul needs in that very moment in your situation.It reminds you of what you already know deep in your soul. Once you read it, it will become clear to you what you need to heal your spirit, adjust your thinking, change your actions, overcome fear, and remove your ego. These principals are tools that make life much more meaningfully for you. This book supports the essence of our own spirit and validates the presence of the intangable spirit that is in concert with us all. Thanks you Ayanla Vanzant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting","review":"This a good kick start (or re-start in my case) to exploring your spirituality.

It is taking me a little longer than 40 days to finish (light can blind you if you open your eyes too fast),but every day that I open this book, I find just what I needed help in struggling with. This book is gentle, truthfull, and I can feel the love rolling out of the pages.It is understanding, forgiving, and I feel like I.V. is a personal friend of mine. I have been given a whole new way in which to view the world, my marriage, my children, but most of all, myself. What a blessing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has changed my life!","review":"Never befor have I been so moved by a book after only reading the 1st chapter. I look at my life, my relactionships w/family and friend, and my actions(or reactions)to everything and everyone in a new light. The meditation and prayers do my soul good and quietly bring me to a peaceful state of mind. I've given this book to my mother, sisters, friends and co-workers alike and now they see me with new eyes. A \\"must read\\" for anyone with a dream and a determination to reach it! My God, in Her compassionate wisdom, bless and keep you all."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Meantime","review":"This book by Vanzant has been very helpfulto me regarding relationships. Hopefully it is helping in all my relationships. One mistake that I have made in the past is to let jealousy play a big part and another mistake that I have made often in the past is to focus on the other person instead of focusing on myself.To make myself happy I need to focus on myself and think positive about myself. Ignore that little voice that keeps putting me down. Tell myself I am a good person and I can not expect another person to fill all my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Encouraging Ego and that's all","review":"Ms. Vanzant is good at encouraging us to feel good about ourselves, but doesn't take into account that our lives are not just about \\"us\\". She discourages learning about history, science, and the arts; which can be the thing that brings many of us to life. Too much focus on what are already the problems of the kids in our society. Lack of interest in the \\"whole\\" and the interesting things we can discover if we look outside of ourselves and our small focus. Already our kids and young people have been discouraged from going further in their education to learn more about why and how we are the way we are as humans. The more we learn about other subjects, the more we are able to deal with adversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"One day my soul shut down","review":"I read this book on the first day and you know what I probably would have gotten more out of a labotomy. Reading this book was the day my soul shut down"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is the forbidden fruit, ladies!","review":"I know this author is commercially successful & I am politically incorrect but I don't care. Somethings must be said.This book is wonderfully written and sounds very, very good on the surface. All you have to do is be no more than moderately knowledge about the Holy Scriptures and, like me, you can see the real horror of this book.I know this author is very popular with Oprah Winfrey and women are are \\"searching\\" for meaning in their lives. But don't be fooled! This is just ancient new age philosophy re-marketing thru a contemporary African American female. Nothing more.If readers are so stuck on the publications of this author, then go to the true New Age sources like Rumi or Buddha. The writing is better and the books are less expensive than Ms. Vanzant's.Just see for yourself. Good day."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"i like the chick, i really do. i initially saw her on oprah, all dynamic and inspiring. but, i just couldn't get past the higher power references, which were like every other sentence. i was hoping for more soul work, more generic \\"insert-your-own- faith-or-lack-of\\" here attitude, and less god-related-to-soul references. if you are religious, you will love this book, and i would highly recommend it. if not, you may like her initial concept but be put off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starting the 40 Days","review":"I just started this book, and it seems promising. I can tell that the author tends to focus a bit too much on her own life, but I can relate to the emotional breakdown that she wrote about in the introduction...as long as you can get past that. I'm reading this along w/ A History of God by Karen Armstrong, and during my own faith-questioning journey. Together, these book are great for me. I think 40 Days and 40 Nights goes well w/ any book about religion and theology. It reminds you that only you can determine what is truth to you, and you can view the other matierial w/ an open mind, not committing yourself to believing everything the author has to say. ...So to sum up all this babble...Vanzant's book is very good for those questioning their faith, or on some other spiritual journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritually breathtaking.","review":"When I first started to read the book I had to condition myself to read it every day to do the process properly.

It is enlightening, uplifting, and inspirational while at the same time being just unsettling enough to truly \\"open you up.\\" After reading it, I bought one for a friend. I have since given several as gifts. Each one has been received with high praises. In each case, the appreciation multiplied as the book was read. Buy a case - and give one to every woman you know. Your spirit will rejoice and your soul will find a previously unknown sense of peace as you read and share this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Day My Soul Just Opened Up! Amen","review":"I've read everything that Iyanla has written and attended several of her workshops. I know that I know God but I had forgotten the principles and skills I possess to reach out to him.

No tough techno beats, but delicate mid-tempo drive.No gimmick overload, but a sensitive, very sympathetic arrangement, reflecting the chilly silence of a lost night surfing the web for cyberpleasure. Please wait for the second verse and notice the piano toeing Thomas' voice. This is authentic MT-style. The bridge tightens the drive, and then you lift off to a catchy sing-along chorus, light as a feather. A \\"well done\\" for the lyrics this time.Songs like this made MT unparalleled mega-sellers. Though it appears to be simple, it's got excellent timing, wonderful melody, unique singing and that little extra that has inspired millions of listeners since MT started their career.But VICTORY has got more: \\"Juliet\\" is already legendary, and many songs on this album will be a surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"too bad it's copy protected","review":"I just received the CD last night, and found out it is copy protected, which didn't play in either the car's CD changer nor my portable CD player.. This album won't be playback normally in the computer CDROM. the CD has a build in player program to let you play back, but if you are running on something other then windows (like me) then you are out of luck. After a lot of effort I finally can enjoy the music. Overall it is a very good album, much better then last one. and the mastering is also very good. My personal favorite is #7 When The Sky Rained Fire.I would give it 5 stars if not for the copy protection. The record company is punishing us who lawfully own the music CD. I would really like to obtain a version of the CD without the copy protection"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy if you're a true FAN,","review":"I would say this is the worst album that MT released in their 12 albums series. I have all of their albums and this one was the worst album. No good melody, there are only 2 good songs in this album. Higher than Heaven & Ready for victory. all rest is boring and not entertaining. I only bought this album cause I'm a MT fan since childhood. I like Thomas's voice in the old albums better. He sounded much better, but he still sings good. Skip this album and buy the last one \\"UNIVERSE\\" instead. here's my opinion about their albums:The 1st Album: VERY GOODLet's Talk About Love: VERY GOODREADY FOR ROMANCE: BESTIN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE: VERY GOODROMANTIC WARRIORS: GOODIN THE GARDEN OF VENUS: O.K.BACK FOR GOOD: NOT BADALONE: GOODYEAR OF THE DRAGON: O.K.AMERICA: O.K.VICTORY: BAD!!!

My personal fav is \\"when the sky rain fire\\" which was co-produced by Axel Breitung (who did Silent Circle in the 80's). I am very sorry to read that some people have problem playing this on their car stereo and PCs. I put this on my old Sony car CD changer and it works just fine. I also copy this CD successfully, but I didn't use \\"copy CD\\" option but I copied it one track at a time, it is rather time consuming but the copy works fine on my car CD player as well so those who have trouble with the cd should at least give a try to copy it track by track not copy the entire cd at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non PC Friendly!!!","review":"I play all of my cds in my PCs or Archos Jukebox.

I say bring on the next naughty girl, Ms. Showalter, and keep them coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it used, if you must!","review":"I'm not sure what annoyed me most about this book. The plot holes you could drive a truck through. The plot devices you can see coming a mile away. The heroine who needs intensive therapy to get over her need to kick the ass of every man she meets. The alien world you learn next to nothing about, despite the fact that three of the main characters are aliens. Characters who seem entirely one dimensional.Actually, I'll have to go with that last one. The heroine, Mia Snow, doesn't seem to really connect with anyone in this book, including the hunky alien love interest, and neither do we as readers. If the characters are strong enough, I can over look a lot of problems with a book (say, items 1-4 cited above), but this book is populated by crudely drawn stereotypes I couldn't bring myself to really like. I won't be buying the sequel, just because I don't really care what happens to these people.If you must read this book, buy it used or borrow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written!","review":"I have tried 2 of Showalter's titles, and couldn't finish either of them. I'm going to have to give up on her I guess. She's not a great writer, and her editor doesn't bring her material up to standard.The characters are poorly developed, and the relationships aren't believable. This woman's friends and co-workers support her totally, but we never see any real reasons for that type of devotion. The alien hero (Kyrin) is completely and intensely passionate and committed to a permanent relationship with the Huntress, but those feelings come out of nowhere so fast and intense it's really unbelievable (well, more than any alien story is unbelievable, that is!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting ideas badly written","review":"I read around a third of this book before I finally gave up. It has some interesting ideas in it -- an alien huntress is a nice change from all the other kinds of paranormal heroines -- but it's SO badly written that I couldn't stand to read any more of it. God, what was her editor thinking of, to let this through? Cliche after cliche, dialogue that's supposed to be tough and kick-ass but sounds phony instead: it's like someone put Anita Blake, Eve Dallas, and Spencer in a blender and pasted the result on the page.There are a LOT of people out there now who are writing tough women, and all of them write better than this one; I suggest you read one of those, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read","review":"I love Gena Showalter's Lords of the Underwolrd series so I thought I would try out her Alien Huntress series and I wasn't disappointed.

The behavior of the heroine, Mia, is brutal and off putting.The storyline is that the Alien Hunters have complete authority over all Alien species, judge, jury and executioner. In just the first 100 pages alone you see the heroine committing various forms of police harassment and brutality, all the while thinking to herself how much she dislikes most Aliens. And she's supposed to fall in love with an Alien? Is this supposed to be enjoyable?If this was a male lead I would consider him a villain-and I consider Mia Snow one equally. At one point she tells a suspect \\"you know I have no conscience\\" and I agree.When did equality mean to be equally brutal?0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really disappointed, this book reminds me of JD Robbs \\"In Death\\" series, the girls hard, the guy fights with her til he gets her, I picked up this one and I shouldn't have but I thought that I would give the author another try after I read Pleasure Slave that reminded me of Sherrilyn Kenyon's book Fantasy Lover.

Some authors can carry writing a book in first person point of view, this author is not one of them. On top of that, I hate chick lit, and this reads like one. Chick lit with supposedly sci-fi (not horror, to dainty for that) and is as sensual as talking to my ex-mother in law. The dialogue and the fight scenes read like a bad B movie. And this was lazy--at least she could have done some research into fight scenes. The hero is an alien and he can \\"vanish\\" or as the author says \\"travel molecularly.\\" NOTHING else. Again, no explanation, no research. But hey, it's a sci-fi romance so why do any world building? The readers don't care... As to being erotic? This author should continue to write Harlequin and leave erotica to those authors that know how to write it. Please, can I have my money back???????????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just my opinion","review":"I expected it to be better. For some reason it left me feeling flat. It had some good parts. I liked the fact that the \\"heroine\\" was tough and smart."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was looking forward to trying a new author, especially one who has already written several books. Unfortunately, I doubt that I will waste time on another one by Showalter. The plot and characters were one-dimensional. I liked the original premise, but it was not well executed. The whole book felt very surface. I wound up not really caring for the characters. Mia needed some very intensive therapy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read like fan-fiction written by a 15 year old","review":"Have you ever read fanfiction? Have you read the pieces that seem to have obviously been written by teenage girls, where everyone loves and is utterly faithful beyond reason to the \\"Mary Sue\\" heroine, and \\"deus ex machina\\" is raised to a whole new level as every truly unbelievable twist possible happens to resolve the plot at the end? The only difference is, you actually paid to read this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little disappointed","review":"Showalter disappointed me with this book. I was leery of her at first but her other titles in the Atlantis series are really good but this one was slow in the beginning, and when the book got on track it slowed again. The herione in this book wasn't as memorable as the others from Pleasure Slave and The Nymph King."},{"rating":"1","title":"idiotic extremely violent irritating heroine","review":"I bought this book with good expectations based on the reviews and the fact that I love a good paranormal romance. I was disappointed. The Mia Snow character is really irritating. She's extremely violent, bad-tempered, undisciplined and would be a disgrace to any law enforcement agency (even a futuristic one). Her alien love interest is a classy guy and it's beyond me what he sees in her, since she tries to beat him to a pulp repeatedly. The romance isn't convincing at all. I also thought the primary storyline (alien babies) was hard to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aliens, Cops & Danger","review":"First, the cover design rocks. I was one of the people who thought this was a paranormal romance, but it's more of a science fiction mystery. It's a darker story about an alien hunter, Mia, who has to work with a dangerously attractive -- and plain dangerous -- alien because her partner will die if she doesn't. It's one of those who-do-you-trust? stories and I liked it a lot once I got into it. I was reminded of the politics of non-humans vs. humans in Charlaine Harris's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!! Really Bad!!","review":"I'm a huge fan of paranormal romance. Unfortunately, there was very little romance in this book. The heroine was totally rude, immoral and a totally unlikeable person. I actually hoped that she and the hero didn't get together in the end, believe it or not. As a reader of romance for many years, I've never wished this before.Overall, the book was badly written. I'm not just talking about it being written in first person, just badly written in general. My first time reading this author's work. I definitely won't try her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy a book for its cover...","review":"That's what I learned with this book, I saw the cover and said hmmmmmm and then bought it only to learn this book sucks. It is one run on sentence there no real sense of time maybe cause it's written in the first person no biggie I have never had a problem with that but everything runs together. Fantastic event over fantastic event till it gets to the point I'm rolling my eyes every other page by the end I had started to skim just to finish the damn thing cause I so hated it. The hero was creepy and the heroine was some petite dynamite stick that blew up on everyone and that was her whole personality. The worst part of the book was the conversation with her father it made no sense and the information revealed just threw the whole book into lala land. I really hated this book buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time","review":"I to feel like this book was not written very well. Some of the things that happened in could have been explained better and the romantic aspect of it was not there. The story seemed more writing formula than plot. I have never felt more frustrated reading a book, as a matter-of-fact I put it down and started reading another book, before finishing it.I won't be reading any more of her books.On the other hand I have fallen in love with author Susan Elizabeth Phillips work. Here is a romance writer extraordinaire. Her books have great descriptive plots, her characters are well developed and she makes you laugh out loud or cry. She is a true erotic romance writer for the ages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Series, DVDs in set were defective. Returned One Set So Far","review":"The companies producing these large DVD sets are doing so with such poor quality that I have stopped buying them. I had to return one set of Six Feet Under already when the 5th DVD would not play. Was almost going to buy The Wire Complete Series DVDs until I read all of the negative reviews about defective DVDs. Don't want to spend lots of money only to find that DVD 16 and/or 20 won't play. By that time return will be impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"SFU review","review":"Finally, the complete six season set. I wasn't the biggest fan of the show, but it nevertheless, was a good show that I watched weekly. The show did have some very dark sides to it, but that may be of great appeal to some. It also got a bit \\"cooky\\". Not that the show got weaker as it progressed, but season one was probably the strongest season. For under $100, I would recommend this dvd set. Enjoy!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series ever","review":"Complete collection of the best series ever, what more could you ask for?? The box set perfect for the series in its design. Additionally, the fact that it comes with the obituaries for all the characters makes it a must have. If you love the series, definitely get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six Feet Under","review":"With the end of the series it's great to see a complete box set of this superb show. Each season gave us highs and lows, as well as dark humour and touching, poignant relationships. The way it covers the various issues of death is refreshing and you really became involved following the lives and trials of the main characters. The seasons had many story lines, from the illness on one family member, to the development of another's art career, to the various boyfriends of Ruth (the mum in the series) and way more besides. What better way to celebrate one of the most original series to come out of America in years than to buy, watch and enjoy this outstanding boxset?Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST show EVER put on TV and GREAT deal here!","review":"The most brilliant show of television history was Six Feet Under. This series ends the way that such a high-brow should and with dignity. The show only ended because Alan Ball is now wanting to make films and win some more well-deserved Oscars. I will not ruin the ending but the last episode is monumental and life-altering! Buy this season and watch all 5 seasons (and save money).[...] Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this","review":"Do not buy this collection! Apparently HBO is releasing a REAL complete series set for just 280 bucks, that includes a new booklet (Obituaries), a family tree, and the 2 soundtracks that were released. It's coming out October 31!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great packaging, but a little tight.","review":"Obviously, this is a great show. I didn't buy the DVDs until now because of HBO's insane pricing, so I was happy when this came out (and in such a neat box, too). The only problem I have with it is that the individual seasons and \\"In Memoriam\\" booklet are wedged inside very tightly. It's really difficult to pull a season out, so I've had to take the \\"In Memoriam\\" booklet out of the box for more ease. Not a huge problem, but one that grows increasingly annoying. Still, definitely a great box set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birth, Loss, Sickness, Old age, Death. What an adventure!","review":"No need to extol the virtues of the show, it's all in other reviews. Just know that in the west we now have our own 21st century version of \\"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\\" and it's called \\"Six Feet Under\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Television Series Of All Time?","review":"Well, it's certainly up there. Watching Six Feet Under is a life changing experience. Having been on HBO, most of mainstream America has yet to watch this show, and many have probably never heard of it. This is unfortunate. This show will make you a better human being. Stop reading reviews and buy it right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"This arrived so quickly, I was impressed greatly! I bought it as a gift for an as-yet-to-come anniversary, so we haven't actually watched them yet. However, I assume they actual discs themselves will be as good as everything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a DVD set.","review":"The set i ordered was a new product - each DVD is in its own envelope/page - no scratches noticed. I've only watched four of the DVDs, but no problems so far. I'd say something witty at this point, but I'm too depressed from knowing how this series' plot evolves."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Set MISSING Items, Amazon gave a good partial refund","review":"I got this as a gift for my girlfriend, and she loved it, right up until we opened the box and discovered the booklet and the 2 soundtrack CDs were MISSING. It was completely factory-packaged and shrinkwarpped. There is an insert sheet describing all the wonderful features of this box set, and the missing items are mentioned, but they are MISSING.I see that the original seller, AMAZON, isn't listed as a seller anymore, and that this item has been DISCONTINUED by the manufacturer. I'm hoping Amazon can make this right by sending the missing booklet and the 2 soundtrack CDs.UPDATE: These gift sets aren't being produced anymore, and Amazon is out of them, but they stepped up and fixed the situation as best they could, in the form of a 50% refund. \\"As best they could\\" is pretty darn good!

Beautiful, though weak, package design.","review":"The series is wonderful. One of TV's best in recent years.The reason I rated this item a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the shoddy manufacturing. Be careful not to set the individual season boxes on a table and slide them across, because the ink or whatever it is will wear down very quickly, leaving white splotches of wear all over the box. Also, one of the bottom sides of my box set has split completely along the seam. And the 'grass' on the top flakes and falls off, making a sort of mess. All this from minimal movement and placement on a book shelf.But despite the construction, the content on the discs makes this box set well worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"six feet","review":"i am totally in love with six feet under.a stroke of brilliance.this item may be hella expencive but is well worth it i watch them on a regular basis.and they really make you greatful that your alive now.(if it is somthing to be thankful of){who knows}.but it is amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of DVDs, not series","review":"I buy DVDs instead of streaming videos because I need subtitles.

I've purchased several times and always exactly as described, well packed and fast ship!! I highly recommend them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Lovely","review":"Is this series flawed? I think not. The packaging is a little flimsy compared to the hard-box season one I bought before I gave in a just bought the set, but really that's my only critique. Umm.. I guess if you watch it for three days straight in a dark room eating cheese puffs, the characters can seem a bit stock, but calling them flat would still be an exaggeration. Great show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"Although at times I felt I had become addicted to a glorified soap opera with highly dysfunctional characters, overall this series is phenomenal, and the final episode is spectacular. Its creator is Alan Ball, the director of the movie American Beauty. 6 Ft. Under follows events in the lives of the Fisher family of Fisher & Sons Funeral Home. Someone dies at the beginning of each segment, and the Fishers handle the funeral. This is a perfect drama for death-denying Americans. No punches are pulled, with very little off-limits as the Fishers struggle with one another and with their partners and friends as they explore life in Los Angeles, which includes sex, drugs, and the latest in awakening workshops. Often funny, the story also brings tears. Mostly it makes it impossible to deny that we are all dying and now is the time to live and forgive."},{"rating":"1","title":"too racey for us seniors","review":"we began to watch the series but soon were turned off by the unacceptable scenes and dialogue.

It's about a completely dysfunctional family who runs a funeral home. Lead character is oldest brother who meets a woman whose family makes the Manson Family look like Ward and June Cleaver. The only normal character is Rico, the mortuary assistant. I kept watching, thinking \\"God, this HAS to get better.\\" It didn't. Can't recommend buying or viewing this, but would suggest every cast member deny ever appearing in it. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAR TOO MUCH GAY SEX FOR ME","review":"Had I known that gay sex would be so frequent and graphic throughout I would never have purchased this series. I grant you that the story lines are interesting but most of the gay sex episodes border on porn for me and my family. Was embarassed to have other people with us while viewing this highly rated series. I am not a prude but based on the ratings given, clearly many in society are more accepting of this kind of material than others. The DVDs should be rated X to alert people before they purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six Feet Under should be buried..","review":"Whole series seemed to be about a bunch of sex starved drug addicts with no boundaries or integrity who constantly sought to draw as many others into their misery as possible. Glad I only bought this set from a resale shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Packaging","review":"I bought this because I've heard such good things about the series. But I only got to see the first episode from this boxed set because after that the discs were unwatchable. I had heard the packaging was bad, but I didn't think it could possibly be this horrible. When I removed the discs from the box some of them had paint on them and others had glue on the edges. I couldn't watch it and had to send it back. Safe to say I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SERIES EVER-GREAT VALUE","review":"I love this series and it definitely was a great value when I picked it up.

It was better than watching it on HBO whenever i was able to catch an episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's OK. I learned something watching these.","review":"It is not a bad series. I just got bored after the first season, cause they were no hot women to watch here. All of these women looked so normal. And their characters were crazy!

I was hoping for a more breathable product, not sweaty polyester to sleep under."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crunchy Bedding","review":"You can't debate the fact that this is one of the cutest \\"space\\" prints for bedding on the market. With that said, I should have followed the recommendations from the reviews for the matching sheet set for the Out of This World bedding. The bedding must be made of low grade cotton or so over-dyed that the material is literally harsh/crunchy to the touch. This also goes for the sheet set and matching pillow sham. It does not soften with washing and/or fabric softeners. Although cute, if it's not comfortable what's the point. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Cute As The Picture","review":"I had been looking for a space themed bed spread for awhile.

It's their second release; features a great combination of dance music, r&b, and even a little jazz. It's got a great vibe from start to finish; very solid throughout. Very head-nod-friendly.Good stuff. It's too bad this band basically fell off the face of the earth after this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caron Wheeler's absence is sorely felt!","review":"Although vocalists Kym Mazelle, Victoria Wilson-James, Lamya, and Marcia Lewis perform well on their respective solos, the powerhouse performances of Caron Wheeler from the group's first album drops this recording down a few notches.With that in mind, the instrumental selections are clearly the better offerings here: \\"Time (Untitled)\\" and \\"Courtney Blows\\", are jazzy enough not to be pop and pop enough not to be jazz.That is Soul II Soul's contribution to the music industry: being something for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic in its own right!","review":"It was hard to come close to the originality of their first offering, but Jazzie B and his fellow Funki Dreds along with some of the most underestimated divas in the business provided fans of true R&B with a timeless taste of pure soul!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Eyesight: The Complete Magazines of William H.

LOOT was perfect. After a few games, my kids were able to teach their dad a lesson or two on the high seas. The games are relatively quick, and the math never gets too complicated for a 7 year old. They loved Loot so much, they once cast aside their Apple gadgets to play this game instead at a restaurant. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Card Game","review":"I bought this for my 10 yr old nephew for Christmas. Since the family is big into games of all kinds, I hoped this would be a good card game for everyone to play together. I did actually get to play it before they left that day, and I was pleasantly surprised! It was fun without being too easy, and once we got the hang of it, it went smoothly with enough strategy for the adults without being too hard for the younger ones.It's probably better for younger kids (vs. an all-adult game night) but if it's a light-hearted card game you're after, then this one definitely fits the bill, whatever get-together you're having."},{"rating":"2","title":"AARRRRRR ye ready for some fun?!","review":"Great game with great rules. Just as fun, if not more fun to play in teams. I really like the artwork on the cards, which is important for card games. Being a card game, I can see the cards showing wear after a while, but mine have not yet after a year's worth of play. A lot of strategy required to win this game, and typically not the same strategy from one game to the next. All kids (over 7 or so) and kids at heart will love this game. I am 27 and love to play with my grandparents. Great game at just the right price. Pick it up, and be happy you did so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for young kids, limited replay with adults.","review":"A very light game. I played this with my 5 year old daughter and enjoyed it. It can be played as a counting game with young kids, and, fortunately, requires no reading, making it viable for pre-kindergarteners. It doesn't really stand as much for adult gamers, though. A few playthroughs and you are going to be done. Still, great for playing with young kids and learning counting, though. You really can make it fun with pirate talk, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best all-age game ever for under $10","review":"I got this game for my kids (9 & 5). It was cheap, well rated, and didn't have lots of pieces to lose, thought it would be good for camping, traveling, etc. My kids LOVE it, they want to play it all the time.What I didn't expect was it being a hit at the adult game night as well. Very simple, very quick to pickup, loads of fun, yet doesn't take forever. Best $10 I ever spent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why buy this?? There are so many better card games!","review":"I'm surprised at the number of positive reviews.The best, and maybe only good thing, is the artwork on the cards...the pirates are funny looking.But this is a rather boring game that has almost no replay value. It's just same old same old each time. Our son liked it for a while (around age 10) but we're glad to not have this in our house any more.If you are looking for a fun card game you can play with kids, here are a couple games we prefer significantly to Loot:DominionFive CrownsWizardFluxKuudukBohnanzaCitadelsMonopoly Deal7 Wonders (I'm stretching the definition of \\"card game\\" a bit, but this is a great game too.)If you have a TON of games, playing this once or twice a year won't kill you, but why buy this when there are better games?(If you've never tried Dominion, get the original...we can play for HOURS on end.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good warm up game that is quick to learn","review":"While I agree with some other reviews that the rules are somewhat ambigous we made a house rule that you can tie the pirate ship strength and the winner is the last person to meet or beat the previous people. This is how ship captians and the admiral work to at our house.The game is easy to learn and takes about 10 minutes or so to play through. The worst part for us is we have never had more than 3 people play at once and we have never tried the team part of the game. Besides that it is a fun warm up game that usually leads us into a longer night of strategy games. I would recommend it overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family game","review":"We've had this game for our family for a few years and we play it regularly with the kids. We all love to play... it's a blast! It's easy to learn and teaches the kids some strategy skills. We brought it on a vacation when our nephews were along and they became addicted to it, so we bought them one for Christmas. They love the game. Great for kids who love the pirate theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treachery on the High Seas","review":"This game is great for two reasons: it's rules are simple and it requires strategy to win. It's a very fast-paced game too, so there isn't much waiting between turns. It teaches addition to kids and helps adults stay sharp with basic math skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game.","review":"This game is great. Bought for kidds 11 & 10.Artwork is pretty cool.Kids always want to play this game over the other 9 I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"a lot of fun - ages 7 and up","review":"Friends from out of town introduced us to this game, and the time passes so quickly with this game. The instuctions are a little laborious, but once you start playing everyone catches on. It's a strategy game at several levels. The cards have 1) pictures of merchant ships with differing levels of loot (gold pieces) 2) pirate ships at various 'power' levels and 3) pirate admirals (trump card, effectively.) As the game progresses players attempt to capture other players' merchies and maximize gold pieces while trying to prevent their own merchies from being captured.Trust me, it's fun for the family. And of course, everyone can talk like a pirate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I bought this game after reading some great reviews online. I thought it would be a good game toplay as a family as we've begun to have family game nights again. Needless to say it was a huge flop.We played it one time, and noone liked it.

It is seemingly based on an old story about possesed red shoes that dance their victim to death. This one has a ghost twist and some other complications. Overall the movie is over the top (the shoes have a scary theme song) and it is an open ended movie. Rent first!!Storyline cut and pasted from that release:After catching her husband cheating with another woman, Sun Jae takes her young daughter and moves into a dilapidated old apartment building to start a new life. Heading home from work one day, Sun Jae finds a strange pair of high-heeled red shoes located inside her subway car, and decides to take them with her.

It generally does what it is supposed to do. However, it was nearing time for me to renew. SpySweeper becomes a huge, irritating nag when it comes time to renew. Not only does the software bug you all the time, but Webroot sends out reminder e-mails too. With 3 weeks left on my subscription, I decided to renew, mostly just to get rid of all the nagging. Well, guess what? - the renewal process reset my expiration date. Rather than giving me 3 weeks plus 1 year, the renewal starts immediately, and ends in exactly 1 year - which means, that I've been ripped off for 3 weeks of paid subscription. Maybe Webroot thinks their users are too stupid to notice this deceptive practice of moving up renewal dates. I've complained to them - and if they don't make amends, then I cannot recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!

Tried out XoftSpy software and it found and removed ALL of the spyware.Even more, I get constant e-mails from Webroot telling me that my \\"Subscription needs to be renewed.\\" and that I must send in another $25 to renew. I got caught in their scam once until I started checking my subsciption date. They frequently send out banket e-mails telling people their subscriptions are up even though they may have as much as a year left. I have contacted them several times on this issue with no response or correction.I am only keeping this software installed because I paid out the bucks for it.

For the second copy, the registration system never worked, so the program refuses to update on the web site. There is no way within the program to register and no useful info on their support web site on how to fix this problem. I opened an online support ticket more than 2 days ago and no response. Waited on the phone for 15 minutes, then was cut off and told to leave a message, no return call more than a day later. For a program like this, if you can get updates, it is useless.

Tech support's response to my query: our test program generates many false positives. My response: what a sales tool!I've found that this program certainly detects many cookies.

I set the volume at mid level. Whenever the whole orchestra played a chord the sound distorted badly. The piano sounded washed out. I then played a B.B. King cd, again at medium volume. The bass was completely distorted. I tried moving the speakers and adjusting eq in itunes to no avail. Don't even try playing anything loud. It should also be noted that there is a fixed wire coming out of one speaker that connects to the other speaker. This wire is quite short which I found restrictive. Apple pushes these so I expected more. I'm very disappointed with these speakers. 2 stars instead of one because they don't freak out at low volume. Otherwise, thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"These speakers are just not very good and thats the bottom line. I bought them due to great reviews and I wanted more volume out of my iMac. It turns out that my built in audio on my iMac sounds better and louder than these speakers.

She assumes that Blake's views of Zinzendorf, who died when Blake was 3, are accurate, which in many cases is simply not true. I have checked her footnotes on many of the exxaggerated references to Zinzendorf and the Moravians, and in many cases the reference simply does not support the bulk of her statement. She labels any group that had any sort of secret ceremony or practice as being \\"occult\\" or \\"Rosicrucian.\\" Occult is technically correct, simply meaning \\"hidden,\\" but it is a loaded word for most readers. She labels the Ephrata Cloister group as being Rosicrucians entirely without any evidence or documentation. Being familiar with Beisel's group, I have NEVER heard any suggestion that they had any connection with Rosicrucianism.The amount of speculation and sensationalism in this book undermines what should be a fascinating exploration of Blake."},{"rating":"2","title":"kite uncut","review":"It was a good watch and a real eye opener to those who only watched the censored version.

Probably Bern's best efforts to date.I must admit, his politcal commentary is good and all - but it's the humor that keeps me coming back.

(By the way, if you want to hear them check out the Kronos Quartet album \\"Night Prayers\\" - the opening track has them featured.)Wasteland is just too great for words. And yes, this album has \\"that song about Marilyn Monroe\\" on it.

The original release did NOT include Ode to the Banana King, Song for Eric, Happy Phantom (live), Ring My Bell, Happy Workers, or Workers. If you pay $125 and you get a cd that includes any of these songs, you've been sold a cheap bootleg that you could have gotten for $10.And to be honest... would the original Y Kant Tori Read album actually be worth spending that much money? Probably not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bootleg","review":"I hate to break it to you, but this is a bootleg.The original \\"Y Kant Tori Read\\" album does not have any B-sides, and the cover art is not nearly as purple."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not as bad as all that!","review":"I quite like this album. It's not Little Earthquakes, obviously, but for an earlier work it's got some good Tori-quirkiness,some unusual lyrics, and some songs such as \\"Fire on the Side\\" and \\"Cool On Your Island\\" I would enjoy in any context.

To say I am disappointed by this movie is putting it mildly. Again, this is another movie of which the standards were extremely poor.The audio and visual of this movie were in any case extremely saddening. To see that movies made by Arabs, for the Arab Americans who reside in this country or any other country for that matter, are made with such total lack of resources or talent is maddening to say the least.Salam, which is the main character,(whose voice is played by an adult woman I might add) is a boy who could be drawn into a world of lies and thievery.Thankfully, Salam has religious parents who would not let this be. The moral of the story is the only redeeming quality. A person must not lie or steal.

Now the FloodSafe mechanism appears to trip if the water pressure goes up past about 2 and 1/4 turns of the water supply knob.I didn't have to disconnect to reset, I just turned the knob until the supply was completely off, then turned it on gradually as the toilet was filling until the mechanism tripped. It still works, sure, but the toilet fills at about 1/4 its previous rate, which is not a huge deal but would be truly impractical in a home with kids for example with lots more bathroom traffic than I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"neat idea but needs work.","review":"There's to many problems with these. They are a very substandard. Depending on how close your toilet is and how much pressure that line has will create problems. Also these are not friendly with the Fluidmaster fill valves which seem to be the most popular fill valves. To be honest how likely is your line actually going to break to cause a full force flow for this to even kick in. My advice is stick to a basic mesh line and check your system yearly for leaks/wear and tear..etc...etc. Also check your water meter for any leaks.

If you had asked me to list three subjects on which it would be impossible to write hard SF, the fundamental nature of reality would have been #2. Forget the Hugo and Nebula; this book deserves a Nobel Prize. \\"Permutation City\\" is the only truly perfect hard SF book which I have ever read, and I've been reading Niven and Pournelle since age nine.Permutation City is the only fiction book I keep in my reference section. As an SF fan since age seven, and a member of the first generation to grow up with computers, it takes an awful lot to give me a sense of future shock.

Read it or else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure intellectual stimulation.","review":"Immortality, the nature of conciousness, the nature of reality, and more. This book is hard science fiction at its very best. I cannot think of another book to rival this one in terms of pure intellectual stimulation. Egan takes a few simple ideas and runs with them as well as anyone writing today. The writing is wonderful, the characters are interesting, but oh! the ideas, the ideas are grand! This book took me forever to read; so many times I would read a paragraph then stare into space and think about the ramifications and possibillities.

Also there's a description of a meal and the food is terrible and the portions small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much technical detail, too little plot","review":"There are a lot of interesting ideas in this book, but unfortunately none are fully developed. There is very little plot and the characters, who were difficult to tell apart, are simply devices to carry out the techical details.

I can't begin to count how many times I almost put the book aside due to the highly disgusting, graphic violence, and confusing plot. Then I would remember how much I really *wanted* to like this book, since I'm a fan of science fiction and also a software developer and computer simulation consultant, and I would continue on. This evening, I finally had my fill of the garbage and decided to toss this book in the trash, despite the fact that I could likely make $25 or so selling it.

Full of excellent ideas and strong emotion. Although the main characters seem a little bit forced, the flow of the novel is brilliant and the ending is beautiful in an odd way. This book works on so many levels. It's the standout among Egan's novels for me.The saddest thing is comparing this novel to his latest work \\"Zendegi\\". Perhaps Egan has stopped trying, or perhaps with success comes complacency. Permutation City is a masterpiece of speculative and predictive science-fiction; but Zendegi is one of the most plodding, dull, unimaginative pieces of predictable diatribe I've ever had the misfortune to start reading.

The rest of the book is devoted to a history of Germany, a biography of Stauffenberg and other non relevant details.

Andy Lau is a tremendous actor as is Lau Ching Wan. these two bounce and feed off each other beautifully in this cat-and-mouse movie. both use one another for personal gain yet when things get intense they are there to help the other out. i was just amazed when i finished watching it. this is definitely one to add to any person's movie collection, whether you are die-hard HK or not. subtitles shouldn't scare you away. trust me and see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a hoot!","review":"This movie proves that to make a suspenseful thriller does not necessarily require a big budget and lots of explosions. The action is centered around a \\"72-hour game\\" between Andy Lau, playing a criminal with 4 weeks to live, and Lau Ching-Wan, taking the role of a crack police negotiator. The action cinematography is as thrilling as the interplay between Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan is entertaining.The picture and sound quality of the DVD version are about average, although I was somewhat disappointed that the Cantonese track is not quite up to par with the Mandarin track. For non-Chinese speakers, there are several subtitle languages available, including English, Thai, as well as traditional and simplified Chinese characters.Overall, this is well-done, fun film, and you definitely don't have to be a Hong Kong cinema buff to enjoy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for browsing, not using","review":"I can't recommend this book at all. While there are a lot of recipes in it, you'd be hard-pressed to find a particular drink you wanted since there is no index of drink names. Although divided into general categories (Tropical Drinks, etc.), within that chapter the drinks are not organized in any logical way (like alphabetically). The index only lists ingredients, mainly types of alcohol, so you could look up \\"vodka,\\" and then check the 88 pages listed if you were trying to find, say, how to make a Devil's Torch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing!","review":"Picked up this book, as it was written by a reporter from my state and I try to support the locals.

Kids today can't relate to the horrors of something like the Holocaust, and providing as much background knowledge as possible is critical. This movie very closely follows the story of the Franks and the other people in the Secret Annexe as it was told by Miep Gies. It gives the perspective of those who bravely hid Jews from the Nazis. My students are in awe of those who so willingly risked their lives for the sake of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"This is a very good depiction of the people who actually hid them. There are many versions on Ann Frank but none on the Heises.There is no one actor or actress that I can say was the best. They were all excellent and they could not have done a better job of it. It made me feel both sad and angry. Sad because of what happened in that time and angry for the same reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have book","review":"Very good book.

I understand that Brainard was very ill, but he needed more than physical help. His mental outlook was so melancholy that he was obviously in need of a good physician to improve this problem.

As you can see God uses him in miraculous ways. A false prophet is one who directs people to worship other gods or themself, Todd does not do that. He exalts the King of Kings and Lord of Lords and is evident in his walk and fruits of the Holy Spirit.His book is an autobiography of his life and what God is doing. Beyond fascinating people get healed in his meetings and revivals. Its all about God and we too should be obedient and hungry to do John 14:12.This book documents what God has done and his staff was there to back him up. He is the real deal and so different that he does not fit the mold of the usual christianity that we like to box ourselves in.

I bought for a camping trip which is where we opened it and learned to play. Since then we can't stop playing. The thing is, it is fun for me and my husband AND for our 3 and 5 year old. The 3 year needs to be on a team with one of us, but the 5 year old can play alone now. There is some easy math in it which makes it educational too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome card game for everyone","review":"Bought this as a gift for a 7 year old girl and my 7 year old boys.

Fun for adults too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tutor's Review","review":"About 3 years ago, the tutoring company I worked for recommended Sleeping Queens. I bought it right away and since have used it with 60+ students from K-12th grade! They all love it! Boys and girls! And it teaches them how to work within a complex set of rules and enjoy it!! They even teach it to their siblings!!I suggest adding the cards slowly as players begin to understand what each card does without overwhelming anyone. I start off with only Kings, Queens, and number cards. Once this makes sense, I add in the knights. Then, the sleeping potion. Then, the dragons. Finally, the wands. I find that I usually leave the jesters out. This really helps my students learn how to attack a problem in steps! Plus, it keeps the game new for quite a while!!!I would highly recommend this game to all ages! Just be prepared to have your kids wanting to play it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Family Favorite","review":"We bought this game with the sole purpose of qualifying for free super shipper savings. Little did we know it would be such a hit with our kids. Our four year old daughter is addicted to this game. There is simple math involved, which she doesn't quite get yet, but she does understand how the game is played, the objective, etc. We have owned it for about a month and the cards are showing some wear and tear already. Great game to teach counting and simple addition. Not too bad for adults either. Most kids games aren't a whole lot of fun to play over and over, but this one really isn't too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Interesting, Right Amount of Time","review":"My 8 year old and I really enjoy playing this game together. It's fun, has the right mix of thought (adding card points), strategy appropriate for an 8 year old (whether to steal or not a queen), and fun (cards are beautifully illustrated and very silly.The play is very straightforward - there are 12 sleeping queens and you 'awaken' them with a king card. But knights can steal an awakened queen, dragons can defeat nights, potions can put an awakened queen to sleep, and a wand can stop a potion. Queens have points - get enough points and you win. In addition, to keep the game moving, there are numbered cards that have their own way of being played to help you draw more cards each turn.In all - highly recommended. We love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this game!","review":"I wanted to find a game that I could play with my 2 girls ages 12 and 7. I read some reviews and decided this game sounded good.

My eight-year-old is fast & furious; the five-year old needs a little finger counting to benefit from the math, and the four-year old can't do the math, but can still play (against patient opponents). The whimsy of the art is great, and the included story about how the game was invented by a child has inspired my daughter to create games of her own. The game has more options for choices and tactics than a chance-only game like Candy Land, but has enough random chance that even the youngest kids can get lucky and win. Given how much we like it and the price, I bought a couple more sets to give as birthday presents.How can you not love a game with a \\"pancake queen\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a game that isn't boring for the adult!

It's absolutely AMAZING!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids would give it 5 stars","review":"Our kids love this game. Note they are boys, it doesn't matter. Fun basic game. I didn't give it 5 stars because as I enjoy this game, it is not a game that I would pull from the closet to play. But if the kids get it out, I will play it. Graphics are fun and cute.If you like this you would also like Rat-A-Tat or Five Crowns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game","review":"We bought our girls aged 7, 9, and 11 a game each. The Sleeping Queens was the winner hands down. They love it! It is the first thing they want to do each morning. I like it too. The girls really like the art work on the cards too. They realized that the pictures on the number cards represented one of the queens, little things like that make Gamewright games fun. Great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A game for kids that adults enjoy too","review":"We play Sleeping Queens before bedtime almost every night. So many kids games, while entertaining to the kids, are nearly intolerable to the adults. But this is actually entertaining. My daughters, ages 6 and 8, just love it. They sometimes pull out Playmobil or other figures to act it out the waking, stealing, dosing, and defending as we play. Though that takes longer and sometimes they get side tracked. As someone else mentioned, the kids can play it without help.My one argument is that in the game the knights steal the queens, and the Dragons defend them. It should be the Dragons who are stealing away the queens, and the Knights should rescue the queens from the dragons. That's the way I've always heard the fairy tales, anyway. The first half dozen times we played it we kept getting it wrong. We tried just switching the rules about the cards and doing it the way we wanted, but there are more knights than dragons and it didn't work as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our favorite card game!","review":"Once you play this game with your kids it will be an instant favorite! All of our kids friends want or have purchased this game also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"We bought this game for my 5 year old daughter, and she absolutely loves it!

He requests it every night before bed time. He caught on to the rules quickly and there is just enough math to make it challenging and fun, but not a chore. I love to play too. Great all around family game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A BIG hit!","review":"I bought two of these games for Christmas gifts. One for my 9 year old niece and one for my 6 year old son. Initially, my son balked. I thought he would. It does seem girly. The fact that a kid came up with the idea didn't impress him either. After I finally talked him into playing - he was hooked after one game. Our family plays games to wind down before bed several times a week and this has become a favorite. Even his dad requests it. He's also taken this game to play at sleepovers with this Aunt and cousin.My extended family also has a tradition of playing games at get-togethers such as Christmas. Sleeping Queens was the big hit this year and the adults pretty much took over the one I'd given my niece just that day. Bottom line this game is FUN for ALL ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this card game!","review":"This turned out to be a great game that both our kids (6 & 10) love as well as us!

My 4-, 5- and 7-year-old boys love it, and are able to play it independently. I like it too; it's not like some other kid games that are so boring that I cringe whenever they ask me to play. I am always glad to play this with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most popular game in our house right now","review":"We are a game-playing household and have tons of games, but right now this is the one my 4-year-old always asks to play. My 7-year-old loves it too. Very simple to learn and quick enough to play 2 or 3 games in a sitting. They love the art and the mechanic of stealing queens from the other players. The bit with discarding number cards by making an addition problem (1 + 4 = 5 so you can discard your 1,4, and 5) is a little hard for the 4-year-old but you can still take your turns without it, as it rarely puts you at a disadvantage to miss one of these. It also is teaching him a little math, because he likes to list out his number cards aloud and ask us \\"do I have a 'quation\\"?No reading required, which is great for younger kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Card Game!","review":"We bought this for our then 4-year-old - and at age 6 it's still his favorite game, and one of ours too. The aunts and uncles even ask to play it when they visit. The cards are fun and colorful, the game is fast and is even educational in that it helps teach them math and strategy, without having to know how to read. Lot's of competition over stealing the favorite queens as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for kids and adults? Kids maybe...","review":"I picked up this game based on the glowing reviews. I did not expect any deep strategy, but even kids games should require some meaningful decision-making. I have played six or seven rounds of this and I have yet to encounter any meaningful decision making at all. Zero. It's hard to dislike a game that is this cute, and I can see how it would appeal to children between the ages of say, five and nine. But good family games are both simple to learn and challenging to master and Sleeping Queens is only simple to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent game for kids of all ages!","review":"My kids received this game for Christmas two years ago, and it's still a family favorite. At the time they were 6 and 3. It's been a great tool to reinforce math facts. The game requires matching, building simple equations with totals of no more than ten, and logic. It's a game the entire family enjoys. It's going to be a gift we give to many of the kids' friends this year. Highly recommend it if you're looking for a quick game that contains hidden (from the kids) educational components."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for any age.","review":"This game was made up by a 6 year old. We have had it for over a year and still love to play it. My kids are 6 and 8 and love to play because the rules are straight forward (so you have less time reading the rules and more time playing!), and the illustrations on the cards are fabulous. It is a great family game, the games only last about 10-15 minutes. I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game to play with the kids","review":"As always, a cracking good game from those fantastic folk at Gamewright.

My five year old has played it everyday since Christmas (about 2 1/2 weeks now). The adults can only handle it once or twice a day but she probably could go all day.

We played this by far more than any other game we had. Our five year old caught on quickly and has since taught several other family members how to play.

This is a favorite among the adults too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favourite for more than a year","review":"My son (10) and daughter (8) have not tired of this game in the past 18+ months that we've owned it.

Congrats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for boys, too!","review":"My six-year-old son received this for his birthday from his cousin (also a boy, who wasn't quite six at the time). The game appeals to boys since in addition to queens, it features kings, knights, dragons, sleeping potions, and wands. Number cards are used for simple one-digit addition, which many children now learn in kindergarten, so I think that the game is appropriate for children from toward the end of the kindergarten year on up. The combination of fun characters (brightly illustrated), strategy, and education make this game a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for younger children","review":"Game has been great for a 6 yr old, and even kids as old as 10 have enjoyed playing.

It's too bad that the talent and tone were wasted on the songs found on this disc. Part commercialized stuff targeted for the masses, part sub-par pop-rock, none of it really comes off as truly great music. About the only song I really enjoy on here is \\"Don't Look Back\\". Pretty much every single on here I've heard on Classic Rock radio about a thousand times, and the rest of it just put me to sleep.

It would have been nice to include \\"Hitch A Ride\\" from the debut, too, but I guess they couldn't have TOO many songs from the debut, else there'd be no reason for people to buy it!

Both of these songs charted in the top 50 when released as singles. Also, what in hell is Tom Scholz obsession with \\"Living For You\\"? He also put that song on \\"Corporate America\\" Come on Tom that song is really not that good. If you felt the need to include something from the \\"Walk On\\" cd then \\"Surrender To Me\\" would have been an much better choice. Of the newer songs \\"Higher Power\\" is really good. It rocks with the trademark Boston guitar sound that we all know so well. \\"The Star Spangled Banner/4th Of July Reprise\\" is totally cool. Very up-tempo with melodic guitars; not to mention the awsome begining with the hyper space pedal guitar effects unique to Boston. Good cd to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good collection.","review":"Boston's \\"Greatest Hits\\" #47, is a pretty good hits collection. Of the 3 new songs on the album \\"Higher Power\\", is my favorite, a real driving rock song. This could of been a better collection if they would of added some tracks you don't hear on radio every 20 minutes. I really don't buy best of's, but it's the only way I could get \\"Higher\\". It would be another 5 years, before they released their next studio offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boston-Greatest Hits","review":"This is a great CD loaded with hits. Unfortunately my personal favorite, \\"Takin My Time\\", is left off but worse things have happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money$$$","review":"I am a long time Boston fan and have the first three albums. I didn't really find any need for this album as there are plenty of great songs that are not included. Just get the first three albums and be done with it. They are full of great music that didn't make the greatest hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost The Definitive Boston Collection","review":"This disc has most of the essential Boston songs. It features some of their best album cuts like \\"Cool The Engines\\", \\"Smokin'\\", \\"Rock And Roll Band\\", and \\"Feelin' Satisfied\\". \\"Cool The Engines\\" is also a nice addition to this collection. Most of the hits are present like \\"More Than A Feeling\\", \\"Foreplay/Long Time\\", \\"Peace Of Mind\\", \\"Don't Look Back\\", \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" and \\"Amanda\\". However songs like \\"We're Ready\\", Cantcha Say/Still In Love\\" and \\"I Need Your Love\\" are not included on this collection though they should be. According to Boston's web site, Tom Scholz is remastering this CD for re-release. Maybe \\"We're Ready\\", Cantcha Say/Still In Love\\" and \\"I Need Your Love\\" will be included this time. \\"Tell Me\\" and \\"Higher Power\\" are outstanding tracks as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Boston that you can Get","review":"This is about as good as you can get for Boston. It includes the greats such as \\"More than a Feeling\\" and \\"Don't Look Back\\" as well as \\"Amanda\\" and my favorite song \\"Piece of Mind.\\" The only bad part is that it has the song \\"Higher Power\\" twice as if they had to make it seem like more songs. I would still recommend this because it is a good CD all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Styx or something better","review":"If you're looking for good old bread and butter American rock, stick with the likes of Styx or REO, not the over-porduced Boston. Ever notice how Boston NEVER released a live album? Because they are NOT capable of pulling these songs off live. Tom Sholtz is a smart man in the studio but it's obvious he could never pull these off live and maybe that's why all the talented members left the band over the years. Buy the first CD and you'll have the only \\"Greatest Hits\\" you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never heard anything this bad in my life!","review":"This stacks up there with Britney Spears and the Back Street Boys.

Their debut album from over twenty years ago could debut today & still be #1. Their sound was ahead of their time & timeless. I suggest you buy their albums in order.. from start to finish.. this being the last. But get them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff...","review":"For anyone with a casual appreciation for the sound of Boston, I think that this album is definitely worth a try. I don't own any other of Boston's albums, so I don't have the passionate opinions about the band and their somewhat spastic career that so many die-hard fans apparently do. I think this \\"Greatest Hits\\" album is solid.Of course, \\"More Than a Feeling\\" is a classic, as is \\"Foreplay/Long Time\\" and \\"Amanda.\\" I even enjoyed the first two tracks, which were written for this album. There is something totally unique about the combination of driving guitars and soaring vocals that make the Boston sound, and this album captures that sound very well.Though the purists may protest, I think that this is a great album for anyone who wants to get a taste of Boston. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boston - 'Greatest Hits' (Sony)","review":"Review no. 132. Nicely assembled 16 track compilation of hits / fan favorite tunes off the arena rock master's first three albums, self-titled('76), 'Don't Look Back'('78) and 'Third Stage'('86). Plus there are three exclusive cuts here that you cannot find on any other CD, \\"Tell Me\\",\\"Star Spangled Banner\\" and \\"Higher Power\\" which are so-so. Not even sure if 'Greatest Hits' is geared toward the Boston die-hards or the casual fans. Either way,it does make for decent listening. Oh, great cover, don't you agree?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much better than debut album...","review":"It's a shame that Boston couldn't reproduce any of their brilliance from their debut album in another great couple of albums, which would have ensured a wonderful greatest hits album--perhaps one of the best of all-time. Unfortunately, with the exception of the songs \\"Amanda\\" and \\"Don't Look Back\\", they pretty much did nothing after the masterpiece \\"Boston\\" CD.I would still recommend this album to anyone. It is a fantastic album, and would be a great addition to any music collection. The only thing that bummed me out is the fact that Boston couldn't recapture the brilliance they had with their 1st album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as Good Now as In 1977!","review":"Very good sound quality.

If you like this CD, you are a tool box!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok...you're named after a the city, right?","review":"Why a band named Boston has UFO's on all their covers I'll never know or care to know, but hey, to each his own. This is 70's rock at its worst. These are long, drawn out songs with a lot of organ solos. ROCK ON. But really, there are a few good songs, but a lot of better ones on their first self titled album. It's obvious they want you to buy both albums by keeping the good songs on the original. For instance, Let me Take You Home Tonight is a decent song, and isn't on the album, while Higher Power (Kalooner Edit) which is God awful is on the CD. Whatever. Buy it and blow 10 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy the first three albums.","review":"They made the music they wanted to make in a garage out on the East coast as kids. The classics live on - the new stuff is mediocre and uninspired.

Why are these classics? Cuz they're good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is definitely not worth buying","review":"I bought this CD a week ago and returned it immediately. I just basically wasn't able to get past thier lead singers voice and stingy bicycle bunz. Their guiter licks were pretty descent and their lyrics were good, especially on Peace of Mind. I strongly advise people to listen to it on classic rock stations before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"You would be better off spending your money on the \\"Boston\\" and \\"Third Stage\\" albums. Half of the songs on this so called Greatest Hits album were not even hits and received little to no air play. The best of Boston is on the the \\"Boston\\" and \\"Third Stage\\" albums.

I discovered that there are NO labels to the CD as well as to each individual Track. So when the music play plays the screen on both players is blank. As far as I am concerned, it is unacceptable. I feel that Amazon should have stated that this CD was an unlabeled \\"remake\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"Boston had some great albums and great songs, although they did not have many charting hits. Why, then, is a CD titled \\"Greatest Hits\\" missing one of their greatest hits (\\"We're Ready\\")? The answer: greed. The music on the CD is quite good overall, but the omission of a Billboard top 10 hit is insulting to buyers. And the music industry wonders why CD sales have been falling. Your best bet is to buy your favorite songs individually. Don't support compilations like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boston = Discolorations of Tracy Kollings' thigh fungus.","review":"There once was a time when I thought I had known what hell would be like.

Don't waste your time with this album, go out and get their studio albums, they're a lot better and well worth it. A group with only four albums should not have greatest hits compilations, this is a perfect example, it's incomplete as far as I'm concern. Sorry Boston, even though I love your work."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like this album, your music taste is deranged.","review":"This album just goes to show how overrated this band really is. The title \\"greatest hits\\" should be \\"45 minutes of pure torture\\". Brad Delp is the most annoying singer in music history. He demonstrates that the only thing he can do is squeal like a girl. If you know anything about classic rock, you will pick up some doors, pink floyd, neil young, or fleetwood mac.

This is nothing more than a gimmick of \\"let's milk Boston for all they are worth\\". Who is Tom Sholtz to trick us into believing a new singer is Brad Delp? Stick with \\"Boston\\" and \\"3rd Stage\\" and you'll have the only Boston you'll ever need."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band is absolutely horrible. Don't buy this brutal CD.","review":"Brad Delp's voice sounds like he is trying to annoy the listener through every track. \\"More than a Feeling\\" should be permanently banned from sales or radio play.

This compilation shows that Boston is partly responsible for the terrible music today. They are the originators of the squealing, annoying voices that usually get made fun of on Beavis and Butthead. This album is full of horrible squealing. You would be better off buying Britny Fox even though they suck as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"I have noticed that every time a band has a greatest hits, essential collection, etc., reviewers are always complaining that they left out this or that song, blah blah blah. It's Boston, geez. If you want Hitch a Ride, classic rock radio still plays it every other hour. As a matter of fact, Boston is the band that created the Classic Rock format even before there was such a thing.

This suffers with the inclusion of new tracks and exclusion of more familiar material. The new material juxtaposed with the old is awkward, especially if you use shuffle play.

There are only about three characters in the entire book who aren't pretentious to the point of being repulsive, and those are fairly flat and uninteresting. There is virtually no plot, and the recurring idea that we should cover up what is real with our own illusions because they're prettier and more perfect disgusted me.

Most importantly consistency is essential! If there is a set of physical laws in place, the character should follow them, unless explained for! The principle of the book was good.

The queen then reveals a devious plan to destroy the Earth, but her plans are stopped by the Earthmen and a rebel scientist(Gabor) and her friends who are against the queen.

Thenthere's the Elastica song. As if those weren't bad enough, there was the horrible cover of The Smiths classic \\"How Soon Is Now?\\", where Love Spit Love couples an irritating voice with a total lack of feel for the song. That WOULD be the worst track on the song if not for the Heather Nova song, a track which shows promise in the beginning but devolves into painful whining.If you want a soundtrack, get the one to Mortal Kombat, Twister, or The Matrix.

However, the execution left a little to be desired. That's not to say this is a bad album, but it's not exactly a great album either. For the covers, I kept wishing that I had the original copy of the song, with the exception of Our Lady Peace's Tomorrow Never Knows.

Had it not had so many plotholes and miscast characters, Enough may have survived the critics test but as Lopez films go- this one really takes the biscuit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing can describe how truly stupid this film is","review":"In the same vein as Panic Room this is yet another woman-rambo film that, for some unknown reason, is gracing theatre screens everywhere. Here the character played by Jennifer Lopez marries into a life of privilege only to discover 'when it's too late' that her privilege has become her prison.Saving herself and her daughter from the man she married, the movie plays out to a black leotard climax that is laughable.Fortunately, and quite unlike Panic Room, not all the men were distilled to the state of limp amebas or classic neanderthals. However this cannot save the film. I like Jennifer Lopez. She is an intelligent and capable actor but this movie gives her nothing but stereotyped mush and ridiculous motivations to work with.The film gets two stars but only because people tend not to read reviews with only one star. How many stars should it get? 0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"This movie was terrible. Not even worth one star, if you ask me. I only went to see it because I'm utterly obsessed with Noah Wyle (who's only in a few scenes, SO DISSAPOINTING!).Here's the deal though....this movie has an ok premise. There are points in the movie where I was like, \\"gee, this could be a good movie.\\" The thing is, they take every last LITTLE plot point and they serve it to you like a smack over the head with a 2 x 4. Nothing at ALL is left to suspense or to the imagination.I read in the Chicago Sun Times that this movie completely parallel's Julia Robert's 'Sleeping with the Enemy' and that all the details are like completely the same. Maybe SWTE is a better movie...For what it's worth though, save your money and DON'T see this movie unless you like really tacky, cliche, all-too-long movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie is full of action - impressed that Jennifer did her own stunt work - boxing, etc.Think this is food for thought for everyone to learn to do - especially girls/women in today's world with so much abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough","review":"One of my favorite movies of all time!

Lewis. I guess if you're a J.Lo fan the music video at the end might appeal to you as an extra.The bad: Overacting by Campbell. The far out plot. The dialogue. There were plenty of things that had me wondering what in the heck happened. There was too much left hanging, like what happened to Joe? What did the cop REALLY mean at the end? What happened to her relationship with her estranged father?

She's so mediocre it's painful, and nowhere is she more mediocre than in this piece of trash.

And if you were a wife finally looking to get even with your abusive husband, after you snuck into his house, wouldn't the first thing YOU do be change into a skin-tight black outfit? And where did she get those \\"magic\\" detecting devices? Save your money. Watch TV instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie plot is getting old.","review":"ENOUGH! The film makers are about to drive this plot into the ground. Hard working pretty woman (Lopez) meets up with handsome hunk, has a fairy-tale wedding, and then dreams of living a fairy-tale life. All this only to find out her wonderful husband is a jerk. He chases other women and he is abusive to her. She's on the run and he's trying to find her. Naturally, he's rich and has inside connections with the law enforcement agency, so hubby has no trouble tracking her down. And naturally, he's going to take her to court to get the child away from her. So the wife sends her daughter away for a month so the wife can be by herself to enroll in a class and take instructions on how to physically kick the ... out of an attacker of any size. Hollywood needs to give this scene a break. Really. Lopez is okay, but she should probably stick to singing, or wait for a better film script to come along."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing good about this movie...","review":"is that Jennifer Lopez is in it. She is beautiful and does her job well. The story is an improbable one at best with a supporting cast that doesn't quite get the job done. This could have been a superb movie.

This movie is amazing, every single woman that ever was in a relationship which turned to be abusive, knows how hard is sometimes to say stop and go your own way! This movie shows this situation in very special way, and Jen's playing is great, yes I am a fan of her, and I know every single movie she did, but I can say which were really good, and which dont worth it, well this movie worths it! i wont say what is it about, you all know it. But what I want to say is that even if you're not a JLO fan, or of any other actor involved, you still would love the movie. Worths all the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to see what a good job Jennifer Lopez did in this movie.

All Lopez's movies are so. You might want to overlook my biased review because I can't stand J-Lo. She's one of those people whose very existence makes me despise them. She cannot sing nor can she act. But she can wait tables superbly. Jennifer Lopez, waitressing is your one true calling in life.

I mean you're watching it in the theatre and then they display a title. I could understand if it was a dvd but it wasn't. The plot is terrible. Slim, lopez's character, and what kind of name is that, found out that her new husband, who also called her by her nickname, slim, was cheating on her and her husband thought that it was a good thing because now he didn't have to hide it.

I always wondered why they were too scared to leave home and get help, but in this movie i realized that a restraining order won't stop someone from doing something to you.

Lopez did everything wrong. She never reported the abuse to the police, other than to talk to a police officer and pretend that her abused friend needed advice. She also never consulted with a lawyer about child custody rights. Instead of seeking out the help and protective services of a women's shelter, Lopez changed her name and started to run across the country, with no money, no plan and nowhere to go. That she dragged her child along with her is inexcusable.And lastly, Lopez met with a self-defense trainer, pumped up and set out on a mission to kill her husband.The movie was ridiculous.

Her acting skills have grossly deteriorated over the years and she is proof positive that this country rewards mediocracy over superior talent. In Enough, J.Lo plays a battered wife who seeks revenge on her husband, but the plot is so thin and unbelievable that the movie fails to rise above average.

I thought it was great because all of the stuff Slim (JLO) was feeling is true to life. She didn't handle everything perfectly. She should have turned her husband in at the beginning, but she was scared. That could have been a plot device so that the ending was needed, but I've also seen people's fear in real life that keeps them from going to the cops. I thought that this was a great 'power' movie. Not girl power, but the power that one gets as a result of taking control of one's life and saying \\"Enough, I'm not letting this go on.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Even men can cheer.","review":"A very good movie. No matter what some critics may say, J-Lo has a presence on screen. She gives a great performance and helps women believe that they don't have to take abuse of those types. Plus she is beautiful.

So, I gave it s chance. After all, Apted was responsible for \\"Always Outnumbered\\" and \\"The World is Not Enough\\" recently and I thought that if he could combine the melancholy of \\"Always outnumbered\\" with the action of \\"The World is not Enough\\" we might have a decent film on our hands. Jennifer Lopez also proved she had dramatic acting ability in \\"The Cell.\\" Wow, what a waste of all involved. All of them seem to be slumming it. \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\" at least had a more haunting villain and when he just wouldn't die in the film's finale it was ridiculous but heart pounding. I much preferred its finale to \\"Enough's\\" in which Lopez becomes a female ninja. Elia Kazan must be spinning in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's all a horrible mistake","review":"My parents rented this dvd, and told me it actually was pretty good (though you'd think by now I would have learned my lesson about trusting their judgement on film), so I figured I'd check it out. That was a horrible mistake. Somebody casted Jennifer Lopez as the lead role. That was a horrible mistake. I suppose I should have kept in mind that Nicholas Kazan, writer of Bicentennial Man wrote the script, both of which were horrible mistakes. Three great actors, Juliette Lewis, Dan Futterman and Bill Cobbs were in this film--a horrible mistake on their part. And while this wasn't the best movie for Noah Wylie to take a part in, he did a wonderful job. He played a villainous role, one that is so unlike what he usually plays, and he did it well. Very creepy. Not a horrible mistake to take a role, just a horrible mistake that the role was in this movie. It's predictable and the only outstanding thing about this film is that it is, you guessed it, all a horrible mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happens when good talent meets bad script","review":"Jennifer Lopez is much better an actress than singer, but \\"Enough\\" is not a showcase for her. Following a formulatic, but tolerable rising action, the film quickly falls apart when Lopez's character goes on the run with her daughter from her abusive husband. Plot holes and quickly executed fragments of the story ruin an otherwise predictable but entertaining film.While the point of the film is a woman's power to protect herself and her children, the film seems to just be gearing towards the mass of girl power films of the last few years. Nothing original or engaging happens in \\"Enough\\" and the finale sequence is pretty laughable.Despite a decent performance out of Lopez, she can't save a mediocore plot with minor potential from going anywhere but below average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough of J-Lo's acting","review":"Considering how this was advertised as a serious role-it failed to measure up. I guess J-Lo's paycheck was so big- there was not enough money to pay a decent writer.So all abused women should take Karate and learn to fight back! Hmmm this is an interesting concept. TOO bad this sound message did not come across due to the insanity of the script, and the crappy dialougeGive up acting J-Lo and focus on your other talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"\\"Enough\\" is nothing more than a Lifetime original movie masquerading as a big screen drama. Instead of exploring the complicated and tragic dynamics behind an abusive marriage, \\"Enough\\" simply creates a cartoonishly evil villian and a damsel in distress for the audience to root for. Charismatic Jennifer Lopez, talented Juliette Lewis, and dashing Billy Campbell all deserve better material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performance fron Jennifer Lopez","review":"I went and saw this movie the day it came out and it was a wonderful movie. Jennifer Lopez gave a great performance as Slim, and Tessa Allen was really cute as her daughter Gracie. The story was kind of predictable, but it was suspenseful, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat with the music and all of the shadow images around the corners.

Sonia Dada hails from the Chicago area, and their music has a bit of city grit mixed in with their smooth harmonies. They have obviously grown up listening to a lot of different sorts of music, and you will hear the church, the bars, Haight-Ashbury, Motown, Memphis, and other influences mixed into their sound.

If you are JUST starting out with exercise (or, specifically, kick boxing) than this video might be a viable option...

Before I ordered it, I read through some of the reviews listed for it and thought it sounded almost too good to be true according to some. Well, they were right. I remember someone stated they never skip through any of the songs on this one as they would on other CD's (I do the same thing). With this one, I always let it play from beginning to end. I love it & I can't wait to hear some more of what this group has to offer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting","review":"The voices on this cd blend like the paints in a watercolor...beautifully.

I liked everything about it--the smell, the feel. Though it seemed at first like it would dry my skin out, it didn't, and it wasn't greasy or oily like an \\"aftershave balm.\\" I like it a lot. And for the price Amazon had for 8 ounces, it was quite a steal. The small bottle lasted me a while; I'm sure I'll be set through next year with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great aftershave!","review":"My husband has used this aftershave for years, and I love it. A bonus to the light scent is that it doesn't make me sneeze, as so many scents do.Delivery was quick, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"husband gifts!","review":"I love this product. Your site is the only place i can reasonably and easily find it. It is THE ONLY after shave that my husband likes and wears. it has been virtually non-existent to find in stores anymore as i usually did for the last 30 years................thanks so much for having Royal Copanhagen on your site............it makes it so easy for me to get and very convenient. wish i didn't have to pay tax/shipping handling as i didn't have to in stores, but i do understand the reason for it. thanx again for providing me with an easy way to continue to keep my husband happy and smelling fabulous! I love it too!! Sincerely, Nancy Johnson P.S. also thank you for providing the public with a fantastic source of shopping for all kinds of products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Smell","review":"The other three reviewers to date seem to love this stuff. I couldn't disagree more. It stinks of a heavy perfume worn by an old lady. Not at all subtle or masculine which is key to a good aftershave splash. I own at least 30 aftershaves from the cheap drugstore variety to the more expensive imports. This is one of the worst I've ever tried. Had to shower after about 20 mins. to remove the stench from my skin. So strong it constricted my nasal passage and initiated the gag reflex. My wife got the same reaction. I boxed it right back up and gave it to my daughter to give away. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wrong item","review":"I ordered Royal Copenhagen Aftershave BALM, not regular aftershave.

Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"picture shows what I wanted Royal Copenhagen aftershave balm.","review":"I was disappointed in my purchase. I very carefully looked at the product displayed as Royal Copenhagen Aftershave. I was looking for Royal Copenhagen Balm so I increased the size of the picture and saw that it was the balm which is a creamy aftershave lotion. What I received was 3 bottles of clear blue liquid aftershave not what was presented in the picture. For this reason I returned all three bottles. I was credited with postage only the first time and then was told when I brought this to the attention of customer service that I had returned all 3 bottles that I purchased. I was told that it would be credited to my charge card that I used to purchase it in the first place. I have not as yet seen this credit on my charge account. I am still looking for the Royal Copenhagen Aftershave BALM on other web sites."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's gold to me","review":"I've spent a long time with this book because I keep rereading passages I love. I quote Bennett-Goleman; I try to incorporate her themes in my own work; I've brought this to my coaching buddies as we wrestle with theory and practice. Bennett-Goleman isn't the only person to combine emotional intelligence, psychological theory and Buddhist practice, she simply does it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true healer!","review":"This is the single best book that I have ever bought. It is truly inspiring and gives you the ability to get in touch with emotional pains by healing them at the root. I would reccomend this book to anyone who feels they have any problems now but they cannot understand the reasons for repeating the same patterns in their life. It is easy to comprehened, and very nicely laid out. Very great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant - and brilliantly useful","review":"There's probably not a lot I can say about this book that hasn't been better said already. However, I just want to add my opinion to those who have praised the humanity, intelligence, and usefulness of this book. Having studied Buddhism for quite a few years, I can attest that the author's use of ideas from this domain reflects years of solid training on her part. This is not new age, feel-good fluff, not by any stretch of the imagination. It is an imaginative - and in my mind, brilliant - combination of buddhist thought and more recent parallel ideas from cognitive therapy, neuropsychology, etc. I think it had just the right blend of theoretical, explanatory power (so you really get the sense that there's some there, there) and ideas for practical application.This is a book that can add great value to anyone's life. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interest mix of ideas, writting style a little grating","review":"This is a very good book in terms of ideas, even though the ideas are not new this is the first time I've seen this particular approach to them. With all do respect to a previous reviewer, who cares if these ideas are not new? To some people these ideas are new and useful and to be honest I've not seen a book that combines them in this way before. Her writting style can be a little warm and fuzzy at times, but I've found this to be a very helpful book in my life. Read it and judge for your self."},{"rating":"2","title":"For serious persons on the upward mobility growth curve.","review":"Of the thousands of books I've read over the years this book has eloquently packed more intellect per page than I've ever seen. My recommendation is run, don't walk, to Amazon.com and purchase it, read it, re-read it and contemplate every magic moment it brings you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Access to self knowledge and self healing","review":"Tara brilliantly lays out the origins of our dysfunctional behavior patterns. This book was the catalyst for my own investigation into my childhood, which resulted in a tremendous insight about myself and the related events that have affected my entire life.

Well worth reading twice. No, it's not for someone who is educationally challenged, there is an academic flair here, but for those only remotely familiar with psychology 101 or the basic methods of Buddhism, this book is a winner.Bennett-Goleman breaks down the reasons why we get tripped up and trapped by our emotions in a way that I haven't seen presented this clear since \\"Awakening the Buddha Within,\\" by Lama Surya Das. She takes the tenets of Buddhism one step beyond peace to tie it in with why we respond to life as we do, and how to change the automatic pilot of our negative emotional reactions. I found this book to be thorough in explanation, deeply insightful, comprehensive, very well written, very well framed, and extremely helpful to understanding myself and those I love. I'm buying a copy for every member of my dysfunctional family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buddhist Enhanced Psychotherapy","review":"Eastern spirituality is woven into contemporary western psychotherapy. Bennet-Goldman illuminates her technique with clear and relevant examples that have helped heal her patients"},{"rating":"2","title":"Theoratical and elegant","review":"This is a book essentially about turning adversity into advantage and it's written with good linguistic skills and beautuful ideas. However, the practical aim of the book is to help readers ride out their storms and gain as much as possible in the process but the content is delivered in a rather literary and technical manner. As a self-help book, simplicity is the key because most readers who turn to books of this genre hanker after precise and concise words and messages. Thus, the main and perhaps only demerit of this book is the message of the book and the way it is delivered are not perfectly attuned to one another. That said, as a self-help book, it is not of first choice. But as a book in general, it's a good-quality and highly readable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Great book. Really practical, clear, balanced and logical. I've read a lot of books in this area of study lately and it is unquestionably one of the best. A good balance using the most pertinent information from cognitive behavioral, psychotherapy and spiritual studies. The case studies are great. It's nicely grounded. I underlined many passages and find it helpful to just go back and read the underlines. It's been helpful both personally and in my work with clients. It's a book I've recommended to many people already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but will they ever chime?","review":"I like the way these chimes look, including the rock base, but I have yet to hear them ring.

I'm waiting for the first act!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The chimes are not ringing","review":"Can't tell you how disappointed we are with these chimes that do not chime. We have moved them, repositioned them, and have had no results. We wanted chimes, not a lawn ornament."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have listened to the Amazon Reviews.","review":"I ignored the reviews of those submitted by others and learned I shouldn't have. I liked the design as we were go to use it at family events as a remembrance of those no longer with us. The idea being as you passed by you could ring the chimes as remembrance without words. The chimes were difficult to ring even with enough effort that you felt you needed to hold the base which resulted in a couple of clunking sounds instead of a chime. It was the first item we ever returned to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garden bells","review":"Great concept, however, the wires on the chimes are so stiff that I haven't heard them ring even in high wind situation. Thought maybe they were rain chimes (needed water in the cups to move) - but even the extra weight of the water won't make them chime. However, they are very pretty and make a nice outdoor piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aesthetic","review":"After reading reviews that this chime did not easily 'activate' I hesitated purchasing but did so anyway. I've placed this within easy reach in a flower bed where I can easily hand activate and hear it any time I want, instead of waiting for a stiff wind. The golden appearance is a pleasing contrast nestled in the flowers, as well as the gentle sway of the 'fronds.' I'm pleased with my purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Four years w/o a sound","review":"I have really wondered what the point was. I was given this as a gift, it said it was a wind chime. I sat it out on the deck railing where we get a fairly steady breeze throughout the year yet have never heard a single note out of it. The tines holding up the bells are just too stiff. It would take a hurricane to bang them together.Now I read from one of the other reviewers that it's supposed to sit out in the garden and collect rain! I'll try it, because I was about ready to junk it. Hope it works. Would have been nice if some directions to that effect had come with it.I'm giving it 3 stars only because I'm holding out hope the rain routine works. ..otherwise it would be a 1.UPDATE: 5 yrs now.

Its definitely a beginner tape though."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for bad backs","review":"I have a recurring pinched nerve in my neck, and I was very hesitant to start yoga for fear of getting hurt again.

No matter how my back feels at the end of the day, doing this video ALWAYS makes it feel better. I've found that it's gentle enough to do no matter how much pain I'm in (although obviously you have to modify it when you're really tweaked). Like other users have said, it helps faster than any medication treatment, and it's easier, cheaper, and faster than a massage or other therapy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Plan but take with Precaution if injured","review":"For those of you with back injuries that have been advised to take up yoga this is a good tape.

Stretches and movements should be done without overextending oneself beyond a comfortable limit. Rodney is good and the tape is well directed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Easy","review":"One would really have to be out of shape to find this tape worthwhile.

Just wanted to share the info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many props, too easy","review":"I have several of Rodney Yee's videos and really enjoy them, but I don't like this one much at all. Most of the exercises are done on a chair, which I suppose would be good in an office environment. For lower back development, I'd recommend the Yoga for strength, which goes a lot farther to help develop your back and stomach to avoid pain in the future. however, i guess if you have a weight problem and have a good chair, this would be a good video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Back Flexibility-With a Tummy Tuck Bonus!","review":"I have been using this video for some time, and have found it to be a great way to stretch and strengthen the muscles in my back, especially my lower back. I have what is primarily a desk job, and this video has helped improve my posture significantly, as well as helping with my flexibility. As an added bonus, as my lower back muscles became stronger and posture improved, I noticed that my stomach was pulled in tighter and my spine was straighter. I highly recommend this video to anybody who sits at a desk all day-use it every other day for two weeks and see how you feel.Rodney Yee uses a clear style of presentation, but be sure to watch the video through a couple of times before trying it, so you don't keep trying to twist around and see what he's doing.

I think Friedman is a great author with lots of great insights, but he isn't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as I would have liked in a bunch of detached 750-1000 word segments. Since the sections are arranged chronologically, there also isn't the opportunity to tie the themes together.If you really like Friedman, then it's worth a read, but if you are in it for just one, I'd read The Lexus and the Olive Tree first. It is by far his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friedman is compulsary reading in these troubled times","review":"Thomas Friedman has become compulsary reading in these troubled times - for us in Europe, thankfully in the International Herald Tribune. And for those who find that the New York Times is not to their taste - read and enjoy this book. For example, although an NY Times columnist, he was IN FAVOUR of the war with Iraq!

Mr. Friedman's glaring short-coming as a writer is that he is overly tunnel-visioned on the mid-east while he writes about the rest of the world. His entire perspective on the world seems to pass through the prism of Israel. Unfortunately he writes with a grossly liberal bias that takes away from the quality of his book. My money is always better spent when I avoid the narrow-minded overly liberal or overly conservative writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Wing Diatribe","review":"I bought this book thinking it gave insight into the culture and thoughts of those in the middle east.

That's how the liberal sees everything. Only sincewe - the US and Israel - are supposed to be evolved societies, we are more bad and less good. The Arabs are expected to be bad, so when they do anything less bad, Friedman thinks they are good. You can read this stuff from every columnist every day in the NY Times.An early paragraph captures Friedman perfectly: He wants the US to kick the crap out of Afghanistan for 9/11 without hurting the good people there. How do we tell them apart? What if the bad Afghani is hiding behind the good one?? Everything sounds good but isn't realistic - the mind of the liberal.I like Friedman's writing style so I've read all his books, but I loathe the holier and smarter than thou attitude that pervades all his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repeats himself, however much of the content is worth it","review":"The author repeats himself and god forbid you loose your place you might have to start at the begining since after a couple of the collums they all sound the same.

What an extraordinarily insightful book. I couldn't put it down, even though I'd read virtually all of Friedman's columns when they first appeared in The Times. His prose is wonderfully lucid and colloquial; it helps us understand the increasingly bewildering world around us--and within us. Friedman shares his interesting and intriguing experiences with his readers, and we are all wiser and humbler for it. Read Tom Friedman, then read him all over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":".I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Friedman's Lexus and Olive Tree.

This film plays out like it was directed by a 13 year old and edited by his spaztic younger brother. The violent scenes are cut so quick and close that the action is not watchable. The acting is of the worst caliber (special mention to the world's stupidest father, and worst actor of all time who (thankfully) suffers the most creative death-though completely impossible). Entertaining only if you enjoy really stupid movies with really bad makeup and under the floor acting. Did i mention i didn't care for this movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This...Like the Plague","review":"Great Gertie's Nightgown! What in the world was THIS all about? I'm given a cast of characters who are so full of loathing you can't stand a single one: Two sisters that constantly b*tch at one another; a milquetoast step mom, a father who needed to be slapped until someone's arms got tired, and a \\"local\\" who is simply there for \\"boinky-boinky\\" purposes. Lord, this was like attending a family reunion. The viewer is never told why all these children are cursed...with bad makeup...and why--after being stabbed with a piece of broken glass by one of the local darlings--the father didn't have sense enough to just get the hell out of Dodge. Let's just say this amounted to 85 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. And, as one previous reviewer pointed out, I'm glad I rented this before I decided to buy it. BIG change of heart there..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to its potential","review":"Taking the horror genre to Ireland for a change, I was looking forward to seeing what they had done with Plague Town. The answer was \\"not much\\" - aside from some effective imagery (the few scenes with the blindfold girl were well done) the film plays out like a re-hashing of any of the recent \\"torture porn\\" films, such as The Hills Have Eyes or Wolf Creek. The acting on some cases is bad, even by low-budget standards.Sadly, with all that Ireland has to offer a horror film - from gorgeous lanscapes to castle settings - the producers of this film gave us just another cottage in the woods, and some people who are so hard to like, you don't care by the time they die."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Plague","review":"This was more like a badly made (Hills have eyes or Wrong turn) set in the English country side. The family unit walks around aimlessly in the woods waiting to die. Meeting badly made up mutant kids with an extreme mean streak and a bunch of crazy parents. To make it even worse no one fights back or even try to protect themselves while being beaten and killed. Another waste of our hard earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soon to be a Hit Movie","review":"I mean when people discover it on DVD and Blu-ray.A path less slashed, style wise. Travelers meeting very weird locals, is a point of departure. Good looking, moody and shot on film. You may notice that this is not a big budget Hollywood Studio release and it's direct to video; But!... Let's call it a soft opening. It's a real horror movie. This is a 'must be a hit by Halloween Film' because I've found a new film for that tradition. Slow creep outs, surprises and fresh horror ideas with power; and it just keeps geting better; and a mild but deviant erotic element pushes the envelope! More 70s style shocks that reverberate into the now and maybe into next decade. A great horror fiim; not to miss.A/V on BD is a treat. Sound mix is almost retro style also but will activate a booming bass, a crackling treble and everything you want from DTS Masterless. The filmmakers were into sound and there's an extra about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter garbage Dont waste your time or money!","review":"Complete and utter garbage Dont waste your time or money!Says it all for me but have to use 20 words in review.Probably the worst film with some of the most lame special effects I have ever seen I could not believe it was made so recently.I know everyone is different but surely anyone giving this more than the one star that is the lowest possible rating must need some kind of psychiatric help...........I watched it for free on sky and still felt I'd been ripped off!As another reviewer pointed out it's ninety ish minutes of my life I will never get back..........I have never felt driven to review anything before but if I can prevent even one person from wasting a portion of their life watching this drivel my own sacrifice will at least not have been in vain."},{"rating":"1","title":"dumbfounded","review":"That is the only word that comes to my mind when I think of WHY DID I BUY THIS MOVIE.

There is no way this hat would fit any coach, and the only player it would fit is a 4 or 5 year old playing t-ball.

Ann writes about her life and the events in her world from the farm to the school where she taught and her own education.This book is invaluable in understanding how people like her family coped during those difficult times with the dust, financially, and other storms to weather but they did with great tenacity, faith, and strength.

No opportunity is missed to suggest that the books of the New Testament were probably not written by the traditionally attributed authors. A particularly obnoxious example is the contention that Colossians was certainly not written by Paul (even though Colossians explicitly names Paul as the author). No opportunity is missed to suggest that the texts we have are probably distorted, incomplete, etc. The most grating example is the helpful rearrangement of Philippians, showing the text not as the Bible has it, but as 'scholars' have decided it was probably originally arranged. If you don't believe in Christianity and don't hold the Bible in any particular reverence and think that the Jesus Seminar is really cutting edge theology, this is a good example of Catholic scholars trying to join the club.

Everytime I read about her \\"screaming,\\" I glanced up to see if my kids were somewhere in the room with me. The only plot line that held a mild interest for me was waiting to see when Tiffany was going to get her horse back.

The dialogue was hackeneyed, the characters laughable, the plot stilted and full of undeveloped threads, the \\"historical\\" background weak and/or inaccurate, and the entire thing heavily rife with a sexism that shouldn't've existed in the 1990s. I truly hope someday our society will cease and desist with the whole \\"battle of wills\\" = \\"romantic\\" and \\"exciting\\" misconception.While cleaning out old boxes of books today, I discovered Defiant Angel and re-read it, reconfirming my earlier assesment... and spending an hour having hysterical laughing fits.

King's Quest 1 was the first computer game with color graphics, King's Quest 4 was the first game with digital music, and King's Quest 5 was the first game with complete voice actors, and King's Quest 6 was the first game exclusively on compact disc.But besides all that, the games themselves are practically masterpieces in their own right. That is, except for game 7. I'm not sure if that was made before or after Sierra was bought out by Cendant, but it would certainly explain some things. In any case, the mediocrity of it doesn't detract from the rest.

That may or may not be true--you can decide for yourself if you purchase this package. Unfortunately, only a couple of the games are worthy of being influential--the middle games in the series are the most fully realized and most satisfying games. Most of the others are hollow playing experiences, offering little besides scintillating graphics and usually interesting sound and music. Even the bonus games are, for the most part, mediocre offerings at best. If you are a long-time fan and would like to own the games, it's definitely worth it. But you will most likely otherwise not be swayed to think King's Quest is the greatest game series ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Bought this as a gift for a friend's newborn.

The baby responded well to the sounds and rhythms of the text and it helped with parent-child bonding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid collection","review":"Pleased with this collection, as is my 2.5 year old son. The poems seem well-selected and the book itself is a nice length/weight for bedtime reading. Only 4 stars because the illustrations are fairly unremarkable and in a few instances needlessly inaccurate (i.e. illustration for Dr. Seuss's blue duck/black duck poem features two blue ducks). That said I'm pleased with the purchase and would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"We like this book","review":"This is a great book! My kids (6, 4 & 3) really like it.

We ordered it on the basis of Amazon reviews and Prelutsky's reputation. It has really captured the attention of our little boy while age 2-3. We'll read page after page and he doesn't get tired of it--this at an age when he's getting a lot pickier.The rhymes are just wonderful and the pictures go very well with them. This is not the typical poetry collection for young people. I think it has more appeal than most, at least \\"for the very young\\" as the title says.

The rhymes are simplistic, dare I say the work of amateurs. That may be a harsh review but there is nothing memorable in here. We read it through once and will probably not read it again.

Written so long ago and we can relate to St Augustine so easily in today's world. Very encouraging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transformation","review":"As an agnostic, it might seem strange that I found this book so deeply moving. Augustine's autobiography describes a process of conversion from a skeptical and unbelieving perspective. Regardless of whether the reader is a believer of God or not, this book is a fascinating read on both an intellectual and spiritual level. His writings remain as fresh today as they did when they were originally written -- a true sign that this book is timeless. This book is a must read for anyone serious about his own spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave, Bold, Beautiful . . . .","review":"True medicine for the heart: read it with the Bible. For centuries, AUGUSTINE'S CONFESSIONS has touched people's hearts and inspired the greatest philosophers to think on God, time, memory, creation, and our humble existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"I suppose this work might be inspiring and even entertaining tosome people. However, this is a very select portion of thepopulation. _Confessions_ is, pure and simple, Augustine's justification of his religious beliefs. The text tends to be incredibly repetitious, and belabors inconsequential points. For instance, Augustine takes great pains (many times) to explain that incorruptable is better than corruptable. Whoopee. I will concede that _Confessions_ is more entertaining than _City_Of_God_, but that's small praise indeed. Most likely, you'll end up reading one or both of these works for some college course. Just remember as you're reading through the same idea for the umpteenth time that it doesn't get any worse than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Editing","review":"This review refers only to the Kindle edition - I have not looked over the print edition of this bookThis review is not based on the story, or the overall writing of this book.

However, it petered out. I just could not read any further as it just seemed to stall. Farrell to me is such a masculine name too. I love historical fictions, but this one needed a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"I purchased this book several years ago, started it and lost interest more than once. Finally forced myself to read it not long ago. I truly wish I could say something positive. I found the plot to start interestingly enough but the charactors could never make me care about them, or what happened to them. I was just glad I was able to force myself to read it so I can pass it on and make space for a new book. All the while feeling I had wasted time and effort better spent elsewhere. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Irish Book!","review":"I enjoyed reading The Irish Bride on my new Kindle. If you are Irish, especially, the historical mentions of Ireland & the hazardous crossing as well as the USA at the time of the story (late 1800s) are fascinating.

But then I came across \\"Take A Chance On Something Beautiful\\", an album that Chris had recorded with his band, Half Past Forever. I'm glad that I made this discovery. \\"Take A Chance On Something Beautiful\\" is a very good modern rock album with Christian messages in some of the lyrics. Very good production, very good songwriting. Looking forward to hearing more by what Chris and his band have to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Surprise","review":"American Idol doesn't do Chris Sligh justice. With his fellow band members in Half Past Forever, \\"Take A Chance on Something Beautiful\\" is immediately engaging. The music is beautiful with \\"wall of sound\\" excitement that is both complex and accessible. The lyrics are solid and at times awesomely profound. Above all, however, is the strong and soulful sound of Chris Sligh. I hope that many people will be curious to check out this album based on what they have seen and heard from Chris on Idol. They may come to check it out because of Idol, but they will stay and be thrilled by the sound of Half Past Forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHRIS IS GREAT!!!","review":"I AM PROBABLY ONE OF THE OLDER FANS. CHRIS WAS MY FAVORITE THIS YEAR ON IDOL AND I HAVE WATCHED EVERY SEASON, SINCE THE FIRST SHOW. I RAN UP ON THE HPF CD, BOUGHT IT AND I LOVE IT. THE FIRST TIME I LISTENED TO IT, I REALLY LIKED \\"IN A MOMENT\\" AND \\"KNOW\\". BY THE TIME I LISTENED TO IT ABOUT 4 TIMES, I LIKED \\"HERO\\" AND \\"RISE\\". WELL NOW I JUST LIKE ALL OF THE SONGS. CHRIS TO ME HAS A WONDERFUL VOICE. I REALLY HATED THAT HE WAS VOTED OFF AND HOPE THAT HE GETS THE CHANCE TO REALLY MAKE IT. I HAVE TALKED TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS CD. WHEN I GO TO WORK IT IS ALL THAT I LISTEN TO. AT LUNCH FOR A WHOLE HOUR AND AGAIN ON MY WAY HOME. IT IS ADDICTIVE. I WISH CHRIS AND THE GROUP THE BEST. I WILL KEEP LISTENING AND I WILL DEFINATELY BUY ANOTHER CD IF THEY COME OUT WITH ANOTHER ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut CD","review":"Chris Sligh doesn't disappoint on his first recording with Half Past Forever. The songs are varied, ranging from rock to to soulful blues. The arrangements are interesting and all the songs are distinctly different from each other, something hard for even veteran bands to achieve. The CD has a values-oriented approach in its lyrics, so no need to worry that young ears will hear something they shouldn't. \\"Know\\", \\"In a Moment\\", \\"Closer\\" and \\"Gone\\" are particularly great songs, any of which could become a hit song nationwide. I like the fact that Chris has a voice with lots of depth and the ability to vary his singing style. The CD is surprisingly good and the music-listening public will be pleased that they took a chance on a very beautiful CD by a very talented young up-and-coming artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polished yet not sickly slicked!","review":"The thing that blew me away most on this album was the excellent production on it! Yes, the songwriting is great, yes the vocals are crystal clear and on pitch, the musicians rocked etc... but the production is what really makes this album rock! Sligh has produced a near masterpiece on his first effort. I can not wait to see what he has up his sleeve in HPF's future!This album is chock full of great music of several degrees of rockiness. While it does tend to rock, there are a few sweet moments too. The song \\"In A Moment\\" is probably the most radio ready on the disc. \\"Waiting\\" is a hooky pop rock extravaganza as is \\"Tunnel Vision\\". Probably the one that haunted me most was \\"Gone\\". It's just a cool song that will make you think. There are numerous songs just waiting to chart on AOR as soon as the boys get some backing.As long as Mr. Sligh does not let the record execs and producers water his pure rock driven vibe down, the world will be a happier place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a Chance on Something Beautiful","review":"I think the CD was very loud and therefore could not hear the lyrics. Every song sounded the same to me. I thought it was a very poorly produced CD. Not worth the money. For someone who does have a great voice the CD does not do him justice. Actually hated it. I was very disappointed after hearing him on American Idol and then listening to this CD. People who listen to this will probably get turned off to him and it is too bad, with the right material it would really sell him."},{"rating":"1","title":"??????","review":"why are you bunching this album with elliott yamin.....with daughtry maybe.....but so different from elliott yamin...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sound I have heard in a long time","review":"Chris was the only reason I watched Idol, and when he was voted off I searched the net to see if he had a CD out. Sure enough, he did, and I have to say that this is the best debut album I have heard in a long time. The lyrics are strong and moving and Chris' voice is very refreshing in todays' music business. I can't wait to see what they come out with next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Made my day.","review":"I saw Chris Sligh on American Idol and I immediately became a fan. When I heard he had an album dropping with his band, Half Past Forever, I knew I wanted to check it out. Well, the album did NOT disappoint!! Chris has amazing song writing abilities, not to mention vocal genius. Adam and Cole are fantastic musicians! The band operates as a single unit allowing an incredible sound to blast through the speakers. Each song on this album has a different flare, but it all falls under the same category of good rock. The lyrics are meaningful and the music is catchy. I find myself singing \\"Know\\" all the time, and it's not like one of those bad songs you get stuck in your head and ruins your day...It actually made my day to find myself singing the pleasing song!!Overall, \\"Take a Chance on Something Beautiful\\" gets 5 stars and hopefully we'll see these guys make it big! They deserve it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a chance on this!","review":"Listened to some demos quite a while back and had been waiting for the release - Impressive! Well worth the wait.

Passi, the popular Paris-based rapper collaborates on \\"African Kings\\" and this track is destined to be a big hit single.The song sequence and abrupt endings are rare production goofs but does not take away from the overall enjoyment.

It turns out that the handset cord has a nice, industry standard plug at one end but the other end - not depicted in the photos I viewed - is hardwired.Even if one could overlook this \\"feature,\\" it demands the question: Can the rest of the engineering be just as amaturish?Mine is on the regifting list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful phone. Do not buy!","review":"I bought this phone from a brick and mortar retailer, thinking I could trust its purchasing department. I was so wrong. I wish I had checked the Amazon reviews before buying. But who would have thought a company could screw up a corded phone? Well Thompson did just that and GE should be embarrassed. The other reviews hit the nail on the head. The cord is less two foot long and stretches maybe five feet. And it's hard-wired, so you cannot replace it with a longer corded. Seriously, hard-wired?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooga","review":"What a joke this phone is. I wanted to mount it on a wall and the cord is about 4 foot long. It is hard wired to the base unit and has to be wrapped around the bottom of the unit about 8 times. Then the base of the unit is to small and the wall plate shows. And last the handset to base cord is only about 3 foot long. It also is hard wired to the base unit. No wonder GE stock is in the dumper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had such a car","review":"\\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" was my favorite movie during early childhood. I was pleasantly surprised that the book tells a different story than the movie, although it conveys the same sense of adventure. Ian Fleming wrote \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" in a different style than more current children's literature, something that may bring a change of pace to a young audience. I don't think the crude illustrations by Burningham would be received in the same manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful classic story.","review":"If you are like me you grew up watching the movie about the wonderful magical car.This is the original story by Ian Fleming. I absolutely loved reading this story even as an adult and the art in the book is a treasure.It is a very different story than the movie but you can clearly see where the movie was garnered from this story.I highly recomend this edition if you want to see the classic art.Oh, and thanks to this book for telling me Chitty's license plate of GEN 11 really is \\"Genie\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like it more than this","review":"It was disappointing and surprising when I finished this book and didn't like it. I genuinely tried to set aside my knowledge and love of the movie, which was successful, but even that didn't help. It seems silly to say a book about a flying car was over the top, but it's the truth. The situations were too silly to be seen as realistic, and yet too grounded in reality to overlook their silliness.That being said, it is easy to see how some children (especially boys) would find this book engrossing. The adventure and thrilling cliff-hanger chapter endings do make for a fast pace. However, those who have seen the movies may not want to cope with the differences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the movie--even better!","review":"I remember the 1968 movie based on this novel fondly, but had never picked up the novel itself until just the other day. I was surprised at how different the book is. Although Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang herself is very similar in both, the plot of the story is much different. I enjoyed this simple little story, with Fleming's humorous asides, very much. Those asides reminded me of the \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\" books I have read and I would be interested in learning if Lemony Snicket drew from Fleming's story style for his own series. This is a fun, quick story that most kids will enjoy. I do, however, fear that the admittedly crude illustrations in my original edition would not be as popular with modern children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Big","review":"I ordered this costume in the toddler size for my 3 year old and the costume came with toddler size on the tag but is way too big for her.

He doesn't just sing songs, he really feels what he is singing is what is sounds like to me. His songs have been in my mind for over 12 years and I finally downloaded them today because I couldn't remember all the words to them from the \\"Utmost for His Highest\\" record.

I listened to it in my car as I drove to work, knowing I was heading into a difficult and stressful day. When sleep was elusive, many times I have faded into it through the soft, quiet and inspirational music of that tape. When my own brother was having trouble sleeping, I looked for My Utmost for His Highest: Quiet Prayers by Bryan Duncan online and was excited to be able to find it for him on Amazon.com.The words and music bring the heart to that relaxed place where one can rest in the arms of the Lord Jesus Christ, whether in the throws of a chaotic day, or the still of a lonely night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aye Chingow....","review":"next time the power is out - i'm cookin' with this! eclectic? sultry? different... could be a soundtrack for a good movie (film if you live in socal). find it. check it out. might just fill one of those dents in your soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more editing","review":"This book is riddled with mistakes. To name a few, 1. it says that cows are related to horses and swine (if you are going that far back in evolution then you might as well say that they are related to us), 2. several photos have misnamed the breed of cow in the picture, 3. says that Guernseys come from France (they originated on the channel island of Guernsey), 4. a photo shows some Muskoxen as being a type of wild cow (they are more closely related to goats), 5. the book states that cows have no incisors (they do have LOWER incisors). I could go on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unepic plot","review":"I read the whole book just to see if Tyler and Katelyn would get together. I was really not into the book from the very beginning. There was no real drama going on, only this dating trial. There was no epic plot that made me get interested in this book. I only got slightly interested when Stephen came into the picture, and it wasn't by a lot. All I can say about this book is that I feel I wasted my time reading this one and should have picked another book to read. For all the people that love drama happening in books do NOT read this book. If you like books that contain only dating and no actual big events going on then this is the right book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, But Not The Best","review":"It is a good book overall, but at the begining, they say hell to much.They also say that the mother slaps her sons.My daughter enjoied this book, but she ran over to me alot pointing out things that are wrong to put in a kids book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father and son relationships are tricky and fragile","review":"In this novel, Louie explores the tendency of fathers and sons to be at odds with each other. Add the element of cultural identity to the mixture and you have a very heartfelt view of family life, and what makes our own identity. While reading this book I thought long and hard about my own relationships, and what it was that I have been trying to accomplish. Very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Engaging But Frustrating Read","review":"The Barbarians Are Coming is an interesting story, but altogether frustrating due to the main character's inability to act upon, or even recognize, his emotional response to any given relationship. His relationship to his father,his wife, and to a lesser extent, his mother, is frought with tension due both to cultural disparities and emotional immaturity. He rejects his Chinese heritage, but feels lost in his American birthright. His passivity is at once frustrating and an elemental part of the story. In the end, though, you just want to grab him by the shirt collar and shake him into awareness of all of the damage he has done by not doing anything decisively in his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as nourishing as I had hoped","review":"Well written and often witty, but lacking in substance and sometimes embarrassingly self-indulgent. The book could have used a good editor (on several counts)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I cannot pinpoint exactly why I liked this book, I just did. I can say that the writing was superb, and I enjoyed following the characters. There was wit, there was sadness, and at times a detached, cold lack of emotion. But the detachment was almost like a character to me.One caveat. I found the references to the anatomy of the males in the book awkward in placement and content. They were extremely brief and only come up two, maybe three times. But, I was struck by how weird it felt for the author to be referencing it when and how he did each time. Maybe my gender prevents me from getting it.That aside, I think this is a solid piece of literature worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy read...","review":"I ran across this book by chance and had to read it. The title didn't match the cover and both enticed me to find out more. The plot is full, with forbidden relations, action and despair all packed into a dystopian society. Sure, there's a cure for just about everything, but intimacy seems to have disappeared. This book is supposed to be a trilogy, but as far as I know, it never happened. This is very disappointing given how wonderfully written \\"Sex Life\\" is. However, readers will not feel unresolved at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Imagine......","review":"The year is 2268. The place, New York City, now known as \\"first city\\".

Jameson, who has the dubious distinction of writing the \\"official\\" editorial statement about this Allen masterpiece, does not know what he is talking about. As often happens here on Amazon, many of the customer reviews are far more knowledgeable and discerning that the conventional mainstream critic's assessments.This is a finely written, highly dramatic play transfered flawlessly to film by a master cinematographer and is immensely superior to \\"Interiors\\" which is heavily influenced by, if not actually ripped off from, Ingmar Bergman. Here, the influence is subsumed into Allen's style and milieu, and he gets tremendous performances from the cast, especially Mia Farrow who despite the later troubles with Allen gave him a heartbreaking rendition of the fragile, wounded character of \\"Lane\\" who is brought to a state of desperation in the climax of the story, which is a spellbinding example of pure dramatic storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"bored to tears...","review":"1st things 1st...I love Woody's films and consider myself a true fan but after several re writes, scraping almost the entire film, re casting almost every role I found this film completly boring and just too claustrophobic..."},{"rating":"2","title":"a gem","review":"Great movie.

I am partial to historic romances set in Northern California especially San Francisco. When I found out that this was a turn of the century set read I quickly picked it up.This was a fine read which included two great main characters,(Grayson and Aurora) that will have you as the reader rooting for their happily-ever-after. Finding that they are attracted to each other is not the problem. Realizing that their love is strong and can survive outside the estate boundaries of Grayson's house is quite another. This read offers not only a fine romance that is as sensual as it can be, but it also offers a suspese storyline regarding who killed Grayson's father.I recommend this read for anyone that likes their romances spicy and sensual. This is a fast-paced read that will allow you to step into a wonderful make-believe world if for only a little while."},{"rating":"2","title":"273 Red - Fabulous American Fragrance","review":"Fred Hayman hit this one out of the park!

The radio performs well. It announces EVERY weather and flood alert in the ENTIRE area covered by St Louis NOAA. That is a huge area. After being awaken 6 times last night by thunderstorm alerts a half a state away I ordered the WR300. Unlike the WR11, the WR300 has S.A.M.E. tech which allows filter out warnings that do not apply to the area you are actually in and you can also filter out all alerts but the ones about life-threatening situations.

However, what was not expected was not being able to tell what time it is because the so called 'back light' is only bright enough to see the numbers when an alert is in progress.

I bought two of them and they both have this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backlight not so good, but servicable","review":"My need was for an alarm clock that would wake me to NOAA weather.

The AM and FM tuner is analog and only gets a few stations, even though I live in an urban area with a plethora of station.

Unless you fully extend the antennae, which is awkward for, say, a bedside table, you will get no reception at all. Finally, I couldn't set the clock so that it read 12 PM and not 12 AM.
