The characters are well developed, interesting, exciting, and can really capture your heart. Did I mention I hate reading? Before this author I never read unless required by school.

Velma, also one of the smarter series characters, is a whiny, completely unlikeable teenage girl who is possessive, clingy, wanting to change the guy she supposedly likes, who is jealous of a DOG...

A good majority of the acting was not very good, and you didnt have the chance to feel for the characters.

The soundtrack wasnt bad but could have been much better, like it didn't quite do the job. The writing and directing was what really made this movie a winner. It was like someone handed the story to a 14 year old kid with no vision. BAD BAD BAD. The really sad thing is this could have been a really great movie, and no, budgeting wasnt the problem.

This is the third time we've been let down. And this is the third time Brandon Lee has rolled over in his grave to take a sh*t on the people who made these crappy movies.

The reason i gave it two stars was because I keep hoping there will be another one that can be better than the last. I will say this, it's the worst of the series.

The Prophecy series is decent even up to #5. Wicked Prayer tried to open a new angle within the premise of the storyline and it just wasn't pulled off well.

The acting by eddie furlong was not good because he got nothing to work with he did try and I saw that.

You all know these movies sucks and she is a part of that cause. Back to the crow the love between the 2 couple is bland and the action was so stupid. I swear if you see closely you see the wires when they pretend to fly at each other. This felt like an Uwe Boll presentation, you'll feel like vomiting for every second you watch this film.

The addition of the Satanic cult makes no sense nor does it really make for an exciting confrontation. 3. David Boreanaz and Tara Reid are about as compatible as water and fire. Boreanaz overacts while Reid just looks pretty. 4.

This movie has both good points and bad points. The only good points are the fact that it has all the main parts of the Crow story...guy dies horrible death for wrong reason...comes back to life for revenge. Other than that...nothing else good about the movie. If anyone is a real Crow fan, I highly recommend they read the book. This movie was based, loosely I might add, on a book written by Norman Partridge. The book was awesome. One of the best Corw stories written so far. Lance Mungia BUTCHERED it when he made this into a movie. Its one thing to turn a book into a movie and its a completely different thing to do what they did to this story.

Not only do we get to discover the genius of Parker, but we're taken on the journey with a brilliant writer. Here, Bird does indeed live. Russell vividly captures the essence of the man, the music and the times, and this book is as much a tribute to his superb literary talent as it is to Parker's prodigous musical gifts. A rare combination. If you haven't yet read it, I envy you. They don't get any better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete fraud","review":"This book is historical fiction, not biography, a novel, and a badly written one at that. Ross Russell recorded Parker for Dial records, and also exploited him by releasing sides that show Parker breaking down, for which Bird never forgave him.. Conveniently for Russell, Bird died young, so he could weave this fiction out of his life, exploiting him again for money. Just try the opening scene, an imaginary fable of an encounter between Parker and Dean Benedetti, who, while real, is a cardboard, fictional composite in this book. To begin with, there was no wire recorder. If you're looking for good bios of Bird, try Gary Giddin's book, Gillespie's \\"To Be Or Not To Bop,\\" Phil Schaap's exhaustive liner notes for the two collections he mastered and produced; the complete Parker on Verve and the complete Dean Benedetti tapes. Yes, they exist, and they begin to set the record of this sorry book straight. Avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Myth and Legend","review":"I have to agree with the other one star review posted here.

This 1986 release was one of Jeffrey's strongest albums but it did not duplicate the success of 1983's \\"Stay With Me Tonight\\" (although both albums are quite similar as far as the choice of material and production are concerned).

This is the first Philosophy product that has let me down and let me down in a big way. The creme is light and feels good, but it doesn't look or feel like it goes on or absorbs well at all. After it's applied it glistens, and I'm constantly noticing areas that lack that effect and looks dry, so I find myself constantly reapplying it. And now after a week and a half of daily use it's half gone. I didn't have this problem with L'Occitane so I guess I'll go back to that unless I find something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bottle goes no where","review":"I have many Philosophy products and have been overall very happy with the quality and value.

If you want to try a great hand and body lotion that is not at all greasy and very light weight try body drench!!!!! the lotion is great and you could buy it {on amazon} for $8.95 and its a big bottle and will last you forever.

I would not reorder this stuff again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells Great, but...","review":"I needed a good handcream that would leave my hands feeling soft and not rough, so I purchased this little bottle in hopes it would do the trick.I'm actually very disappointed with this handcream. It is rather greasy and almost sticky feeling. From the picture I assumed a normal handcream with maybe a mild scent, but my bottle came labled as being \\"Handmade Lemon Custard Hand Cream\\". While the scent was delicious (and made me crave Lemon Bars...), the product itself left me rather disheartened. Even twenty minutes after thoroughly rubbing in the product, my hands are still greasy feeling.Perhaps it is back to the drawing board for philosophy on this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be a Handmaden","review":"Look no further than Handmade for the moisture your hands crave. First the texture of this cream is luscious, creamy and very rich. Secondly, one smell and you will want this fragrance to last the whole day long. Three, only the finest of moisturizing ingredients are used, including the expensive and hard-to-find pure shea butter. Nature and technology have melded into the creation of one of the finest hand creams you will ever use.The only reason I didn't say 5 stars is because it does not contain anything with which to exfoliate dead skin cells. Philosophy has another product, Time On Your Hands, that does. Put these two in conjunction with each other or regularly exfoliate before applying Handmade. Either way in a matter of days the skin on your hands will be baby soft. The writer of this review has chronic severely dry hands. I can attest to the purity and quality of this hand cream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"At the beginning of this book the author states that Honduras is the only logical choice for living in Central America.

It is shelved with picture books - and is by the publisher's own admission geared for \\"kindergarten to 3rd grade\\" kids. However, it's not appropriate (unless your family has very low standards). There is a bully character named \\"Micky Badazz.\\" Seriously? That ticked us off, right away, because it's as if the author and publisher are trying to pull one over on the adults (or the kids) by inserting unnecessary pseudo-profanity into a CHILDREN'S book.

It's unsettling to know there are people this dim among us, but I giggle almost continuously whenever I pick up this book.*For people who weren't raised with books in their bathroom: a bathroom book is any type of light reading consisting of small stand-alone pieces.

I came to it looking for a brief overview of German history to fill in some blanks, but instead found a mash-up between a looking back from WWII and an attempt at that brief history. What results has the worst of both...in fact, for a German history, there is no worse remark I can level than to say that it simply isn't nearly thorough enough...If Ozemont wanted to do something about how the Nazis raped German history for their own ends, that's another book. Not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in non-significant details","review":"I was really disappointed. I expected a carefully researched overview outlining the significant events and how they have impacted on and shaped German history. Instead the author gets lost in too many insignificant details.

The research is presented in a lively, interesting, fun to read style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissatisfying","review":"It's very clear that the author is more interested in ideas and cultural movements than politics, which renders the book fairly useless as a historical tract.For example, he spends two entire pages talking about the meetings between Frederick the Great and Voltaire, but the actual actions that led to the \\"Great\\" moniker (the silesian wars and subsequent silesian incorporation) are only mentioned in a paragraph, without background or any detailed description. Particularly the lack of political context is galling - was the invasion of silesia a pure grab for land, or was there a backstory? What was the pretext? None of this is mentioned.All in all, this scewed narrative made me quit after the rise of Prussia. Maybe it dealt with later germany better, I don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read any other book","review":"I found this book annoying. Something about the style is just not right. It jumps around way too much, if it were better I'd say it should be longer. Too many names come in for about one paragraph without sufficient background info. I frequently found myself asking \\"when was this?\\" While many historians will include a simple detail like the birth and death years of the people they're writing about, Mr. Ozment didn't find this necessary. Additionally, I would really like to have had more maps.As a prior reviewer mentioned, Mr. Ozment has the German army avoiding the Maginot Line at the beginning of WWI. A mistake of this size is utterly unacceptable. As I am no expert on German history, I have to wonder what else is inaccurate?On the whole, the book reads as if Mr. Ozment had procrastinated far too long, and began writing at the last possible moment to meet a deadline.I will be looking for a different, more reliable, history of Germany."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ford Focus Fog Light","review":"The product is much less expensive then going to the dealer and they work just like an OEM part.

Very open, quite critical of false spirituality, totally aware of the possible mistakes on the road and of the traps set up by pride. I love the simple yet beautiful writing. It is not true that all the sages presented in the book are said to be enlightened. Quite the contrary.

Mind you after looking at the reviews on his biography, I read an article by Katherine Webster online and it sounds as if Swami Rama still had ego problems in his adult days!But this book is still good and I enjoyed it better after reading the said article as it sounds as if he did all the things he dismissed the other 'fake' swamis of doing.

Australia is getting into the habit of producing wistfully beautiful and elegant music, and Art of Fighting is no exception. This is their second major release, and, like its predecessor Wires, it is both lyrical and musical perfection. This music is beautiful and delicate and powerful at the same time. The first track, Along the Run, is a song of unspeakable brilliance and beauty, and sets the tone for what is a consistantly remarkable album. Every song until the closer, Heart Translation, is, again, for lack of a more appropriate word, purely beautiful. I cannot recommend this band highly enough.

I'm not qualified to comment on anything operatic, but I do like Phillip Glass. I'll need to check out some of his other albums to find what is more to my tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A too-small step forward","review":"Ever since I saw a performance of 1000 Airplanes on the Roof when I was in college, I have been a fan of Mr. Glass. When I first heard the Civil WaRS, I was absolutely floored. The first two tracks of this work seem much different (and much more mature) than his works to date. However, the self-indulgent Robert Wilson/Laurie Anderson narration on tracks three and four snapped me back to reality. Glass has grown but has not outgrown some of his worse avant garde modernist habits. Phil, the 80's are over! These ploys were interesting when they were fresh, but now they just are stale and annoying. If this work did not have the stream-of-consciousness narration, I would feel that Glass had finally managed to break through to a new level of excellence. If you are a fan of Glass who is not bothered by long passages of nonsensical glossolalia, you might like this CD. Otherwise, just buy it and play the absolutely phenomenal tracks 1 & 2 over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Glass \\"Opera\\"","review":"While the expansive Einstein on the Beach has some truly amazing moments, and I cherish my copies of Akhnaten and Satyagraha, it's the relatively short 'The Civil Wars' that gets the most play. It contains what I believe are some of the most achingly beautiful vocal & instrumental harmonies I've had the pleasure of experiencing. And I LOVE Robert Wilson's cameo, as he playfully explores the mechanics of speech; dissecting sounds and words, turning them over, rearranging them, exposing their limits. Wilson had a speech impediment as a youth, and language (like everything else in his work) takes on special significance. It's too bad this project was never fully realized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and put to use..","review":"Okay, so we are all not great organizers, but this book gives you alittle insight on why and also the how to unclutter.

I say this because in my opinion the author writes the book with under tones of arrogance and does not explain to the reader that these are methods that may work for him but it is ok to try other ways to find what fits for a particular person. There are many ways to archive success in completing an organizing task and a person should be open-minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oy Vey!","review":"No one has ever been a bigger Dusty Springfield fan than I. That said, this is one of the most amateurish, thrown together \\"salute\\" DVD's I've ever seen. If it weren't for the rare footage of Dusty's TV appearances, this little disc would have found its way into File 13 by now.It's \\"hosted\\" by 2 people who act as though they had nothing more than a nodding aquaintance with Ms. Springfield - Petula Clark and B. J. Thomas. It just begs the question \\"why them?\\".Save your money and buy the French & Saunders video which has most of the same clips plus Dusty HERSELF! Yep, she participates in this humourous banter with the gals who put together AbFab. It's much more enlightening to hear about Dusty's life and career from Dusty herself rather than a couple of aging contemporaries. It's a real treasure since it was one of Dusty's last public appearances.This DVD is just a fluff piece of cheaply produced drivel with some great old clips. Do yourself a favour - buy the French & Saunders video instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassle","review":"After receiving the item I installed it in my Explorer and gave it a test run while out Christmas shopping. The picture quality on the main unit was outstanding, however the other monitor had distortion and what looked to be signal problems. I returned the item and received another from Amazon, Kudos to Amazon for being so fast with the replacement. I installed the second item, and had the same problems. Needless to say we returned that one too and went with a different DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This DVD player falls WAY below my expectations. The cord will not stay in place to recharge the battery. And, funny, this started happening a day after the 3 month warranty wore out! Customer service is unfreindly and uncooperative. The product is not worth the money to repair, so I threw $161.00 down the drain! I'll stick with other manufacturers with better customer service and a more reliable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless product","review":"The Coby TF-DVD7750 portable tablet DVD player is simply a poorly made product. While it did play DVD's when I first purchased this item, it quickly became useless after only a few uses. Even when it did play DVD's, it would stop in the middle of a movie due to overheating, etc. Now, it won't play anything. This product was never dropped, stored incorrectly, etc. It simply doesn't work. The screen quality was fine, but what good is that when the unit won't read a DVD in the first place? I finally threw the tablets away in the garbage. Also, if you have children like I do, buy one of the units that has the DVD player separate from the screens. This way you can easily change the movies from the front of the car without having to take the player/screen (like the Coby unit) out of its harness to switch movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great System for the $$$","review":"I bought this dvd player for a road trip to Iowa. The picture quality and sound are great. Easy to install, took less than 10 minutes. For the price I would reccommend this dvd player.

Overall a great purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a let down","review":"I wasted over $150 on this letdown.Surprise, the warranty ran out just as the player died.Blue screen on the main unit and no picture at all on the other.I will purchase another portable unit from another company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Don't waste your money on this product. It worked great for 4 months and has now stopped working. It will not play any movie even after cleaning the heads. Customer service was unable to help with the problem except to say I would need to take it to a service center. I guess the reason they only have a 90 warranty is that is about how long their product lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase","review":"Really liked the product at first. After the warranty ran out the system kept telling us it could not read the disk. I called the company several times and they told me to trash it. Gladly! It was a waste of my time and money. I will never again purchase a Coby product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Overpopulated","review":"After several tries, I had to give up on this book. Perhaps familiarity with L'Engle's other works endears this weariness to some. (I haven't read her other books,although I did skim her portrait of her marriage). New characters just keet coming and coming, yet they are cut-outs, not developed other than their particular talents stated. The cold main character is haughty and unlikeable. I've liked other books with repugnant protagonists, but this woman is unpleasantly vapid despite an abundance of talent and an interesting life - maybe that's the dull point. If she was a real person, you'd avoid her. Why waste your time when there are so many interesting books waiting?. Perhaps the plot kicks in at some later time, but after 100 pages waiting for the countless characters to do something, I give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw this book in the TRASH.","review":"As a huge fan of her children's novels, I anticipated a wonderful book. But anyone with any kind of conservative moral convictions BEWARE: all the major plot threads of this novel are based on a hell-raising variety of sexual escapades. I don't need that kind of junk in my mind, and neither does anyone else. I threw this book in the trash, which I have never done before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Long, Nothing Special","review":"I really love chick lit, and found this to be one of the most boring, going nowhere stories I have read in a long time...

Definitely would NOT recommend!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anna Maxted's best novel yet.","review":"Being Committed: A Novel by chick-lit goddess, Anna Maxted is her most intriguing and engrossing book to date. I love the wacky and unpredictable relationship between Hannah and her ex-husband Jack. This book was so fun to read about two summers ago. This is the book I always go back to every now and then. I love, love, love it and so will you. I highly recommend checking this romantic novel out."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first Maxted book - not so impressed","review":"I was looking forward to a hard-to-put-down-engrossing-chick lit, but I thought the book was kind of disappointing...story and characters were shallow, superficial and plot took too many developments that weren't really credible - and I couldn't bond with the characters. It was written well enough, but it's just not particularly witty or funny. It felt kind of like watching an ok soap opera, as you're reading you're fairly hooked but in the end you don't miss out if you don't read it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap of the cheap quality","review":"Not happy at all with the quality of this cable.

If you can't get enough of Queen, or you want to know all the details of their rise and fame this is the book to have. It takes you on their journey and keeps you interested every step of the way. I will read it over and over again. Very tastefully written with love and admiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Essence of Verdun and it's Effects","review":"The other reviewers are correct to point out that this is not a battle history per se. There is little in the way of dates, places, times, etc. However where this book is successful is in capturing the very essence of Verdun and the effect it had over those who fought there. It also successfully places Verdun in the larger context of French national thought. If you are someone who desires to know the true heart of Verdun, what separated it from other battles in the Great War, then read this book. It should be a compliment to a true battle history account such as Horne's classic, The Price of Glory.I have been to Verdun twice and spent over a week in its ravaged forests and ravines. This books manages to capture the mood that persists to this day at that sacred place. If you are a person who wishes to really delve into the \\"spirit\\" of the battle, then definitely read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Road to Verdun??","review":"If you want to read about Napoleon I or III or Louis XIV or XVI or the republics or the Franks, Gauls, and Romans in France among many other subject that have nothing to do with the battle this is the book for you. If you want to learn about the Battle of Verdun I would strongly suggest you read something else. The author wanders between the time when the Romans controlled the area that became France up through WWII. There is at least 1/2 of the book that just is not on topic.When the author is on topic he is very vague. He mentions about the amount of time and effort and the number of historians who worked to discover what exactly happened during the capture of Fort Douaumont but then he skims over the event basically saying which Germans came and then tells you the two senior officers received the German equivalent of the Medal of Honor. He fails to describe the events of the capture of the fort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The why","review":"I very much enjoyed this book! I'm doing research on Verdun for a novel I'm writing and this book gave me so much more than just and troops when here or there... it was brilliant background on what people may have been feeling and why they acted as they did! The battle made so much more sense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dense and Plodding","review":"It is a shame that author Ian Ousby died before completing \\"The Road to Verdun.\\" If he had lived to see the project all the way through, he might have shaped it into something more readable. Certainly, Ousby was a diligent researcher and a very astute historian. Unfortunately, the book's plodding prose and strange configuration (for example, a 58 page prologue!) have mangaged to drain all but the most scholarly interest from the famous World War I \\"battle\\" in which there were more than 700,000 casualties. Great works of history, particularly military history, make the past come alive in such a way that expands interest in the subject matter well beyond the academic world. Ultimately, \\"The Road to Verdun\\" doesn't come close to doing that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Road to Nowhere","review":"Well just as the soldier's thought this was going to be an exciting war with lots of action and glory only to find it to be tedious and boring most of the time. This indeed was how I found this book. As both sides where bogged down in the trenches I became bogged down with endless trivlality and different points of historical contoversy.Never the less Mr. Ousby covered it very well for the scholor and those in need of knowing why WW1 came to be. His points on this are the best and the clearest I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the road, not much of the Battle of Verdun","review":"This book remined me of going to a class about miltary and battles and getting 75% filler and 25% about the actual battle. This book would have been much better if about 150 pages of the fill that had nothing to do with WWI was not included. It almost seemed like the auther had some other material that was vaguely related to the battle and decided to put it in the middle of the book as fill. Do not waist your time reading this unless you just have to read something boreing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book of it's kind.","review":"John Poole has written a fantastic treatise on what will be needed to fight and win wars in the years to come. Though it makes for dry reading at times, this book is absolutely fascinating.It not only discusses enemy tactics, it recommends methods on how to develop ninjustsu-like tactics on your own.

The writing, casting, and acting are all second to none! The fact that the show was shot and produced in Baltimore gives it the unique and unparalled touch that makes this show so special. There has been no characters on television to date that can match that of Andre Braugher's character of Frank Pembleton. The man is a genius. Richard Belzer makes John Munch a very special character that makes you cynical just listening to him. All of the characters are unique and very, very special to the show...more so in the earlier seasons where the emotion and drama were less \\"televisionized\\" and real-to-life. This is a show that captures the human condition in the frame of homicide detectives and leaves you feeling the precious nature of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely incredible.","review":"I really don't have terms glowing enough to describe this season of Homicide.

I have been in the oil construction / engineering field in Alaska for over 30 years. I have also done extensive research on Hubbert's \\"Peak Oil\\" theory, which is not a theory anymore. In 1948 Hubbert began proving his theory beyond doubt by refining his data in time blocks to gain the maximum accuracy it contains today. Hubbert's theory acounts for the unfound oil and it is proving more true as time passes. It is a shame to see an individual, like Williams, supposedly representing God, to use a dead man,a mystery man and our nation's ignorance on anything outside American Idol, in an attempt to get into his neighbor's pockets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes!

Elite members even call him at home to spill their guts. The book costs $2000 because it is worth it. Each copy has enough snake oil in it to power the United States for over two hundred years!

The author succinctly gives us a view of Kupyer's life and influence; not a small task. In the main body of the book jBratt does a masterful job of selecting various works of Kuyper that give us a very well rounded view of the man. This not an easy task given the massive corpus Kuyper created.

All the information he puts in the book can now be found on different forums and blogs.Also having been on his mailing list I see that the author is always promoting other guys seduction material- so if he has the answer and his book is supposed to make you an alpha male- why does he promote other teachers stuff all the time?Answer: this guy is just a marketer trying to make money. I don't think he is an alpha male- just a keyboard jockey at best..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"You'll often here women say \\"Sexyness is something that men have to exude\\". This book elaborates on just that. Any pick up artist will tell you that inner game is just as important if not more important than outer game. This book goes into descriptive detail on the fundementals of the Alpha Male persona, elaborating on such things as body language, vocal tonality, and inner belief. I for one have noticed a significant change in the way women as well as friends and people in general behave around me. This book is a must have, I highly recomend this for anyone who is looking to have game with women, or improve the game they already have. FIVE STARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"Highly unorganized in the advice that is given.......and half the reviews are Fake on the website.

This book is a better guide if you focus on the general principles.Those principles are deep and may help you become a better person.As for my personal experience, the book delivered its promise. It allowed me to identify where I was getting it all wrong and provided an alternative that worked much better.The book main shortcoming is that it emphasizes a confrotational attitude that requires more social skills than the average reader of this kind of book possess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative gigolo guide for busy studs!","review":"I found this read to be just what I needed!

But that section is worth the value of the book. The other info is very important, but it is covered in other books as well. I found the alpha male info very insightful and in a way revolutionary in the area of relationships. There are too many men, that are bunch of wimps, it could all be changed with a different point of view. And that point of view would in turn change the actions of a man for the better. This book provides that crucial information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starting point","review":"This book is an excellent starting point for those trying to wade through the ocean of sailboats available on the used market, who want to get \\"the most bang for their buck.\\" The reader should come away with at least several favories, allowing him/her to narrow the search for the \\"perfect\\" boat. At the same time, other boats will be stricken from the list of possibilites because of information contained in this book. It is aimed at the person who wants to get out there and sail on the best boat possible, but must shop carefully due to budget considerations. The short descriptions and comparisons of the boats are helpful, as are the details of the \\"known weaknesses,\\" and interviews with owners. I just wish the book could have profiled more than 20 sailboats, I hated to reach the end. As a companion to this book, I would recommend \\"Inspecting The Aging Sailboat\\" by Don Casey. I would buy this book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for a beginner","review":"I am new to sailing but this book is accessible enough for a beginner to start narrowing choices. The book's organization allowed me to quickly skim through a chapter and glean enough to know if that boat might be one that would be a candidate for my needs, interest, and budget; it has the right blend of technical information and personal anecdote. Using this format Vigor could easily expand to include many more boats and still have a useful reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good placeto start, but...","review":"There should be more books like this for young sailors to read. His writing style is good - the information presented is good, but it is true he omitted some boats which should have been included. That said, how many people have sailed in every possible boat between 25 and 40 ft that might be capable off shore? I like the emphasis on inexpensive boats. In addition to this book be sure to read J. Fitzgerald's \\"Sea-Steading\\" , Pardey's books, and Hiscocks. You don't need an expensive boat full of all the latest gadgets to sail the oceans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreams in paper form","review":"This book took hold of my imagination and such that I actually went out and got me a small boat that can take me anywhere! With any luck, perhaps I can eventually try a few of the other inspiring little boats Mr Vigor so painstakingly described in this little tome!Really, this has become my favourite book - which I actually carry around with me; if I'm ever feeling down, I can just pull out the dog-eared little paperback and wistfully dream about Bristol Channel Cutters and Pearson Tritons and Folkboats and cetera!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Easy Read","review":"As a Sailboat owner and always looking out for improvements to my current boat or an eye to another one this book has been a nice summer read with short chapters that allow you to set it down and start up again any time the mood strikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!

I took a closer look at the belt - Made in India. I went to my local hardware store with both belts. He measured and confirmed that the new belt was too small. He sold me a replacement for $9.95.

It is about how Jack Schwager, the author, is late for planes (this is the subject of the introduction), how Jack is late for interviews, where various traders have worked and how they liked their previous jobs, what their offices look like, etc.This book reads as though it was assembled very hastily. The interviews are short and very, very shallow.This book is so far below what Jack Schwager is capable of...$ can be much better spent elsewhere... This book was a frustration and disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a joke!!","review":"What is the point of doing an interview with traders who act like they have some kind of secert. Wake up people, there is no secret. the secret is mastering yourself. once you have done that and you follow the basic rules of trading, the money will follow. It cracks me up when these traders say they do not want to talk about thier methods. The trend I see is these traders get burned out and go on to writing books and doing seminars and teaching. If they are so successful, lets hear how they became successful. The only part about the book I enjoyed was on Mark Cook. About his persistence to do well. Save your money and learn how to master your own mind. Get trading for a living by mark douglas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why write another???","review":"I am sorry, but this book should not even have been written.

The traders in this book are top notched. It shows how you that others can trade consistently and be profitable. Trading when you understand the rules isn't being in Vegas sitting at the slots. It means being the house at Vegas.

It's not nearly as in depth as the other two Market Wizard books.

Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"marketing tool for the market wizard fund","review":"I have to say that this is indeed the worst of the Market Wizard books. I got the feeling that it was written as a marketing tool for Mr. Schwaeger's Market Wizard Fund of funds.One interview that I found particularly annoying was Stephen Lescarbeau, who only agreed to the interview because of Gil Blake's interview in MW II. Unlike Mr. Blake, he revealed nothing about his methodology, only the inspiration for it. Further, I see from Mr. Lescarbeau's review of the book, he was surprised by the information divulged by the other wizards. He should have done likewise or not have been included in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"I have to agree with some of the reviews here. The \\"wizards\\" in this book seem very worried about giving any type of information regarding their techniques. Now, I am not looking for easylanguage code for each of their systems, but they divulge little compared to the traders in the first book.Also, how about interviewing some individual traders as well.It's too bad this isn't a better book.

A preachy, incoherent plot, filled with wooden characters (helpfully named things like 'Kali' and 'Arcangelo' so you can tell the good guys from the bad guys), and awful mystical science which explains how some animals are intrinsically evil.Yuck. Go read the 'Wrinkle in Time' trilogy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to Basic","review":"This book followed a plot woth charactors who did the thing you would expect them to do in a book.

The evil characters are completely evil; you lose all sympathy for Adam as he continues to be confused about which characters to trust and obey. The Young Unicorns is a much tighter, more compelling thriller and much more interesting in its exploration of good and evil. Please read The Young Unicorns for L'Engle at her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"L'Engle Makes another great book!!","review":"If you love books that have a lot of clues and are a bit confusing you're in for a treat.

My friend requested this one because one of the characters is in the other series by L'Engle. As a scientist, I found some parts not quite realistic but close enough and other parts were amazingly still holding up today. I am not sure about such a young teen boy being able to do all of this but honestly, this was a pretty good story. If you have enjoyed any of the Austin family or related stories, you will very much enjoy this one. It reads a little like a thriller and has some enjoyable cultural references. I would like to especially commend the publisher; while these are paperbacks, the covers of this series are beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the uninitiated","review":"I had to buy this book for class. Even the professor stated that the book was heavy going and has to be reread over and over again to understand it. There are examples but they really don't go over them in enough detail. This book is really for someone who already has a good user knowledge of excel and somewhat familiar with solver. Many of my classmates have expressed dissatisfaction with the contents and how it was written. My main complaint is that there are not enough examples to illustrate the many new concepts found in this book. This is a difficult subject and the book doesn't make it easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This book is definitely very advanced and is very clearly written. The approach will:- state (and explain) business problems- explain the rational in choosing the computer tool (despite the title, the book is not entirely focused on Excel).- walk you step by step through the modeling processThe CD contains some valuable tools for advances topics (monte carlo and discrete event simulation).

I already have a good number of Boston Camerata CD's and I wanted to find out what was on this one before I purchased it.

There seems to be two main characters in the book but they never interact; at least in the first hundred or so pages. Also the characters are flimsy, without depth and there is no plot. The story just winds on and on. I didn't know what the hero and heroine was trying to do even after the first hundred pages. They just seem to go on and on with their lives.

Nice touch!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent characters! Great series!","review":"I definitely enjoyed the \\"King's Dragon\\"/Crown of Stars series. The characters were complex and interesting, and the story unfolded slowly in the beginning and then built to a fast paced... not conclusion, but stopping place. The best thing about this book is that although it was full of the fantasy staples..sorcery, battles, elves, kings, etc. it did not overuse them. You definitely will enjoy spending time with these characters, and I know I look forward to reading more about them in the future.The only reason I rated this series a 4 (instead of 5) is because the later books (especially #4 \\"Child of Flame\\") can be a little hard to follow at times. The many plotlines/characters are woven in a very intricate tapestry. This can be very entertaining though, after reading some of the less thought provoking fantasy series out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUMB","review":"I purchased the book based on the rave reviews given by Amazon.com readers - big mistake! If you like two-dimensional characters with the depth of a puddle, this is the book for you. Elliot is frightfully unimaginative with her generous borrowing of our very own medieval customs, literature, and religion. The characters' actions and reactions are unbelievable and melodramatic. As for the plot...there are at least twenty with as many loose ends. While you do follow approximately 4 central characters, hundreds more are introduced for absolutely no purpose; some are even killed off and I'm not sure if I was supposed to care. Maybe the next book in the series helps explain half of the characters and plots introduced in the first, but I can't stomach it to find out. If it's a 5-star author you're looking for, check out Guy Gavriel Kay or Stephen R. Donaldson."},{"rating":"1","title":"First 300 pages - very slow reading!","review":"A friend lent me this book and told me that the book was exciting, tremendous, thrilling and vivid, yet when I started reading it, I felt that Kate Elliot was dragging the story, not giving any progress, not letting the reader hold on to something. It was very frustrating reading the first 300 pages, I found myself skimming the first sentences in each paragraph. While it is perhaps a necessity of the subject matter, I felt all of the main characters were either excessively cruel or excessively weak. Some of her story lines were very confusing. Example: When St. Thecla appears to Alian and gives him the rose. I really don't grasp why Kate Elliott included this. Even though this wasn't my favourite book, I did appreciate the literary skill of Kate Elliott..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate Universe - very interesting","review":"I very much enjoyed both King's Dragon and Prince of Dogs, and look forward to reading the 3rd volume.

Well worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good book, but......","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but it had a problem that just really cheapend the book for me. It's a simple thing really. The author did a holesale ripe off of the Roman Catholic church. From the tearms used to address religous figures and changing the spelling of historical persons names and their writtings, for example Eusebuius wrote the Ecclesatical history, but how was it in the text Eusebi. And what I really thought was the worst were several blatent quations from the new testament, from Acts 2 for example to the names of the four gospels of the fictional church which were in the case of three gospels, slightly changed names and then then one from a noncannonical source. Other than the author's poorly borrowed christian tradition, I loved the book, I thought this portion really lacked imagination and originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of novel","review":"This book is nothing special. Imagine George R.R. Martin's a song of ice and fire but make it boring and hard to follow with a really so so narrative and no emotion-you'd get this book.This is basically just like the normal Middle Ages, but with monsters and other creatures that are never explained. Take normal human conflicts, throw in some obscure stuff, and viola-here is the Kings Dragon, a boring and extremely typical fantasy book. I can't say I'd recommend it just because there's nothing really good about it (although, there's nothing bad either) and nothing grabbed my attention in any way. I won't continue on with the series and I'm not interested in this author anymore. Maybe this book is more for people who like intrigue fantasy or more normal fantasy books, stuff with nothing really fantastic in it, but this just wasn't my kind of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much religion, not enough good writing","review":"I made it most of the way through the second book of this series before I couldn't take any more.

But have yet to get my hands on 'Prince of Dogs' or 'Burning Stone' (books are scarce where I am)... This is just a really terrific read... I've never tired of reading it again and again... I really, really love the characters as they are fleshed out wonderfully... the plot is engaging and the background history gives the world a real 3d feel... Recommended to anyone who likes a book with adventure and drama! And anyone who likes fantasy should *definately* give this one a shot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did someone forget the storyline?","review":"I am an avid fantasy reader and was seeking a new series to sink my teeth into. I read online reviews of this book before I bought it and found them quite positive. After reading 400 pages of King's Dragon, I called it quits (something I rarely do). The author spent so much time on background info for the religious and political landscape of the story, that she completely forgot about progressing the storyline itself. I didn't care about the characters and I didn't care about the story. If you like complex, detail oriented fantasy, maybe this book is for you. If you read fantasy for a rich storyline that urges you to read on and on, try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible...","review":"I have read many books, but nothing has ever been this good! King's Dragon, is fast paced, and the characters are so very real! I highly recommend this book to any fantasy lover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Renaissance - Transitional Album That Does Not Quite Work","review":"Being a long time Annie Haslam era Renaissance fan I have always been curious about the early albums before the classic lineup came to be. I checked out the first Renaissance album and was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Bering that in mind I decided to delve into \\"Illusion\\" hoping for a similar find. Unfortunately this one does not stack up nearly as well, and does not do nearly as much for me. The band was pretty much falling apart at this point and I think it shows on the album. The best track is \\"Mr. Pine\\" which featured Mike Dunford who would go on to lead the more famous next incarnation of the group. The rest of the album is a mish mash of half finished ideas and meandering instrumental interludes. The final track \\"Past Orbits Of Dust\\" has it's moments, but at almost 15 minutes eventually wears out it's welcome. In the end this was a transitional album that did not live up to the material that came before or after it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy stupid","review":"Someone else mentioned the interviews on this CD but I hadn't read it until I ordered and received this. I didn't see any mention of interviews let alone interviews that are mixed in with each of the songs. I just can't believe; who would have been stupid enough to mix the interview with the actual song in the SAME track. I mean even if you were interested in what the artists had to say(which I'm not), how many times would you want to listen to it? Even having done this they could have lessened the impact to your music listening if they had at least placed the interview AFTER the song in the track. Then at least you could have skipped forward to the next track. Someone really blew it with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BIG LIE","review":"You need to write another book this next one about 9/11 how the media and politicians were coerced by the corporate rich to make it happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indeed, Attack The Messenger","review":"Crawford is one of the least talented, alleged \\"analysts\\" on the political scene. His book adds no contrarian or scholarly insight to a debate that's already been thoroughly rehashed. His CQ columns are dreadful, and his book is little better.If you want a real analysis of the media's role in covering politics, read Howard Kurtz or Larry Sabato for starters and stay away from Crawford."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fantastic book!","review":"Once I picked it up I didn't want to put it down again. Craig Crawford has provided compelling and insightful criticism of the role of politicians and the press in the erosion of public trust in the media. A sobering look at the intersection of politics and media as it exists today. A must read for consumers of news and information, but should be of particular interest to students of Journalism, Public Policy and Political Science.Craig offers much needed historical context for the breakdown in trust between the politicians, the press and the public. He makes an eloquent case for the importance of a free press to a healthy democracy. We all benefit when the press is free to serve its ultimate purpose of watchdog and informant for the public, and we all suffer when that process is eroded. Everyone should read this book.Buy this book! Buy this book! Seriously, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak and disappointing","review":"I purchased this cologne from another company. The cologne is weak, disappointing, and a rip-off.

After soldering a few wires and running the ipod cable to the glovebox, I have my mp3's from my 8gb nano being channelled through to my headunit.

I then went to my local installer and confirmed with them that they could install all three devices and still allow my factory rear entertainment center to function in the new setup. After 3.5 hours they failed.I decided that I'd return the items because I needed to get an alternative gift before Christmas and I didn't have time to find another way to get it installed. I was able to return the D2, but the GEX-P10XMT and the IB100II are not returnable. It turns out that Amazon brokered my sale to three other companies that have differing return policies.

At this point I will never purchase anything else from Amazon ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this with an AVIC-D2","review":"I bought this unit for my Pioneer AVIC-D2. I had it in for about 2 weeks and got completely fed up with it. The interface is horrible [can only go next or previous, can't fast forward], and almost no information gets displayed (one line with only 8 characters or so). I took it out of the car and I bought an iPod to 3 RCA adaptor. (video, left and right audio) I connected that to my D2, and it is fantastic. The quality is just as good as through this CD-IB100II, but I have full control of my iPod, and in addition, I can play movies on the D2's screen.Now this unit is back in it's box, but my return limit has just expired.. so I'm stuck with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Update of New English Bible","review":"The Revised English Bible is a useful one to have, partly because it translates freshly, and does not slavishly follow the traditions established by Wyclif, Tyndale, the King James, Revised Standard Version, etc.The use of inclusive language is cautious and the translators are not squeamish about using masculine pronouns occasionally.But the language used is not the language people speak: at least not here in Australia! At times it sounds quite stilted and unnecessarily formal.If you liked the New English Bible, I think you will find that this one is a big improvement. There is not as much conjectural emendation in the Old Testament, and the translators are less inclined to move the text around, as was done in translations by Moffat and the NEB.It is well worth getting a copy for the fresh approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's a very poor-written book.","review":"This book's title and topics sounds very attractive.

First of all, the Lord Advocate was not too smart. For someone who was supposed to be a great lawyer he was pretty dumb when it came to the book and Maggy. Which brings me to my next point: Maggie the lost daughther of a Duke; who lives with pack of thiefs and homeless people in the worse part of town. How can she still act and look like royalty? She is been living in the streets for years!!!! And, to make it worse her butler still lives with her... Come on, give me a break!!!

This book was trite, un-even, and just plain ridiculous. It started out with a decent enough premise but did nothing to really build the relationship between the hero and heroine.Maggie came off as a young, naive, totally unrealistic, \\"I'm trying to be cute & pert\\" but, I'm not. It's almost as if the character \\"Ally McBeal\\" were thrust into a book. The plot veered off in directions that didn't get tied up and the Hero, Connor, seemed to be spouting lines because that's what he was supposed to say rather than what he felt.Also, there wasn't too much of anything that was daring in this book. Just Ugghhh! I feel sad that I dared to buy this.

All I could think of are all the Late Night B Movies that so make VR an unattractive subject.I got the audio version from the library on the simple fact that Ben Bova is an established fiction author. Suprisingly I enjoyed this quit a bit. The audio version had me anticipating what would happen next more from the story than from the reading of the story.If the reading was done a bit more like acting things out I probably would have gave this a five stars. At least they had some different sounding voices for some of the characters but the reader's ability to switch between character voices had some flaws.This story based on VR technology really did get my thoughts going on the dangers of other pieces of technology. Interesting and entertaining story."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a tough book to review","review":"How do you review a book that is perfectly enjoyable up until about page 450, and then you suddenly realize that the conclusion is not going to be a great revelation? Early on I greatly enjoyed this book and the occasional flashbacks into the characters pasts were quite interesting. I also realized as I was reading this book that there's not a whole lot of action and the book probably could have been trimmed by about 150 pages. But in the end, I feel as though I got led in circles. Who is the Inquisitor? Who does he represent? What about the foreign investors? What about Disney possibly buying out ParaReality? So many ideas are introduced and nothing comes of any of them. I'll give one of his other books a shot, but this was a bit of a disapointment. Good first 450 pages, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Information from back cover","review":"Pioneer Pottery contains a wealth of technical and traditional information which simply cannot be found in any other book. Its first aim is a simple one: to help craftsmen potters who want to make use of natural materials without depending too much on store-bought supplies, and to assist those teachers of pottery who appreciate the educational value of this unique approach.Pioneer Pottery was the result of the author's own experiences in West Africa, where he had to make glazed stoneware without the support of the ordinary aids and industries on which potters elsewhere can usually rely.Topics include clays and their preparation, making pots with and without a wheel, glazes and how to make them with raw materials, how to build and operate wood-fire kilns, how to price pots for sale, and how to make the most of science and industry. Appendices cover special subjects such as clay testing and temperature charts.To put it simply, this book is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice beginner book","review":"I just started seriously playing the harmonica, I have puttered around with learning for years but when I decided to get serious I went looking for a book to take with me on the road and learn, between this book and the Harmonica For Dummies by Winslow Yerxa (sold here at Amazon) I am making excellent progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning harmonica","review":"It is a good book for beginners.This is the only book I have tried so I don't know how it compares to other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Instruction Book.","review":"This book gets right to the point.

Overall, the instruction in the book looks solid and many of the songs look like they'll be alot of fun. However - please be warned - I removed about 1/3 of the book because the songs were not appropriate for kids. I didn't expect the book to be filled with kiddie songs but did think they'd be appropriate for a wide audience.

Yet she can be effective in a softer song, such as 'E Comunque Natale'. For those studying the Italian language, Mannoia's diction is exceptionally clear.I also want to recognize the arrangers and musicians, who have achieved originality that is a pleasant surprise. Too often I have been disappointed in Italian (and other European) music that differs from American music only in the language being sung.

They even stick in the head of all the adults:) Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for children","review":"I purchased this for my (sometimes too friendly) 4 year old niece.

What a brilliant way to give children the tools they need to decide who is a stranger, and who is safe. Mom and dad, you will feel a sigh of relief too. We bought the DVD for our kids, and have shared it with everyone we know. We also added it to the school library, and have suggested that everyone see this video. It is fun, while giving your children the knowledge they need to stay safe. Great work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Video for Youngsters","review":"My 2 year old and 4 year old love this video! I have to admit that I love it too! We found out about it from our pediatrician at our daughter's 4 year check-up. I couldn't find it in any store, but knew that I would find it at amazon. It is interesting, funny, and very silly. It keeps our kids attention, and has some useful info for parents too. The kids want to watch it all the time which is fine with me. I would definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"A little quirky but the kids loved it.

Excellent DVD, minor sound issues (but come on, we're not expecting a blockbuster-quality here, are we?). The content is what is excellent; it's hard to talk about danger to kids without terrifying them, but this DVD manages to do it.Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STRANGER SAFETY","review":"Wonderful video for your children. My 5 year old grandaughter watches it over and over and over again and I watch it with her. She has been watching it since she was 3. With the problems in today's world it is good to have this video if you have young children. It teaches them who is looking out for them and who is a not and who they should be very careful of. I would highly recommend this video for all parents with young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my family","review":"While the overall content is fine - the presentation was terrible. The girl acted like a lunatic (and a very messy one) most of the time, managing to get food all over her face every time she ate anything - GROSS. It may help with strangers, but it's stone age manners. My girls (10 and 12) did laugh once in a while and watch the whole thing, but I didn't have to tell them twice to put it back in the library bag to return it. I'm Very Glad I didn't buy it! The 2yo cried and ran from the room! And they have no desire to check it out a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"My kids found it boring","review":"I think that this video has good intentions however, most of the things in video are common sense situations that most if not all parents teach their children in reference to strangers. What bothered me was that my kids walked away from the tv periodically. My 6 year old watched a bit but then got bored. My 4 year old liked the music but didn't pay attention to what was going on in the video which defeats the purpose of it. Although every child is different both of mine were not interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for parents!","review":"My kids love this video and watch it frequently.

The Safe Side Super Chick presented serious material in an extremely funny and capturing way. Some kids may need to watch this several times, as my 5 year-old son actually said he thought he should have helped the woman find her \\"lost kitten!\\" We only watched it once and obviously need to keep watching it to refresh his memory! But I know this is going to be an excellent tool in teaching him who is safe, and who isn't. AND, it's something that I won't mind watching over and over either, unlike a lot of children's DVDs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Instruction DVD","review":"I purchased this DVD after seeing Angela Shelton and John Walsh on the Hour of Power, and also because I want my kids to know be safe when I'm not around.The DVD is all played out by people not cartoons, so I think kids will have a realistic view of what to do if any of the situations presented occurs in reality. Also, this dvd is very funny - so kids are not groaning when you ask them to watch and they don't lose interest in the first few minutes. Further, for me it presented discussion points for situations I had not considered, and also to check my kids understanding.I really like this dvd, it doesn't make kids be too fearful and at the same time they can be aware of what to do if any of the situations presented occurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!!","review":"My kids, 6 and 2 1/2, love this movie. It's educational and silly at the same time. A great combination for kids! We are constantly using the examples in the movie to remind us about stranger safety.

My husband & I TRIED to watch this prior to letting our boys watch it. We found it to be nonsensical & could barely suffer through half of it. We thought maybe we just \\"didn't get it\\", maybe we are too critical & it is SUPPOSED to be for children after all. Our kids were uninterested. Guess I shouldn't expect a video to do what we (as parents) are supposed to be doing in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Safe Side - Stranger Safety","review":"My five year old daughter and 2 year old son, love this video.

It has catchy tunes that my son and I sing together and encourages participation. If a child loves a video he will watch it over and over, much to many parents irritation. This video however, is one that you want your child to watch over and over and remember well and Safe Side does just that.

My oldest two saw this video a few years ago, when it first came out, but my youngest had not. She does not meet a stranger, and while that's nice in some situations, it's sometimes a little scary because she will talk to anyone who pays the least little attention. My second grader watched the video again in a guidance class at school. Over the summer, she insisted we check it out from the library for her little sister, who's about to start Kindergarten. We recently took it on a trip, and they watched it several times in the car. Even my middle school kid, who saw it years ago, picked up a few things. My youngest has been repeating the tips, and all three of my kids have asked questions. It was really good to revisit it and have conversations about what's safe and what's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stranger Safety","review":"This DVD is a great and funny way to teach children how to be safe and how to protect themselves from strangers and dangerous situation.I really recommend this DVD as an exellent tool to promote safety in our children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I ordered","review":"Thanks for the informative video that will help my children stay safe.The product was received shortly after I ordered it on Amazon.

It is something that we will watch over and over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love it!","review":"I bought this video for my 4 yr old girl because she is entirely too friendly to strangers. I thought this would help her understand how important it is to not talk to strangers. She recites lines from the video and really enjoys it. I never expected my 1 yr old girl to be watching it too. This is the only video I have ever seen keep her mesmerized the entire time. It's a little whacky but the kids seem to enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good safety video for children","review":"My granddaughter was way too trusting and impulsive.

It does send the right message out there to you and your kids about strangers!! It also conveys the importance and seriousness to your kids - the silliness helps keep them entertained. Even if you have already taught your children about stranger safety, it helps enforce the message. It even helps with getting the message across to grandparents!

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best stranger info!","review":"Both of my children are very friendly and fearless with all people and it scares me! I have looked for a good stranger book, video or computer software for several years. This is the best! All adults go into 3 categories - Safe Side Adults, Kinda Knows and Don't Knows. I have always been looking for a way to explain that you can't trust people you do know like the coach, neighbors, mom and dad's boss, etc. This DVD explains the Kinda Knows very well with great role playing! Supersafe Chick does a great job being silly, but explains the information very clearly. The end of the movie tells the kids to write down a list of Super Safe Adults with mom and dad. This is an assignment we should have done a long time ago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Safe Side - STranger Safety","review":"We LOVE this DVD.

That's OK, because the video is perfect for this age and older. I am amazed by how well this is written, and how expertly it is acted by Angela Shelton. There is nothing scary for children in this, the entire film is upbeat, the terms are easily learned and remembered.

The first thing that comes to my mind is how annoying the main character is. She is all over the place in this video. And the red, yellow and green light thing just doesn't work for me. My daughter is 6 years old and it did not catch her attention (much to my surprise)! I just didn't like this video.

Don't waste your money or time with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"stranger\\" review for children.","review":"Entertaining, kid's level discussion of how the child needs to be more aware of the people they come in contact with. It visualizes situations so you can discuss with your child what to be aware of. But, even though the child can recite back portions and understands the concepts, you'll still need to reinforce the concepts.

In the listing of American Knife Makers, the list isn't alphabetical. For a resource book this is insane. While this book appears to have logical sections, nothing in the sections appears in a logical order, and they seem to be merely touching the surface of each topic. There is a suggestion to be sure not to confuse two companies with similar names, and not even a hint how to do that. It appears to be more of a compilation of unrelated articles than a guide. There is more history about companies than information about the knives they made.

She has taken a traditional story, and by use of her scholarship and literary flair, turned it into an engaging tale. It is interesting to note that the book may actually make a connection to another currently popular novel, \\"The Red Tent\\". The little girl Hannah, at the end of the story (Puah's reat-great-granddaughter), may well be the same Hannah who is the focal point of \\"The Red Tent\\". \\"The Midwife's Song\\" is a delightful book, hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moses: From Tears to Triumph","review":"This is a most unusual novel. Brenda Ray has taken 18 verses from the book of Exodus, placed them under a microscope, and with delightfully creative accuracy, recreated the story of Moses as if he were her own son.

Thank gosh - it's about time someone show the world what our generation is really about.

An engaging read that rarely falls victim to theoretical rhetoric. The world needs more writers like Stewart who take their time, slowly unfolding their argument, surveying all aspects of culture, giving high and low culture equal weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very usefull for research","review":"This book has some truly enlightening chapters on the meaning and implications of Souvenirs, which are really useful in conceptual research.

The production quality of this book is poor - several photos are straight up BLURY. There is no excuse to include these photos in a professional product.

The early church fathers spoke out often against thisheresy. It twists the Holy Scriptures words and takes away thepersonality of mankind. I found the book blasphemous, to say thevery least and contemptous of God.I think that to deny medical care to innocent children who cannot speak for themselves, but are at the mercy of one's parentspracticing such a belief system is dangerous. Mrs. Eddy blames the parent's thinking if a child is sick. This is hogwash!The early Gnostics beleived that matter was evil, we had no material body, there was no sin, Jesus didn't really die on thecross, etc. Mrs. Eddy has not founded a new \\"religious belief.\\"She merely tapped into the ancient cult of the Gnostics. I wouldadvise anyone not to even buy this book. It is opening a doorto neglect, abuse and denying your very existence. Not healthy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a book that is dangerous and kills trusting readers","review":"This book is dangerous and should be avoided or read with great caution. First, the Bible says it should not be added to, or mixed with odd explanations, as the author consistently does. Unknowingly, trusting readers rely on the teachings contained here and are severely hurt physically and emotionally. I found it constantly contradicted the Bible. Abiding by its claims and teachings almost caused a death in my family and in did cause deaths in families of my friends who also relied on what the book says. The author was later found to be involved in drugs and gave away her own son after several divorces, I learned after further research.

Since Science & Health is typically referenced for study by page and line number, plus liner notes in the columns, it's almost impossible to use this version for study. If you want to know what Mrs. Eddy said on line 9, page 319, you will have to really, really dig to find it in either of these two Kindle versions. Not very useful that way, but easy to read as a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeble","review":"As a fan of these three eras in fashion, I had high hopes for this book, but the front cover is the best thing about it. The most grievous problem with this book is that, focussing as it does on such a limited time span, it should go into depth about that time span. It does not. The descriptions of fashions of the eras are too generalized and don't indicate how and when changes within the eras took place; since fashion was changing pretty rapidly by the end of the 19th century, and certainly by the beginning of the 20th, I expected much more attention to chronology and gradual changes.The illustrations are also scanty and often of poor quality; some look as though they were made by tracing the outline of another illustration. I could have forgiven the shortcomings of the text had this book provided lots of illustrations, which is the main reason I suspect many of us buy books on fashion history. This book has a great premise, but it is very unhelpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Couple of Good Songs","review":"There's only 2 good songs on this CD - Love For a Lifetime and China Rain.

I would have perfered it if the composer had chosen some of the current Celtic artists (Maire Brennan, Anuna, Joanne Hogg, Altan, etc.)or chosen singers in this style, who could have interpreted the Welsh, Scots and Irish texts more faithfully. As it was, in my opinion, there is nothing here for fans of Celtic music.

I have no words. I do not agree though with this mass being performed by famous singers. I think the coductor made just the right choice.

There can be few things lower - to take a nation's tragedy and use it as justification to attack it. And like most British books on Russia (and to a lesser extent, America), Truscott uses his spiteful magnum opus as a lecture on how allegedly morally superior the English are over Russians and other ethnic groups.

The appearance/texture of the printing itself is a little bit different. If you want to get a modern copy which duplicates the sheer magnitude of the original. This is it.

Also interesting to read the author's relation of these 19th c. staff positons to their modern counterparts.If I have any criticism, it may be that the text relies a little too much on three individual staff officers- Walter Taylor, Henry Kyd Douglas, and Heros Von Borcke. I wonder if there are other memoirs out there that would expand on their accounts.Overall an outstanding book. Very logical and readable.

It was as if the rubber trees held her sorrow and wept for her - after all, the land and the people that she had come to love were on the verge of a major change of path. This film is also interesting because of the love triangle that takes place. Both DeVrie and her young daughter, CAmille love Jean-Baptiste. DeVrie, however, represents the old Indochina, and Camille represents the new emerging Indochina. And this is the conundrum of the film.

It reveals a very involved triangle of love connections that are complicated to say the least. The mother first meets the beautiful sexy naval officer and gets involved in a very steamy relationship. He falls in love with her daughter and gets involved in a steamy relationship. The mother finds out and well I dont want to give it all away but it is a very unique situation that takes on a very interesting twist at every turn, the least expected happens and you will not be dissapointed. I have watched it a number of times and still enjoy Deneuve's clothes, and class of all things French. Not to mention the splendor of Asia revealed in so many of its scenes. I think you will too. There are some scenes that are just a little too romantic to believe but nonetheless, they are fantastic fantasy like all romance. N'est Pas?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"I enjoy foreign films as I learn a lot about cultures from it. I balance what I learned with what I see first-hand when I visit the country. Indochine is two stories in one. One, it about love and the lengths people will to to express their love. Two, it about the exploitation of people and the lengths the elitists will go to preserve their power/business at the expense of others. Indochine is a film worth watching over and over and, keeping a copy of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Social Studies teachers","review":"I teach social studies to grades 10 and 11. An English teacher recommended Indochine to me. I am so glad she did. The kids get totally engrossed and there is enough historical backrgound to facilitate several lessons: 1)European Imperialism, 2) French Involvement in Vietnam, 3) Vietnamese Nationalism, and 4) the Mandarin Class in Vietnam. I have shown this video for three years now. The kids consitently rate it tops and they enjopy the writing assignment/learning log I assign with it. The characters are complex and well developed. As a Vietnam veteran, I also appreciate the movie in its own right. This is one great flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breathtaking story of love and loss","review":"As I watched Indochine, I couldn't help but fall in love with all the characters. Deneuve puts on an amazing performance. The scenery, cinematography and acting all contribute to make one of the best french films created.

Anyone who would leave home for Mr. Lopez and travel a kajillion miles, starve in a prison and become a commie as a result, must have lived a very sheltered life.

Even if you did not speak French and the subtitles were not included, every moment would be crystal clear.

Though it is rather long, every moment is important and interesting; there are no extraneous scenes or lines.

Too late, Catherine DeNeuve's character discovers that she must let her daughter grow up, just as too late France discovered it too had to let go of IndoChina. As a result of that failure to give up control, relationships and lives are devastated and violence errupts. In addition to great acting, the movie shows the beautifil lands of the East."},{"rating":"2","title":"Background to history","review":"If this film didn't do anything else, it updates Americans on the background history in French Indochina up to the time when the United States decided to try its hand in pushing the Communists back and regaining control of Vietnam.

I could tolerate an unlikable character but the story and character were too abnormal. The story relied too much on coincidence and undeveloped plot. Thoughout the book the actions of Hannah rely heavily on her avoidance from the FBI. But the fact that the FBI is after her and the fit with her personality is very weak. The Zack character turns up whenever they need a backup for a new twist. All her money to come to America is used to buy a ticket and escape for Charles Taylor (or so the books quotes) but yet she continues to live with the same money and even manages to buy a video camera and return ticket to Africa. The whole plot is just too far fetched.The only redeeming quality and it is just a small percent of the book is the historic setting in Liberia."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Darling","review":"This is the second time I read the book because years ago it left me haunted, to reexamine the relationships.

I, however, was distracted because of the many errors. At one point, if one had gone south as the direction to a location indicated, the person would have ended up in the Atlantic Ocean. When writing \\"historical fiction\\" that is of a current situation it is important to get the facts straight and often these were not. I was living in Liberia when much of this story occurred and know some could not have been true. Since most of the Liberia story was in the last twenty years readers may feel they understand, but just because it is published does not mean it is true. Actually, when I completed reading the book, and I read it all to see what truth I could find, I dumped it in a garbage can. What a waste of good talent - misleading people about events in a country they may never see! Reader beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Finished It!","review":"Being a big Russell Banks fan, I was very much looking forward to reading The Darling, a book that addresses a subject matter that is clearly a departure for Banks. I wish he'd stuck with trailer parks and the rural working class. The only reason I finished the book was because I was so hoping something bad would happen to the heroine. She is perhaps the least likable, least sympathetic heroine in a book I've ever read. What ever happened to writers writing what they know? Banks using a woman as a first person narrator was a big mistake. Hannah rings so hollow to me, a supremely self-absorbed, irritating and, in many ways, dangerous person to anyone she encounters. The dialogue throughout -- particularly the trite conversations among the characters about the \\"sixties\\" -- was contrived and unreal. I was immensely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good, some bad","review":"Some interesting historical content about Liberia, otherwise I probably would not have forced myself to read the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikeable main character disappoints","review":"It's a creative enough story, but I found the main character too shallow, egotistical, spoiled and (self-avowed) cold to like and therefore find the book disappointing because she never ceases to be so, nor does the author sufficiently explain why she is so. There are also too many absurd events, such as her walking around war-torn Liberia unaccosted, her children suddenly becoming gang-leaders, making and getting demands from the war leaders, helping to get Charles Taylor from an American prison, etc. How true the book is to the story of Liberia I don't know, but I'd rather trust a history book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banks' weakest effort","review":"Banks can be forgiven for making his heroine unbelievable. Unfortunately, she is also unsympathetic and uninteresting. That's quite an achievement; after all, Hannah Musgrave is a terrorist, lesbian chimp-keeper who runs a farm, helps spring a Liberian dictator from prison, and raises three guerilla rebels.Banks does a much better job with the real-life terrorist John Brown.

There is just enough talking to say what the signs are but mostly relies on images to teach signs. Great for your first signing DVD and also for deaf or hearing impaired kids. The video is simple and easy for my 9 month old to follow. He loves the puppets and squeals when he sees them. They teach eat/hungry, drink, milk, more, play, friend, ball, tired/sleep, mom, dad, kiss, blanket, bath, baby, and probably some more that I can't remember right now.

But there are too many words/signs in this video. I think they should have stuck to the basics and left it at that.

Although the word selection is better than the previous two videos in this series, I was disappointed with the format.The format does not hold the attention of my grandchildren and it is does not offer the repetition necessary to learn spoken words or sign language. Several words and signs are presented in rapid succession followed by extended scenes for each word. Then the same words and signs are presented again by a child who is clearly old enough to be speaking. The program also lacks a tutorial for grandparents and parents who are teaching their babies to use sign language for the first time.All of my grandchildren have learned to sign and speak from the \\"My Baby Can Talk\\" series and I would recommend this series for babies who cannot yet speak or are just learning to speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the standards of other baby signs DVDs","review":"My son loved the My Baby Can Talk sign language DVDs and he loves Baby Einstein, so I thought this would be perfect for him. I was so, so wrong. The DVD is not done in a manner that promotes learning. The words are combined too much, instead of focusing on one word at a time. I would not bother with this DVD if you really want your baby to learn sign language. We love baby sign and can highly recommend the My Baby Can Talk series instead of this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Signing Time! is sooo much better!!!","review":"My kids love to sign, so we try and watch every signing video available, but this one went right back to the library. My kids and I were so disappointed with this video. I must say that this area is just not in Beby Einstein's expertise and just because they have a famous deaf actress does not make it good.

It is exceptionally entertaining and educational. I was worried that the signs would break up the entertainment value too much however I was wrong.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Signing Time is way better!","review":"I checked out Signing Time DVDs from the local library for my daughter. She LOVES them. I thought she would like this too. She does, but not me. I agree with another reviewer about the \\"filler\\"--too much time showing the pictures but not enough for the signs. The music and scenes make it somewhat entertaining for little kids, like other Baby Einstein DVDs, but not very educational.

With this one, though (which by the way said was precisely for children in that age range), his attention was only captured for the first 5 minutes. Analyzing it from a non-target customer standpoint, I think it is not in the same category as the other ones I've seen, quality wise. Maybe my expectations were too high but I can honestly say I was a little disappointed with this product. Maybe someone can recommend other BE products that are as good as the others.

That video is more for older children. Baby einstein - my first signs is great for younger children because it has images that they can relate to like babies and music that they can enjoy. My son loves it and will sit there the entire time watching it. (actually he stands next to the tv so he can watch them up close)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The *best!*","review":"I think this is the very best of the Baby Einstein videos.

If you want a book that touts all the most recent modern psychobabble this is not the book for you. Instead, if you want a book that is balanced and offers common sense then you will want to add this book to your library.

A young fighting couple experience an automotive breakdown in the middle of the night on a deserted road. They end up in a run down motel run by a creepy caretaker (a little bit like Pscyho, but not nearly as good). They then find a stash of tapes in their room showing previous guests in the room being tortured and murdered. Soon they find themselves under attack by the same group of masked killers.

And I actually appreciated the ending -- thank God they spared us the extended Halloween / Friday the 13th non-surprises. The film was blissfully brief. Unfortunately, any satisfaction during the intervening 50 minutes or so requires an impossible suspension of disbelief. Why did these guys, who obviously had this act down to a fairly well-oiled machine, deviate from the game plan for this couple? Why did they give them any room to maneuver? If they were this incompetent, how had they been so successful in their earlier attempts? It seems this would have been a fairly easy hole for a decent writer to fill (\\"Damn!

Having strayed off the Interstate one evening in the middle of nowhere, they end up in a motor inn.The motel is actually a house in which the shag carpeting does little to muffle the screams of the dying.

It also has some of the worst acting i've ever seen.. I am really suprised that these 2 famous actor/actress agreed to partake in such a horrible film.I'd complain more about how bad the film is, but if you really like the same thing over and over again, I wont spoil your ending - which is also really lame, unrealistic(not that it should matter in these types of films), and has the worst acting for these two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacancy shakancy....awful, awful,","review":"We had high hopes for a bit of updated Hitchcockian film viewing, murder-mystery-suspense wise.

In \\"Vacancy\\" it was the knocks and pounding on the walls and doors that made me want to turn this movie off. Then of course it was the cell phone that didn't work when you needed it most or having to get out of the Hotel room NOW but oh, what ever you do to get out, don't break out the bathroom window that is nailed shut ! Maybe i'm just too picky, but this movie is full of holes and not much surprised me when i watched it. Might be the worst movie i ever saw Kate Beckinsale in ( and the only one ).

If you read this then watch it anyway, at least you can't say you weren't warned. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stong start, weak finish...","review":"Well, I have to say my expectations for this film were low. I rented it as a fluff popcorn piece, not as a event. It fit that bill fairly well, but it started a lot stronger than it finished. It was good at setting up the mood and vision but then mid way, it felt a bit repetitive. The end was just weak. I knew exactly how it would end; nothing was surprising or tense. Too formula for a movie that had a minor twist on a horror staple. Acting was credible, other than Kate and Luke had zero chemistry. Its a good time killer (pun intended) but pass on down the road if you are looking for real suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Normally i give a movie an extra star or 2 just because kates super fine butt is in it.... but THIS movie is a low production, not even a 1 star, garbage film...a waste of my money.... iM SURPRISED SHE WAS EVEN IN IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad at all; however, it's a one time deal!","review":"The movie is about a couple who are terrorized by strangers when staying in a motel. True, many scenes are unbelievable, but not more unbelievable than reality TV; you will be mystified as to why the evil people can't break the door or how the screw driver got in the car ignition, but that shouldn't be a problem in scary movies, because they are by definition somewhat detached from reality! I enjoyed it because it wasn't filled disgusting scenes and it was suspenseful enough. Good movie but not perfect, like most of us viewers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck- did not even want to give it one star!","review":"This was a horrible waste of my time. I am certainly glad I rented it through an online membership instead of even paying full rental price. Not for intelligent people -- you could predict everything that was going to happen. The really bad part was that they used a child's death to tear the marriage apart and even hinted that it was the mother's fault -- low, very low.

It starts off a bit slow initially only to really pick up a frantic pace right from the moment the couple hears that knock on their door in the motel.Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson play the married couple well who up until getting to the motel had their relationship in a crisis. But soon have other things to do, like staying alive, once they checked into that motel, because their car broke down in the middle of the night. I don't want to give away the story, but if you haven't seen it then go ahead, because this movie will keep you on the edge of your sit, since its full of suspense and some rather unexpected things coming your way.This was certainly one of the best thrillers of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"good suspense...","review":"Great movie. Good price.

People who spend the night at this down-and-out motel are subjected to torture and the horror of hearing others tortured. When the protagonist couple settle into their room and realize something is terribly wrong, they try to escape. This could lead to a great cat-and-mouse movie, but it is spoiled by the fact that the couple just isn't very resourceful. You'll find yourself yelling at the TV in frustration when they fall to try some of the most obvious things, and meekly fail to fight when the opportunity presents itself. What could have been a taut thriller cops out by making the character too weak and dumb to launch a true escape plan. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The psycho always knocks twice (or more)","review":"Oh my! - yet another seedy gas station/motel staffed by twitching yocals. Okay, so Antal and Smith cover no new ground here but their reworking of conventional themes is well done.

Everyone I watched this with said \\"grab the gun\\" about 45 minutes before the dumb girl finally thought of it. On a side note, the addition of the snuff films as a bonus was in really bad taste.

I am like a lot of people when it comes to such things; I only know two or three of the songs before I buy the thing, and I only listen to the others about once. This disc is different. I still only knew the first two tracks, but I grew to love the others after hearing them just once! The disc offers good coverage of the Wetton years of Asia, before all the breakups. It includes several songs from each of the early and middle albums, and puts them in order of their debut (Asia, Alpha, Astra, Then & Now). Geffen and 20th Century did an excellent job mastering the audio; it sounds excellent. Asia is never given due credit, but this band pioneered many of the aspects of music we take for granted today. This compilation offers all the songs one would ever need to hear to understand why the last sentence is 100% true. Happy listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid - Not a real CD, does not rip to MP3.","review":"While this disc contains a decent selection of Asia's songs, it doesn't actually carry the Compact Disc logo. This usually happens when labels try some bogus copy protection scheme on a disc, and this one is no exception. It looks like they have put a fake, empty data partition on the CD to trip up people who try and rip the tracks to MP3 on their computers.It's a shame, because this is an otherwise fine collection of songs.While it is still possible to rip the songs to MP3 (by recording the tracks one at a time and then ripping them), the annoyance involved means you are better off just buying a different greatest hits collection such as the Definitive Collection or Asia Gold.On a personal note, I also missed the presence of the Roger Dean artwork that graced the original album covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed It!!","review":"I enjoy reading this book.

I expected a deeper digging in of photoshop and compositing materials to form a more real-world sense of how pros put together real eye-catching images. Instead it covered the first quarter of my photoshop class and the images are not that interesting. Only the cover image and one other inside was good.

I've traveled lots through Mexico, the scenery was there, but I was on buses with tickets never seeing anyone who looked like an obvious gang member.

While the first one hits you with a sledge-hammer trying to convince you that humans are too violent to survive, this one hits you with a nuclear bomb to convince you of the same. There were some decent ideas in the show, but very little exploration of those ideas. It was too mired in political/social commentary through allegory. I was disappointed the most by the ending. The main character, Taylor, has been one of the few reasonable characters in the movies and seems to be working to save the world from destroying itself, but when he is dying, he is the one that gives up on humanity (and monkeymanity I guess) to nuke the whole planet.

The scene drags on for what seems like 30 minutes). Then, we get lots of horse chasing and running away from apes which seems to last about another 30 minutes. Finally, in the most exciting part of the movie, we get to see underground New York. This is the only effective scene in the movie. After that we are introduced to mutant humans with no explanation as to how they go there, what they are, and why they are.

However I am convinced that the author has largely lost his way with this series. His creation has gotten away from him, and is now peopled with weak and confusing characters and utterly irrelevant sub-plots and red herrings. Enough I cry !!! Please, please, Mr Jordan get a grip on this saga !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless","review":"There are people who have died before seeing the ending of this story! Loyal fans for years, and years, and years. I wont be one of them.I got about halfway through Book 10, closed the cover in disgust. I no longer had patience or interest in going one page further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"You should stay away from this whole series. Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time moves at a glacial pace. He has far too many characters. He's turned his main hero, Rand, into such a wimp I'm rooting for the Dark Forces. It takes Jordan multiple books to wrap up scenerios that should take a few chapters. I'm sorry to hear he is ill, but he will die before he can come close to finishing this series. If you want to read an exciting series that actually accomplishes something within each book I would recommend George R.R. Martin's a Game of Thrones."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series that would never end.....","review":"I'm very disappointed with how this series is going. It was so promising for the first few books, and now it just seems to be sinking into an extremely verbose repetitive cycle. The characters are flat and robotlike, and the plot is stuck in place. I'll have to seriously consider before buying the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left for a new comer!!!!","review":"Having grown tired of endless plots that drone on and so many characters, you have to reread the previous book, maybe two before you remember what's going on, I finally gave up and went with newcomer. Brian S Pratt's The Unsuspecting Mage gives what Robert Jordan no longer does, Action! Action! Action!I liked the Wheel of time, the first 5-6 years I read it. But it never ended.this new guy may not be a world class auther, it being his first one, but it kept me engrossed and actually found it harder to put down than it was to pick up Knife of Dreams.I am a loyay Robert Jordan fan, will be with him through to the end, no matter how long it takes, I just wish it got my pulse racing as it once had. I sincerely hope the ending will be worth the time, patience and money I've invested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still not recieved","review":"Can't really give a review of the book. Its been over a month and it still hasn't arrived. But I am in Afghanistan so its probably stuck in customs some where"},{"rating":"1","title":"What???!!!","review":"What is wrong with Robert Jordan?! He keeps introducing new side characters instead of focusing on the central characters!!! He is obviously just milking us for all we are worth. As usual, he has pages upon pages of useless descriptions and Aes Sedai ranting. Far fewer pages are devoted to Rand and Mat (although I have to admit, the pages that Mat was in were worth the read). Who cares about the silly whiney Aes Sedai? Those women are enough to drive any sane person to skip the pages to the next chapter. I think I had to read/skip till page 186 or something before things got interesting. Why?!!!! Mr. Jordan needs to go back and reread his first five books. Stop milking the cow! I am running out of milk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another wow","review":"another awesome episode, cant wait for the next one!

Great book overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, tedious","review":"I bought all of the books in the series for my Kindle. While wading through the first 8 books of this series, I learned that nothing much happens until the final few chapers. For the rest, I looked ing up the plots online. Money-wise, shouldn't have bought Books 6 and onward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Jordan","review":"I have read numerous Robert Jordan books and almost all the wheel of time including Knife of Dreams is horrible. Why would anyone waste their time reading these books. Its like a bunch of women talking about rumors that may or may not happen, no action just talk. Apparently none has read Brandon Sanderson or they would find these books lifeless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good process on the story; Great book for true fans of the series","review":"I don't understand what everyone is complaining about with this series. When reading fiction you're supposed to open your mind and let the writer take you into a world of their making. Everybody seems upset that Jordan doesn't focus mainly on their favorite character or goes into a little description of the world surrounding the story. If you have no attention span then this series isn't for you and you should go read a magazine or book of short stories or something.I will admit that the last few books have focused too little on the main story and main characters. But Knife of Dreams gets back into things quite smoothly. Several sub plots are resolved in this book. Jordan finally comes out and confirms several things that we've all suspected for years. And the book is almost entirely focused on Mat, Rand and Perrin. Any true fan of the series should have no complaints. A good book and entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book of the series.","review":"THe whole section dedicated to Perrin and Mat are worthess.So that leaves you with the 2 paragraphs on the only character that can fight the \\"dark one\\". I mean seriously, jordan could of handled Perrin's part in a page, Mat's in 2 pages. THERE'S NO ACTION for most of the book. People lose limbs over stupid bitches(how do you let a chick talk you into lettin her into a dangerous situation? THas a bad reflection on Jordan) and other dialougue i've read a million times in the other 23 books, takes place again.THis book just sucks, and i want the weeks i spent reading this series n my life back cause its all a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't Jordan put this series to bed yet?","review":"I refuse to buy another book in this series (as of two books ago) until Jordan finishes it. Until then I am reading George R.R. Martin who does seem to be able to move his books along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally getting somewhere","review":"I enjoyed the first 6 (or 7) books, but the last few years have become a grind. This book at least gives a faint shimmering hope of final resolution. If 12 isn't the end, I'm done. One gets the feeling that Robert Jordan has a couple kids in college and the last few books have been nothing but tuition money. Still, this book was quite an improvement over the last couple of offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knife of My Dreams","review":"I'm really disgusted with reading one and two star reviews by people who have not even read the books; this is a good portion of them. I've been noticing many of these lately; these typically are written by people who think the series is too long. Most of the new readers do not make these same complaints because they don't have to wait for two years between each book. It is not the change in the author, it is a change in the readers; many of them are impatient.This book doesn't rank with the first four, but it easily ranks with book five and six. There is some truly awesome battles sprinkled throughout the entire book including one Dumai Wells type battle. Unlike the last several books you don't have to wait around to the very end of the book to actually see something cool happen.Ignore the people reviewing it negatively just because they disliked an earlier book. This book was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on - This is so much better...","review":"Come on - This is so much better...than Books 8-10. Like most readers, I was disappointed to say the least with those volumes, and was howling mad when I heard about the prequels...but in KoD, the plots all move forward, and quite deftly. You can already see how this is going to turn out, and that is what I am looking forward to after more than a decade reading Jordan. The man is immensely talented, and, though he got lost in the last couple of books, this one re-establishes him as the leader in the epic fantasy genre...All authors who attempt an arching story line over 10000 pages (roughly) are bound to get sidetracked, but the charm that was present in the first books of the series has returned, and we are now only 2 books away from finishing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on Track","review":"As many others have noted, after losing control of myriad plots and slowing the pace to a crawl for a few books, Jordan has gotten back almost to the level of some of the great earlier books. Things are clearly moving toward a conclusion now, and unlike a few books ago when I found myself hoping he'd just wrap it up, again I am almost sad that the ride has to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK EVER","review":"How did the series come to this? I won't spend a lot of time writing how disappointing Knife of Dreams was because so many reviewers have already done so. Reading the encyclopedia is more enjoyable than reading the last 4 books of this series. I demand that Robert Jordan use the first 100 pages of his next book as an apology for how far he let his story slip. Oh, and as for that stupid quote from Jordan on the bookcover saying how he learned to read at age 4, you would think that his vocab would be amazing for such a gifted learner. How many times has he used the words \\"diffident\\" or \\"miasma\\" in a ridiculous attempt to sound intelligent?To you people that gave the book five stars...What are you THINKING?!?! I only wish Amazon.com had a zero stars rating instead of 1-5 so that I could give this book what it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad to the Bone","review":"Long winded, overlong, and overwrought series.I think many of the positive review are being posted by Jordan's publisher. Think about it......"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was resolved?","review":"After reading all the reviews and reading the book twice, I only have a few things to say. Very little and i mean VERY LITTLE is resolved. The book is mostly filler with more random characters added with little or no mention of other more interesting characters....Padan Fain comes to mind. Most of the conclusions could have been deduced long before you read the book. Also, very little action took place, mostly endless talks that have been discussed in the other books at length over and over and over again. I have nothing against long stories or series, but I do expect that there would be more conclusions to previous plotlines/characters before new ones are added."},{"rating":"1","title":"Climax?","review":"Alright, I have been reading this series for 6 or so years now. But really I am getting fet up, especially with the lackluster quality of the past two volumes. This book has the most lukewarm ending I have ever seen. Granted at least something happened in this book unlike number 10, but so little happened of consequence and so many sub-plots have just disappeared. At least by the sounds of it the next novel will finally get us to the last battle, and perhaps the end of the series. Let's hope this final book (if it is the final) will be more akin to the first three books or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will this never end","review":"Having stuck it out through all 11 books and the sequel, I am astounded that such a brilliant plot line could be turned into such a boring set of books. You have to conscientiously make the effort to drag on a story as slowly as this one has gone. On the rare occasions that the author gets around to advancing the plot, the books are interesting but unfortunately this doesn't occur very often. These 11 books could have been condensed into 2 or 3 fast paced, attention getter novels. I only actually read one of these books, the rest were listened to on audio during gym workouts and long drives. I learned they are a great sleeping pill substitute. If a 12th book is indeed printed, I will read it but I will have no thoughts of being saddened that the story is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the better books","review":"Book 11 is better than the last few. three is a100 page boring stretch after the prologue but after that it was better than the last two books combined. without spoiling anything a lot of things we've been waiting to happen happens in this book. that's why i gave it 4stars, not the best in the series but far from the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Only Gripe","review":"My only gripe about this book along with the other books of Jordan's series is that they waited til he died to find a better artist to design the front covers. But the art is not his fault so I give the read 5 stars ;]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving in the right direction!","review":"I would say that Knife of Dreams is one of the better books written since book 5 of the WOT. This book was a major improvement over the previous installment, Crossroads of Twilight, and saw several plot lines move forward to conclusion. There are some pretty memorable scenes in this book and overall it was a very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why 4 or 5 stars?","review":"People say stuff finally happens and gives it 4 or 5 stars on that basis, why? Ok, a few things happen but they are completely out of proportion to the time spent building them up and the resolutions are something I would expect a 10 year old to come up with. No offense to all the 10 year olds who think Jordans writing is juvenile.This book gets two stars for finally resolving stuff, even though it is done in a unbelievable and unintelligent manner. I am starting to believe that someone else wrote books 1-4 for Jordan, because no one could go from writing well-written(but highly derivative) books, to the dreck in the past few installments. Either that or Jordan has suffered from brain damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will it never end!","review":"I have started to sympthize with the Dark One and am rooting for his victory. I hope the final book, if there ever is one, does a Torquemada on Rand and the ever proliferating cast of witless characters. A couple of thousand pages detailing their descent through the dungeons of the Pit. The final torture before they are given to the Forsaken as food, would be having to read all of WOT in one go."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny, I didn't think I liked pain","review":"but yet I keep attempting to read this garbage. I loved the first 6 or so books. I guess since then I just keep reading them in an attempt to revive that same feeling. But it's dead. Very very dead. Thank god that I at least learned to get these from the library and not waste money on them. I think this book, especially after that last disaster, has taught me to not even waste my time on them. So that's it, I'm leaving the house of Jordan and I'm not sad about it. Next time I see news that a new book is coming out, I'll only feel sorry for the poor souls that it traps, instead of being one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture","review":"I just found out that this series will drag on for another three books. Are you f***ing kidding me? This book is better than the last few, but since it doesn't really resolve much it is not worth it. This series should come with a warning lable, \\"Starts fast, gets you hooked, then sucks!\\" I've been struggling to try and finish this wreck just to find out what happens; this latest development is the straw that broke the camels back, I'm done. I regret ever having picked up the EYE OF THE WORLD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I waste my time?","review":"I'm done with this series. I kept hoping I could tough it out until the end, but Mr Jordan's milking of what was originally a good story line has ruined it. In this case, wallowing through page after excruciating page of descriptions of characters who would come and go was too much. His readers, and his reputation, would have been better served if he had invested the time, and ink, in writing the ending to this run on tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put down RJ and find Steven Erikson","review":"This was the fantasy series that got me started reading fantasy. I have to say I loved it from the start. However, as I have grown older and my tastes have matured I find RJ just does not cut it anymore. I don't know if he's just phoning it in, or if I just have different tastes now, but these last books just suck. I urge anyone else that feels this way to try Steven Erikson's The Tale Of The Malazan Book Of The Fallen. Gardens of the Moon, Deadhouse Gates, and Memories of Ice have recently been released in the US for the first time. These are great books. At least check out the reviews while your here at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book in the series in awhile","review":"This book is much better than the last few. It is the first in awhile that hasn't left me with the impression, \\"well that book sucked.\\" Once again, I am actually excited about the next book in the series. Also, the plots seem to be narrowing indicating that the series may be coming to a close - I've been reading this series for over a decade and wouldn't mind seeing a conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally it's coming togeather","review":"I'd been irritated with the last several books because there were so many different charecters and plots going on. Now things are coming togeather. I had to force my way through the last two books but this one was a good read. I'm looking forward to the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"The interminal wheel of time series","review":"After reading the reviews for this and the last couple books, I am very happy I gave up on the series in 2000. This probably would have been an excellent series if Jordan had kept it to 6 or 7 books. As it is, I think Jordan is just padding his wallet. The ego of the man is outrageous, to blame his readers, his CUSTOMERS, for getting bored with / not being able to follow his plot lines.Read George Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series. He is handling multiple plot lines the RIGHT way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes up for Crossroads","review":"This reviewer has officially forgiven RJ for CoT.Nauseating as it was, it was in fact necessary for KoD to move as fast as it did.This book managed to salvage my interest in the Wheel of Time - once again, the waiting is the hardest part."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Knife all right....a freakin' Knife in my heart!","review":"Why oh why do people bother to read drivel? Because that is exactly what this is. People, wake up and smell the formaldehyde that is Robert Jordan. Is he dead yet? People, get real. Eye of the World was published in 1990!!! I was in middle school, for chrissakes! I've since graduated from High School, finished college, worked for 3 years, and am currently a PhD student in my 3rd year, all the while WoT hasn't finished. In other words, I've lived a *LIFE*. I mean, for crying out loud, I'll probably finish my PhD BEFORE the series ends! Do you know how pathetic that is?!?! Oh god, I need to get out of grad school, but that's another rant...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"Knife of Dreams is not a good book.I think that if If RJ had written an outline first and then cut out all the unnecessary words I would have liked the book a little more. Instead, all he had done is take a bits and pieces of his other books, add some half-explained sub-plots, and mash it all together into a 700+ page collection of repetition and fashion tips."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate Robert Jordan's books!","review":"Robert Jordan owes every person who has ever read a page of his books a personal apology. I have yet to receive mine.This book is only fit for wiping one's posterior (though I would personally recommend Charmin - it's more interesting to read).As you know George R.R. Martin's Feast of Crows comes out in November. Run, don't walk, to buy it.Also:\\"As our history doth not, like a newspaper, give great characters to people who never were heard of before, nor will ever be heard of again, the reader may hence conclude that this excellent woman will hereafter appear to be of some importance in our history.\\"TOM JONES, Henry Fielding. Take a lesson Mr. Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAGNET WOULD BE A START","review":"The books are getting muddled down. It truly is a bad soap opera. A place where women dont have enough respect for themselves to choose there own man. Where men fight like animals where cunning means will the dragon sword stike true or not.When a writer spends 3 pages. 2 or was it 3 times in his book to repeat the exact same words about how people dress. The question is Jordan writing these books on content or how much money he gets per page?"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE FINISH THIS SERIES NOW!","review":"How long do we wait? It now feels as though Robert Jordan is hanging onto a lifeline so he can make money into his old age as opposed to being an author with a story to tell and COMPLETE! That is sad as this is a good story but it needs to come to a close. Try a new story after this one, but please let us all rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is a warning to those who are considering starting to read The Wheel of Time. The first couple books were fantastic. Robert Jordan then proceeded to continue to add story lines and new characters till the point that when the next book (6 or 7)came out I couldn't remember who people where or why they were doing what they where doing. I quit at that point and from the reviews I read he continues to drag what began as a great epic through the mud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration","review":"Book 10 of the series was the most offensive book I ever read. Robert Jordan is writing a Fantasy Soap Opera and is trying to make (steal) as much money as possible from us. I have never sold any of my books in my whole life. Yet after book 10, I sold my Jordan books. And I will never buy a book from him again, even if he writes a Nobel prize winner. Which he won't.Recommend George RR Martin's \\"The Song of Ice and Fire\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knife of Dreams = Utter Crap","review":"Moving forward?How do these people have time to prepare for Tarmon Gaidon between all the spanking and floggings? Does Robert Jordan think that this is what women do when they're alone together? It's not like the Dark One and Forsaken are any better, what with all the stripping of clothes before receiving punishment.Also, the most annoying thing about this book is the action and characterization for the crowd that is actually hanging out around Rand, including Rand himself. I found him as dull, over-wrought, and unsympathetic as ever. I haven't been able to figure out his hero-arc, or feel very interested or sympathetic towards him since about book 8."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do a blimp and Robert Jordan have in common?.","review":"Robert Jordan is an overinflated and overrated (too high in altitude) gasbag, the contents of which are slowly leaking out. Will there be enough methane in there to complete this series? RAFO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some issues are finally resolved...","review":"This pace of \\"Knife of dreams\\" is fortunately a little faster than the previous chapter in this eternal saga. Important developements happen with Perrin and Faile, the war for the throne of Andor and Elayne and Mat with Tuon.I gave 4 stars for this book because it is much better that the last two. Maybe Robert Jordan listened to the fans complaint or maybe he is really want to move on.I guess the next book will focus on the Seanchan, Rand and Egwene. Maybe in the 13th chapter, Tarmon Gaidon will finally begins. This battle should last at least 3 books. Then I can die happy :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst in series after Crossroads of Twilight.","review":"Jordan knows how to keep a good thing going, I guess. Only redeeming characters in this book are Mat as usual and shockingly Egwene.

Enough is enough...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A warning","review":"I started reading this series when I was in college. I have since been through medical school, residency, and have been working for several years. I regret that I ever picked up the first book. I enjoyed the first three books, but always anticipated a grand finale that never came. Somewhere after the fifth book, I quit. No longer could I bear to hear about a female character tugging at her hair when she was angry or other such interminably repeated mannerisms. Because of this series, I promised myself I would never start a series that had not already been completed. In fact, I was so disappointed in the time I had wasted in reading these books, that I have read little fiction since. Let my experience serve as a warning to you: don't start this series until it is done and you know from others that it is worth the investment of time and money. I suspect the series will never be really done, and that even though a few plot lines will finish, we will see spin-offs of the secondary characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another door stopper","review":"Wheel Of Time had the makings of a great series. From the third or fourth books, it went spiraling down the drain. Each book became bigger with little content and just dragging the plot. Jordan could have been too much in love with his story to finish it. Then there was a prequel. Ok, I can take that too. But when the prolouge for this book showed up for sale, I drew the line. It is clear this series stopped being a great story a long time ago and just a cash cow for author/publisher. I managed to get my hands on Knife of Dreams w/o paying for it and I can tell you it is same as the previous 6. For those who want to finish the story, just borrow. Not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spanking and Kissing Games","review":"A couple interesting things happened in this book, but overall, it was pretty bad. Way too many spanking of bottoms and kissing games. Way too many minor characters who bicker like children and the reader just doesn't care.

Robert Jordan, write a better book or I'll spank your bottom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Game Pieces Moved Around the Board, But No Real Action.","review":"While I have committed numerous hours to the Wheel of Time Series I am a bit frustrated with the last few books. The characters have been fleshed out. Characters are traveling all over the place, yet it seems like they are getting no where. A few events that devotees to the series knew had to occur have occurred, but nothing really new. It's a lot of pages with no substantial outcomes. I read somewhere that there are 13 books due in the series, and do to past time invested in this epic, I will finish it. But I am not sure this book was worth the LONG wait between it and book 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picked up the pace, but lost it's heart","review":"I need to go on record as saying that WOT has been my favorite series for several years now. In the first five books of the series Mr. Jordan was able to create real people that we cared about and could empathize with. While I found the pace of last few novels very frustrating, I was able to tollerate them because I still cared about most of the main players.In this book, Mr. Jordan has focused so much on making the story progress that he forgot to make us care about the people we have known for years. There were only two or three times in the entire book where I seemed to get lost in a characters emotions. I no longer feel like an extra participant in this adventure.I wouldn't care if WOT ended up being 15 books long, if the balance of story progression and detail were restored. If not, Mr. Jordan should stop here. If the final book is as heartless as this one, I won't be able to go back and read the series again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A selfish reader","review":"I am selfish.

If you have seen the ending, then write TOWARDS it. Oh wait, you've got 2 more prequel installments to finish beforehand, right?I only hope those books are as great as your first prequel novel. WOT in that case = Waste Of Time"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not that bad, it's worse","review":"This was so bad I am still shocked. There are few secular sins worse than squandering your talent for writing by whoring yourself out to whoever is editing and publishing this trash.Robert Jordan used to be a writer. It is his fault that he decided to waste that talent on a never-ending swirl of filler in order to keep milking his cash cow.The book also points out the failure of the editor to exercise any loyalty to the story, or the reputation of their writer...shame on whoever is editing this book.Then there is the publisher - proving once again that Andre Breton was right - Capitalism and art are incompatible.And then there is me - shame on me for buying this book, and continuing to read it even though I knew what I was getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointing entry in the series","review":"I eagerly awaited \\"Knife of Dreams\\", anticipatiang a return to form for Robert Jordan. Something along lthe lines of \\"The Great Hunt\\" or even \\"Lord Of Chaos\\". Imagine how disappointed I was to find out that this book is as dull, poorly plotted and poorly written as the last four or five books in the series have been. Mr. Jordan seems to have lost his understanding of pacing and character development. As Tarmon Gaiden is looming, this should have been the most exciting chapter in the series. Instead the character stand around fuming about each other in exceedingly dull overly-detailed passages that lead absolutely nowhere. This book is a sever disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, improvement.","review":"I have been reading this series from when the first book came out. I even went back and bought the first book in hard-back (very hard to find at the time). The last few books have been a chore to read, although I felt that the last book (Crossroads of Twilight) wasn't that bad, probably a 3 star. The writing and storyline of Knife of Dreams recall the first 5 or so books of the series. Not as good, but close. I am just hoping that book 12 (the last?) won't be 2 years in the making.

The plot does not move (ok, perhaps in this book something happens, but still..) and Jordan still believes that bickering is actual intrigue!!If you want great prose, good plot and something actually happening read George Martin!

The Wheel of Time violated every contractual obligation implied by continually attempting to have us readers buy books without end.

I would have more fun reading the encyclopedia then the last 6 books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand","review":"I do not understand the readers who yearn for the series to end or even progress faster. Perhaps our society focuses too much on instant gratification - all action and interesting people and no details. Indepedent of the years, I enjoy walking into a bookstore and seeing that tWoT is back again.I also do not understand the readers who compare Robert Jordan to George Martin, Brooks, Tolkien, etc. Not all authors are up to the standard they have established. Can't we just accept Jordan's style for what it is? I don't always watch interesting, exciting, so called good or great television shows or movies all the time. Sometimes it's just programs that are mediocre, sub-standard, or even horrible. Why can't it be the same with the books I choose to read?Keeping that in mind, I would say that Knife of Dreams is another typical Jordan novel. I can hardly wait for his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Bloody Time!","review":"Finally. Jordan has gone and produced a book of high caliber for the first time in about *counts* 5 novels. Fires of Heaven and everything prior to that were excellent. Lord of Chaos dragged a bit, but was boosted by Crown of Swords, everything since then, crap.Now, at last, he seems to be getting back to the story that he started to tell so long ago. Plotlines advance, and at long last, things actually start happening again. There's even an UNEXPECTED twist or two. God forbid.All things considered, he's still got to dig himself out of that very large hole he's dug, but he's made a damned good start with Knife of Dreams"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and drawn out","review":"I had to put this down 1/3 of the way through, and picked it up a year later just to be done with it. I kept going because I wanted to get to a book that Brandon Sanderson wrote for WOT. Now that I just finished the 13th book, I must say I'm happy I finished book 11, Knife of Dreams. Books 12 and 13 are so much better and the pace is that of a normal novel - not the slow, drudgery of the last few by Jordan - I mean really; must I know about the detail of every freaking dress?!Jordan, rest his soul, was mired in minute and unnecessary details - and if he mentioned 'bosom' once more, I think I would've puked. We all know about that fetish, or fixation.Sanderson's take over of the series is a massive improvement. So for all of you out there who felt about the last few books Jordan wrote, take heart and press on. Am looking forward to the last book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Let Down","review":"I have been invested in this series since I first picked up a trade paperback copy of The Eye of the World back in 1990. After a great and enthralling start to a series with such potential, this one was like lugging through a dense jungle while wearing an 80-pound pack on your back and having no machete.The characters didn't evolve much, if any. The story didn't evolve much, if any. A very unmemorable experience.I have heard from several people that the series has been reinvigorated with Brandon Sanderson finishing it up, and I certainly hope so. KoD, however, was very cumbersome, but it does not diminish my feelings for the beginning of this series and my interest in the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"There may be hope yet","review":"There may be hope yet. I have been frustrated at these last couple books. They are full of things that I do not care about. Characters descriptions of things that do not matter.

If anyone can bring life back into this series it would be him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent unsurpassed service","review":"Excellent unsurpassed service all round highly recomm all AAA+++ packaging and speed of delivery is second to none and as I am from New Zealand wanting to send this awesome book to a friend of mine in the USA I could not ask for such wonderful and lovely service and I am truly thrilled and delighted thank you so much for everything"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, Robert, why...","review":"This book is terrible. There have been bad books in the series, but this one tops my list because it marks a huge shift. Faithful main characters are turned into archetypes. Plotlines are not only predictable, they are broadcast, you know, just in case you miss the subtle hints. The male female dynamic has been totally obliterated, and that was one of my favorite parts. Even Cadsuanes character has been generic'd into shrewish stereotype. And what's up with all the exclamation points? Stephen King did this same thing to me one time. He ruined The Dark Tower series. Everything was going fine until that pink book came out...Quit now and keep your fond memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet more dross","review":"I'm in so much pain. 11 books in and I just want it to end. Please Robert, end my pain. A dirty dozen should be enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"What every fan hoped for... well almost","review":"If you're a fan of the WOT series then pick up Knife of Dreams. Jordan finally cleans up a lot of loose ends in preparation for the final installment. I felt like KofD was what CofT should of been. Crossroads seemed like writing for writing's sake (don't get me wrong, I really like all the characters in the series, but Crossroads was just too slow). Knife of Dreams, in comparison, is paced very well. We see the culmination of a lot of plot lines and can really feel the end is near. I only wish this one was longer. At only about 800 pages we really don't get to see a lot of Rand and the end of the series, though nearer, is still only just in sight. Jordan has said that the next book will definitely be the last, even if it must be 2000 pages long. I only hope he can conclude the series properly, giving all the characters the ending they deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's still good and finally looks like it may end soon.","review":"Knife of Dreams was a great continuation to the greatest fantasy series I've ever encountered. Many of the major conflicts facing the main characters in the last books ended, and it ends the book leaving you with no idea where it while go next. Hopefully, book twelve will start off with the characters getting closer to their goal of uniting the lands for the Last Battle. The ending of this book was excellent with many important and exciting events happening. I could not put the book down, and now I must face another year of waiting for the next book to come out. If you are a Wheel of Time fan, then this is a must-read as it will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did I see that before?","review":"There is so little originality in RJ's books. Now that Martin's Jaime has lost a hand and become an interesting character, Jordan does the same to a lifeless character here. Except that there will be no point to X losing their hand in RJ's world, and he can't hope to touch Martin's characterization, despite this desperate attempt. This Wheel is Dead. Don't bother to read this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as interesting as a root canal!","review":"Somebody ought to pay for this embarrassment and for stringing us readers along for 11 books in a story going nowhere .

I really feel sorry for him, but I also feel sorry for the thousands of people that read all 11 books.

I thought we'd at least get to the final battle sometime during this book.But no. Look, I like setting just as much as anyone else, but how many times does one of the Aes Sedai have to have a smooth face and smoother skirts? How many times do we have to be told that the voice in Rand's head is crazy? How many times do I need to be told Galina and Eliada are bad women? Or that Nynevane pulls her braid?Mr. Jordan, sir, with all due respect...get on with it, will you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A corpse","review":"This series became a bloated, decaying corpse swarming with maggots already a dozen of years ago.Objectively it is not that the litterary \\"performance\\" in this thing deserves 1 star.But it is that even if you find a nice golden ring on a corpse, it stays that it is a corpse.I simply don't care about anything that may or may not happen to anybody.I am fed up with Rand's idiocy, with Perrin's obsessions, with Tuon's arrogance, with Elayne's and Egwene's cluelessness.If anything I hope that the Dark One will recover some brains (up to now his IQ is about the one of an oyster) and sweep the floor up with the Rand's company.Another Breaking on the way but this time the destruction should be complete - nothing and nobody has earned the right to survive.Least of all the WoT series.The corpse became now so ugly and smelling that the only thing it deserves is to be buried.And fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fluff","review":"I had high hopes for this book. I bought it and read every page. By the end of the book I had realized only perhaps 6 chapters held anything worth value. The rest was just fluff. endless descriptions of people and things, that have been desribed to us before and so often. They are getting ready, the last battle is geting closer. It has been getting closer for many books. Had I known this book as this bad. I would have found somebody that read it and got the high points and sved my money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An improvement over terrible still makes for a bad read","review":"All but the most avid fans of this series agree that the last book in the WOT was the worst. Calling it merely terrible doesn't begin to describe how awful that installment was. And yes, this was better. A little.Then why do I still read these things? It's kind of like a train wreck. You just have to see how bad it can get.And I refuse to pay for this trash, as I get my copies through the library.Others have already listed the faults of this novel, so I won't bore you with listing them again. For those who are not critical in their reading, go ahead and give it four or five stars. But if you expect something more for your money than the hack prose supplied by Mr. Jordan, you will be very disappointed.One last point. Given the spanking fetish Mr. Jordan has developed, I'm thinking the Last Battle might be fought by naughty boys and girls armed with switches rather than with the One Power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan Haiku","review":"Hard men are stone facedWomen pull their hair and poutWe get it, okay?Another one:ten thousand pagesseventeen years to write this?end the series now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many unintersting characters/plotlines","review":"Reading Knife of Dreams after going through the same experience as most Jordan readers have, euphoria at the first five to seven books and then apathy and disappointment (maybe it has something to do with age? I was 16 when I read the first five books and am now 27), I realise that there is only one interesting plotline in the book and that is the Rand/Lews Therin plot. All the rest are just predictable plotlines (Perrin chasing Faile, Elayne competing for the throne etc) with boring one-dimensional characters. It is very boring and you keep hoping against hope that Moridin or Demandred finally get their act together and kill some of them but of course this is Jordan and, unfortunately, not one of the major characters on the good side can die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editor?","review":"Get this man an editor! I think that one huge problem with some of the sucessfull authors is that they seem to be able to ignor their editors. There were about 300 pages that could have been trimmed from this book. Repeated and lengthy discussions of unstrurdy chairs and page long dissections of facial expressions hardly make for compelling reading. Get on with the story! One of the jobs of a good editor is to trim the fat and make the books more readable. Where is Jordan's editor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Rubbish - If you must read it, use the library.","review":"After writing an excellent trilogy to start the series, it has become apparent that the author has padded out the remaining two books with trivia and verbose description to milk the plot.What could have become a brilliant 4-5 book series is now little more than the paper back equivalent of a soap opera that you can miss 6 months of, and still follow the story.Shame on you Mr Jordan, the reading public deserve better treatment than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost over, whew!","review":"The best thing that can be said of this novel is that this behemoth of a series is nearing an end. Some reviewers of this and the past 5-6 books in this series continue to sing its praises. I wonder if they read the same book that I did. This is the 11th book (yes, 11th!) in a series which was good for about the first 4-5 books. Somewhere along the line Mr. Jordon fell in love with his own prose and excruciatingly complex plot and character development. I hung around this long in the hopes that the magic of the first couple books would re-emerge. I don't see that happening and thus I will not be reading the 12th or so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Ridiculous","review":"I've read the other comments posted on this book. Congratulations to all of you. You actually made it past the 1st chapter. I myself began to read this and quickly got lost in all the excruciating detail that Robert Jordan has come to be famous for. He could have finished the series a long time ago if he would have chose to not go into so much detail, and actually leave something to the readers imagination.As this book stands, he leaves once again very very little to the reader's imagination, forcing the reader to try and keep up with exactly how Robert Jordan wants his world imagined.I myself have given up on the series. For those of you who have just read Eye of the World for the first time, I recommend abandoning the series before you waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the Last Book in the Series","review":"I have for a long time stopped caring about these books other than to come here and read the reviews, which fall into three camps: a) the people who love whatever Jordan writes, no matter how banal and how boring; (b) the people who feel that his current book is \\"the one in which he turns things around; and (c) those who feel betrayed by how badly he has killed this once great series.Well, this may be the last book for quite a while. I did an internet search for Jordan and Tor (his publisher) and Jordan is very seriously ill. Regardless of what I think of his books (and I think his writing is terrible), I wish him the best. However, that being said, it looks like this could be the last book in the series or the last one for a very very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the last 4, but only by one step.","review":"The intricate web should have reached an end ages ago.Ta'veren are still just whiney little boys that don't understand women.

The books have been generally getting worse with time and I would have to say that this one falls into the same category.The book is over 700 pages, but only 100 of them contain real plot and development. Almost right away I had to employ my WOT strategy of skimming through all of the fluff like how moody someone was today or the wonderful blue sky out in Andor that day and stop to examing the plot. The plot however, looks a bit hurried, almost as if Jordan wants to finish another book this year, but doesn't know what to put in it, so he throws around fluff and then has a paragraph of two on some closure. Well, to the true WOT fans at least there are some long awaited closures in this one.Till #12...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book 11","review":"The story is still too slow in developing.

Many were posted here before the book went on sale, which shows that TOR and AMAZON know that they'll never sell this junk without cheating. I've read this book. It stinks. Here's why:Once AGAIN RJ delivers junk. Rand is AGAIN MIA for most of this book. When he appears, it's only to be whiny and annoying for a short time. There's more on Mat here--which is NOT a good thing. Once AGAIN the Aes Sedai are skirt-smoothing, icy-staring, sniffing, scowling, tea-drinking bosomy witches. Once AGAIN RJ's chapters meander into the realm of FILLER and once AGAIN the ending is a quick burst of unbelievable garbage that makes little to no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"There seem to be 350 unneeded pages (again)","review":"Look, RJ must have been spending time reading Harry Potter, and at the same time trying to write the end to these useless WoT books. I can picture him reading Potter, and falling asleep with a WoT blank page in front of him; and picture him waking up the next day with 50 or so useless pages that were mysteriously written while he was asleep the night before. Dont waste your time. Semirhage kills people, Rand loses a hand (and isnt mentioned til like page 353 or something), Perrin \\"rescues\\" Faile, Mat and Tuon sort of get married, Elayne gets her required backers (and becomes Queen), Egwene gets spanked (unfortunately RJ didnt add pictures of this - that would have bumped my star rating up at least 2 stars), and Oh yeah - Moraine is still alive - Mat is supposed to \\"rescue\\" her.

Overall I really loved this book and can't wait till the next one.Despite the lack of details in this review, You know I MUST read WoT, and especially this latest book, since I typed \\"blood and bloody ashes\\"!

Every battle involving the principal three protagonists was short and lacked strategic thought or twists.

Jordan has proven himself a great describer of scenery and an abysmal storyteller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Disappointing Series Ever","review":"What started out as one of the best series I have ever read has quickly mired itself in quicksand. The pace slows to a crawl as usual and the book is mostly just bickering and banter with very little action. Once again i find myself skipping entire chapters because there is no enjoyment in reading them. There is no main thread to follow and nothing to miss. In fact I have often skipped chapters in his last 4 books and it has made no difference in my ability to follow the story because I haven't missed anything because so little actually happens. While I admit I am a sucker for punishment becuae I did buy the book in hopes that he would return to his original form but i was disappointed again. My wish is that the next book is the last so that we can finally put the readers and this series out of its misery.

I have lost complete interest in these initally captivating characters and concepts.As long as hardcore fans keep slavishly snatching up the next installment, it will continue to be a money maker for Tor.

I'm a fan of lots of fantasy series but WOT is by far my favorite. There are other series that in some ways I think are better but none do I enjoy reading as much as WOT. Jordan writes the fastest reading 1000 page book of any author out there.Knife of dreams is a solid book in the series. It's not as good as Lord of Chaos or The Dragon Reborn, but then in my opinion nothings as good as those two.Unlike other readers I'm not looking forward to the series conclusion. I read my first WOT book when I was 12 and forgot to send one of those autoorder SF book club forms back and I've been reading him ever since. I hope Jordan's healthy enough and has enough willpower to keep the series going for atleast three more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop, PLEASE","review":"Somebody please stop Jordan. This is simply awful and has been awful for so many previous volumes.Whoever out there is buying these books: Please, stop as well - it only encourages Jordan to write more of this schlock. For crying out loud, these books come close to being nothing but the mindless killing of innocent trees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knife dreams","review":"Super book and on time, now waiting on number 14th.Numerous plot lines advance and the writing shows the effect of a full cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last track of the gravy train","review":"I, like so many who have stuck with this series past book 6, am only in it to know how it ends. Knife of Dreams, the 11th book in this strange journey of Robert Jordan, brings me no closer to the state of serenity that (after book 9) I feel I've rightly earned. To that end, I closed the book and asked myself what it was that kept me reading this trash, book after book, wasting countless amounts of currency just to keep abreast of the hemorrhaging plotlines. Was it the random paragraphs of detailed description about a culutre that Jordan kills off in one chapter? Was it the obsessively repetitive passages devouted to the spanking of Egwene al'Vere? Or was it some sick, twisted hope inside of me that somehow Rand al'Thor would keel over dead and Mat Cauthron would ditch princess Toun and go back to the dicing and womanizing that made him likeable to me in the first place?None of the above. I just want this series over."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more...","review":"I really believed after the disaster that was CoT, that Jordan would write a better book than this (see books 1-5). Maybe my opinion is skewed, since I read this book right after reading George Martin's Feast for Crows (got it early from the UK Amazon site).Pretty much agree with what all the other reviews complain about: Perrin/Faile story is long and basically I don't care anymore, liked Mat/Tuon's story, WAAAY too many pages about Egwene/Nynaeve/Elayne.My biggest peeve is why he keeps writing about Rand/Perrin/Mat not understanding women and vice versa. Seriously, what is up with that? Didn't he write enough about that garbage in the last couple books? Who gives a #%$@# about men and women not understanding each other? It's not a self-help book, fer christ's sake.Sorry I had to vent like that.Anyways, I'll probably read the last book just to see what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little better, but still sub par","review":"Well the book was loads better then the last, but it still wasnt even close to the begening of the saga. It was nice to see some of the plot lines finishing up, what took 3 or 4 books could have easily been done in 2 chapters.. there is still no end in site, though atleast there are some allusions to \\"an eventuel end\\"all and all I stopped getting mad a few books ago, I continue to read with the small hope that they will eventuelly turn back around. I just wonder if this man realizes what he has done to his once great saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan in true form....AGAIN!","review":"Bravo Jordan!! You have once again crammed 450 pages of over descriptive, drawn out, long-winded JUNK into a 760 page book. I am assuming that the final installment of this series will be about 1100 pages and the characters will mill around moving about 6 feet until the last 50 pages when you will get into a rush to tie up all the loose ends? I haven't seen a worse book since Simon R Green wrapped up the Deathstalker series in Deathstalker Coda. That waste of money was not fit for toilet paper. I have very small expectations for the final book and will only buy it when it hits paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Para Para Rocks!","review":"Yoko Ishida is amazing, with all the different songs she can sing on. Tank! from Cowboy Bebop is amazing and so upbeat, as well as the classic Sailor Moon Song on the album being completely remixed and redone. I love it!So far 3 albums have been released, with a 4th on the way. I do say that the music can be a little repetitive at times, however, it's only truly appreciated if you can para para with it! Luckily inside the booklet there is an actual dance lesson to help you learn the moves for the song! ^_^All in all definitely worth the price, especially for the para para enthusiast! Keep watching for the instructional DVD which is coming out May 2nd. Then you can REALLY enjoy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would recommend to others and would buy again!","review":"I received the sunshade in less than a week.

As another reviewer stated, the rear view mirror does continuously get moved when removing the heat shield. At first this was an annoyance but I've gotten use to it.

One of which sold this sauce. We were buying random sauces and spices to try that we had never seen before. This was without a doubt the best of the things we bought. In fact its my favorite sauce to marinade and cook with. I thought I was going to have to get our friend to buy and mail us a whole box of these, but I decided to see if I could order them online, and here they were right on Amazon.It is a bit pricey to have shipped, but it tastes oh so good. I try not to over use the sauce when cooking because of its costs, but its very hard and I love using a lot. Anything else doesn't compare anymore. I wish I could buy it locally at a cheaper price.

Excellent historical background which linked the past with the present, providing a how and why of our present circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real stretch","review":"I read this book shortly after it came out and before my third deployment to Iraq. It relies heavily on specious arguments to make the case for such tactics as the Arab use of magic hand gestures (really). Poole's early books, The Last Hundred Yards and One More Bridge to Cross, were pretty good although still short of academic quality. The quality kept slipping in subsequent books. By the time we get to Crescent Moon, the whole thing is very poorly argued and not worth your money except, I guess, for use as an historical artifact. I would not buy this or any of his books written since."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Ladder is a death Trap","review":"After reading the reviews I decided that this product would meet my needs. Fortunately, I opened it up to test it out when it arrived, because the ladder was attached to the metal bars backwards, meaning that the legs that are supposed to keep the unit away from the wall pointed out instead of against the side of the house.I imagine this could lead to broken limbs or a broken neck, depending on how agile the person was trying to navigate this wobbly ladder during an emergency, as they tried to gain a toehold with the rungs right up against the wall.To add insult to inevitable injury, when I called First Alert customer service, they pretty much ridiculed me that I was using the unit wrong, and then told me to go through the process of returning it without so much as a \\"sorry about that\\" or \\"how can we help\\".I wish I would have bought the highly rated X-It ladder, instead of trying to save a few bucks at my own peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fast trip to the ground","review":"We purchased this Fire Escape Ladder from Amazon a few weeks ago. We opened it up to test it and found out that the ladder has no locking mechanism. You can try to secure it as much as possible, but it still slides up and pulls out. If you always have someone strong enough to hold the ladder in the window, you may be fine, but in a fire everyone needs to get out. This is NOT SAFE. Our windowsill was 6\\" and within the compatible range. We called First Alert and they offered no product support, but just said to return it. We did, but now what are we to do?We also attempted to leave feedback on the First Alert website, but not even that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Story Ladder","review":"I have not had the miss fortune of using the product.

It stores neatly in its box and is easily deployed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great Product","review":"Ordered 2 of these ladders and am sending them back. The ladders are heavy and combersome. Ladders seem too complicated especially if needed in an emergency situation. The hooks have to be pulled apart so it adds an extra step. The hooks are heavy and hard to get even to latch onto a window seal. The actual ladder rungs fall out of their packaging and are heavy. So getting the ladder rungs out the window could be troublesome. We have an X-it ladder and I was hoping to be able to get away with using these cheaper ladders in some other needed areas. The X-it ladder I have is a much better product. It is light weight. My kids can lift it. The ladder rungs stay neatly packaged until deployed. The hooks that secure to the window seal are simple. Guess I will have to spend the money and get more X-it ladders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Escape Method","review":"We were concerned that getting out of the second story of our house could be an issue in the event of a fire. I know these ladders have been around for years, but I was always sceptacle about their use. Amazon had one listed as a special deal, and that pushed me towards trying it. The ladder is small when not in use. It hooked up to my second story window ledge fine. It may be a little scary using it, but not as scary as a fire. It looks like it would save the lives of my family so it is not sitting in its original box right under our escape window."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very important to have!","review":"An escape ladder is very important to have in rooms that are 2nd story or higher.

They are very pleased with it and I rest easier knowing they have an escape route from their upper story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for kids","review":"This is not a good escape ladder for kids. We have a 6 year old daughter who was not strong enough to lift this heavy ladder up to the window, unfold the cumbersome hooks, and then throw the ladder part out the window. It is hard and awkward even for an adult to do this let alone a child.Once the ladder is hooked on the window sill, you have to lean waaayyy out the window to pull the release tab, risking falling out the window to do this, especially if you are a vertically challenged.Once you pull the tab, the ladder is supposed to neatly fall to the ground without getting caught up on itself. Wrong. The ladder gets so tangled that it would require you to go 4 or 5 steps down, untangle, go 4 more steps, untagle, etc.I do not recommend this ladder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to use and climb on safely.","review":"I tested this item from our second story window as soon as I got it home. First of all the rungs became entangled with the nylon straps when I released the velcro handle, had to pull the ladder up to correct it. The way it hooks over the window sill was not sturdy at all, and tended to shift dangerously when weight was put on the first rung. Just placing my foot on the first rung was a challenge in daylight with no emergency occurring, it just doesn't protrude from the wall far enough. I am athletic and of normal height/weight, but clambering down this ladder had me fearing a fall and I crawled back through the window before I got below the second rung. I returned the product to the store and will have to find some other way to egress our home in an emergency."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Alert EL52-2 Two-Story 14 foot escape ladder","review":"Very good product.

I had hoped that it would be simple and light enough for my daughter to use, but I don't think she could wrangle the ladder out of the box, let alone get it through the window and hooked onto the sill.

With vivd and heart-renching portrayls of his young wife, infant son, other raltives and friends who perished during the Holocaust, Destined to Live brilliantly depicts the devestating emotional toll the Holocaust wrought on those that survived. Without a trace of bitterness, Mr. Ungar describes how he managed to survive the Nazi's occupation of Poland, and went on to create a powerful life that postively impacted the lives of countless others. Destined to Live is not a memoir about survival for survival's sake. It is a gripping tale of how humans, even in the most dire and unjust of circumstances, can use the powers of love and perseverence to create true beauty and greatness.

This is now almost 30 years old, and it is still a standard reference for the sorts of problems it addresses, in spite of the fact that those problems are mathematically interesting and often economically important, And of the standard references it is easily the cheapest, at least of those you have to pay anything at all for.My only caveat is that I personally would have appreciated a more geometric tilt, rather than the algebraic one that the authors favour. Results tend to be derived first and primarily using algebra, and only then discussed from a geometric point of view. In particular, e.g., the discussion of duality is heavily algebraic, with Farkas' lemma tacked onto the end, _and proved using the previous algebraic result_.

I just want to know about Willow and her quest to survive. That's why I bought the book for goodness sakes! Not to read a textbook on pioneer life! If the author is so obsessed with putting those details in, the least she could do is put them in in an interesting way. I know these books are supposed to take place in just one day, but one day just doens't work for the Oregon Trail. The only thing I liked was that Willow was a pretty good character in that she was terrified of the river for a reason and in her feelings about her stepfather.

While some of the stories deal with the unusual or with borderline personalities, the rest take an ordinary event or person and show us the dark inside. What has always amazed me in Rendell's books is her ability to convey violence in actions and emotions without actually describing violent events or behaviors. And she does it again in this short story format.It is always refreshing to get a mystery/suspense collection that is built on a more elaborate scheme than a juxtaposition of good and bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable to Silly","review":"Ruth Rendell is one of my favorite mystery writers, so my disappointment in this collection of stories was all the keener. In the title story,the cliched tyrannical mother-dominated, creepy son relationship certainly robbed the ending of any surprise. The only aspect that caught my attention was whether Rendell's depiction of a stupidly pedantic \\"critic\\" was the author's revenge on nit-picking readers. As for \\"High Mysterious Union\\"--in the \\"it's an idyllic English village with salt-of-the- earth country folk . . . or IS it?\\" genre, Fay Weldon wrote a much better, much creepier, and much funnier novel: Puffball (a book I would not recommend to a pregnant reader!). For a superior collection of Rendell stories, seek out The Fever Tree and Other Stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"obscurity","review":"Though I remain one of her legion of fans, with each successive published work, I find myself asking \\"Why\\"? \\"Pirahna to Scurfy\\" has to be the worst offering of short stories that Rendell has written to date. The plots are thin, the endings seem forced. The title piqued my curiosity when I first saw the title on sale in my nearest bookseller. However, an obscure title cannot begin to compensate for tired colorless writing. In truth, Rendell hasn't written a truly gripping novel or short story collection since her works of the early to late 80's. I am only thankful I didn't waste a dime on purchasing this tame literary gesture but read it, borrowed from my neighborhood library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool CD!","review":"This is a cool CD, it's the best for partys!

She's calling from the sanitarium where she has been imprisoned for the past eight years for attempted murder -- his.To 'help' him, Detective Challis has a crew of helpers. It's not at all certain that they are more help or trouble. You kind of think that some of them might do better if they were to join his ex in the loony bin. ==A good mystery, characters with depth, a moving plot line, with some comedy thrown in. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary...","review":"This book should have been good. There are several separate story lines interwoven around the main one which I expected would add depth, complexity and interest. Disher has the potential to paint a vivid picture of small town Australia. But somehow - for me, at least - it just never picked up any momentum. Many of the characters were under-developed and one- dimensional and some of the situations described were just implausible to me. It was obvious from quite early in the story who the serial killer was (there was no other convincing suspect!)and there was a total lack of suspense or tension for much of the narrative. The action did pick up a litle towards the end, but that didn't compensate for the dreary plod through the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for the beach or holidays","review":"Mildly diverting, a quick read.

I know dance re-mixes are for dancing, but they can also be exciting and listenable at the same time. These are just junk. Over synthesized and boring.

Love it or hate, but you have to give them credit for this Album. This isn't as good as anything they released since then, but it is by far their heavist and most grinding album. Slow, depressive and heavy, far away from any \\"Icon\\" or \\"Host\\" sound. Even if you listen to \\"Shades of God\\" you wouldn't belive that this is the same band. But, I think it is a milestone in it's own way. Sure, during the Summer Holidays, this Album is Rotting Misery on my CD Collection but it has an original Atmosphere you can't get elsewhere. Not for everyone, by far not, but it shows that Paradise Lost where able to create great music even in their early days. Nick Holmes dark and deep Vocals take you on a journey into deep depression and a constant state of hopelessness, \\"...running in circles, not knowing where my fate lies\\" is a good credo for the message of this band.

Not only are they learning about the bible, they are learning about God's creatures and are even able to work on counting (counting level is more for 4 year old).Very interactive, just the right length, wonderful illustrations and age appropriate questions make this our favorite devotional to date. The only negative is that it is only good for about 60 days - I wish it were longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for preschool age","review":"My children are 4 and 6 and they both really like this book. I expected it to give examples of difficult situations that kids get in at school, with their friends, etc. But it's just more for preschoolers because it doesn't have that.

This book has been incredibly helpful to me as I struggle to make this decision for myself. I scanned the book quickly when I first got it, and have recently re-read the book more thoroughly; the exercises really help the reader explore their feelings. By using a journal along with this book, and with the help of a good therapist, I feel confident that I will make this decision and live well with it for the rest of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When reading the cover of this book, it seems as if it would be the ideal read for any person considering having a child. I understand the necessity of presenting the reader with the difficulties of child-rearing and the challenges that having a baby present, but I feel this author goes to the extreme, presenting worst case scenarios with absolutely no positive comments on the joys of having children whatsoever. This book is a great read if you want to be convinced that having a child will make you miserable for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should come with a free hysterectomy!","review":"This book goes into excruciating detail of every possible reason why having a child will ruin your life forever. It is completely biased! What little information that is presented on the positive aspects of having a child is short, weak and unbelievable. Many of the quotes from her clients are from people who never actually had a baby -- they are just speculating on how they could never handle it.Some of the views presented in this book are sexist and offensive. She presents the negative physical impacts of childbirth as though they all happen to EVERYONE, and that they will permanently ruin your sex life.I felt this author should have co-written this book with someone who has children, so they could provide a more balanced view. This book is so wildly negative, and parts of it made me laugh out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very biased","review":"I found this book to be very one-sided. While it does bring up some very important issues to think about before deciding whether or not to have children, it focuses on all of the hardships and none of the positives. Maybe it's due to the fact that the writer does not have children of her own. The writer also makes it seem as though you have to have everything in your life completely figured out and thoroughly organized before you begin to have children. Well, I'm sorry, but life usually doesn't work that way. I was very discouraged after reading this book and would only recommend it to people who are looking for validation on remaining childless."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author was quite biased and didn't think about the issue deeply enough","review":"I read this book when I was trying to make a decision about whether or not to have kids, and it did not help me at all. I found that she did not give very many reasons why one would *want* children. She only gave reasons for why one wouldn't want children. I think it was because she had not reflected on the question enough. Reflecting on this now, I think one great reason is a spiritual one: you want to pass your values down to your children as part of the greater goal of the development of humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Sadly, the author of this book presents herself as an authority in the baby-decision making realm. And in some ways, she may be, having been a family therpist for over 35 years.However, this single woman tells us in the introduction that she made a decision *not* to have a baby after asking herself the questions she asks of the reader in her book. So she does not possess the authority and insight of one who's been not only through the decision-making process, but also ultimately baby-bearing process.What does comes across is her belief that almost no-one is capable of being a good parent, especially if one were to follow her guidelines. For example, in order to be a good parent, in this author's opinion, one must have enough money not just for clothing and food, but also for summer camp, vacations, dance lessons, and private school. This, in addition to being an unrealistic expectation, is simply classist and highly inappropriate.Don't waste your time trying to work with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about overpopulation?","review":"Thin, vapid pop psychology that does not even mention such concerns as global overpopulation and the ensuing ecological collapse of our planet. The decision whether or not to have a child is the biggest decision most of us will ever make, and it requires the thoughtful person to consider factors other than their own small life. This book won't help you with the bigger issues. Very superficial. Check out Bill McKibben's Maybe One or the Society for Voluntary Human Extinction for more provocative, subversive food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every School Should Show It","review":"The great showdown between segregationist Alabama's university and Kennedy's very assertive policy of integration. Many strategies were planned in advance. Some contingencies had to be decided on a moment by moment basis.

The bonus film on JFK's funeral captures a sad sad day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real president","review":"For those who have short memories concerning the ugliness of racism in the United States or who will simply not address the true facts of that shameful period in america history(which in some ways continues today despite the fact we have an African-American president), I highly recommend this DVD. It shows the true nature of the legacy of slavery--particularly in the South and the necessary steps taken by the FEDERAL government to recifify the blockades put in place by those advoctes of states rights, who at that time were clearly were denying a significant portion of american citizenry their rights based upon their skin color."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to curl up with on a rainy afternoon.","review":"As a mystery buff and outdoor enthusiast, I found Mr. Eslick's fast-paced novel a wicked melding of both of my interests.

Since then it's been on the shelf collecting dust. Even if you are a LOTR fan (even if you are a super LOTR fan) I would not recommend this game. The riddles are straight out of the book, so if you have read the hobbit or seen the movie, the riddles are a joke. The song part is really dumb too. You just repeat after another person after they read the song. I can't even remember the other parts of the game.

It's a beautifully done art project on, as the title says, \\"the truth about growing older and the beauty of getting on with your life.\\" You can read this book in an afternoon on the couch with a cup of tea. It's on the whimsical side, has its sweet moments and some smiles too. One thing I really appreciate is that there are no cleavage shots and none of that \\"wow-we-are-still-hot\\" energy. It's just a reminder of who we were, how we've moved through this life, and here we go for the rest of it. I loved the photos of the women in this book. Real women, with real wrinkles and sometimes grey hair, any one of them could be a friend of mine. In truth, I was hoping for a bit more depth, but it was still worth my time. I guess in a way, even without the deeper kinds of conversations that I love, it's a little like just sitting with a friend you've known for years; it's just comfortable and easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm READY!!","review":"It was fun reading this book -- filled with facts & helpful advice.

Before you can say \\"acupuncture\\", the film takes off, trying to stay faithful to it's source but in the process, completely ignores much of the logic the series relied upon when it was first conceived to film. Rick Bota is once again in the director's seat, and his direction is uninspired, the plot laughable, and by the time Pinhead (Doug Bradley) shows up, it's apparent that Hellraiser: Hellworld finds the series diminished to the point of being a teen slasher. Pinhead hasn't been scary in quite some time, and here, he's just laughable. Like Hellraiser: Deader, Hellword is beyond bad, and even Henriksen's great performance can't save the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE IS NOT LIKE THE REST.......","review":"WOW what happened? this has to be the second worst hellraiser movie! it barely has anything to do with hellraiser....very disappointing.....hellraiser deader was the absolute worst!!!!hellraiser is my absolute favorite horror series and the last two do not stack up at all!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you might think for the 8th sequel!","review":"After reading some of these other reviews, I wonder if any of these people were actually paying attention to the movie. Many of their complaints are explained in the plot. Also, anyone who is still complaining that the Hellraiser series isn't like the first two movies needs to just deal with the fact the series went in a new direction years ago. This is nothing new people.....Having said that, I must say \\"Hellworld\\" is surprisingly entertaining considering it's the 8th installement in the series. The acting isn't stellar, but the gore, scares and surprise ending are all quite intriguing and fun. Although I admit the ending of the film may be a bit hard to believe, but then again a box that opens the gates to hell isn't exactly realistic either!This sequel is far better than \\"Deader\\", the previous film."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome twist of a great classic horror film.","review":"This is a great twist of one of the great classic horror movies. I am not a cult movie follower, but the Hellraiser saga has been one of my favorites for along time. In this episode, we find the puzzle box has became a game online and there are many of teenagers playing it. There are even parties held in honor to Hellworld aka Hell. This movie takes a great twist and follows up with a shocking ending that is barely fore-seeable. It is just a game right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest \\"Hellraiser\\"","review":"I thought \\"Bloodline\\" would go down as the least essential entry in the esteemed \\"Hellraiser\\" series. I was wrong; \\"Hellworld\\" isn't even up to the less than elegant standard of part 4. The problem here is not at the feet of director Rick Bota, who delivered the masterpiece \\"Deader\\" and the excellent \\"Hellseeker\\" prior to this one. It's the script, even more, it's the entire concept behind this film. It's another of the self-aware type of horror that was already proven to be useless with \\"Halloween: Resurrection\\". The story about internet Hellraiser games and revenge and hallucinogens, etc. etc. just doesn't work. The \\"Hellraiser\\" we have here is basically reduced to a teen thriller, and the only reason it's entertaining at all is because of Bota's deft hand and background in cinematography. Otherwise this would be unwatchable. Really.This appears to be the final film of the original series. Too bad it had to go out like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it \\"-10\\"!","review":"Deader (7) wasn't all that bad compared to this piece of crap.

Please skip this one it gives bad a new name."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Would Rather Go To Hell Than Watch This Again","review":"Hellraiser: Hellworld is definately the worst Hellraiser film to date. Hellraiser: Special Olympics would have been a better title. The plot is pathetic, the dialogue is awful at best, as is the acting. By the time a franchise gets to part 8, it's expected to be crappy but this film opens up it's own puzzle box of crappiness. I can't believe the money that is wasted producing horrible movies these days. Hellraiser 8 only solidifies my opinion that the entertainment industry has gone to Hell. Freddy Vs. Jason, Alien Vs. Predator, Hellraiser 8, what are they thinking? Are there any artists left in Hollywood?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellraiser - Hellworld ~ Katheryn Winnick","review":"Hellraiser - Hellworld~ Katheryn Winnick is not your typical hellraiser movie. Still it has a good plot. Well developed dialogue and actors that are not nearly as bad as in many horror sequells. The music in the movie is quite effective and Lance Henricksen is as good as always. For the budget that the movie was made (5 million or so I believe) I find that it is quite well developed indeed and not nearly as bad as some other reviewers have said, still this is only my opinion and can only be viewed or seen as such. But I give this movie five stars and consider it to be one of the better in this amazing series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves 0!!","review":"Hellworld is a disgrace to all horror movies especially the Hellraiser movies. The gore level is up as usual but other then that their is no reason to get this movie. Pinhead is in just one time and that is at the end. The whole internet puzzle box is just dumb. And how does every person in the town know about Pinhead and all the different movies, I though those things were real not fake! If you wan to get a good Hellraiser movie get H1 or H2, but this is just pure trash. The only good thing it does is it helps me go to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight to Trash","review":"There should be a category called that for movies such as these...It's awful. It's stupid. It's badly filmed. It's just plain pathetic. It gives a bad name to other Straight to Video films.

And I must say that it is a disaster. To me, Deader was a decent attempt to bring the series back on track. But then three months later..BAM! We get Hellworld. HELLRAISER IS NOT A TEENAGE SLASHER SERIES!! The story is complete crap and the characters are completely forgettable. This movie is a total disgrace to Clive Barker's original vision which was Hellraiser. The series needs a writer and director who understands the Hellraiser world as it was portrayed in the first two films. The best thing to do would be to bring Clive Barker back to write and direct and bring back Christopher Young's excellent score from the orignals. But that will never happen anytime soon if ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do they make decent hellraiser movies anymore?","review":"The last few hellraiser movies have been less than impressive. As is this new installment. First, you don't understand many of the goings on in the film. Most of the film doesn't make any sense and hardly anything is ever truly explained, you don't feel for the characters at all. The movie's villain Pinhead is hardly seen at all, and even he doesn't explain too much when he is on screen. I enjoyed the first 4 films in the series, but from there on, its been one bad film after another.I couldn't sit through this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"This Hellraiser movie is so cheesy. Think of it as another one of The Scary Movie - Hellworld. Pinhead and gangs don't do nothing in this movie. There is absolutely no computer on-line world at all. This is so misleading. People are screaming and running inside a mansion for 2 hours. That is about it. There is no pain or pleasure. On the other hand, if you are a Scream fan or Scary Movie fan, give this movie a try. You may like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big dud.","review":"I thought this movie would be awesome but it wasn't.Everything was ultra low budget including the script and special effects.I thought Hellraiser Deader was far superior and interesting compared to this boring mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like Hellraiser 1 and 2","review":"I have been waiting for a film like Hellraiser 1 and 2 . But the good old times are over. This movie is like many movies part 1 is very good part 2 is also very good but then the quality is going down. I have now all parts from 1 to 8 ; but after part 4 the quality has changed.Better buy Part 1 and 2 ! Okay for collecting you must have all, but do not hope you get the HELL like before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"I am a huge fan of Hellraiser and it pained me to watch Bloodline. But after seeing Inferno (a person favorite), Hellseeker (just as good), and Deader (confusing, but decent nonetheless) I had a lot of hope for the continuation of the series. Enter Hellworld. I didnt think it was possible, but this is worse than Bloodline. The characters are so horrible you cant wait to see them die (I mean there's a token black guy for Christ's sake), and their deaths are not satisfying enough considering the awful proformances they put you through. The soundtrack was so bad that it'll make your ears bleed (at least thats what crappy hard rock music does to me). The movie is not so much scary as it is laughable. I'm almost ashamed to call myself a Hellraiser fan after this movie. I was looking forward to a sequel after Deader. The only thing scary about Hellworld would be a sequel similar to this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really....It is bad.","review":"It is sad that these new movies went the wrong way. Pinhead is only 60 seconds in the movie.

This time a group of kids are invited to a Hellworld party full of partying, drinking, dancing and all out fun but their fun soon turns out for the worst as one by one they start to die. Lance Henriksen (Hard Target, Near Dark) plays The Host of the party. Doug Bradley (Hellraiser 1 & 2) is still going strong as Pinhead but he's the only thing good in this movie. Henriksen should stop doing this kind of stuff. Katheryn Winnick (Failure To Launch, 50 First Dates) plays the screaming girl this time but she's laughably bad here and her screaming is annoying. She either needs lessons or it was the script. Also starring Henry Cavilll (Tristan & Isolde, Laguna), Christopher Jacot (Degrassi, Get Over It) and Khary Payton. Another forgettable horror sequel"},{"rating":"1","title":"The last sequel?","review":"As a dedicated Hellraiser fan, I was constantly ripping Dimension for sitting on the last two sequels, Deader and Hellworld. After sitting on them for a year they were released right together as if Dimension was saying get them out of here and let's be done with them.Deader was by far the best of the last 4 installments while Hellworld is by far the worst of the entire series. Rick Bota has done a classic job of destroying a horror classic. When you take a classic horror film like Hellraiser and try to turn them in to mysteries or thrillers, you destroy the foundation of the legacy. Rick Bota needs to have a personal date with Pinhead. Let the chains tear his soul apart. Thanks Rick for destroying a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are there any reviews at all?","review":"This movie hasn't even been released yet.

By far the worse Hellraiser movie ever. It does not even deserve to be called Hellraiser cause it has nothing to do with the movies. Deader was crap but this is below that by some margin. After watching the first 4 parts of the franchise again,i only felt anger over this one. Either bring back Hellraiser as we knew it in the 80's or kill it off"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Been Years...And Finally...","review":"I first heard Scheer on a radio beer commercial in 1996...and they have been my favorite band ever since. The driving guitars, Audrey's haunting melodies, the heart-wrenching passion in every song, so beautiful that I still cry when I listen. It had been years since I bought Infliction (Scheer's first cd) and I thought I would never hear from them again, until...And Finally. Once again I found myself surrended to Scheer. The One Forgot, Slowly, and Secrets and Lies are my favorite tracks on this cd. ...And Finally, they couldn't have titled this one more appropriately.

Set during the reign of Louis XIII & Cardinal Richelieu in France, D'Artagnan seeks enrollment into the Musketeers. But the plot thickens as he courts a woman. There is even more conflict as Milady, a beautiful but demon-like woman, is hunted down by D'Artagnan & company. D'Artagnan also faces several sword-fights against the Cardinal's Guards, and conflicts with the Cardinal himself. There is action on almost every page, and I recommend The Three Musketeers to those looking for an action-filled classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"historical book","review":"the coffee trader is tedious to read but fascinating as to historical facts about trades on the market.

Like most of his books \\"The Coffee Trader\\" takes some time before it hooks the reader. As always Liss brings the past alive. It was fun to read about Miguel Lienzo's beginnings and explore an amazing city like Amsterdam. Reading and learning about coffe made me increase my intake rather considerbly. The financial markets and intrigue make for a very entertaining good time. If you are a fan of Benjamin Weaver you will enjoy this prequel of sorts. If you have never read Liss before this is a very good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turner","review":"I have to be honest, I dont read for leisure as much as I would like to. As a college student, if I can find time for fiction, I should be using that time to read textbooks. I bought this book in the RDU Airport (solely on the cover, and the fact that I was going to amsterdam in a few weeks, which is where this novel takes place) and couldn't put it down. I finished this book in about 3 sittings; the characters were incredibly intruiging, with one plot twist after another. Deception and trickery is an all-too-common theme in this book, and the ending is fantastic. I had never read a historical, economic mystery before but I would wager that Liss is one of the best authors for the genre. He describes 17th century amsterdam beautifully and the beauty of that description is only surpassed by the development of the characters. I would highly recommend picking this book up the next time you have a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Conspiracy of Paper","review":"I liked Conspiracy of Paper very much, but Liss is even more successful with The Coffee Trader.The plot is extremely intricate, and the reader must work to stay with it, but the work pays off in a terrific resolution.Though I admire Liss's attention to detail and historical veracity, what I most appreciate is that his characters are convincingly three-dimensional. Few people are all good or all bad, yet the proliferation in modern fiction of characters who are no more than straw men is appalling. Liss gives a reader characters that are convincing in their strengths, flaws, and manifold complexities.All in all, this is one of the better suspense stories of recent years, and I recommend it without qualification."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great historical scenes, but...","review":"I found the plot and characters really lackluster. I'm surprised to see so many good reviews--I'm a voracious reader and rarely put a book down disatisfied, so my reviews are normally higher than average. But this book was a disappointment. I really did enjoy the historical tidbits and the descriptions of Amsterdam, but by the end felt like I didn't care about any of the characters and really wasn't that interested in what happened to them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a lukewarm cup of instant de-caf","review":"I really wanted to like this book and I appreciate all of the research that the author did into his subject and period. He really did do a wonderful job of recreating 17th Century Amsterdam and of making it seem authentic. Unfortunately, more than 100 pages into the book I still couldn't find enough of a plot to keep me interested or a charecter that I cared enough about to want to get to know any better.

Individually, the story of the commoditiy traders and the history of the Jews from Portugal and Spain are interesting topics, but the story line used by Liss left me wanting. I think Liss did not take either aspect of the novel to any depth leaving just the whipped milk on my latte wasting away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee trader could have been better","review":"The idea behind the story was good. A great setting, and good characters. The problems with the book were historical value was diminished by too much that was inaccurate; all of the charactes were disgusting and were tricksters, slobs and cheats, all painting the supposedly pious Jews of the period too look like dishonest greedy thieves....no one was righteous; all immoral or amoral, everyone out to cheat everyone else all for different reasons was depressing, and the long discussions about the commodity trade were confusing to someone who didnt know the business, and finally, too much vulgar language which was inserted to create a sense of salacious appeal which was uneceesary.....although the concept was good and the setting interesting, the book failed in the story line itself"},{"rating":"2","title":"17th Century Intrigue Brewed Right","review":"If you're somebody who prays to the gods of java every day, that fact alone would make you want to read this, Liss sets his book in 17th century Amsterdam where a shrewd Jewish trader who's desperately down on his luck, is drawn into a money making scheme that involves a new berry called the coffee bean that supposedly produces near miraculous results in those who ingest it. But there's plenty of things standing in his way. There's a dangerous and mentally unstable client who blames Miguel for his current poverty, there's his brother who is colluding with one of the most powerful men in the city who wants nothing more to see him fail, and his brothers' attractive and unhappy wife, who seems eager to trade her husbands bed for Miguels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crackling good \\"noire\\" novel that transcends typical categories.","review":"The Coffee Trader is an entertaining page turner with danger, romance, mystery and lots and lots of lying and deception on the part of virtually everyone in the narrative. The central action might focus on commodity manipulation (something that some people might find boring - but which is actually as good a theater for action as any crime drama) but the meat of the story involves sexual desire, culture clashes, alliance making and criminal scheming and betrayal straight out of noire film. There's a wicked twist at the end too. The fact that the setting is a brilliantly researched and detailed seventeenth century Amsterdam is just icing on the cake. This one was fun. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical literature","review":"I actually really liked this book for my history class!

I very much admired his earlier book \\"A Conspiracy of Paper\\" and have been doing a major \\"word of mouth\\" on that first book among my circle of acquaintances (who have also enjoyed it). I am so impressed with the research that Liss evidently must do to create the elaborate plots and detail he conveys --you truly can feel (and smell) 17th century Amsterdam.

The historical background seems well researched, the characters initially seem to be interesting, the plot promising. But read on, and you will only be disappointed by the shallow portrayal of the life at that time, the undeveloped characterizations, and the excessively twisted and, ultimately baffling, plot.

Maybe someone else should give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portrait of greed","review":"The Coffee Trader is a historical novel set in the 1600s in Amsterdam, a town even then known for its freedom and liberalism. Jews flocked there to escape persecution elsewhere, and one of them, Miguel Lienzo, tastes coffee and the first time - and is changed forever. There aren't a lot of \`good guys' in this book; it's just that some of the bad guys are gooder than the badder bad guys!

Chapter 3 tells us \\"most creative work requires a healthy cooperation between intuition (right brain) and logical thought (left brain). Under the topic of cognitive style, the author says people's personalities and abilities are strongly influenced by their mental habits. Education has traditionally been biased toward left brain processing. A strong case is made for the use of both hemispheres.

These patients were thought to be perfectly normal even though the two halves of their brain were surgically separated (to stop seizures.) Sperry showed that independent thinking and knowledge was going on in the two halves of their brain. The fact that they appeared normal except under the special conditions of the experiment has amazing implications about the way normal people integrate non-verbal thinking into their consciousness.

There is just little to nothing on here that makes this worth having, in my opinion.Reminds me of the Mickey Ratt CD I bought earlier this year, with a bonus DVD of Stephen doing nothing but sitting around making stupid comments about nonsense with Ratt songs, and banging away on a guitar.

The acting is marvelous--right down to the smallest roles, such as the maid and the hotel clerk. Nigel Havers is perfect, as are Rosemary Leach and Bernard Hepton. This is television the way it used to be on BBC before the Huns took over. I noticed one small cut, however, in the sex scene between Havers and Leach, a moment of complete disgust on the face of the younger man. Perhaps the contemporary editors thought that the facial expression was politically incorrect.

Please, Amazon, rewrite your description of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay While it Lasts","review":"This is a handy product to have around, especially with the suction cup accessory to hold it upright in your sink. But the sponge is too flimsy to do much beyond glasses or very superficial mess, and the green scrubby portion of the head falls off within a few washes. Definitely not the best dish brush I've used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has quickly become my favorite dishwashing tool...","review":"This is an amazingly useful dishwashing tool. I was skeptical upon purchasing this item as I am not a big fan of sponges, but I am very glad I did. While you might tend to think of this as a tool mainly for washing glasses, I have found that I use it for almost everything. Why? For one, the design is great. The fact that the sponge completely encircles the bottom of the wand, instead of simply being on one side, makes it very easy to swipe in and around a number of dishes. Secondly, the material of the sponge is GREAT. It is almost a plastic mesh material (as a sponge) that cleans easily and holds up great. It does not flake, and it scrubs really well without being abrasive. I definitely recommend this product. Simply love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Glasses","review":"If you own an assortment of thin, long glasses like we do (pilsners, flutes, etc.) this brush is a must. We haven't had any problems with breakage, and it quickly dries if kept upright in its suction holder. The downside is that it has to stay in the sink to dry and it gets knocked over sometimes being in the way and I can't imagine the colors actually matching anyone's color pattern. But well worth the investment to properly hand clean glasses (especially those that are not dishwasher safe)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the 'dish wand' not the 'scrub wand'","review":"We love the wand, but we hate the 'scrub' head. We've never had that scrubby green bit on the end last more than two weeks before falling off. It can be super-glued back on, but that only postpones the inevitable.This product rates two stars instead of one only because you can use the 'dish wand refills' with it. The 'dish wand' head lacks the scrubby bit at the end, but it lasts much longer due to the one-piece construction. Our local housewares stores only carry the 'scrub wand refills' these days, so we'll be buying 'dish wand refills' on Amazon for now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile and easy to use","review":"We don't have a dishwasher, and we use this sponge more than any other. I sometimes have to use a separate scouring pad for stuck-on food. This is great for deap drinking cups and water jugs. I can squeeze this sponge into a Tupperware midget container, too. I just put the dishwashing liquid in with a little bit of water, and I don't have to refill it for about a week (washing dishes every day). My husband tends to be a little rough with it (he's a speed washer), so the sponge tip only lasts for a few months. I really like that I can just buy the sponge refills separately. I've never had to replace the wand. We've had it for a year and a half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Info For this dvd","review":"Great White - Live and Raw DVD 2 full concertsThis DVD features vintage performances of the top-selling SoCal blues rockers captured live at the height of their success in Irvine and Modesto, CA!

This is probably a \\"cash in\\" on the fact that Great White is doing a reunion tour and has a new album coming out so I doubt this has been endorsed by the band, regardless of what the liner notes say. Much like the recent Stephen Pearcy and L.A. Guns DVDs, this one sort of misses the mark. Since no other footage is currently available, you can argue that it is nice to have for that, but the footage itself leaves a bit to be desired. It's certainly live and raw and while I don't want a hard rock band to be all polished up in the studio, this could have stood some sprucing up. It's more bootleg footage than an actual commercial release. It's not unwatchable, but it is lacking in quality somewhat, so just be forewarned that it is not some pristine high def DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOTLEG","review":"though i had read some reviews before i bought that dvd i didn't expect it to be so bad (quality).The capturing and the sound is probably of the worst bootlegs i own.The cover gives you the impression it's an official release but 101% it isn't it.The only good thing is the GREAT WHITE's performance which is excellent.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Youtube quality","review":"I have to echo the sentiments of my fellow reviewers here, this is bar none the lowest quality DVD video I have ever seen. I've seen divx rips off the internet that were much better... mind you, this has nothing to do with the band itself, and everything to do with looking and sounding like some fool shot the whole thing with a crummy old home camcorder and plopped it onto a disc. Please avoid this one, it's probably not worth adding to your collection even if it was free."},{"rating":"1","title":"5.1 surround...for what?","review":"Being a big Great White fan I was so fired up to have a DVD concert from these guys, but when I popped it in, what a disappointment.I can tolerate the hand-held camcorder quality video footage, but the sound? What were they thinking? Why didn't they use audio from the mixing board and dub that over the camcorder sound? That would have been perfect. It should have at least been specified on the packaging that it was an authorized bootleg type thing. Oh well, it's still cool to watch these guys rock out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing more than a bootleg","review":"I love Great White and have had the pleasure of seeing them live and they are an excellent band. Having said that, I am very disapointed with this release. The video and sound are bootleg quality. The DVD says these shows were hand selected by the band. I find that hard to believe. This was obviously shot with a camcorder by someone in the audience. The band does an excellent job and the shows are good, it's just hard to get past the quality of the sound and video.

One track \\"Check Ya Self\\" and you will be hooked on Midnite. I have tens of thousands of Reggae cuts and this song blows my mind. The rest of the album will hyponotize and mesmorize. Branch out my brothers and sistas Roots is fierce when Midnite play de down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch, origonal reggae","review":"I have to say that this CD is some of the most raw, origonal reggae sound I have ever heard. It is not typical mainstream reggae but it is not lacking in creativity or talent either.Bass and drums take the front in this production with layered vocal and instrument effects highlighting most of the tracks. It has a very dub meets rhythym and blues reggae feel that is overall, very origonal and extremely well done.If you haven't sampled any of the tracks already I would do som\\\\ immediately if you are a fan of Midnite and make your own decision.I would highly reccomend this to anyone who is a fan roots and/or dancehall reggae. The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because there are 2 songs on the CD that I wouldn't mind if some one pressed skip while they were playing. Any other tracks on there and I would have to object and replay them from the beginning :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recomended","review":"This reggae on this cd is monotonous, dark, and depressing.

When it was on a terrific sale at Amazon, I immediately order two. I had just run out and open the perfume immediately sprayed it on and was very disappointed. I don't know if it was stored improperly or is a fake, but it not Glow. There is a possibility that they have changed the scent at the manufactures for some reason.

The other perfumes I have by J-Lo are more evening orientated whereas this one is definately a day fragrance, could even stretch it for a casual evening out. Other reviewers mentioned that this reminds them of soap smell, it does but its not overpowering or unpleasantly so and I hope you wouldnt be put of by this - its not a cheap soapy smell, but a I-just-got-out-the-shower-and-am-ready-for-the-day soapy smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clean, fresh scent","review":"For her first perfume, J Lo released Glow, a very clean, fresh-smelling scent. To me, it is a combination of a clean soapy smell with a bit a of fresh floral. It is sofly feminine without being sweet or girly. I think it's appropriate for all ages--it has a youthful appeal, yet I'm close to 40 and enjoy it, plus I bought some for my mother, who just turned 60, and she likes it too. Destined to be a modern classic, Glow is a beautiful scent with wide appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerising...","review":"Glow by JLo is one perfume that remains with me everytime - no matter what.

Smells okay, but doesn't last all day.","review":"When I bought these two bottles of J Lo Glow I believe they were about $15 less (each) than what I pay in stores, which is GREAT! Almost like 2 for 1. The perfume smelled like Glow but for some reason the scent wasn't as strong, & did not last all day like Glow normally does for me. In addition, the whole time I used these bottles I didn't get the usual compliments to my scent that I always get from everyone (male & female - they like the Glow plus the hair stuff I use). Once I went back to store-bought J Lo Glow, the compliments returned. All is normal again. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd, interesting groups","review":"when i first came upon this cd, i was very pleased with what i saw, i mean the selection of songs/groups were amazing, the velvet undergroung, nico, bowie and the reason i discovered this cd, television, what a great song marquee moon (among the 500 songs of all-time so is i wanna be your dog by the stooges) i thought, wow, it's worth having, you don't find music like these anymore, and these selection of songs are definetly from warhol's era!!!!!

As for the playstation game though I have to say this. First of all the game has a very limmited variety of questions that start to repeat after only a few plays of the game making it bore to play after only a couple of days. Number two, this game could not load more slowly from question to question, its like sitting and waiting for your death. I can get a right answer and wait a full minute untill Regis is reading the next question, its just so slow you will want to scream. My advice, watch this one on the tube, leave the playstation game alone though. Try You Dont Know Jack on your computer or Playstation instead. Its a better triva game suited for at home play with pals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of games....","review":"First of all, I don't know why this game has a 2 player option. Two people face off and only 1 person gets to play the game really. Some of the face off questions are so ridiculously hard that you will be guessing for a long time and the game will keep on telling you to try again and again before ending the game. It won't even give you the right answer at the end!! You should have the option to pass to a new question for the faceoff.In the game, now this is where the playstation is showing it's age. The loading speed is VERY ANNOYING. The questions are repetitive after awhile. The phone a friend dialogues are amazingly cool and funny. Regis adds a few wise cracks and you got a less than average game. Not worth buying but go for a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wants to be a little disappointed?","review":"I had high hopes for the game. While others mention the lack of questions and the slowness of the game, I was more concerned about the overall feel of the game. This game seems to have been rushed out and is not as polished as it could be. While Regis' voiceovers are OK, as is the phone a friend, the game is played mostly in silence. Regis doesn't even read the questions out loud. If he did then I could forgive the game for having only 600 questions. More full motion video of Regis would have been nice also. In addition, having only 30 seconds to answer is extremely limiting. On the TV show there is no time limit, so why in the world impose one here? Just as you begin to talk yourself through the answer the time is up!

Much of the information was wonderful, the explanation about protein and simple vs. complete protein was very interesting. I am an avid reader, but I found this hard to follow, and didn't retain the information. Having to trudge through the chapters made each new page harder to face.

But the author is such a fine story-teller that the reader forgets he's drawing on sources. Jones pits 2 naive mid-western comic book creators against 2 slick New York comic book businessmen (you can guess which side screws the other) to illustrate not only how Superman came into being but how members of a once-cohesive ethnic community exploited one/no two of their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"New material in paperback","review":"I read the hardback and loved it, then read that errors had been corrected and new material added in the paperback, so I picked it up. I'm glad I did. The new material isn't extensive, but it provides even more fascinating glimpses into the twisty story of Jerry Siegel, both in his early days and his publicity campaign in the '70s. Also corrects the previous impressions of Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson and Siegel's mysterious son Michael. An even better read than before!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating study","review":"This book gets off to a slow start but is well worth the effort if you stick with it. Much of the ground covered is familiar from other histories of the comics, but Jones adds some unique twists. In particular, he talks about the publishers -- not just the artists, writers, and editors -- and sets the origins of the comics in the Jewish culture of New York in the 1920s and 1930s. He also uses the experiences of Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster as the through-line for his story, giving it unusual emotional resonance and depth. This is the real-life version of The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"Anna Deavere Smith is a well-educated, well-connected, talented, scholarly African American woman, recipient of many honors, minor movie and television roles, her own one-woman television specials and theatrical performances. The problem with this book is that she NEVER lets us forget how wonderful she is. She is SO impressed with herself that it's amazing to me that she ever got around to interviewing her, uh, subjects. (SHE seems to be the real subject.)The book is a fairly interesting look at what goes on in Washington political circles, where most of her interviews take place. If you can get past the parties in her honor and all the other self-focused hoo-ha, you might enjoy reading it.

The last series (Jerle Shannara) left me slightly disappointed.After reading a preview chapter from Jarka Ruus I became very interested. I received this book as a gift and immediately sat down to read it over the course of a few hours. I was very impressed. The writing, characters, and plot lines are much more reminiscent of the earlier Shannara novels.

They are always at odds and almost the entire Four Land is their enemy5. Theres romance. And it happen in a blink of an eye or a snap of a finger6. Theres always internal strugle7. Hate to say it but theres always resemblance to Lord Of the Rings but maybe thats the only way the story can be told.8.

One moment, she's purrs angst and seconds later, she snarls and vocally struts her style. The opening track, \\"Beautiful\\" typifies this beautifully.And the rest of the band helkps her create a sound so distinct, from the keyboard riffs, to the deep gutteral distorted power chords from the guitar, it creates a nice balancing act between elegant and anger.

The mystery, when solved, is out of the blue. Then, wasting eighty pages to get started and after a hundred pages of story, we get long, boring tell-not-show, backstory upon backstory that again has no bearing on anything.I'm dumbfounded that a book like this gets published.

It is absolutely fascinating - the review, that is, not the book. It exposes the book as \\"pedestrian rehash that reads like one of the Victorian hagiographies\\". The book has ignored all the intervening research and accepted as fact Stanley's self-serving and now-discredited accounts. Most of the New Yorker review is about Stanley and Livingston themselves and chockful of realistic info about these fascinating and utterly dissimilar characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing read","review":"If you have any interest in Africa, its' exploration, peoples and/or geography this book is for you.

He also places the characters well into the historical context of the times. He captures well not only the facts but he captures the characters including their foibles and weaknesses.The best part of this book was getting to know the men involved - thankfully they were all prolific writers themselves.

A page-turner.","review":"The entire trilogy is first-rate and one gets hooked very fast. Plots and subplots come thick and fast. There's no way to anticipate them, yet they never seem contrived once they arrive. Characters are deep and realistic, strange yet eerily familiar.One complaint: the first 100 pages or so are a waste for those who have read the first two volumes. It seems that Cherryh is simply trying to bring new readers into the story. This is not only boring for those who are already hooked but also somewhat futile for others: there's no way to capture adequately what happened in vols. 1-2 without reading them. This concerns not only plot but also, even moreso, the character development at which Cherryh excels. Fortunately, after this initial letdown the book picks up and quickly reaches the pace and intensity of the others. Let's hope the author doesn't do *this* again in any sequels. (I'm hoping for at least one more follow-up!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aliens","review":"C.J.Cherryh is really seriously good at depicting aliens.

The blade guard will still not retract properly. She explained to me that I am the problem by not blowing out the tool enough. Here is the problem. A woodworking tool with a safety feature that intermittently works is very dangerous. A tool with no dust collection that generates copious dust during any cut will clog the spring (that I am apparently in error by not blowing out enough). After using 10 circular saws in my life, never blew one out, never had a guard issue.Big Bosch fan until today.

While this was a minor problem the problem with the plastic base plate would have been a lifetime pain! The base plate lacks dimensional stability in that it will not accept the rip fence insertion without a significant use of force and again more force or a rubber mallet is called for if you need to move it to your desired rip dimension. Additionally the set screw for the rip fence comes with a spring that is to long thus requiring more force during all my aborted attempts to screw it into the base plate! I further found it physically impossible to screw the set screw into the base plate without the spring in place!

I fixed the bent plate and put the old Milwaukee back in service."},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic junk","review":"I like most bosch tools that i've owned and used, but this unit needs some serious rethinking from the bosch brains. Way to much fragile plastic for a tool that is inevitably going to take some serious abuse. The table also flexes and moves way to much for consistant, acurate cutting due to the plastic scrap. Bosch needs some good old mag on this pup or some seriously fortified plastic resin. A little redesign and this would probably be a great saw, but till that happens it is a hunk of junk. Wake up u bosch nerds and tune this puppy up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with decision","review":"I bought this saw a couple of months ago. Overall I'm really happy with the decision. It's relatively light and well balanced. The sight line is truly the best that I've came across. Angle and depth adjustments could not be any better. I've had no problems at all. The only gripe is that I wish Bosch would include a case instead of the bag for storage. The bag just doesn't protect the saw that well, and there's no pocket for the wrench.Update: The direct connect cord system is really a pain in the rear. Its not easy to get a cord plugged in. I've bent the prongs several times. I think the prong will break before the year is over. My suggestion is to get a the model with the included cord and leave it plugged in to the saw permanently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Popeil the truth stretcher!","review":"Popeil surely has a place in gadgetmania history, but to take credit for the work of others is an insult to the reader. Most TV gurus know that even the title \\" but wait theres more \\" is the work of the GINSU Guys. If we can't even believe the title, perhaps we shouldn't trust much after we open it.

I really liked The Innocents so I bought the rest of the Wil Hardesty series. Boy, do I wish I had not. If you do decide to read Bearing Secrets be sure to have a pen and paper in hand and write down each character and how they relate to the book. You will need this as it is very confusing. I don't think I have ever read a book that I stayed so lost with the people in it. It goes back seventeen years and brings you up to date. There are just so MANY PEOPLE and groups involved. I ended up reading several pages twice to try to connect who was who. I guess I will read the next one as I already have it and hope it is like the first one and not the second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgivable drumming ruins an otherwise perfect jewel","review":"This monumental Paradise Lost album is beautiful, haunting, surreal, dark, dramatic, and, well, Gothic!

Turns out the book was originally printed in 1945 but reprinted several times after that, so the resulting book was actually a 1960's version with the 6o's hair and dresses - not what I wanted. It should have been advertised as a \\"1965\\" Emily Post book instead of a 1945 Emily Post book, so it was a bit misrepresented.

Too much reminiscent of the first shpongle or even shulman, with the pseudo-alien-mushroomy voices here and there... booooring.THIS ONE, on the contrary, makes a clear choice: subtility of the music, balance, in a fine dub spirit; not too many layers of sound, not trying to be too psychedellic, it really does the trick. has a nice soomth dubby rythm all the way through, and can really take you somewhere far away from where you are.

My little boy is three and he loves it. It teaches him history and other things including manners and taking turns. Great movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious as usual","review":"A lot of people are being critical about Margaret \\"turning\\" political nowadays, which is ridiculous because all she does is speak about her life and her experience, and everyone is more political these days. If she has anything interesting to say about politics, than by all means she should include it in her act. That said, here's my review-She is much more connected with the audience here than with Revolution, which I'm sure a lot of people will be happy with, even though I thought she was great before. Most of her new writing is 100% political in nature here, and scathingly funny. Gay marriage, the moron in the oval office, the flavor of Laura Bushes' coochie, the pope's decidedly homosexual lifestyle- are just a fraction of the perceptive and hilarious material seen in this film. You pretty much know what to expect, which is something creative and original."},{"rating":"2","title":"The taking of the torch...","review":"I have watched and listened to Margaret Cho over the years and found her brand of humor funny throughout. This time around, however, I find she has successfully migrated herself into that elite group of social humorists who are able to comment on our social status as a country and our politics, and do so with blazing strikes that are poignant, on-the-mark AND funny. Margaret has changed, and with this change comes a broadening of her boldness. She has taken the torch from the likes of Lenny Bruce, and she holds no punches back when she speaks her mind, be it about the rights of individuals or the brazen BS of our some of our right-wing politicians. Ms. Cho may be the one that she wants, she might be notorious, she could lead a revolution, but frankly, she IS one politically savvy comic assassin and this show is her best yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not watch more than 30 minutes. More like a DNC pep rally.","review":"Margaret Cho has been one of my faves for quite awhile. I was telling my wife that if she stopped doing impressions of her mom that she would be done, and it happened. Instead of being funny and poking fun at the right wing tactfully, she just comes off with vulgar language. Many times she is waiting for the audience to get what she thinks is funny. She pauses and nervously goes into her next tirade. I think gays are cool. I am not much into politics, but this was really, really bad. It is something if I can't even sit through 30 minutes of it. If I could have given a more negative score I would have. Any fans of her old material will be VERY dissapointed. Do not buy or rent this garbage. Dave Chapelle gets more laughs in 3 seconds than I did watching 30 minutes of this. It is one thing to be vulgar but funny. She was just vulgar. He career is plummeting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've enjoyed much of Cho's past work, but this time around nothing was funny. Even she didn't seem to be enjoying the material on this outing. She just keeps feeding the audience the same tired routine (hate Bush love us) and the audience just goes insane.It's just not entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Rant not comedy!","review":"The problem with this dvd is it is just not entertaining. Margaret goes on a political rant rather than performing true comedy. Suffice to say she is anti-bush. She can substitute the word Bush for Clinton, It still won't be funny. Margaret forgets she is a comedian. She should not use the stage as her political forum regardless of either to the right of left of political views. Perform comedy, not name calling. I am just flat out bored watching this DVD. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"More gay-focused, less funny than her others","review":"I've enjoyed past live performances by Margaret Cho and was really looking forward to watching her latest. This one seemed *a lot* more focused on gay culture and 'being gay' in today's America than her previous performances and got a bit tiring after the first 30 minutes. Maybe it's just that she's peaked and is now headed down, maybe it was the audience she was performing in front of... but I was disappointed and will likely not watch another one by her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have they stopped trying to tell us Margaret Cho is funny?","review":"They tried to force Cho down our throats about 10 years ago. Yeah, that worked. In my opinion she is flat out just not funny. Period. If I have to see her doing another impression of her mother (the squinting of the eyes and screaming pigeon English into the microphone) I cannot take it. Now her act seems to be her just rambling on about herself, not only is her current act not engaging it would be torture if I was actually with her one on one and had to listen to this crap. I think she is basically for the hardcore left crowd now. Other comics of course have had acts that had real overt points of view from the left like Bill Hicks except he was FUNNY."},{"rating":"1","title":"i still love margaret cho but....","review":"a couple of years ago i bought the 3-pack dvd set with cho's first three stand up dvds and i loved each one of them. all three were funny. i wanted to buy assassin but something told me to wait. then one day at blockbuster my mom told me to pick a couple of things out and when i saw assassin, i was like, cool i'll rent it to see if it's any good. my mom wanted to turn it off after 10 minutes, bored, but i, loving miss cho as much as i do, made her sit through the first half hour. i was so sad because i love margaret and wanted to love it but just couldn't. we still have it for like another week and i plan on watching the rest of it alone to see if it gets any better, but from the first half hour, i can tell it probably wont."},{"rating":"1","title":"Margaret Cho forgot that she's a comedian! BORING!","review":"Margaret Cho USED to be so funny that you'd gag on your own laughter. She seems to have forgotten that she's a comedian. I don't know if I'd call if social or political soapboxing... I didn't laugh once. Even the folks who paid to see her show in person aren't laughing. They clap in agreement with her views. The crazy thing is that she ^believes^ that she is being edgy and original. She's just boring..... I miss the old comedian, Margaret Cho - the entertainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy","review":"Margaret cho is no longer funny. this isnt stand up.this is just a liberally biased speech for 1 hour. get earlier dvds and ignore this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presidential Assassin","review":"This installment of Margaret Cho's comedy outting was pretty good. It's a step up from her last comedy movie, Revolution, but still doesn't live up to her first two.It starts off pretty slow, but once she starts kicking in heavy on her political jokes, you'll start enjoying it. She's very critical of the administration in her jokes, but does it in a way that's very truthful and not too malicious."},{"rating":"1","title":"An extremely dull & painful half-hour was wasted","review":"Before I finally turned it off. I had seen and liked her first thing years ago, so when my gf (a big Cho fan) picked this out I was like \\"okay\\".We watched for about 15 minutes, waiting to laugh or even be slightly amused. No dice. We fast-forwarded; more of the same.The whole show is apparently joke-free and consists of a shrill left-wing political screed using 'newsworthy' events from 2003-2004, interspersed with long silences and Cho making weird faces or staring dully off into space. It was sort of like being forced to watch Bill O'Reilly of Fox News fame, only if you put him in drag and made him into an anarcho-communist somehow.Very annoyingly dull, boring, and pointless. Save your time and money by staying far far away from this! (Note - other anarcho-communists may find the show minutely entertaining, but would probably have a lot more fun by just turning on the news and righteously yelling at the stupidity)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Margaret's Monologue","review":"This performance is not as funny as her first 2 concert films, but it is an improvement on \\"Revolution\\"*. She looks the best - she appears healthy and her outfit is flattering (look Ma - no sweat stains!). The only negative is that her routine is very topical, which may not preserve well over time. Opening act Bruce Daniels (seen as a DVD extra) is pretty funny. [*FYI, \\"Revolution\\" gets one, maybe one & a half stars; I deleted my review and am unable to re-post, but most reviews echo the main point: Margaret is a mess in \\"Revolution\\"]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh...","review":"For all its controversy/political relevance/stereotype-challenging/what have you, \\"Assassin\\" just isn't very funny. It has its moments (\\"Matthew 4:17 - Shut the f*ck up\\" is a winner), but her style is so overbearingly political that it more often than not just seems preachy. Throughout the sets, she alternates between her normal voice and that of a sassy black woman, the only purpose of which is to evoke nervous laughter. Even when she's doing a good joke, it takes about 5 minutes to tell, as she is either waiting for applause or spelling out her material in a condescendingly slow fashion. The funniest parts have nothing whatever to do with the larger political message, leaving one with the feeling that she'd do splendidly with less politically motivated material. We get it - she's Asian, gay, and angry. You won't come away with much more insight than that. For wittier, more playful, and equally political satire, check out Eddie Izzard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know in what world this is plus size","review":"I'm a size 16, and this didn't fit at all on the legs.

The outcome is a warm and ultimately forgiving portrayal of a woman who would have been controversial in any age.

It was not as the title suggested a guide to wild edible & medicinal plants at all. I was greatly disappointed & so was the recipient. I would return it, but it would cost me even more to do so.

Lee combines two favorite ideas in a story of alien contact during WWII. But the alien is really just a McGuffin, and the reader is treated to a tale of Allies, Nazis, Communists, spies and resistance all trying to outfox one another and protect their own ideas. The alien could easily be replaced with a munitions dump, secret weapon, or other typical WWII target without changing the story very much. Good war story but a lousy alien tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one","review":"Sci Fi and WWII don't mix well in this failed effort.

The one draw back is he tells you just about everything else to know. I feel like I know the whole Flames organization. He'll start talking how Theo had a nerve injury when he was little and then he switches to something like how the team mascot go his job. Seening as how I love hockey I don't mind the extra stuff. But for those expecting pure Theo you have been warned. Anyway just reading this book is very insperational. The author does do a good job of telling people that this little guy does not give up. After reading I applied some of what Theo does to my own game. It literally made me want to go out and play some hockey and just have fun and try my hardest. Theo is a truely inspiring character and the author doesn't do a bad job doing that.

I read it out of curiosity. Theo's story will not just warm your heart. It will make you love him, and respect him. So many who have his difficult background use it as an excuse to walk around with a chip on their shoulder. Theo doesn't, he only has a chip on his shoulder on the ice, where it belongs. The author included a lot of other stuff, that sometimes made the book a difficult read, but I'd just turn the pages until he picked up Theo's story again. I liked him to begin with, now I root hard for him, this little dynamo paid his dues, and earned his success. If you only read one book this year, you have to read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The Theo-specific info in this book would make a very nice in-depth magazine article. The book is poorly written, very disjointed. The author introduces a Theo story, and in the next paragraph is telling the history of the food services manager. In one place, I counted 6 pages that included only 1 paragraph of 2 lines about Theo. Theo has an incredible spirit. His story is one of triumph over truly overwhelming odds. He deserved a better effort for what is titled as HIS biography. If you want to know about the GM, coaches (at all levels), security guards, bus drivers, entertainment managers, food service, mascots and ticket sales this is the book for you.

I hesitate to leave electric heating pads turned on when I'm not at home, so my kitty had to go \\"cold\\" turkey whenever I left the house. The SnuggleSafe really does stay warm for 10-12 hours! I don't use the cover that came with it (it's thin and not soft enough). Instead I place the SnuggleSafe underneath a couple of layers of microfiber blankets.

The first time of use, and I suppose when almost cold, my dog moved the blankets away from over one of them and with ease chewed away the filler cap. This was not noticed until I put it back in the microwave to reheat and the gel inside came flooding out. The product may be all right for a cat but not for any kind of dog that still has its teeth and curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard","review":"Our cat sleeps in the basement and the nights had gotten pretty cold, so I ordered this item, not realizing itwas made of hard plastic.

I would not recommend this product...you are much better getting one of those foil warming inserts for pet beds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard and small...not appropriate for larger pets","review":"This product is completely useless for larger animals. It is very thick and hard. I saw it advertised as being placed under bedding with a large dog...but there is no way that anyone could tolerate laying on this thing. It is hard as a rock and small so it is like sleeping with a rock under you. I wish I would have know this before purchasing. It also claims to stay warm for up to 12 hours...but that is misleading. I originally bought this product to use with a medium sized dog that has arthritis as I also saw it advertised for this, and I can't imagine her sleeping on this. The only way that it might work is if I used several layers of bedding which would affect the amount of heat that actually gets through and even then I think it would be uncomfortable.I read one review that claimed they bought this for a pet and ended up using for themself. Find that hard to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last 24 hours","review":"My dog LOVES heat so I thought this would be perfect to put in her cage while we are at work. I buried it underneath the blankets, and had the blue cover over it. She ripped off the blue cover and chewed all the way around the warmer, and punctured it so I can't use it at all.Now I'm stuck with the blue cover, paw print cover, and dog stuffed animal.The warmer is a lot harder than I thought it was, so I can see how some dogs wouldn't find it very comfortable to lay on, but if you use the stuffed animal the heat doesn't go through it very well.The one good thing is I was surprised at how long it stayed warm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant for aged pets.","review":"We have an old pooch, about 20 lb. size, that must sleep in the porch (was never properly house broke) and she loves her Snugglesafe.

By necessity we found out it keeps pots warm on the buffet (fully washed and sanitized, of course). Hubby then wanted one of his own to keep his feet warm while on the computer and now we are purchasing a third for a friend as a gift. Keeps the heat for 10 hours easy. For the cat we had to wrap it in a towel when adding it to her bed as it was too hot - but 10 hours later we pulled the towel off and it was still warm enough for her. Stopped her from waking us up at 4 in the morning because she was cold. Love it! And I should mention our first snugglesafe is about 5 yrs old and still going strong after being heated almost every night during the 5 months of winter. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good foot warmer","review":"I purchased this for an aging cat. He slept on it one time and then decided he didn't like it.

I followed the instructions exactly on timing--no more, no less. The first few times it did not seem to get as warm as after I had heated it several days in a row. DO NOT heat longer than recommended for your microwave. We built an outdoor shelter for kitty out of two Rubbermaid containers, with one smaller than the other and insulated on the inside of the large container with a small round cut out to enter/exit. We taped a towel over the round hole at night time to keep the cold air out, yet kitty can push it aside with her face to get in and out at will. Every evening the Snugglesafe goes into kitty's house with lots of warm blankets and she is snug as a bug in a rug!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Snuggle-safe disc","review":"This product is just what it says it is. It's a Fribee-like disc in a fleece container that you microwave. It doesn't say as warm as long as advertised, but it does stay warm for a number of hours. My animals don't sleep on it as it is hard, but they will sleep near it, which works because the heat radiates if you are close to it. I've used it myself to warm my feet at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for hedgehogs","review":"this is a great product for keeping you hedgehog warm and toasty. it's easy to heat, and with the cover that it comes with on it feels like just the right temperature. I'm not completely sure it stays warm quite as long as the manufacturer claims it will, but it does stay warm for several hours. The only real problem, if you want to call it one, is that if you use wood shavings as a bedding material the cover is like a magnet for them.It is just a pain to get them off the cover so it can be washed. The pad itself is simple to clean and keep clean. This product sure beats heating pads and other electric devices to help keep your little buddy warm and toasty.

He tore a ligament recently and has been hobbling around, so I was hoping the heat would soothe the pain. I ordered this item hoping it would be the solution. While it does retain heat for a long time, it is very hard, and also rather thick, so my cat wasn't comfortable laying on it, no matter how much padding I tried to soften it with. He's also a LARGE cat and this item is smaller than a frisbee, so the size was an issue for its usefulness, as well. I would only suggest use for outdoor applications and small cats who will be much more comfortable and much more in need of heat (outdoors)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cats aren't a fan","review":"The product holds it heaat for a very long time, which is good, but it's extremely hard -- so hard, in fact, that the cats don't like sitting on it.

I was worried about having electrical wires running to/from his bed, so I didn't want to go the heating-pad route. The SnuggleSafe has been a great discovery for both of us! Tucked under the pillowtop of his bed, it provides enough heat to keep him warm all night - he's still very cozy when I let him out of his kennel in the morning. Although I've found I like an extra layer of fabric between me and the SnuggleSafe if I'm using it on my bare skin to ease a muscle ache, I haven't had any problems with my cat being burned or uncomfortably warm on it. I've also found that it's great for warming up cold bedsheets before climbing in at night and my boyfriend wants one for cold mornings in the duck blind when he goes hunting. Great product - lots of uses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flynn just loves this.","review":"A friend recommended these SnuggleSafe heating pads when I brought home my 5 pound Rat Terrier. Even though is is quite cold outside, the crate in his car is toasty warm. He settles right in with a blanket and I hardly hear a peep from him till I reach our destination. Since they stay warm so long, I just plop it in his bed and he can snuggle warm and cozy. I love the covers which protect the product and protect him from getting burned in case the pad is too hot.I would recommend these (at least two of them for every dog owner).Rebecca Campbell"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Works!","review":"I was skeptical that this heating pad would actually stay warm for a full eight hours as the previous reviews said, but it did.

After heating the pad up for 6 minutes (it comes with a sheet that tells you how long to heat depending on your microwave) the pad stayed quite warm for at least 8 hours. My dog will snuggle up to it if I cover it up with blankets but by itself (even with the fleece cover it comes with) it is still pretty hard and apparently unappealing to her. I do wish the pad was a little softer so she would like it more but at least it is sturdy enough that she can't chew it up. The pad does come with its own fleece cover so don't bother buying another one unless you want extra or if they make something thicker and softer to put it inside. If your dog or cat is not picky about what they snuggle up to this is a great item to keep their bed or kennel warm."},{"rating":"2","title":"seat warmer","review":"I purchased this for my husband (not a pet).

I don't think it lives up to what it says. While it is nice and hot after you heat it up ... it seems to lose 90% of the heat within a couple hours and not 12 like they claim.

I'm not exactly sure how long it stays warm (I microwave it when I go to work and when I go to bed) but it is very close to what they claim. The disk is hard even after it is warmed up. I didn't buy the snuggle safe cover which I'm sure would make it much softer but I put a soft blanket on top which works well too.

The first time I heated it up it only stayed hot for a few hours..but the more you use it the better it seems to work & stays warmer longer.3. 12 hrs. of heat is a bit of a stretch. I would say more likely 8-9 hours.4. Although it seems like it would be uncomfortable bc it is hard, my cat seems to be very comfortable when it is in his bed.

I had one we had used for years but I forgot this winter how long to zap it in the microwave. I ended up with a melted hole in the pad and the equivalent of molten lava oozing out. This of course rendered it useless and I had a very angry cat. I'm ordering 2 more so I can have them on rotation as they are such great products and were hard to find.WRITE DOWN YOUR TIME - YOU WILL FORGET NEXT YEAR!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Product was as described and delivered earlier than anticipated. As other reviewers have said, this is a very hard plastic disk and must be placed inside a dog bed so it can be cushioned between the stuffing or placed under a pillow. It definitely heats and the heat will last for several hours. I recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"stays warm for hours","review":"My cat was very suspicious of this at first, not sure why, perhaps because it is hard and not kooshy, so not comfortable to actually sit on. She has gotten used to it, though, if I prop it up vertically NEXT to her and tent a blanket over both her and the warmer, then she seems to really like it. It's also a great back-warmer for you if you need that on occasion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Snuggle safe pet heating pad","review":"This product was exactly what I was looking for. I have a very elderly cat who is just skin and bones now and therefore feels the cold of Canadian winters.

Just pop it into the microwave for the required time and you are all set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puppy is toasty","review":"Our new puppy loves this. It stays warm all night long. Worth the money to comfort the pup in Minnesota in winter.

One was chewed to the point of not being safe to heat and I still can't find the other one. The disks also did not seem to get as hot as claimed, even though I heated them according to the instructions (2 1/2 min using an 1800 watt microwave). I put them in the dog houses at 6:30 am at about 38 degrees outdoor temp. The chewed up disk was stone cold by noon. The product is probably better suited to smaller animals or older dogs who don't chew. My dogs are 3 and 6 yrs old."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is NOT \\"bite resistant!\\"","review":"My 7 month old puppy chewed through the outer covering in about 1 or 2 unattended minutes.

We bought this to put in her bed so that she'd stay warm on cold winter nights -- especially recently where the temps dropped into the 20s. She loves it. We wrapped it in a small fleece blanket since it's hard as a board. It has stayed warm throughout the night and into the morning. I think her body heat helps it retain heat -- there have been times it's still warm in the morning, 12 hours later. Exactly what we wanted and has made the cat very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bed warmer","review":"I bought this to put under the banket of our outside dog. she loves it.

I would recommend it to any pet owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this product!","review":"We have a Netherland Dwarf rabbit and she LOVES this product. We purchased it to help keep her warm during our cold winters here in the midwest. I took everyone else's advice and purchased a second cover so I would always have a clean one on hand.

I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Firm","review":"I thought the SnuggleSafe would be snuggly.

Once I tried it out, it worked very well. It's warm, not hot, when it comes out of the microwave, and stays warm the entire day. My only complaint is that it is rather hard, even with the cover. I have to put a blanket on top of it, then place the dog bed on top of the blanket. Otherwise, my dog won't lay on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cozy for Kitty","review":"I am happy to have purchased this heating pad/disk.

I looked at the wattage on my microwave and heated it at the recommended length of time. it was BARELY warm.... certainly not enough to keep a new puppy warm. I increased the time little by little and stopped trying at 4 minutes, for frear that it would explode. (Instructions are clear that you are not to heat longer than they say). It also said it remains warm for 10 hours. That didn't happen either.Our electricity goes out often and we wanted to be sure the pups stayed warm if that happened. Very disappointed. Even tho the puppies were in our dining room, we would have had a major problem if the electricity went out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Warm In The Winter!!!!!","review":"I love this product. I care for a homeless cat and as winter was approaching I needed to find the BEST way to keep him warm. I purchased a little dog house. I insulated the bottom and sides of the house with Styrofoam. On top of the Styrofoam I placed a quite time pet bed. I heat the SNUGGLESAFE for the appropriate time and slip it under the bed. Its been quite cold here. Many nights have gone below freezing.

Fast paced, exciting and intelligent, it has much more to offer with its depiction of friendship, respect and above all honor. This film was vastly ignored when it played theatrically and that's a shame because it is infinitely superior to the type of fare in this genre being made today. It's one of my all-time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese Mobsters versus Martial Arts Masters, but with a soul....","review":"Wonderfully plotted -- with twists reminiscent of Chinatown -- and beautifully acted, this tale of trust and betrayal, love and obligation encapsulates the spirit of post-WWII Japan and the effects of immersion in a foreign culture on a man (Robert Mitchum). Believing he is doing a favor for an old friend who has run afoul of the Japanese mob (the Yakuza of the title), Robert Mitchum returns to Japan where he re-experiences his love for a Japanese woman, learns of a friend's lies and betrayals, and pays a heavy price for that discovery. Ultimately, this movie is not about violence and death -- although there is enough of it to make Quentin Tarantino proud, or envious -- it is, rather, about duty and obligation (in Japanese, 'giri'), and how one comes to assume a duty or an obligation. A gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Japanese gangster movie !","review":"This is truly one of the best Japanese gangster movies ever made. Robert Mitchum is wonderful. This proves my feeling that if you wait years and years and years the great movies will eventually come out on dvd.

One of Robert Mitchum's best stories.A story of honour."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Yakuza","review":"Excellent story... the characters are believable and the movie has a twist that will break your heart. The actors became the characters. They bring you to Japan and they're way of thinking. The HONOR among the Japanese can be a little overwhelming to the American mind. DEEP!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Neglected Classic","review":"Robert Mitchum had a mini comeback in the 70s with this film and also as Philip Marlowe in Farewell My Lovely. While he was a great-- if old-- Marlowe, this is the better film.Sidney Pollock does his best Howard Hawks impression with this story of world weary macho men, the eager young gun, and a code of honor that must be satisfied-- on both sides.The Yakuza has it all, action, romance, exotic locales and customs, and suspense. The climax is one of the best martial arts sequences in movie history, because while fantastic and very bloody, it keeps its feet on the ground just enough to stay believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent movie about duty, loyalty, and obligation","review":"This is an excellent film. It may be old (1975), but it is the best movie that I've seen that describes duty and obligation and what it means to fulfill an obligation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sequel that Bombs","review":"This was a bit of a disappointment. First, if you were hoping for a coach's principles on leadership in business, go back to the \\"Business\\" section of the bookstore. I understand that by targeting the business world Brad can increase his book sales beyond the sports junkies of the world, but in relating his coaching to other life applications, well...he leaves a bit of a gap.I really enjoyed \\"Winning Ugly\\". In fact, as a tennis player, I found it loaded with great tips (and it even improved my game). But this one is loaded with Brad's \\"good ole days from the tour\\" drivel that is certainly is out of date and more than a bit tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put it back !","review":"This book is disappointing. There is very little that is contained in this book that is worthwhile information to anyone. Brad Gilbert describes (many times) what a great relationship that he has with Andre and Andy and what a great coach he is. There are quotes sprinkled in throughout the book to make it come off that it really is a business type self improvement book, but it isn't even close. Save your money and put the book BACK on the store shelf and put your money BACK into your wallet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Since I am a huge fan of Winning Ugly I bought I've got your back immediately over amazon when it was out (In Switzerland it has not been released yet). I thought like Winning Ugly was advice for players and his second book was more into techniques of coaching. But to my astonishment it was all about Brad, Brad and Brad. All about what great guy he is and what outstanding relationship he has got to Agassi and Roddick. Hey Brad, take a look at Roger Federer who's been without a coach the entire year, in which he won 3 Slams! A coach cannot be that important, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"I was very glad that I borrowed this book from the library and didn't waste any money on it. I skimmed through it and found it to be a huge disappointment for a fan of the series. Ms. Gabaldon must think pretty highly of herself to write a book about writing the 'Outlander' seeries or she just wants to cash in on their popularity."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly organized and redundant","review":"This volume might have been interesting, if not for the fact that certain obvious steps were overlooked -- such as an alphabetical listing of terms. It felt rushed, as if the author is juggling too much. And for a woman who supposedly has advanced degrees in science, the astrological charts are more than a little incongruous. I found the novels interesting and well told, but this is going too far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outlandishly Awful","review":"An uncomplimentary mix of horoscopes, recipes, writing tips, synopses.

Yes, the books are great, but do you really need to know Jamie and Claire's horoscopes, not to mention the minutiae of very minor characters' lives? The books, although lengthy, are not that hard to follow. I'm sure Ms. Gabaldon had fun putting this together, but it smacks of time buying and audience baiting. It's been three years since \\"Drums of Autumn,\\" and despite predictions \\"Fiery Cross\\" is nowhere in sight. If you're an absolute diehard Jamie and Claire fan, this is a must have (and you probably already do).

I enjoyed her personal story about how she got started with the series but other than that I struggled through it. The recommended books section; which was the main reason I purchased this book, was a disappointment. I hated many of the books I picked from the list in the back of the companion. I get the impression that Ms. Gabaldon is very intellectual.

I would recommend this book to any reader who wants a bit more information on the process of writing.

So, my final word to Diana is: Take your time writing these books. It wouldn't be fair to you to have a book published that you were less than happy with.

When you reread each book before the release of each new book, and you have read Outlander 4 times, then you need the Companion. People who aren't true fans of Gabaldon will feel like they've wasted their time and money. It has become a necessity in my library and will be very helpful when I start Outlander for the fith time.

But I'm afraid I don't understand the frenzy around this book. Astrological charts for fictional characters seems rather redundant to me, for example. In fact, I am rather disturbed by the tone of the other reviews. Little to do with constructive commentary and more to do with group hysteria, it seems. I would have prefered Mrs. Gabaldon to write another novel, rather than spend her time on this rather strange documentation for people who are, after all, products of her imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"what a great companion book. with 6 books in the series it nice to be able to use this to look up something that you had forgotten. highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome...brings it ALL back","review":"I am having a great time with this book.

What's on the Web is just a couple of brief samples--a note from the Family Tree section, a snippet of the Methadone List--to let people know what kind of stuff is _in_ the book. She does the same thing for her novels, and I haven't heard anybody complaining about the posting of excerpts from them!Believe me, there's tons of stuff in this book that I don't think anybody could ever find _anywhere_ else!

It's a perfect complement to the Outlander series. I'm so glad that she worked the time into her schedule, to expand on the incredible books she has written. The Companion will tide me by, until The Fiery Cross. I can't begin to articulate how meaningful Herself's writing is to me. However, I can say how grateful I am, for the places she has taken my mind, while reading her books. Her writing lets me visualize the scene, and my own imagination colors it in.

I loved the photos of the places she went to for the information re:the sights she referred to in the novels. That was also interesting. I was hoping for a continuation of the series that was why I was a little disappointed about the actual book with this title.I would not purchase it again however.

Once again, Criterion should have restored the original version, rather than presenting this cut version; anything less violates entirely the spirit of the original film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware- Mutilation of a Classic","review":"This is an abridged version of Clair's 1931 masterpiece, with two key sequences cut, and added to the DVD as \\"extras\\" in beat up 16mm prints, when original nitrate material is readily available. The two sequences in question are the singing flowers who serenade Emile outside the factory; and Emile's quest for romance in a Parisian cafe. All in all, this is about 10 minutes of material! It is impossible to overstate the effect that the elimination of these two scenes has on the film as a whole; it destroys, in large part, much of the magic of the film.On the plus side, the subtitles are vastly superior to any other version available, and the transfer of the feature (minus the cuts) is superb....but with the cuts, you're really not getting the film. Criterion made a serious error with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An oldie returns","review":"I thought about renting this tape for years! before it vanished from blockbuster, then it vanished for years.

I've taped them to the closet doors right behind the chair that I nurse him in and he stares at them continually.

When our babies were little, we had simple waterproof pictures with red, white, and black drawings that we set inside their cribs. I was looking for something similar. These art cards are the nearest thing I could find and they are very cute. They can be hung on the wall or set in a crib or you can simply look at them with a baby, while naming the animals.

I opened the box with my 7-week-old son in one arm and started to show them to him. When I got to the pig card, I found it had a smudge of red fluid on it. Could be ketchup, could be blood, I have no idea. As the cards were marketed and packaged as new (in a plastic-wrapped container), I can't imagine how ketchup would have gotten on them, but regardless of what it was, I certainly don't want it near my newborn.

And the art is absolutely adorable. There are six cards in each pack. Each card is two-sided, with a white-on-black subject on one side, and a black-on-white subject on the other side.My baby is only 6 weeks old, but these have been capturing his attention for the last 1-2 weeks. They are the first toy / learning activity that he has focused on in. We put a few up on the wall next to his changing table, and he stares at the while he is being changed (less crying!). We also use them around his mat at tummy time.Highly recommended. Removing one start just because they're a bit expensive for what they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for newborns","review":"I bought these on the recommendation of a friend whose son is now 9 months for my then 2 mo old (now 3 1/2 months). I was a little put off by the price because for some reason, I thought they were playing card sized, when they arrived they are about the size of a paperback or DVD package, and very sturdy and thick. My son loves to look at these and will follow them with his eyes and by turning his head. I had borrowed some black and white books by Tana Hoban for infants from the library which have solid shapes in black and white and my son couldn't care less about those images.As far as the garden collection, I am sure that it doesn't matter to the baby which set you choose, but you will get use out of these and they seem to be substantial enough to be passed on to another child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way, way overpriced","review":"The cards are large, sturdy, and well drawn. Each animal has its name on the back in a nice cursive font. But there are only SIX cards in the box!!! At $12.95 per set, I should at least get enough cards to fill the Wee Gallery mobile.

Now she only occasionally chews on the corners. Nice idea, great drawings, but nothing special and certainly nothing interesting to my little one. Possibly because she was too old. When she was a newborn we printed out a FREE pdf of black and white shapes and images off the internet that she loved and stared at for ages. Just, FYI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves them","review":"I ordered these cards to put on the wall behind my baby's diaper table. She was 3 weeks at the time, and now she's 8 weeks, and she loves staring at them while I change her. Since they're high contrast, she can easily see them. The reversible cards are thick, and I use sticky putty (Scotch/3M) to change them every few days. I wish more than 6 came in the box though.

I mean there is only 6 cards in a set and once I go through this with him, he is not interested for the 2 second round.

This series does not disappoint especially, with the handbook that comes inside detailing where they got the several types of magic and where they came from. I enjoy dubbed versions better because I can focus more on the animation and often times the translation does not come across. This is an exception. I really enjoyed the japanese cast. This series one and two ( you have to get both) were fun to watch and hit the different magic fields right on.Buy it. It is definitely worth the money.Only problem is that you can either watch it in broadcast order or chronological. Which really didn't make too much sense. Of course, you want to watch it chronologically to get the whole story at once. So, you are constantly switching from one disc to the other. But, It is worth it. Just be patient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb job and suspense","review":"The book starts out a little slow but speeds up after a couple of chapters after their mom gets kidnapped. Most of the suspense is in a wonderland R.V. Park where the two kids meet some friends and explore the shut down park with great anticipation. As the story gets to the last few chapters the kids get chased through the park by a couple of men who kidnapped their mom. Using their skills from exploring the park with their two friends they try to outwit the two men. The author has a lot of suspense through the chase that will keep you reading until the end.

Until she comes back home, they have to live with their uncle in an R.V. park. They are given many clues to find their mother, but this isn't an easy task for the boys of their uncle, and it is always a very dangerous thing to do.I love this book very much. It was very suspenseful and didn't give away too many clues. This book had me guessing until the end. It was hard to stop reading it. I got very attached to the characters in the story.

I found it rather overworked in parts and simply ridiculous in others: e.g., period costumes mixed with bride-of-Frankenstein costumes; Papageno in a duck hat; a pathetically misfired updating of Papagena.I can't fault the voices, orchestra or chorus and especially think Papageno did a fine jo, in spite of the costume that gave him trouble. However, I regret investing in this DVD. I have since seen the Royal Drottingholm Theatre version and find it superior in many ways, even though the sound quality is uneven. I found the Drottingholm enchanting, but the Covent Garden production was so visually cluttered and ill-conceived that it completely detracted from the glorious music and the great voices. Mozart deserves better. And so do opera-lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and positive","review":"To be very short and to the point:I love this recording. I would like a larger DVD opera library, and I would buy more quickly if I believed they were as watchable as this. The disc sounds good. It is fun to watch. The production is modern and thoughful. The staging is surprising and fun. The video editing is somehow appropriate; not that the singers are playing to the camera, but that the camera has been planned for and is not an afterthought. I am completely in love with Keenlyside and Roschmann. In summary, this is a recording that I can easily put in front of people that 'don't like opera', and know that they stand a fine chance of getting the bug!WThompson"},{"rating":"2","title":"It All Works Together on this Disk","review":"Like all works of art, opera is the sum of its parts. Opera joins music, both sung and played, acting, both physical and verbal, costumes, settings, and lighting. A video disk of an opera adds camera work and editing. What I found remarkable about this disk is that the total is greater than the sum of its parts. Yes, there is fine singing and playing. The acting is expressive and appropriate. There are quirky and specific costumes, often funny. Glorious sets (the Masonic set and the sun both stand out). Miraculously the lighting looks fine in the video. I can only assume that the light was stunning to the live audience. Having the light work both recorded and live is not so simple because the human eye and the camera see differently. Everyone who watched this disk with me walked around for a couple of hours happily dazed by our experience, whistling and singing excerpts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it! Get it! Get it now!!","review":"There is no disagreement with any of the reviewers here - this performance blew me away and had me completely enthralled. I bought this recording for simon keenlyside and colin davis, but all the main characters are fantastic.To start with the queen of the night, diana damrau has to be heard and SEEN to be believed..she sings and acts her heart out - this is the most exciting portrayal of the queen I have ever witnessed. Will Hartmann and Dorothea Roschmann are excellent as tamino and pamina, and simon keenlyside is as brilliant and touching as his review in opera news claims.The sets and costumes are marvelously tasteful, the conducting is magnificent, and the performances have you laughing one moment, excited the next, and in delicate ecstacy after that.

Listening to this version, the musicians, singers, conductor, chorus, orchestra are all very good to excellent. The costumes, scenery, and and how the performers act on stage I find strange, dark, and not in keeping with the way I understand Mozart. Even though it could be said that Die Zauberflote is a philosophical theme, I do not see it as a dark piece as this version portrays. My previous experiences of Die Zauberflote on the screen were the Swedish film version and the Metropolitan Opera version, which I liked much better. In the end it depends on one's perception of Mozart's Zauberfloete how a particular version is liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Magic Here","review":"What a disappointment! The movie \\"Amadeus,\\" offered a brief view of what could be done with colorful costuming and imaginative sets. This performance not only lacks any visual excitement, it is positively proletarian drab.

Even if you can't sit and watch the DVD, play it just for the audio!Simon Keenlyside as Papageno made this an excellent choice. His voice is awesome. Being able to see his facial expressions adds to his performance. Something you'd probably miss from most opera house seats. Diana Damrau handles her Queen of Night solos flawlessly.

Unfortunately his largely anecdotal story telling has little serious thought regarding the fundamental reason why high speed rail has a very limited future in the United States. There is a reason why Europe has trains and America has planes. Europe is smaller than America. The distances are shorter. Not only does this make a tremendous difference in travel times but it also makes a huge difference in cost. Vranich completely avoids the cost issue.Not a detail.Each mile of track for one of his supertrains costs between $30 and $50 million. Who is going to pay for his 1000 mile network.

The center of the screen is washed out by distortion in the darker scenes. I had to put my Black Enhancement on High to get it to look decent. Like the old print of BULLITT.

If you can forgive it that it's a pretty decent film. And come to think of it, it has kind of a 'New Hollywood' vibe as well, i.e. early 70s film which often seem more decadently concerned with the artistic value of a film over its box office potential.Actually Night Moves is from '75, but this era of film-making and noir in general seem to have been made for each other.Good performances, and good screenplay writing. The story location's are all over the map but it works. I found the plot interesting as well.. but uh, do pay attention. Gene's in his prime, looking a little like David Crosby. Finally, the ending, while perhaps not initially satisfying on a visceral level, is on reflection very aptly symbolic for its character and the times in general.

It's tough on Hackmans character \\"Harry\\" see 'cause he used to be an NFL player and now he's reduced to being a private eye, she hates it, he does not want to give it up and everyone concerned gets a bad speech.Don't get me wrong, this is no \\"MegaForce\\", where the film is so bad it becomes campy and actually enjoyable.This is just...mediocre.

Hackman gives one of his career-best performances as a world weary P.I. who gets mixed up in a case of battling ex-spouses that quickly descends into the sludgier depths of incest,smuggling and murder. In the meantime,Hackman's own marriage is floundering, and the script cleverly parallels this disintegration with the layers of deception and corruption exposed as he peels away the mystery of his case.

Not nursing anymore, I put mine on before bed when things are a little tender and its supportive enough for the few minutes it takes to wash up, but really it's just for sleeping. When I was nursing, it held the pads and accommodated the gals' changing sizes (C empty, D++ full).

However- the large size fit well. This is the first nursing sleep bra that I am not spilling out of completely. I also purchased one made by motherhood maternity and would not recommend that one for women with larger busts because the front hardly has any elastic at all, and so my breasts fall out any time I bend a little bit. However, just one thing about this Medela bra I don't like- the material is a little thin...I have been wearing it very frequently (3x per week about) and think it might be worn out within a couple of months.

This bra's elastic is not strong enough to stay firmly around my body. For some reason it always slides up when I wear it so the bottom of the bra ends up sitting across my nipples - not very comfortable to wake up to. I think this is a case of a poorly designed bra with not enough elastic, or they mislabeled the size chart on the back. Do not get this bra if you are thinking about it. Madela makes one that resembles a sports bra and clips at the shoulder and is made of a super stretchy material (it is far more comfortable and it works fine for sleeping and nursing).

I washed it a netting bag for delicates and sometimes even handwash. Also the seams are coming undone. I had to use scissors to cut the seams that was starting to fall apart. This is not worth the money since I only got 5-10 uses out of it and it's starting to fall apart.I gave it one star because I like how it is very convenient w/o the clasps. When you have a crying baby you can easily get to the breast w/o the clumsy clasps. It does not hide the breast pad very well. this is definitely something for sleeping not going outside especially if you worn under a thin blouse.Also the sizes run small. I am normally a small and 34A. After pregnancy I did go a size up on normal bras. I first ordered medium but when it came it was so tight around the bust and the back was riding up.

It seems very cheaply made. Also, the sizing seems off. I ordered a large, which should have fit by the sizing chart on the back of the package, but it seemed a little small. Final complaint is that it was a bit too short for me, the elastic being pulled up at the shoulders rather than sitting straight and secure around the bottom, as though the straps are too short. Overall, it just felt a flimsy and thin. I'll be returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bra for large Breasts: No leaking","review":"I purchased two bras with different brands last month. My cup is 36 DD. At the beginning, I like the Lamaze one because its materials make me feel decent and comfortable. After using one month, I switched my opinion. The Medela sleep Bra is better because no milk leaks out during the night when using Medela. I have to wash my bed sheet frequently when using the Lamaze one. So I decided to buy another Medela."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sleeping bra","review":"I purchased 2 of these bras and I have to say that I do not like them one bit. The material is incredibly thin but the worst part is how high it rides up in my back. I am not big chested so it holds my girls in just fine but it drives me crazy how ridiculously high it goes on my back. I am forever tugging it down but it is as though the back is a size extra small and the front is a medium. I would NOT recommend this bra to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed: Really Small for a Large","review":"I ordered a large after I decided the medium wasn't big enough -- and frankly, the medium and large are not very different in size. I'm contemplating trying an extra large. But I'm not sure. The elastic band that goes around my ribcage seems very tight (and I generally wear a 36). Bummer. Finding comfortable bras... Otherwise, the $14 price and the stretchy, light fabric are the upside of this bra."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MUST HAVE for all new moms and breastfeeders, if it fit syou","review":"this only comes max in XL, which is fitting me at 36C barely. i highly recommend this product! it makes your nursing life so much easier! wow. i have 2 of them. pretty expensive tho is only drawback to the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable and Easy!","review":"I wish I could wear this sleeping bra all day long!

I normally wear extra small or small; however, the small was too small. If you order this item order a size larger than you think you need. The lamaze cotton spandex sleep bra for nursing and maternity is comparable price to the medela sleep bra and a much better product.

I'm normally a 36B/C cup and the medium felt super-tight and rode up in the back. I can't imagine sleeping in this or wearing around the house. The elastic was also a bit scratchy. This is a simple bra and it just isn't worth the cheap price. There are better options out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality","review":"This bra did not fit properly, and it did not hold up in the wash.

Don't waste your money! I like the target-gillian brand MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three weeks in use and coming apart","review":"This bra is a waste of money. It is nothing special - yes, can be pulled away for feeding, but so can many other bras. It is a thin material which would be nice for these hot summer nights, except that after a few washes the trimming is already coming off. I doubt the bra will survive more than two months - a rather costly investment for such a short time. Would not buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty useless","review":"I agree with many reviews. There is really no point to this bra. I get more comfort from old navy sleep tanks. There are seams that dig into my sides and poke. Barely any firmness and no support.

The fabric on this is very thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SMALL, even after I exchanged it for a larger size.","review":"I thought this would be a good bra, but both sizes I tried, much bigger than I needed according to the charts and other reviews recommendations, were too tight, too small, and too uncomfortable to wear.

Since the pins don't stand up though the kids don't really pay attention to them.I ended up giving this toy away to someone who had a baby.

Children that young can't bowl, but I suppose some might be able to throw the ball at the pins. The pins and ball are plush and they jingle.

In the end Karl will return, but it may be too late already. Don't want to spoil any surprises for you...The play defitely is a German classic and one of Schillers most famous works.

Next, you get a booklet FULL of ideas that will inspire or increase your understanding of lego building. What's also nice is that the entire set is geared towards creativity. So, the mind of someone working with this set will not be hampered by the models within the instruction manual. Also, the models in the instruction manual range from ridiculously easy to moderate. This is wonderful because a person can look at some of the \\"easier\\" models and come up with improvements or ideas of implementation, thus spurring the creative and engineering process in young people and old.

Horrible. Junk.","review":"Lets be honest about something - babies are messy. They're dirty, especially when they are eating. Food gets everywhere. Strained peas go in the hair. Prunes end up, well, I can't really say where. The problem with this high chair is there are too many cracks and crevices into which little ones can deposit their unwanted dinnertime treats. After one meal, the chair is absolutely filthy and disgusting. Then, once you finally get your child unstrapped, stripped, bathed, rediapered and put to bed, you have to go back to the kitchen and face an unholy, god-awful mess that takes forever to clean, because you have to take the entire chair apart and use toothpicks to pick the strained peaches out.

Trust me, buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"As a mother of two little boys, this high chair has been a huge disappoinment from practically the beginning. First, it is very difficult to clean and has so many nooks and crannies that if you are not ready to wield the Q-tips, it begins to have a smell. Second, the seat cushion ripped near the middle knob. Water collected after you cleaned it, and also if you have a child that throws up, that as well. I decided just to order another seat cushion, thinking it was maybe something I did, and the second one has now ripped. For the price, this high chair is DEFINITELY not worth it. The person who invents a high chair that is one solid piece of plastic and easy to clean will be a billionaire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest.","review":"Now that I have this chair, I'm not going to replace it but I have two major complaints about it. Our son is 20 months old and I still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table. Raising the height doesn't help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you can't scoot the chair in any closer to a table. The chair also has a very large footprint--unless you have a very spacious dining area it's hard maneuvering around it.

I agree with the other reviewers on everything including how hard it is to clean, the tray height, etc. I ended up taking the seat cover off permanently because I was so tired of scraping things out of the crevaces and trying to get underneath it for the food that fell through. The chair is trying to be so high-tech that it forgets that parents need easy, too!! I have had to clean the chair with a toothpick to get the food out of all the little cracks and crevaces. I am a clean person and I think that my son is relatively self-controlled when it comes to food mess .... but there isn't a child clean enough for this chair!!

(I must do this EVERY time; VERY annoying.) Also, the tan leather doesn't seem to be as \\"pretty\\" as when we first bought it; it looks kind'f grungy (sp.) now even though I clean it all the time.I do like the fact that the seat raises up and down and also reclines, but many of the cheaper highchairs do this as well.I will not be buying this chair for my 3 month old.

Looks lovely, mine is pale blue and lime green, but is infuriating to clean. I have never seen more cracks, crevices, screw holes, all where baby food and slobber collect. After one feeding with my hyper 7 month-old the chair is beyond filthy. You will need to buy toothpicks to get in all the crevices. A friend of mine has a Fisher-Price high chair which is much less complicated and easier to clean. The price is insane (glad mine was free). I would never buy this chair even as a gift. I would advise anyone considering this chair to go with something cheaper and easier to clean. I would give it zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"nightmare to clean!","review":"We had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes. I am not a neat freek in any way shape or form. But you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny. If i had to buy another chair I would get a wood one. We have the Eddie Bauer booster now that our son is older. We clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week.The Prima Pappa is comfortable and secure. In the end I realized that we didn't need all the bells and whistles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money!","review":"I am very disappointed in this high chair and we own 2!

Also the cost of the doll head with the clamp was cheaper than buying just the doll head at a local beauty supply store. Upon receiving the doll head, the hair length was not as long as shown in the picture, the hair length is uneven throughout the ENTIRE head. There are very short layers around the parameter and even shorter pieces and layers inside and throughout the rest of the hair. The hair is very coarse. I ended up having to purchase a new doll head anyway. So I spent $30 on a table clamp and another $30 for a GOOD dollhead.

However, the clamps are excellent. These are good for hair cutting classes only."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fair had.","review":"The reviews I've red are accurate, I purchase this doll head to practice hair cutting and is so difficult even to section the hair, because it comes with different lengths of hair all over the head. The hair is coarse but natural, and after many shampoos, hair treatments, and few hair cuts, now with few inches less that hair looks healthy and shiny.Now if you want to take a challenge this is a good head.

Huh?I remember reading the description, and imagnined that the students were going to rush forward and support the Brendan Fraser character, as he's about to get kicked out, for cheating? Huh? Nobody showed support? It was just a sad story, with no real feeling. I actually disliked it more than I learned from it. Every direction he turned there was no support.

The first time I listened to it, I wondered who the drummer was, as he was sounding pretty good. It's none other than Nick Mason sounding much jazzier than Pink Floyd ever let him be.

The mother's body is found badly broken and Phryne agrees to find the killer. Additional, Phryne rescues a young girl who has lost her memory.I've said it before, but Phryne is who I'd like to be when I grow up; beautiful, smart, tough, independent, fashionable, wealthy but mindful of her poor beginnings and willing to help those who truly are in need.

These are slightly over the top, just plain fun books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder on the Ballarat Train","review":"Dismally un-engrossing, with cardboard characters and an improbable plot.

Not that I was expecting War and Peace, mind you, but I was certainly expecting more than what I got. Based on very little evidence AT ALL and with every scintella of evidence pointing directly at only one suspect (and glaringly obviously so) we know who the murderer is almost upon the first mention of him in the book. Characters are physically well-described, however their personalities are flat and one-dimensional. No one in the book dares question or challenge the main character - all are enamored of her including any and all law enforcement types. Her romance with a young man she has just met is not germaine to the story line and yet it fills up page after page after page. Sorry, it's just not a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable mysteries","review":"The Phryne Fisher series is great fun and a good read.

Why must Christians, or Moslems or whatever group of people need to make such a work of entertainment their own or pass their blessings upon it?...The notion that magic is vestigial in these works is simply ridiculous.

The book has helped me re-frame my thinking about myself, my job, and my relationships. Even more important, I have taken this new way of thinking and have applied it to my actions. As a result, I feel more equipped to face challenges, accomplish goals, and experience lasting joy. I often find myself passing along the wisdom found in the book to my friends, colleagues, and family members when they come to me with their own challenges.I have often been skeptical of \\"self-help\\" books, but Living with Intention is a practical manual that I couldn't have done without.

Seriously. This book is only 116 pages, and heavily illustrated. Many of the illustrations are not captioned, so I have no idea what they are for (other than general artistic photos of lips, lipstick tubes or women applying lipstick); and the book ends on a strange note, almost as if it were in the middle of a paragraph. I kept checking to see if pages had been torn out by some previous library patron. There's not too much about the history of lipstick per se - there's a lot of talk about how lipstick 'empowers' women and a lot of talk about how sexually suggestive lipstick is (the tube, not the actual product), and a few names of classic (now discontinued) lipstick shades or ad campaigns that were bombshells in the day. But otherwise, this is really something you might browse through at a doctor's office, not a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too deep, but a fun, interesting read","review":"While this book isn't a thesis on lipstick or the cultural significance of lipstick, it is a light, informative read on where lipstick came from and how it's evolved over the years. I found the facts about what ingredients used to go into lipstick fascinating, and the book is filled with interesting factoids such as how to say 'lipstick' in several different languages. The photos are great---the old cosmetics ads are a hoot!---and the book is written in a light, breezy style that makes it easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most believable Hamlet","review":"I teach Shakespeare classes to adults and have a personal collection of seven VHS and DVD versions of Hamlet. Campbell Scott is by far the most believable, and my students have chosen it as their favorite version. Claudius is pefect--a smiling smiling villain absolutely capable of secucing his sister-in-law and murdering his brother. The casting of Polonius, Ophelia and Laertes worked well. The second choice of my students is the Mel Gibson, which had been number one until they saw Campbell Scott. The scene in the room where they have stored away all reminders of the old king is brilliant. Great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the meter and poetry?","review":"I found this production to totally flatten out the music of the lines. It had some interesting casting choices and a couple of good moments, but overall I found this production lacking life or drive. I have eight different Hamlets (Olivier,Burton, Brannaugh,Gibson, Jacobi, Williamson, Hawke, and finally Cambell Scott) on video and this is ranks toward the bottom. Only Ethan Hawke's Hamlet do I like less. If you want to see a good American performance of Hamlet, then watch Kevin Kline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Wait for the Kenneth Branaugh version of Hamlet. Although the Campbell Scott version has its good moments, generally it lacks energy. The sword play is so reserved that it gives the impression that the actors didn't want to hurt each other. If you're really interested in buying this version of Hamlet, borrow it from the library first. You may find my copy there soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Ok, first off, what in the world is up with the bongos and other crappy background music? It just doesn't fit in with the Shakespearian play at all. I can understand perhaps using a little rock music if you want a bit of a modern twist, but the slow jazz music and cheap-sounding piano really downplay all the emotional scenes. The movie wasn't affecting at all. And some of the acting was really crappy. I couldn't feel any sparks between Hamlet and Ophelia and the last scene was so anti-climatic. The swordfight was made too light of a matter - it just seemed as though they were just practicing or entertaining the court. This was the first time I ever saw Hamlet acted out (I had to watch this for a class) and I really like the play, so I was highly disappointed. I swear, you could find more entertainment in just reading the orginal Shakepeare script than watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Compelling Drama","review":"This version of Hamlet does not seek to capture the soaring poetry of Shakespeare's language. Delivery of lines is, instead, clear and thoughtful, so that the viewer is truly confronted with the struggle of the characters themselves. One can almost forget that he is listening to Shakespeare at all. The time period in which it is set works very well, and the sets and costumes are wonderfully effective, but nothing calls attention to itself. What one encounters is simply the compelling drama of Hamlet. It does not take the place of every other Hamlet, but it certainly holds its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"This band just keeps getting better","review":"How funny, I bought The New Pornographers newest album Twin Cinema first and was immediately hooked and amazed by that sublime cd. So I plunked down my money for their debut album Mass Romantic thinking I'd get more of the same and was underwhelmed. It didn't hit me right off, so I put it away for a while and have since come back to it. While it's not as immediately powerful as Twin Cinema, it's really grown on me and is a very good album in its own right. Mass Romantic is punchy, emotional with a wonderful sense for mining the best of rocks past such as the Beach Boys and The Who while maintaining it's own character. It's structurally simpler, less original and not as well-recorded as Twin Cinema, yet there's a lot to like about this cd. For one thing the wonderful singing and melodies.

I'm very curious about the other bands the guys are in, because this record rocks and has more great hooks than a fisherman's expo.Some of the critiques on here mention folks who are Neko Case fans not liking this record; it's very different from her solo records, but not too far removed from the bouncy pop-punk she made while playing drums in Maow.

Actually, she only appears on the first cut, which, not surprisingly, is the best thing here. It's not that the music itself is bad--kind of a Green Day meets Cheap Trick---there is just way too much going on here. Too many hooks jammed into too few spaces. After about halfway through I was desperately hoping for, oh, a slow song to provide relief, but there was none. Way too jarring and claustrophobic for repeated listenings. Sort of like the Boomtown Rats on crystal meth."},{"rating":"1","title":"a forgettable stinker","review":"I think this CD was on my recommendations list. That will teach me to buy something without listening to it first. Ugh.I've been playing this disc on repeat and so far I can't remember a single tune.

Do they really expect me to care about anything they're singing about? \\"Mass Romantic\\" epitomizes banality.Did I say the vocals where nothing special?

Unfortunately, this is not a Neko Case album. While her songs have something to say, these songs are trite and ridiculous. Furthermore, the production values are terrible.

It was supposed to give us insight into the 1920's era. It just made me bored. There was no plot that made me even the slight bit interested in what was to come or in any of the characters. The entire world in Babbit was made up of a bunch of conformists who wasted their lives. If you want a story about not conforming and without a plot, read Joseph Heller's Catch-22.

I bored all of my friends and my wife to tears telling them about this book that I was reading that was written in the 1920's (I'm guessing it was written in the 20's), and how relevant it was to our society today. It has pompous businessmen, evangelical conmen, hypocrital churchmen, and many more contemporary characters. One note to potential readers: This is a portrait of a person; it's not a thriller, or a romance or a mystery. As such, it has very little plot, so beware. But for readers who wish to try this book, and read it as a study of a class of people, most will find it very rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"How down to earth","review":"I am so glad read this book before I read Freedom From Fear.

But Babbitt is a fine novel. H.G. Wells said of it: \\"I wish I could have written Babbitt.\\" It's a novel about George F. Babbitt and the city he lives in, Zenith. Some of the greatest lines in the book are descriptions of Zenith, not the least of which is the opening lines. Lewis creates in Babbitt the total conformist and we follow him through his conformity and into thinking on his own. Babbitt is simply a man who wants to be liked by everyone. Babbitt gives expression to the glibness and irresponsibility of the professional social climber. Lewis gives us one of our modern classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drab","review":"This book was utterly boring. It is a cutesy attempt at satire, only the entire time, I kept thinking, \\"Edith Wharton did it better.\\" The problem with Lewis's version of what a satire is is that satire is supposed to be subtle; outright criticism of the characters and lifestyles is almost insulting to the reader's intellect.The other issue I have with Babbitt is its long-winding lead-up, unsatisfying climax, and disappointing denouement. The plot took too long to manifest itself, and this was largely due to Lewis's incisions of \\"clever\\" critique into the narrative.As a short story, this novel would've worked out brilliantly. However, spanning three hundred pages as it is, it's a long, drab waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read - a great Socialist work.","review":"This book is especially powerful if read immediately before or after reading Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. Where Rand promotes the virtues of Capitalism, Lewis promotes the virtures of Socialism. This is an fascinating comparative reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only gets good near the end","review":"A one-joke book for three-quarters of the novel, satirizing the bourgeois conservative customs and morality of '20s business culture (a joke that could play equally well in the '50s). As such, a crushing failure, that wallows in its own too-unsubtle unsubtle humor. But then suddenly, with less than a hundred pages to go, the book suddenly gets good--very good, as Babbitt is confronted with a mid-life crisis. Novel gains an entire star for its thoughtful and sensitive treatment, that manages, with powerful irony, to manipulate the reader into hoping that Babbitt will return to his unthinking conservatism. 2 1/2 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"One dimesional elitism.","review":"I picked this up after reading Arrowsmith (which I enjoyed) but didn't finish it. I enjoy French and Russian lit with its long and deep analysis of almost every detail and this book would stand in stark contrast to most of my favorites. Babbit (the book and the character) is almost completely one dimensional. It reads more like a pamphlet than it does a novel. I t reminds me of current cable news - business is bad, industry is bad, and the making of money through business is bad. All is bad, bad, bad, except for the poor peasant who tills the soil to earn his bread. I finally put it down without finishing it. The sarcasm and elitism did me in. Thank God for Hemingway."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not involving","review":"From the jacket cover, Babbit would seem to be a highly provocative novel about the true nature of the American dream. While it is about the American dream, the book seems to run only on one joke: Babbit's rampant materialism. This joke wears thin within the first 30 pages, and the reading the 400 more pages is a tedious task."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this","review":"Quite a delightful and enlightening story about Mr. Babbitt, a family man, man about town and business man.

Babbitt is.","review":"I just spent fourteen hours over the last couple of weeks with George F. Babbitt, listening to the audio version of Babbitt. I wouldn't recommend his company to anyone. He is a joiner, follower, flaky, unreliable and a man of no agency. Things happen to him and he acts or reacts trying to sound out what he thinks others might think best of him.George F. Babbitt is not my friend, no matter how much time I have spent with him recently. I wouldn't suspect you want to be his friend either. I suppose that this is a credit to what I think of your character. As for Babbitt though, he is an interesting character, but I don't know if Lewis created a new archetype or just adapted one. I think this is a triumph no matter, as he created a character sketch that is effective but never defines the character.I still don't know who George F. Babbitt is, do you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read this book a dozen times","review":"A delicious bon-bon of a book, stuffed full of the details of everyday life that are wonderful to savor. This is the real stuff! The thoughts of a man shaving in the morning, the conversations of travelers in the smoking car of pullman trains, the rigmarole that a whole household goes through just to impress dinner guests, the restless irritation of listening to a pointless sermon on a Sunday morning, the inevitable malaise accompanying a tawdry affair - a treasure trove of ordinary sentiment and a document of its time.

First of all, it includes the test. This is a forced-choice, thorough test which took me almost a week to complete (the reason being the questions are hard! After 20 or so questions I felt exhausted). After that there is a small section on each of the types.The info of your type is short but amazing. There are diamonds of information and I read it over and over again, each time finding something new.You can, also, \\"try to type\\" the people in your life, although this is not really accurate.My only negative would be that after finishing it I felt it could have contained more information on each of the types, and thus making this a more complete book.

Whole sections appear to be reprinted photocopies of documents from other sources.There were two useful sections, however. There was a section that listed the licensing requirements for claims adjusters by state. I have been unable to locate this information any where else. However, I can't verify the accuracy of the information. The other useful section gave a list of job titles which cover the duties and responsibilities of a claims examiner.

The ghetto set alone, the seed of great martial artists, is very reminiscent of \\"Dead End\\"/\\"Full Metal Jacket' with jarring delight.Wonderful to see good use of mature actors as martial artists.It also captures the exhilarating wish you find in \\"Life Is Beautiful,\\" that life can be redemptive and inspirational.

They did a very good job in blending the moves together seemlessly.As far as the plot goes, it is fairly well done. You don't really know for sure what's going on at first, although there are plent of hints, but eventually about half way through the plot you'll figure out what's going to happen at the end.

Does have some of the quirky Chinese moments in it that some Westerners might not get, but who cares! Stephen Chow and the cast are very funny and the fight sequences are a mix of old school 70's kung fu mixed in with cgi and wire work, and it works wonderfully!Some of the CGI is kinda shotty IMHO, plain awful at times, but...if you can ignore that, then the rest of the film is perfect. The love story angle isn't too contrived and the ending is nicely done and cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, Terrible access","review":"By far one of the greatest martial arts movies of all time, but having the only viewing option as \\"streaming\\" , rather than being able to download and watch without pixelation from streaming, has convinced me to NEVER buy a movie through amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail","review":"The movie was only 3/4 of the way burned to the disc. I know it's a good movie since I have seen it on DVD before but this vendor did a poor job in description. Who wants 3/4 of a movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a cool Flick.","review":"A nice mix of Kill Bill and Hotshots.I have watched thousands of movies, reviewed hundreds on amazon or otherwise, and can honestly say that Kung fu Hustle made me laugh like no other.Seriously, I could go into the plot, which is more or less an excuse for more awesome acrobatic achievements of excellence, but Kung fu hustle is about the prat-falls. It's Flat out hilarious. Never have I laughed for the duration of an entire film.It seems that Bruce Lee and the Wachowski's have finally met the Anamaniacs. Support the cause, go see it, then tell your friends. Kung fu Hustle is a fantastically unique bit of coolness. ~saos~"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't possibly squeeze any more fun into a movie...","review":"Layered, interesting, funny, and full of action, nothing is quite as this appears in this crazy non-stop kung fu action movie. During a time of economic crisis the Ax Gang takes control of most of 'China' in the 40s.. the story seemingly focuses on the plight of one particular impoverished ghetto 'Pig Sty Alley'.The genius of the movie is how the focus constantly shifts, the references to other classic movies, brilliant camera work, and brilliant action sequences. A must have for Stephen Chow fans, and if you've never heard of Chow but love comedy/action/martial arts movies.. this is something you NEED to see.The Blu-Ray disc is phenomenal to watch (repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"audio options","review":"I bought my fullscreen DVD at Hollywood video, and it had two Chinese audio options (Mandarin/Cantonese) and English dubbed (hilarious) as well as some Euro language (Probably French). It should be the same version Amazon is selling...not sure why it wouldnt be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious! Great Score!","review":"I loved the musical score... it was so well put together! American directors could learn something from them! Also, it was hilarious... the physical comedy is great, and the acting is superb.*****"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I enjoy all types of movies, especially comedy and horror and I have a lot of movies that I enjoy enough to watch again and again. Kung Fu Hustle was so awful I couldn't even get thru one viewing. After about 30 minutes of no entertainment at all I turned it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"technically brilliant but empty","review":"There are some pretty breathtaking special effects and handsome cast members but in the end this is a film all about virtuosity and technical brilliance at the expense of anything remotely meaningful.if you have an appetite for violence/orient,but want something deeper check out 'House of the flying Daggers' or 'Ong Bak'"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fu That Failed","review":"Kung Fu Hustle is a really cheezy movie, with a bunch of badly acted stereotype characters. The Voiceover work is horrible, and only barely can be interpreted as being the same dialogue as the subtitles show (and probably even worse from the original chinese).Despite claims to the contrary, it is not 'Crouching Tiger meets Looney Tunes'. The plot is nowhere as complex as a Bugs Bunny cartoon, there are scenes that seem to have nothing to do with the plotline at all, and some of the characters (especially the gay characters) are so ridiculously inslulting as to annoy me to an extreme. The Kung Fu was also pretty bad, the over use of wire work for humor side downright boring, and the reasoning behind what was going on even more ridiculous.There's a point where funny becomes ludicrous and unacceptable... where I lose interest and can't regain it. This movie went there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite hilarious...","review":"But plain stupid, and exagerated. Stephen Chow can do better than that. More storyline please!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be kidding.","review":"I must've missed the meeting on this one. This thing is so profoundly dreadful, I can hardly formulate a comment....but I will. \\"It\\" was recommended to me by a workmate who just loved it. The critics loved it. You may love it. In my opinion, this movie is so bad on so many levels that it seems improbable that anyone could find anything to appreciate in it. Yet there it is. If you choose to indulge in this vulgar, silly, low vibrational waste and end up enjoying it, then I strongly recommend that you re-evaluate your life mission and do some serious soul searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST PRAIN REDICUROUS!","review":"Some of the visuals were good, but it got boring after 30 minutes. Why people would give this four or five stars, makes absolutely no sense! I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most creative and funny ...Kung Fu movie ever","review":"This movie has a good balance of action and humor wrapped inside of it. If you're expecting a serious kung fu flick like Hero or Crouching tiger, this isn't it. But that isn't to say that the action scenes in this movie are not up to parr with the others. The fight scenes are surprising and well choreographed.If you are a fan of the director Steven Chow and his movies like \\"God of Cookery\\" and \\"Shaolin Soccer\\", you will definately enjoy this movie. If you are a Jackie Chan fan, you'll probably like this movie as well, since it's done in a Buster Keaton/Looney Tunes type style. In comparison to the other Steven Chow movies, this one is a little more violent at times. This is good to keep in mind if you're going to watch it with young children.In addition to this,it also has a good story line and some very heart-warming scenes. I would rate this as one of the best Kung-Fu Parody movies ever made. Plus, you'll laugh until it hurts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A whacky good time","review":"Kun-fu Hustle is a fun martial arts comedy. With how cartoonish it can be, I guess you can call it a fantasy as well. Even if you are tired of Kun-fu movies you should be entertained by this movie. It has the style of an old black and white movie in some ways. It sort of reminded me of a Buster Keaton movie is some ways. I mean by the comedy, not the martial arts of course.You have a lady with curlers in her hair that can run as fast as the road runner and who's main power is her screaming. Also scrawny looking guys who are really great warriors. One of the funniset scenes takes place when Stephen Chow challenges some town people to a fight. He wants to prove himself worthy to a badass gang. Anyway each person he chooses that look wimpy turn out to be covered in muscles. Even a little kid that he challenges, is ripped. The movie is great fun and good for a laugh even if the final battle is overly silly and not as funny as it could've been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kung Fu Hustle 4 stars !","review":"Kung Fu Hustle is a good movie.It's very creative and comparable to a superhero movie.Some actors in the movie hold powerful martial art skills.It adds great comedy that's very orignal and even includes dances on a couple scenes.All I have to say is I liked it , good effects \\"for the most part\\" and entertaining to watch.If you like Kung Fu movies then pick up or rent Ong-Bak :The Thai Warrior\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just wonderful in every way!","review":"From Tango dancing Ax murderers, a Kung Fu reincarnation of Paris & Helen of Troy to deadly martial arts musicians, this movie never stopped enchanting me.I never stopped laughing. If you want to see a perfect send up of all the wire fu movies of recent years(chinese and american) then see this movie. It also has a strange and beautiful love story at it's center.Just see it, you won't regret it. I will definately put this on the must buy list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie","review":"This movie wasn't what I expected, it was much better.

Worth having if you don't already own it on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun...Funny...Hilarious! Buy It!","review":"Ok...if you're ever blue and need a jump start on a change of state, put this DVD in. This movie is well done. The martial arts are good. The villians, comical.And the story flows.I really enjoyed this movie and own it - I bought it INSTEAD of going to the movies and watching it first. There was something that just attracted me to it.I'm glad I wasn't wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offbeat and Fun","review":"How do you describe a film with the slapstick of the stooges, the moves of a Bruce Lee? Frankly you don't, you just watch it and enjoy.The plot of this picture takes quite a few twists and turns, you never really know where it is going until the very end.The writing is simply awesome, and Chow is at the top of his game but it is Qiu Yuen far removed from her days as a kung-fu teenager in the Man with the Golden Gun who makes this film.The knife throwing scene is worth the price of the film alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"This is a funny, quirky, family style comedy that can be a bit violent at times but most of the violence is forgivable by way of a laughable predicament that the two main losers get themselves into. With the supporting cast and the high paced action followed by insane thought out story lines this movie is one that you can watch over and over. There are a couple of suggestive scenes but they are done in true Asian fashion with little crudeness. So if you have little one watching it should be o.k. as long you don't mind them watching someone getting smacked over and over or a bit of minor cursing."},{"rating":"2","title":"kungfu hustle axe kickin edition","review":"its a funny movie for a spoof. great effects,great action, if you like silly movies this ones good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fat Lady really can sing!","review":"Loved this movie. Went in not knowing what to expect and left a very happy movie goer. This flick has it all, Comedy, Drama, Action, Spirituality. Most memorable scenes are the Fat Lady chasing Sing and then the ulitimate battle between Helen of Troy, Paris & The Beast. Great special effects and wild imagery. Have watched it multiple times, since then and it keeps getting better. Liked it so much, purchased Shaolin Soccer (which pales in comparison). Have highly recommended it to others.

So what you have now is an R rated version that is not the theatrical version. Just so you know..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Gem from Chow, but....","review":"Kung Fu Hustle is again a wonderful & just plain amazing film from writer/director Stephen Chow. However, this American release by Sony Pictures Classic is horrendous as they censored & edited some scenes heavily in order to make it look perhaps more slap-sticky /or family-friendly.It's an R. Yet the higher ups in the studios think that Americans can't handle a real uncensored release...so they censor and don't tell anyone.This IS censored & edited. Avoid if you don't agree with big studios censoring artists works.

After the 2nd time I watched it, (first time I fell asleep) I really liked the movie. Because I fell asleep the first I missed alot of storyline and when I woke back up, I didn't think it was that great, but I gave it another chance and really enjoyed this movie. It is dubbed in English or you can just read subtitles, but you will miss a lot of the movie while you are reading. The actions is great and made to be over done but that's what makes this movie cool. It's like watching a cartoon knowing that real people would never survive half the things that happen to the people in this movie, but we accept it because it is funny to see what happens to them, just like in a cartoon. I didn't care too much for the axe gang dancing around, I thought that was kinda dumb, but I did really enjoy this movie. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick Ass","review":"This movie kicked ass.I've seen alot of kung fu flicks and this one is my new favorite.This movie was far better than Stephen Chow's last film Shaolin Soccer.Even some of the cast from that movie star in this one but they have smaller parts and are mostly upstaged by the kung fu masters who have incredible fighting techniques.There was also alot of comedy which I enjoyed.Overall I'd say this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNIEST FILM OF THE YEAR","review":"This is one of the best films so far this year (2005)..Brilliantly entertaining..."},{"rating":"2","title":"second time viewed","review":"loved it first time, I liked it this time. guess it has kind of grown old over the years..like me"},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal","review":"I havent had much opportunity to use it yet but I'm happy with my purchase and the price I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Calculator!!!","review":"Super Great Calculator, it makes my job a lot easier to get the right length of my rafters and hips...It's very practical.... totally recommended 100%"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid too Much","review":"I purchased this to replace a broken Pocket Handyman IV.

The build quality isn't as good. The regular cokin adapter has nice rounded edges. This adapter looks like it was cut w/ a sharp blade on the front (including the sharp edges) but is slightly different in the back; I fixed the sharp edges w/ sandpaper :-)I wish someone would make an inexpensive alternative wide angle adapter that goes closer to the lens w/o needing to buy an expensive $70 Lee filter holder..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stops most vignetting on wide lenses","review":"I've got the standard holder and the wide angle holder. I use a Nikon D300 - the crop factor and angles will be different with non-Nikon cameras and with FX Nikon cameras. The standard holder vignettes badly on my Tokina 12-24 until 14-15mm. The Wide angle holder shows just a tiny hint of corner vignetting at 12mm.I use both the standard and wide holders. The standard holder accomodates up to 3 grad filters - and I often use two. But for wide angle images the vignetting was a problem, and the wide angle holder resolves most of that issue.The holder will vary with other lenses. It depends on whether the design is for FX or DX format, the camera manufacturer, and the specific lens design. My coments related to this specific combination only.Workmanship is fine. The holder is durable and cheap to replace if ever lost or damaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy","review":"I love the toy.

We have given these toys to grand kids ages 3 to 5 and they have always been a top hit. The size is perfect for little hands. The joy of taking apart and putting together in different shapes is a big hit, but the biggest draw seems to be how FAST they go, even over carpet.

This is just an awesome concert video. I've been a fan of Rush for a very long time (circa 1980), but most of my friends at the time were more into the Metal Bands, so never found someone to go to concert. When I got to college I made friends with plenty of Rush fans, but as is the case in college money was lacking when it came time to buy tickets. Well, thank god for Rock Band. Rock Band introduced my son to his first Rush song, and I introduced him to the rest. So, last summer I took my son (age 10) to his first concert, which happened to be my first Rush concert. The best concert that I have ever been to (mad at myself for waiting so long to get to a Rush concert). My son still talks about it. The setlist they played was almost identical to the one played on the Blu-Ray. Watching the Blu-Ray is like reliving the concert over and over again for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmmm Rush live...","review":"Great quality for audio and video.

Great to see the trio doing what they do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is Never Too Much.........","review":"I totally agree that this can confidently be rated a 5 before we even see it. True RUSH fans know it will be perfect. Every time I have gotten wind of a live DVD over the past six or seven years I get a little nervous. I fear that the powers that be will think there is too much live stuff coming out. Naturally there are going to be repeated songs. Anyway, from 1977 to 1997 I never missed seeing them live on their tours. Then I got sick and am now unable to go to the concerts. The fact that they have released a DVD of the concerts I have missed is fantastic. I just hope that continues, after the next tour another live DVD. True Rush fans will never tire of seeing the greatest musicians hitting the stage today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live Blu-ray","review":"Been a fan for years and I don't have any Concert Blu-ray's to compare. I read dozens of reviews before investing in this one to be disapointed. Maybe I was expected to be blow away. The picture looked crisp for a live concert. The sound seemed to be weak. What can I say other than I kept looking for other settings on my Denon to improve the sound. Something I never do when surfing the concert channels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this is awful!","review":"What an awful band. After this, I want to \\"Rush\\" to the nearest toilet and barf! LOL! That Geddy Li guy sounds like he's been sucking on way too many helium balloons, he sounds like a chipmunk! The drummer, Neil Pearl or something, is horrible. He only plays in 4/4 rhythm! He should take a cue or two from Lars Ulrich from the St. Anger album. Not to mention the lame guitar work and inaudible bass. Skip this generic classic rock junk and stick with the masters like Britney Spears."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"By Far the best concert BluRay you will ever own. Sound quality is mind boggling. The concert footage is crystal clear. I've been to 12 RUSH concerts and this is as close to the real thing as you will get. ASTONISHING!!! Play it loud, it just gets better. The better the equipment the better the experience. The camera angles around Getty, Alex and especially Niel are fanominal. If you have any interest in RUSH buy it.

This is particularly noticeable when watching Neil hit the snare drum. When the audio and video are out of sync, it completely ruins the viewing experience for me. I own about 20 concert Blu Ray discs, and haven't noticed this problem with the other concerts, so it appears to be just poor editing on the part of the folks who edited this particular show. Inexcusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Rush concert DVD or video ever!!!","review":"This is by far Rush's best concert DVD.The picture is clear and sharp and the sound quality is outstanding.I saw them twice on this 2007-2008 tour and this captures the band just as I saw them.For me or any Rush fan it will be a great momento for years to come as a reminder of how great these shows were.If your a Rush fans, or just a fan of great rock music done by one of rock's most talented, and underated bands (by the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame) get this disc!It's awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The guy responsible for mixing the sound should be shot.","review":"Great band, great performance, great music! All are wasted under a very very overcompressed audio mix...which may be why the bass sounds so thin. No actual dynamic range, everything is way loud...all the same volume...sucks the life and emotion out of the music. Might as well have used MP3 for mastering. DTS Master Audio...what a waste of MA!

Before you buy this book, I suggest you do some research on the author at Wikipedia or your favorite search engine.While I think in general knowing a little self defense is important, learning it from this book is likely to get you hurt or killed. Should you actually need to defend yourself, the training offered in this book is of little to no value when it comes to fighting or self-defense...but looks really cool showing off to friends who don't know any better.In today's litigious society, I wouldnt be surprised if someone actually tried these techniques in a real-world application, got hurt..and sued Mr. Elmore.Mr. Elmore should actually learn how to fight, and show that his techniques will work before anyone will take him seriously.I won't comment on the section about homeless people, as it has absolutely nothing to do with self defense...merely Mr. Elmore attempting some sort of social commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short of Experience, Empty Head","review":"One of the most inspiring martial arts books on the market.

Do some research on this author before you consider purchasing this book.This book is akin to the Dummies series of books except for the fact that the authors of the Dummies books generally have expertise in the given subject area they are writing about. Mr. Elmore claims no such expertise but espouses his right to do so based on his ability to communicate with an average person because he is himself average.Again, research the author before you consider buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocrity","review":"The book isn't written poorly, what is substandard is the fact that the authordoesn't know what he is talking about from a martial art perspective. By his own admissions he doesn't hold rank in any art, nor has he trained for any significant amount of time. He calls himself an 'average' person, sharing his knowledge, if it can be called that, with others who know even less. This is a case of the blind man leading the blind.It is one thing if someone researches a subject and then publishes the knowledge gained, but in this case, the subject matter has not been researched, nor has it been tested and found to be a system of proven techniques. Let the buyer beware, you would be better off watching the Karate Kid and doing Crane Kicks than to buy this book of fantasy martial arts."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many accounts can Phil Elmore make to bump his stars up?","review":"Don't be fooled. This book is a dog.Doesnt matter how many accounts Phil makes to write his own reviews.Anyone who thinks that someone who looks like they never got off the couch with that bag of potato chips, with no training in self defense,can write a book on it is fooling themselves. Claiming that hes just an average guy trying to promote no-nonsense self defense is rediculous.

This many has no real training, no real experience, no real first hand knowledge of any martial art barring his failed years at Wing Chun.Which is the point. If someone inferred that they had 15 years of experience as a chef but needed help boiling water.. Isn't that dishonest?

No, everything about is SUPERIOR, although the graphics are a little fuzzy but you can still see what they are supposed to show. Phil Elmore knows what he talking about from a martila arts perspective. By his own admissions he is just a private citizen. He is not trying to impress anyone, he is just trying to help them. That means a lot to me. There are martial artists who will have to let go of their fantasy worlds if they want to see a book that is really useful. This is one of those books and the author is one of those people who knows what he is doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"This book was great.

Rae is injoying a normal life with Anthony and with out Yana. But then she is told that Yana has escaped. This time though, shes not after Rae. Shes after the agency that really killed her mother. And with the help of Rae, Mandy and another powerful T-2 shes out to distroy them once and for all.If you found the others in this series kinda boring. Dont worry, this one is well worth buying!

From one week to the next after viewing the videos with the boys, the team looked like a whole new league!! The easy to follow techniques improved the skills of the whole team. The parents were baffled and thought they were watching a seasoned league! The coaches were impressed and mentioned their secret weapon at the closing ceremony! These videos are worth every dime, and would be beneficial to all ages!

The movie introduces the three kids, portrayed by excellent unknown actors, and takes us down a sometimes plodding road to the ending we are dreading: their cold-blooded killing of their victim - an excellent Ila Schactler. The sequence from inside the box, with its lit/unlit squirming and frantic action had me feeling for the victim. The end seemed abrupt, and I wanted the movie to show more of the effects of this deed on the three murderers. One thing's for sure - I'll never forget Kayla freaking-out being buried alive!Also, I didn't like the hand-held camera effects too much - got feeling a little queasey after a while. My wife liked the movie, and the camera motion didn't bother her at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meadowoods","review":"This was a stupid, sick movie. I have to admit, I absolutely hated the three college students. Especially, the blonde guy and girl (Travis & Stephanie). I couldn't wait for them to get what was coming to them. In the end the conclusion left me unfulfilled. There really was no conclusion. The other thing is the long drawn out death scene in the box. Which can't be really called a death scene because most of the time it was just a dark, blank screen. In any case. I hate the two actors I mentioned before, even though I know they were just acting. I'm so sick of individuals that think they can take other peoples lives with no consequences. And yes, I know this is a movie; it just reminds me of all the 'real' sick and disguting people in the world.P.S> Get Bent!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"I rented this movie thinking it would be a guilty pleasure horror flick to enjoy.

The suspense angle is really good, the story well told and interesting. I would definitely class this novel up with Tess Gerritsen, Lisa Garder, Lisa Jackson etc, and I'm hoping she'll concentrate more in the thriller/suspense/mystery genre in the future. It will certainly encourage me to take a further look at her other titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I found this book, by an author whose name I had never heard, at an annual book sale. How thankful I am that I risked my $1 as I have now found an author I am excited about reading. Between the suspense and romance, Potter created a beautiful story of relationships.The suspense was well done; I was fearful for the character's safety throughout. Cold Target contains murders, but thankfully they are not graphically described as I am a wimp who cringes at descriptions of wounds and blood spray patterns.The multiple romances were very touching and the sex scenes too were not graphic.This is simply a great book start to finish. Thank you Patricia Potter for writing such a great novel, can't wait to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is a INSTANT STANDARD","review":"This is a very great debut CD. Six for Costas is my favorite song, with a fantastic interplay between Sergio Bellotti (drum) and Bill Vint (sax) The first song (Son finite le vergine, composed by bassist Tino D'Agostino) is Scofield-like even though the guitar is played by MIKE STERN.

The tray does not come in close enough and the seat is much too low. The real problem is the tray, on the closest setting there is still HUGE gap. When your baby starts to self feed, he/she will drop food, since the Prima Papa doesn't come in tight enough, the food will drop on the floor, into the nooks and crannies of the high chair that are impossible to clean, etc. Find a high chair with a tray that comes in nice and tight, so when food does drop your baby can just try again! Some things are definitely worth spending a little more, this high chair is NOT one of those things. Keep looking, you haven't found your high chair yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly I hated it!","review":"We used this high chair from the time my son was 5 months until he turned 10 months. I had so many issues with this chair! The tray is huge and did not fit in my dishwasher. It was also heavy and required both hands to manuever. There was a huge gap between the tray and my son's chest, which means that half the food fell into his lap, or worse, got stuck in the crevices of the chair. I was constantly cleaning this chair and hunting for a tool to get the filthy straps off. At 10 months, when the pediatrician said it was time to start letting my son self-feed, I knew we had to replace the chair. We chose the Fisher Price Heathy Care Booster seat and I love it! Other people may like this chair, but I am just being honest with you regarding our experience with this chair. I wish I had not wasted my money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Highchair is AWFUL!!!!!!!","review":"This highchair is absolutely terrible!!!! It is so difficult to clean and no matter what we do to it, it never seems to be clean. It has so many crevices where food can hide and unless your baby is a very clean eater, this is not the chair to buy. Also, the pad of the chair is very difficult to remove and reattach and it seems as though our fingers are always getting pinched trying to do so.Positive notes - Nice reclining feature, harness and easy tray removal, however these features can probably be found on another high chair.I will probably get a new highchair for my next child as this one is such a pain! Yuck, do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Smelliest chair in town...","review":"In a nutshell, I bought this chair because it looked attractive in our kitchen and I thought it would be very comfortable and safe. There is, however, no conceivable way to get this thing clean! Even with daily wiping down and disassembling, the chair has developed an odor from food getting caught in the straps and crevices. The tan leatherette has begun to deteriorate and crack after only 5 months! We must take it outside and hose down the frame weekly to keep down the colony of fruit flies that have taken up residence there. In short, it is a disgusting chair and I am even more disgusted that I paid $180 for it. I would not recommend this chair to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"best high chair","review":"We purchased this high chair for our daughter (she was 8 months then) and we are so glad we got it. She had a hand-me-down high chair from a relative but she was never comfortable in that one. She was always in a slouching position. With the Prima Pappa, she sits comfortably now and she just loves being in her new chair. It's so easy to clean and it's not cheap plastic. It's a very good quality product and we would totally recommend it to other parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young infants","review":"I agree with another reviewer that this high chair is best for babies 12 months+. We registered for this high chair and I am impressed with its stability, quality and design except for the fact that the tray is so large that my 5 month old can't see over it. She drowns in this high chair! I was disappointed that this chair did not have an adjustment where the tray can be lowered so that infants can fit comfortably in it. I think we will not be able to use this chair until my daughter is about a year old. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannah's Mommy","review":"This chair is way too big. My baby is 10 months and I have her sitting on a book so she can reach the tray, and she's still too low. Plus, there is way too much room between the baby and the tray.

She still laughs at my baby wipe warmer that almost caught on fire.Anyway, my words of wisdom of my 19 months of momdom, save your money for a nice dinner...get a $30 booster seat.

If I had to do it again, I would absolutely not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great chair!","review":"For my second child, I used my high chair experience from my first to help me select this chair. First, it looks great! Secondly, the sleek style of this chair makes it a snap to clean (no ruffles and you can just wipe it down). Read some other reviews regarding the Prima Pappa and people indicated this chair would be hard to clean. I have to disagree. This chair can fold easily for storage and the five point harness makes it seem safe for even a small infant. The lift off tray is a nice touch and can easily be cleaned off in the sink. Most of all this chair seems to be really comfortable for my little one! My daughter loves sitting in her big girl chair!Although this chair seems a little pricey, it has all the bells and whistles you need and looks great around the table. If you can spend the extra money, this chair will last you through the toddler stage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"futbol metaphor","review":"In football terms, X-boy is a pro receiver.

The album starts off with a song called \\"MISANTHROPY\\", which lets you know right away what kind of album it is; raw, uncut, and sicc. \\"WHATEVER IT TOOK\\" and \\"MACAFRAMA\\" are just two of the songs that stand out on this album. This is his second record from jail, but unlike the \\"Exorcist\\", the lyrics where digitally cleaned up so it sounded like he was in the studio.

There is lots of action and lots of animals, which makes a good show as far as he is concerned. However, I *really* hate the dialog--especially the way the baby elephant interacts with the other elephants. I suppose the scriptwriters wanted to make it hip or something, but it just comes off as obnoxious and smart-assy (pardon my french). I would not allow my child to speak in such a manner to *anyone*, so I don't like him being exposed to such behavior.The fact that the story includes death doesn't bother me as much as the dialog. There is no gratuitous gore, and hunting--both by humans and other predators--is what life is like for animals in Africa.There are so many better animal movies out there--The Adventures of Milo and Otis, for example--that don't try to be tragically hip.

I guess music needs to be labelled to make finding it easier, but I have to laugh that this is considered \\"electronic\\" with all the accoustic guitar, hand drumming and even violin making for an organic, gorgeous listening experience; I like the \\"earthy\\" description used by an earlier reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cantoma","review":"I just played the Cantoma CD twice this morning since receiving it and it is absolutely THE most wonderful electronica CD I have - and I have many.This CD has already sent me on a quest for another Cantoma type CD.

You will fall in love with the music and devote some of your spare time looking for CD's just like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight Ahead","review":"Three disks, short ones. This is straight-ahead organ groove. Nothing sudden or unexpected, just nice and easy. Grant Green, Jimmy Ponder, and others add spice. If you like organ combos and Soul Jazz, you will like it.

All Mosaic disks are worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arian Fogelin does it again!","review":"This book was one of the best books I have ever read!

Most (not all, but most) of the stuff I listen to is ten, fifteen years older or more. Yet they've put out two amazing albums in a relatively short period of time that left a lasting impression on me. So Long, Scarecrow is a particularly emotional piece of work, the first full length album I've heard this year that made me feel something more than ambivalence (needless to say, I've been disappointed by some of the recent works of some of my all-time favorite artists). This heralds a complete departure from Jessicka's Jack Off Jill roots, where remnants of them could still be heard and felt in Sweet Heart Dealer. I would definetly say that this album has bumped Scarling up to my new favorite band."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Long, Scarecrow","review":"This album rocks my socks off!!! I saw Scarling live at Bottom on the Hill in San Francisco and after seeing their performance, I simply had to have their new album! Jesicka's voice is one of a kind...along with the guitars, bass and drum, everything mixes together perfectly. I cannot get enough of this album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"scarling is my darling.","review":"This band has some amazing dynamics. They deserve to be on top of the world. Great musical talents and amazing song writing skillz reminisant of great song poets of yore. scarling is not superficial crap, they speak the truth and speak it loud and clear. the songs on this album reach out to anyone who has ever felt pain. City Noise is a revilation to that. I found this cd to confort me in a hard time. I would tell anyone to buy this cd and better yet catch alive show. Scarling has never let me down."},{"rating":"2","title":"the mix tape in your heart....","review":"First off, it IS different from Jack Off Jill... don't purchase this CD expecting it to be a duplicate of Jack Off Jill. This CD shows growth in both voice and music depth. The tracks can go from bouncy and bubbly to solemn and somber, but flow smoothly and creates balance. I can't say I love one band over the other because they are two completely different sounds. All I can say is that I LOVE So Long, Scarecrow and that I recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind change."},{"rating":"2","title":"never cease to amaze me","review":"just keeps getting better and better.i usually tend to be \\"O.G\\" about bands.ya know,always liking the first lp the best.not so in this case.being a fan of christian and jessikas previous bands...this without a doubt takes the cake.can't wait for the next one.SCARLING YOU NEVER FAIL ME!!!!I F'N LUV YOU!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album start to finish!","review":"This is a great well made album i have heard in a very long time. Great vocals, drums, bass, and guitar. This should be album of the year in my opinion. Buy the thing and tell your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jessicka does it again!","review":"Jessicka, former lead singer of the underground band, Jack off Jill, bursts out unto the goth scene once again with So Long, Scarecrow. The CD is a wonderful audio record of the tormented and the demented. Jessicka's normally cough-syrup influenced, candy coated sweet voice may have lowered in tone but its still a joy to listen to. I believe this CD may have been influenced music-wise by the Curioso festival because at the begining of some of the tracks, such as Manorexic, you find yourself wondering if your going to indeed here Jessicka's voice or if she will temporarily be replaced by Robert Smith. This is an amazing CD, Jessicka's lyrics and voice beautifully complemented with great shoegazer like music and wonderfully demented miscellanious sounds, that makes it feel like you have been injected with pure endearment and love for this band from LA."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Scarecrow\\" less than sum of its parts.","review":"The biggest surprise of Scarling's new album is the unexpected lack of imagination and identity contained in the thirteen tracks on offer. Consisting largely of the sort of sonic dirges which are the bread and butter of My Bloody Valentine et al, \\"Scarecrow\\" seems content to plod along this well worn track without adding anything new to the genre and failing to ignite with the patented Scarling energy.While still being a strong effort and an accomplished album, the overall lethargy and lack of inventiveness leaves less to love about \\"So Long, Scarecrow\\" than Scarling's previous, superior, release \\"Sweet Heart Dealer.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply beautiful!!","review":"I expected great things from Scarling!! the first Album was so good i couldnt wait for the next!!!

The lyrics and music are all great, save for the slight repetition. Jessicka uses her lower register a lot more, which perfectly matches the mood of the music. I have been looking forward to this album for quite some time. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"<3","review":"I wish there were more stars to rate the album. Its honestly the best thing i've listened to. I listen to it everyday. Hopefully theres a tour lined up, because if there is, im there.<3 you jessicka<3 you christian<3 you rickey<3 you derik<3 beth"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big If--Big Waste","review":"Mark Costello is clearly an accomplished wordsmith, using his skill to create an edgy, appealing style. I only wish he had used his talent to create at least one character that I cared about, for better or worse. As it was, half way through this book, I was wishing to drown myself in the characters many pools of self-pity. At least that would have brought the book to an end. Pages are wasted on non-action, such as describing in detail the technical aspects of a computer game that really has nothing to do with the plot. Wait a minute. This novel doesn't really have a plot. For me, the Big If was a big waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big If","review":"This is probably one of the worst novels I've ever read. I read the whole book, hoping it would get better, it didn't. The story was weak and disjointed. None of the Secret Service agents were people any of us would want to be around. In describing the Secret Service, the author did little if any research. All of the agent's titles and the terms used for investigative and protective assignments were not even close to being correct.In fact the only thing the author got right was the name of the agency. A little research on line or in a library would have given they story a little more credability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I picked up this book thinking I was going to get great inside dope on the secret service and a compelling plot. While Costello certainly includes some great nuggets here and there, overall he's more concerned about trivial, everyday occurances that don't advance the story. By the end of the book, I was left with a big \\"is that it?\\" feeling. Skip it or borrow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"What a disappointment. I cared nothing about the charecters, and the plot never showed up. If you want to read about the government, pick up Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"a cynical author who hates animals","review":"I decided to give this book a chance, but wish I hadn't. The author has a hateful attitude toward animals that is simply offensive. That, combined with his extreme cynicism, really prevented me from enjoying the book. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended novel about the Secret Service","review":"Costello's survey of a Secret Service security detail guarding an unnamed Al Gore character in the 2000 NH primary has a long lead-up but provides engaging writing about characters as we learn about the people involved in the final scene. (One of the reviewers below writes that nothing happens -- I wonder if they finished the book.) I agree that the book isn't a conventional novel -- see it instead as an Event with the main protagonists drawn in illuminating detail. For example, the description of Tashmo is terrific -- his admiration for Reagan, his aspirations to look like a semi-Cowboy dude, his persistent womanizing, the whole routine about fixing his truck while he is up in NH guarding the VP. Very entertaining and readable.After reading \\"The Big If\\", I asked a friend who's brother was in te Secret Service whether the job was a tense one. He said that it wasn't - rather, it was boring with occasional flare-ups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Hype","review":"I kept waiting for this book to live up to its promise and it never did. If you have to read it, get it from the library or wait for the paperback version."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth your time","review":"I am in a state of disbelief that The Economist or the New York Times could give this book a glowing review. I kept waiting for something interesting to kick in, but it rarely did. To be fair, the last ten pages was a creative bit of writing, but the first 350 pages just droned on and on. Additionally, I found the writing, itself, to be nothing special. There are some authors who are such great work smiths that it almost doesn't matter what they are saying, the reader can simply get great joy in the way they say it. This is not one of those authors. I felt much of the dialog was written in a rather immature, unrealistic way. I kept finding myself saying, \\"Come on, no would actually say that.\\" There are so many great books out there to read, I would definately tell a friend to take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Zero!","review":"The Big If was a BIG ZERO! Full of character development that goes nowhere. I kept reading hoping something would happen -- it never does. It's too late for me, but SAVE YOURSELF, read something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big If Only... I hadn't wasted my time","review":"This is a novel sorely in need of a plot. Interesting premise, good character development, no action, no resolution to the tantalizing \\"Big If\\". Can't believe it is nominated for a nat'l Book Award. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"why read this kind of story when you can watch it on TV","review":"Okay... I had a hard time finishing this book. I really enjoy a detailed book that offers a point of view I have never seen before. The potential of this idea was very good, but I felt very let down. I felt nothing for the main character and at times I think there was too much detail crammed into a page or two. I felt the book hit it's stride during the last thirty pages and that's when it hit me. This book was essentially an episode of Third Watch. A TV police drama with a night-time soap opera foundation. He has a love child from an affair, one boy finds his father, a dot com geek grows up, a tramp looking for mister right... good God! I was almost waiting for a commercial break."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't get past the first 30 or so pages","review":"I love well-written books and read hundreds each year, but this one left me cold. I put it back in the 'return-to-library' pile as soon as the protagonist tossed a live parakeet in it's cage out a car window. UGH. I do admit that up until then I was struggling anyway so it really did not take much to convince me to give up. I just didn't get anything amusing, inciteful or profound out of those initial, awkward pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD FROM WILLIE !!!","review":"This is one of Willie's best. He revisits some of his classic songs from the sixties, with wonderful results. The Offenders provide crisp, spare accompaniment to Willie's sincere vocals. I only hope that Willie makes many more CDs like this one !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an informative book!","review":"This was an amazing book! I loved reading Rochelle's first Christmas Tree Ship book I wanted more information about the story. The Historic Christmas Tree Ship is overflowing with early 1900s newspaper articles, historic photographs, and more details surrounding the story of Captain Schuenemann and his family than you could even imagine. If you're interested in the story, or just looking for a heartwarming Christmas book, I would definately recommend this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Cohesive","review":"If you're interested in an exhaustive collection of the Christmas Tree Ship's story, this is a good book for you. It contains a lot of information. Unfortunately, it is not very cohesive, so it does not read well. It jumps in various directions about different aspects of the story, so it doesn't flow very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this book...","review":"W. Mosley is a solid writer who never seems to let me down. Anything with his name on it I'll read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment in Mosley","review":"I've enjoyed all of Mosley's works until Little Scarlet. Instead of moving the plot along in any logical way, he jumps from place to place with no real purpose. The whole scene with the wrong Harold did little to amuse or reveal.Easy's failure to call friends or cohorts to tell them he'll be delayed for days seems inexplicably rude. Mouse no longer has the electricity he once did. The reader does not believe that Easy is frightened of Mouse.Much of the plot seems unrealistic, with lots of loose ends. Mosley needed a better editor. I'm truly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mosley has a unique knack for dialogue","review":"I don't know why I stopped reading Walter Mosley about a dozen years ago. I think it was after seeing the disappointing film version of \\"Devil in a Blue dress\\" (though it did introduce me to Don Cheadle). I sure am glad I picked up Little Scarlett though. I have to catch up with the last several Easy Rawlins stories now. He is such a quick read and Easy has such a wonderful take on humanity. When I think of Mosley, I think of Elmore Leonard. They both have these rich characters with such snappy dialogue, but Leornard has written a lot of average books amongst his masterpieces. Mosley's work has all been excellent. Little Scarlett is probably the best. At least of the ones I've read so far. Like I say I have some catching up to do. Nice to rediscover an old friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Great","review":"Once again Walter Mosley has written a spectacular novel that trancends the traditional mystery genre with it's searing depiction of being black in America. Set immediately after the Watts Riots in Los Angeles, Easy is asked by the police to help find the murderer of a young black woman believed to be killed by a white man she helped escape the chaos of the riots. This is a series not to be missed for any lover of great American literature, and one of the best in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatness of Blake","review":"Consider the last stanza of Blake's \\"The Scoffers\\"\\"The atoms of DemocritusAnd Newton's particles of lightAre sands upon the Red Sea shore,Where Israel's tents do shine so bright.\\"Or consider the first stanza of \\" A Poison Tree\\"\\"I am angry with my friend,I told my wrath, my wrath did end;I was angry with my foe,I told it not, my wrath did grow.\\"In these two small selections it is possible to see a good part of what defines the essence of Blake's greatness. The music of the verses, their hypnotic power which makes them so easily subject to memorization, the element of original thought, or idiosyncratic new perception, the psychological acuity the revolutionary kind of religious faith and social message, the aphoristic intensity, all these taken together define some of the elements of Blake's greatness, a greatness which is richly represented in this anthology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sturdy","review":"We bought this case for an 80 GB Ipod Classic. It was a tight fit, but that was not a problem. The openings are in the right place, and we had no plans to take it out of the case often. However, the hinge is very weak.

Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every moment!","review":"Fans of Mameve Medwed's two other funny and warm novels--Host Family and Mail--definitely will feel thrilled to return to yet another one of her well-written, humorous stories. If you have never read Medwed's novels, you might want to start with The End of An Error, which is about the road not taken--take it and see where main character Lee Emery ends up! Of particular fun in this novel--the exploration of authorship and how it can enrich/ruin/change your life.

Not nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing","review":"I wanted a compressor primarily for bass to take the edge off the occasional excessive transient and smoothen up the tone. Well you shouldn't expect magic from a compressor, of course, but I was pretty underwhelmed by this one. The effect is very subtle (or nonexistent), then as you turn it up it suddenly kicks in with a rather unpleasant effect. To my ears it works better on guitar, but again I find the compression extremely abrupt when it kicks in and very audible, not in a good way. I was much more pleased with my TC Electronics rack compressor which I put in the effects loop of my bass amp. That has a much more subtle effect + you get a noise gate as well (and two channels too!) and a lot more versatility for pretty much the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to receiving this product so I could get some things organized. When they arrived, several of the boxes were cracked. It seems Target sends them out with no packing material around them.

I am proud of the way he portrays the Southern pride and heritage that is still alive today in the hearts of so many. His book is more than a story, it is a history lesson that goes beyond the story told in school. He brings it to life as he gives us a glimps of the hardships these men faced as they fought for their family and their homeland, remaining dedicated to the cause to the bitter end. This is one of the best books I have ever read and I recommend it highly. I hope we see B.J.'s story come to life on the screen soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"BJ Brown........

This story is based on sex and violence which increase within the story. This story shows the purpose of the increase in sex and violence within society from the 40's to the present. Coover strength in most cases is how he uses various movie sterotypes to display the ending that is not your typical ending. A western movie would overall include the \\"good guy\\" winning, however its not in this case. Overall A NIGHT AT THE MOVIES by Robert Coover is a good read that display the way in which modern society has changed its openness and view on sex and violence and how people typically think a certain movie will end. This book is designed for a more mature audiance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling evening out.","review":"While the big time reviewers seem to skewer this collection, I think they may have missed the point. This novel (of sorts) of shorts consists of exactly what it says, \\"A night at the movies\\" giving us themes and motifs common to the world of cinema and our imagination. Although, Coover is an expert at twisting them around and bringing to light the real motivations and often the folly of these crazy daydreams played out on the screen in our minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coover presents familar movies with unpredictable twists","review":"\\"A Night at the Movies\\" by Robert Coover is a collection of familar cinematic references presented in a montage of short stories. With a continuos theme of violence, Coover masks it with sporatic attempts of dark humor. The collection plays with your imagination by taking familiar characters and presenting them in unpredictable situations constantly surprising the reader. With all of the references to movies, if you aren't an avid film buff most of the symbolism and hidden meanings will not be noticed. Overall I found this book requires constant attention by the reader if you are to fully enjoy Coover's writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cass & Slide: Progressive house at its best","review":"The debut album for Cass & Slide is a must for any prog head.

I can safely say that this book taught me nothing I didn't know or couldn't learn from journals' Guides to authors, nor did it inspire any new enthusiasm. A book on scientific writing should not be wordy and boring; its strained attempts at baseball humour did little to lift the mood.

I'm sure that my memories of it have been filtered by time, but there is no way it could have been as bad as this serial.

The most exciting sequence in the TV series was titled \\"I TOBOR\\" and featured a killer robot with the name stenciled on backwards so that it spelled \\"I TOBOR\\" instead of \\"ROBOT I.\\" Recycling the name Tobor for the villain in the serial is just plain insulting.

Speaking of the tinted sequences, it was nice to see those again since I hadn't seen them except for when I initially saw the serial when it first played at the Saturday matinees at our local theatre back in 1952. This is probably the closest approximation there has been to any serial being in color! I've always found it to be quite enjoyable and entertaining and I thought they made remarkable use of the special effects considering the minuscule budget they had to work with! One interesting footnote: this was the ONLY theatrically released serial that was actually based on a television program(it was usually the other way around) and I'm quite sure that at the time of its initial release back in 1951, Hollywood was beginning to acknowledge the growing power of television!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two year old loved it","review":"Grandson, age 2, loved wearing the belt and using the tools.

The acting was horrible; the actors put no emotions into what they were saying. Whoever wrote the script must be shot and never allowed to work again. The whole movie was implausible. It felt like I was in an 80's movie, because my intelligence was insulted so badly. Basically, most of the things in the movie couldn't have happened. A mother would not have been so stupid as the one in this movie. But it did entertain me, partly because of Steve Buscemi's short but funny scenes he had. If you want to see this movie, wait to video. Otherwise, maybe I'd wait for \\"Spy Game\\" to see a good thriller and go for a family film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Familiar thriller i have seen before","review":"Domestic Disturbance is about as much fun as taking a dip in apool full of acid.

Travolta'skid witnessess his stepfather killing an old cellmate from his shady past in his jeep and then burns his body in a i ron scrap yard.

O'Leary went on to show his incredible range in FRAILTY, but in this movie, he brings his doe-eyed innocence and fervent fear to form the core of the movie. John Travolta does well as Danny's father, although he sometimes seems overburdened with trying not to act like Pulp Fiction; Vince Vaughn is appropriately menacing as the wicked new stepfather, but we never really understand his motivation for marrying Polo in the first place. Steve Buscemi shows up in his usual seedy bad guy role, but doesn't get much of a chance to do anything with it.This is an entertaining movie, and works because it attacks our primal fear of something happening to our kids. It's to O'Leary's credit that it works so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What might have been","review":"Now who honestly thought that this was a good movie ? What shocked me was the number of scenes that there in the movie trailer that never made it to the final cut. I know the DVD has deleted scenes but there accounted for less than 30% of what are missing from the trailer.The reason why I wanted to see this movie is because the trailer made a so-so storyline look half decent.

Another thing that ticked me off was that on the DVD only a portion of those things deleted were in the deleted scenes area of the disc.

Do studios pay people to say nice things about their pictures? If so this was probably one of those movies. This is an old story too. A kid suspects that his new step father (Vince Vaughan) is a psycho; and when he witnesses him committing a murder and cremating the body he runs to his real father (Travolta) who doesn't believe him either, but soon has his doubts because being a movie, his son is perfect and never lies to him. (Feeble feeble feeble). John Travolta gives a good performance and is one of the main reasons for watching this. Vince Vaughan on the other hand does pretty well too, but whenever I see him I am reminded of how awful he was in that pointless PSYCHO remake several years back.

I loved this movie because of how your emotions are glued to the screen as example for how you feel about the son and his troubles, and how you want the Dad(Travolta) to save the day and how your angry/scared of the step dad (Vaughn).

Frank (John Travolta) has to deal with a man marrying his ex-wife Susan. The guy (Vince Vaughn) is well liked by the community, but there are hints of something being amiss with him. Frank's son claims he witnesses his mother's new husband Rick commit murder. The more Frank investigates Rick, the more suspicious he looks. The investigation spurs a game of cat and mouse.There is great interaction between Travolta as a concerned parent and Vaughn the cold heartless type. The tension between them breeds suspense. The would-be new father uses his craftiness to manipulate those around him. There are few things he wouldn't do to get his way.\\"Domestic Disturbance\\" is entertaining with its high-tension suspense and great action.

Neither one was believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A by the numbers thriller that's way to short","review":"Domestic Disturbance is strictly a by the numbers thriller.

The only way to avoid the distortion is to have the iPod EQ off, turn off the bass boost on the system, and put the volume at 50%; but then the high pitched sound is just as loud as the music.My girlfriend has a smaller iPod docking alarm clock from some small company I've never heard of: she paid the same as I did for mine, and hers sounds like Bose compared to this.

First, like many others have mentioned, there was a constant light buzz or hiss sound. Some songs were better at hiding the sound, but some were painful. The other big issue I had with this was the button which allows you to change between the FM and \\"Ipod\\" mode. When I pressed the button to go into \\"Ipod\\" mode and played a track, initially only one of the speakers worked, then eventually, the other kicked in.I am realistic.

Charging and a little music while we were camping. My grandson was charging his iPod and listening to the music last night and the dang thing started smoking through the vents in the back with a stinky electrical burn smell!!! Very scary to both of us! We immediately unplugged the system and removed the iPod. Just like the guy/gal who's great to begin with until you get to know him a little better. Going back to the store and will report for a recall!! Could have been very dangerous if we hadn't been right at the system!!

Its a complete piece of junk. The sound is just terrible, there is no support behind the ipod (mine is a 2nd gen nano) so you couldn't change songs or go into the menu without fearing you were going to break it. With the radio on, the display changed from clock to the radio frequency you were listening to... thats right, the makers thought maybe you would need to check which station you were **listening to** more than the time. This thing really is bad, I returned it immediately and got a Sony ICF-C1iP instead, which I love and recommend, even though it's twice the price. Steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Price","review":"I've had this for about a week now and I have to say that I'm pleased. I knew when I bought this for under fifty dollars that this wasn't going to be symphonic quality sound. It sounds good, and that is what I was willing to pay for right now. It's good looking, easy to use, and plays my music and podcasts. I'm happy for now.

I returned the radio, paying $8.50 in shipping costs which were never reimbursed, and received a second radio after a month and a half. Within one and a half weeks, the second radio broke in the exact same manner as the first. Yet, when I contacted Emerson to receive a refund for their defective product, they told me they do not give refunds. Now I can either return my radio for another defective radio, wasting time and money, or I can simply lose $60 on my purchase and forget the whole ordeal.

However, there is a constant static/buzzing noise that comes from the speakers. I read that if you left the IPOD backlight turned on it would help with the static, but it doesn't make any difference on mine.

I did not realize until today how much of a piece of junk this is. When we first got it, the volume knob stopped working within a few weeks, it makes crusty sounds. The radio does not stay tuned in, the on-off button stopped working within 2 months so if we wanted to turn it on and off we would have to unplug the bulky cable. The iPod dock makes a loud hum sound with no audio, the only way we can use the iPod is by using the auxiliary plug in the back (cable not included) If it were anymore possible to get something to be crappier than this, I would like to see it - I would be amazed.

It is divided into two main sections -- one on longitudinal analysis per se, and another on time-to-event, or survival analysis, models. The former is especially good on the basic setup and interpretation of multi-level statistical models.This is a book for beginners in the sense that it emphasizes data analysis, rather than theory. But every statistician, and every user of statistics, can find something of value.When I was only halfway through reading this book, I recommended it to my friends. Several of them have purchased a copy and are glad they did.This is probably the most well-written statistics text I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing since sliced bread!","review":"This is a great book, it tells you in a straightforward way how to analyze your longitudinal data to answer questions of critical importance in the social sciences. It's not wedded to one particular piece of software, as many books on statistical topics are, but uses examples of real data and different software (HLM, MLwiN, SAS, Stata) to conduct the analyses. An absolute must for the researcher who collects longitudinal data."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applied Long. Data Analysis","review":"Excellent book in general.

And this book was perfect for me. I practically tore through this, and that has never happened with any other stats book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I like this book, specially because it gives good explanations for people that are not very familiar with mathematical statistics.

Plus I've been needing it for my World Literature class. Since I never got it, I was able to find most of the reading online.

Had to laugh at some of the comments of these experts on occasion, though, as some of the songs were just plain simple songs that were written on the sly, with no real intent to have all of these multiple meanings.Still, it was refreshing to hear these insiders look at the songs from their vantage. If you want an intellectual lift on your favorite Beatles music, I highly recommend this informative DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"AFI with an Australian accent","review":"These guys were supposed to open for Green Day the night I saw them, but they were playing at the KROQ Weenie Roast, so unfortuantley I missed the chance of seeing them live- some lame local punk band from the Baltimore area opened instead. Well anywayz, last Sunday I was in my local skate shop looking for new shoes, when I saw they were giving away free copies of this cd up front. I took one on the way out after I got my shoes, went home & listened to it, and I have become so addicted to this cd I'm starting to talk Australian! My favorite has to be Blood in your Hands. I love how it starts out all mellow then rips into a fast, raw punk song.

I'm not even a huge Punk afficionado but I know what I like and these guys have a crisp, classic punk sound that rears it's head every now and again (see: Clash, Greenday, Rancid, et. al.) prior to the band selling out and sounding like [drivel] (see: Greenday). Hopefully these three will stick with what got them here and not become slaves to the record company masters. It's worth buying this album just so you can play \\"Roll On\\" and \\"Dirty Man\\" over and over again (the rest is great too, I just really like those two.) Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A spectacular mess","review":"The Living End come back with more rowdy punkabilly for thier second album. Chris Cheney's brilliant guitar work really hits the forefront this time round. His fluent muscular leads recall the golden days of AC/DC and Led Zeppelin. The instrumental interplay between him and the other band members creates an irresistably catchy and powerful sound that 95% of todays punk bands lack. While some parts of the album do sound a little disjointed moving from ska, to surf punk to flat out hard rock all in one song, the album never loses momentum or energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not any good for many reasons.","review":"But mainly for this band to attempt the 'street' sound is very bad for them as it not something they can perform well. This is an average album which is OK but I am much disappointed as it is not in par with the other material of this band which I have then enjoyed a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Living End show punk is still aroudd and will stay","review":"In this new album out by The Living End, Roll On is an amazing combination of punk and emo-core. The fusion makes a fast and furious punk album. Opening with a traditional punk song of oppesing society they go into aseries of new yet old style living end punk.

This is another slap together dvd by Whirlwind Media who are only concerned with making money. The transfer is from a 16mm print off, most likely, a Sinister Cinema VHS tape. The only reason I even bought this is because it's one of those incredibly rare serials. The sound is pretty much muddied throughout the dvd and the print itself isn't much better. I had high hopes at first as the opening title sequence, although not crisp and clean, was viewable. After that, it becomes a hit and miss affair even more than their release of The Phantom Creeps. I wish Whirlwind would put some effort into cleaning up the video and sound--it isn't that difficult to do as one can see from the efforts of the Doctor Who Restoration Team. Again, as I stated in my Phantom Creeps review, STAY AWAY FROM WHIRLWIND MEDIA!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This video should not be sold","review":"The picture quality and sound on this video are beyond words to describe how bad a dvd can be.

When I saw the title and read the reviews I was very excited to get the book. However, when I received the book, and saw the photos of the demonstrator I was dismayed. These photos were just reprints from some of my very oldest books. This was first printed in 1939!!! It states that many of the photos are from 1984. I am sorry, I know Dharma is supposed to be some kind of a super guru, but his sullen expression in a overly revealing speedo was borderline obscene and the harsh black and white photos were just cold and uninspiring to say the least. 80% of the poses are so extreme that the average student could never achieve them, the book was misrepresented and a total waste of money.

And of course, the best book Light on Yoga of Iyengar."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I was suprised to find that there are postures not included in this book. The photographs are clear enough. There is no instruction. I suppose as an adjunct to some other material it is of great value. The one concern I have is about the durablility of the book itself. Since it is rather thick with a lot of pages, it might be worthwhile to purchase the hardcover edition instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is","review":"Asanas: 608 Yoga Poses does not claim to be a guide to Hatha Yoga. It does not claim to be anything other than what it is: a picture book of 608 Asanas executed by Dharma Mitra, one of the great Yogis of modern times. The pictures are small, as is the book, and the size makes the text a bit clumsy, but the pictures are well executed. This book will not teach you how to enter/exit an Asana, but it shows you what the position should look like when properly executed. I agree with the other reviewer who said that the hardback might be better, but given the lesser cost, this version is OK. This shoud not be the only Yoga book on a bookshelf, and I would not reccommend it as the primary Yoga text for anyone, but if you have a good library of serious Yoga texts, this can be a good addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"this is a wonderful book. it is just of photos though, so it will not teach you yoga. wonderful tool for any yoga teacher or anyone who loves to see all the different poses out there.the reason i didn't give this a 5 star review is that the binding on my book came off completely and all the pages are starting to fall out. will have to take to staples or some place like that to see if they can fix it. they squeezed too many pages into such a tiny book.other than that it's a great book, well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"Please note that this book is very small!!

When I tried to use the book as examples of what poses should look like all I got was laughter. Even from my supervisor!There are no explanations of how to get into or out of the poses safely.

To the critics of this book, I would respectfully state that perhaps they should consider that HRH Prince Al-Waleed did not have to live the very busy life he has now, but that because he choose to do so, many people around the world have benefited from the Prince's considerable generosity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely mixed","review":"I love this cd. I got it for my birthday and it hasn't come out of my cd player yet. I've heard well mixed cds before but this take the cake, in most the songs are only blended at the begining, end, and quickly lead of into the next song. Slim however has again proven why hes so good, starts on a song then in the middle of it he'll start the next song and slowly build up to the next song, however the by the time the other song has faded out the next song is coming in. All the while keeping the song hes doing as the dominant song. I have to get some of his other cds. : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad!","review":"Fatboy Slim delivers overall solid beats and rhythms on this impressive mix CD. The style ranges from house to trance to electronica, and the whole thing works well. The disc sets the tone for the inefectious housed-up \\"Austins Groove\\" by Kid Creme, the trippy yet infectious \\"Where's Your Head At\\" by the ever-funky Basement Jaxx, and Fatboy Slim's own \\"Star 69.\\" The disc does have a few minutes of filler, but I was overall impressed.

Certainly, he dances to the beat of a different drummer. Unlike many of the \\"world renowned super DJs\\" (where you can't tell their stuff on a mix CD from your own mix at home), Fatboy is distinct and awesome. Instead of waiting to see what everyone is listening to he is the one creating the new style that others will follow.And besides all that this CD is F-U-N-K-Y."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lackluster Performance . . . .","review":"\\"Live on Brighton Beach\\" covers \\"The best night of my Life\\"(in Norman Cook's actual words) through a 70 minute mix of what i call \\"boring funky dance tunes\\". I listened to the CD once, and most likely will never listen to it again. I am a sucker for live cds; I love them to death. Whether they be techno,trance,or funky house - I usually buy them. But kids - stay away from this mainstream disc - it simply is not good. The journey starts off stellar with tracks by Underworld, Fatboy himself, and Santos. Somewhere in the middle of all this funk - I got bored. Repetitive beats and a boring mixing style made it almost unlistenable. The last 3 tracks on the cd, and \\"SAFETY WARNING\\" interruption were cool, but that is about it. Check out Mixed Live:Donald Glaude, or DJ DAN - In Stereo, or perhaps Chemical Brothers - Come with Us. But whatever you do - stay away from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fatboy Slim does it again","review":"ok, i just got this CD in the mail today & it rocks. Norman Cook rocks the house yet again. The only downside to this CD (which is easily fixed) is that the track selection is wrong. Luckiny, within the liner notes are some sub-liner notes w/the real track listing written in both English & Japanese (i think). This is truly a Fatboy Slim CD worth getting, and its live so that makes it so much better right there. I was hoping tho, that the cops wouldnt have stopped the music on Basement Jaxx's \\"Where's your head at\\" cuz i love that song.

Have a celebrity DJ play music at them for an hour. Release the result as a new album.This album isn't really anything like any of Fatboy Slim's other live sets - in that it's not actually very good. It starts off with a nice, slow mix of Born slippy, progressing into a nicely funky remix of Right here, right now... and goes downhill from there. Vocal samples that are louder than the music playing are randomly dropped into the mix and repeated for minutes at a time, the sound stops entirely for ten minutes or so while Norman mumbles things at the crowd (\\"get the hell away from the water!\\"), and half of what's played seems to be either from Halfway between the gutter and the stars or You've come a long way, baby.However, I don't like Fatboy Slim all that much.

I felt most of the activities would have been more appreciated in much earlier months such as mirror, rain maker, abacus (even though product suggests 9 months). The only side my 1 year old plays with is the flat round disk with the two finger impressions. He plays with it like dialing a rotary phone. None of the other sides keeps his interest as he is familiar with its motions. Also, the orange disk that is supposed to run up and down a screw-like pole broke off. The toy is actually 1.5 lbs; I weighed it on a food scale. It will hurt if dropped on toes (big or small).

However, if you're looking for an educational rather than emotional/entertaining experience, then I would recommend this book to you.

The writing suggests a dispassionate discourse by someone on the outside of Black culture, rather than in it. Nor does the author have a sociological bent. It's more like encyclopedia enteries for grade schoolers.The book is published by Trafford Publishing, which, I believe, means it didn't go through an editorial review, explaining the shallow treatment and many typos.

He trys to make us think that Joseph Smith and Ron Lafferty are cut from the same cloth. He makes huge assumptions such as all mormons know the day and hour that Joseph Smith was murdered. He also attempts to create the illusion that somehow Latter Day Saints believe that grass is sacred and says that at BYU no one ever walks on the lawn. I wonder if Mr. Krakauer has ever even been to Provo, Utah. Here is another bad book that can be added to the long list of books written in an attempt to demean the Latter Day Saints.

I plan to follow up with other resources since our country might have our first Mormon president soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of murder with a broader point","review":"Krakauer delivers yet another well-written book, this time about two brutal murders ostensibly committed in the name of religion. The account of the murders of Brenda and Erica Lafferty is enough to warrant a book of its own. What Krakauer does, effectively in my opinion, is to convey the implicit message that, while we may be at war with those who seek to kill us in the name of their religion, we have homegrown fanatics right here in the U.S. who are willing to do the same. Krakauer's point is this: religious fanaticism is not confined to Islam, although that may be the focus of our attention at this time.The fact that the Lafferty murders were committed by Mormon fundamentalists isn't necessarily a slight to Mormonism. Clearly, what the murderers did in the name of their faith is not in accordance with today's mainstream Mormon church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under the Banner of \\"craziness\\"","review":"Was a great book to read. My inlaws are mormon, and the book fascinated them also. Its amazing how many people say the writing is flawed... he wrote about FLDS which is a wholey different thing from \\"regular mormons\\".

Its not a bloody true crime thriller, if youre looking for that, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written, Wonderfully Researched","review":"Once again, Krakauer presents a tour de force piece of writing that leaves readers pondering the truth about Mormons, the fundamentalists that can corrupt any religion, and how religious figures can abuse those who trust in them. The history of the church is well-researched and presented, along with those moments in the religion's history that church members are still trying to cover up and rewrite even today.

It works splendidly as both a chilling true crime \\"novel,\\" but perhaps more profoundly, as a thought provoking look at the questionable origins of all religion. How anyone can believe that a huckster and an apparent sex addict like Joseph Smith received the \\"revealed\\" word of God just goes to show that in America, there is indeed a sucker born every minute.

It just plain isn't written very well. His previous efforts were very personal; we got to know the characters as 3-dimensional people. But in this volume Krakauer stands back - sometimes very far back. This is particularly true in the later Mormon history chapters when the more fully developed characters of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young are out of the picture. I got a little bored with his throwing out names of people we don't know and won't hear about further in order to illustrate violent events. These events began to sound very similar to each other..offering us little more to chew on than a thin chronology.Clearly, \\"standing back\\" is not the author's forte.

Not only do I have several Mormon friends but I know enough about the religion to know he is way off. If you want to really know about Mormonism ask a Mormon, not a bitter crime-seeking non-religious man. (And comparing Mormons to the Taliban is just down right wrong.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I could not put down this book. It is a look at the Mormon church's history, as well as some of the current sects that control part of Utah.I found the history fascinating. In one of the appendixes, the Author sites his sources and defends his work against the LDS critics.Over All a very good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My kingdom for a point...","review":"Much like the Mormon faith, Under the Banner of Heaven has an infrastructure of oatmeal. This book, at best, strengthens the resolve of those who love and those who loathe the LDS movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writer, horrible journalist!","review":"I just finished this book. Let me start off by saying that I am mormon. I was curious to read the book to understand what the fundamentalists view is. However, I was dissapointed. I knew that he would get some facts wrong about the Mormon church, everyone does. But he got everything wrong. He's taken sources from history that are anti-mormon and cited them as facts. If he cites false documents, it doesn't make his document truth. I was hoping for a better representation of what we believe, instead he's taken the opportunity to express his views on Mormon's regardless of the truth.Krakauer's writing style is excellent and compelling and hard to put down. But he's short on facts. In fact, he was criticized for the same thing in his books \\"into the wild\\" and \\"into thin air\\". He keeps doing it again and again. He's more interested in controversy to sell his books then telling the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\"","review":"THis was a difficult book to read. It is hard to imagine that the Mormons could be so brutal, especially to women. I understand a lot of them are fundamentalist and there are many who are kind and have good values. I put it down half way through as I got tired of the same old theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under the Banner of Heaven","review":"An excellent book ... Krakauer tells the truth. It is sad to realize that these fundamentalist beliefs continue to be perpetuated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and disturbing","review":"I'm a big fan of Krakauer's previous books and this one definitely lived up to my expectations. Although this is a bit of a departure from his other books which focus on mountain climbing and the outdoors, Under the Banner of Heaven is just as interesting. Krakauer has clearly done his research and presents a good history of Mormonism in addition to the specific story of murder he recounts. The disturbing portion is the Church of Latter Day Saint's own history and practices, but this also makes for an excellent read. I even enjoyed the appendix which contains a response to the book by a historian of the church of LDS along with Krakauer's response."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair as Fair Can Be","review":"Writing a fair but honest product on any religion must be difficult but the author accomplished it with his book. The author's research on the history and origins of the Morman cult was very informative. Highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars isn't enough","review":"Bravo, what an eye-opener. It's about time someone took an honest look at fundmentalism in our country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for","review":"Unfortunately, Mr. Krakauer presents a very one-sided story. I have no affiliation with the LDS, but was appalled by the unrestricted defamation provided in this book. Chapter after chapter I was hoping for any bit of positive insight, but found none.His research does appear to be in good form, but I would like to see this book on the shelves next to the supermarket tabloids do to the negative content. Every story has two sides. Good leaks from the pores of the worst of human deeds."},{"rating":"1","title":"the title should be HISTORY BOOK about fundamentalist Mormons","review":"I was so hoping for another john krakauer exciting read....it feels like being back in school trying so hard to get through a required history book...so far struggling to make it...only one third through. It should not be this hard to get to what you hope will be a good part. Sorry john..your other books are awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hodge podge of gruesome stories. Waste of time.","review":"The historical information is grossly inaccurate. Not a single footnote on numerous items completely out of step with all the professional historical work on the subject, but stated as facts. The narrative jumps back and forth to different stories and centuries with no apparent logic or flow. excessively lurid details of the murders. He is apparently trying to say religion causes violence, but never compares the quantity of religious violence vs violence caused by other things. His argument is absurd and not at all supported by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed and Biased, even if you agree with him...","review":"One can tell going in that Krakauer had a negative view of Mormons to begin with. Rather than making his research do the talking, Krakauer's opinions do the talking, and to me this made him less credible. As a person who agrees with some of his biases, even I was offended by his tactlessness. The story itself was disjointed as well, and I kept having to return to previous pages to understand who was who and what was what. If you want good solid Krakauer, read \\"Into the Wild\\" (my personal favorite of his) or \\"Into Thin Air.\\" In them, at least he does not let his opinions get in the way of his research so blatantly unless he is a part of the story himself (\\"Into Thin Air\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum, what a boring muddle.","review":"Having read many of Krakauer's other books I was eager to get down to this one. What a disappointment. He calls it a story (on the cover) but it's not a story at all - more like a painfully dull history of the Mormon faith, and a slanted one at that. This book misses on both levels - too boring and scattered to be a good story, too biased to be a history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring .................","review":"To me, it's like a textbook, and not a story. The content is apalling; the young women's lives made miserable by sick-minded fathers \\"marrying\\" a number of their daughters when they reach their twelfth birthdays. Krakauer knows his subject, being brought up as a Morman. But enough is enough when it comes to sordid events described over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"This book reads like a novel! The way Krakauer approaches the subject is very neutral and unbiased. He includes the rebuttal in his Appendix and deals with each item in a factual manner. This is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"Wow! I hate reading, but I couldn't put this one down. It was very interesting and kept my attention from start to finish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eyeopener book on Mormons","review":"While the book is about a murder committed by a sect of the mormons that believe in multiple wives, the author gives a riveting and, I believe, objective history of the establishment of the Mormon faith. A real page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a born-and-raised Mormon ...","review":"I must admit that Mr. Krakauer's coverage of Mormon history is fairly accurate. While what he says is far from what the Latter-day Saints would like you to know about. My own church has never really admitted any involvement in the Mountain Meadows killings of over 100 civilians from Arkansas even though every Mormon involved in that terrible event had been into the Church's temple cerimony where they repeatedly swore vengence on the blood (decendants) of those responsible for the death of their prophets. Their last prophet before this event was killed in Arkansas. Yes, Mr. Krakaur needed to write this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well balanced, interesting read","review":"This book does an excellent job of describing and investigating the motivations behind the murders that occurred in 1984. Even though the book delves into church doctrines, one does not need to know much about the Mormon faith to easily follow along. Mr. Krakauer touches on many topics that many of the Mormon faithful would like to see erased from history as they are either quite damaging to their public relations campaign or are just too difficult to explain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening","review":"Except for plural marriage and large families, I had no knowledge (or prejudices) against the Church of LDS. This well written book goes beyond just the recent Mormon Murders, and describes the early history of the church as well as more modern church politics. Krakauer did an excellent job of intertwining several storylines, and kept me turning pages. I bought the book before a long international flight, and it was so good I gave up sleeping! I have read the church's rebuttal, and I think their points are either weak or false. I really believe Krakauer writes objectively and does not slant the facts. Those facts happen to be negative against the church, but that sometimes happens when you take a critical look at something. This book has inspired me to learn more about the church's history and current aspirations. It's a scary cult, and I will never look at my Mormon friends the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under the Banner of Heaven","review":"I struggled with this book because it did not go anywhere or tell me any details that the ordinary person didn't know. This book was heavily footnoted and most of the information was from news articles. There was little information as to the secrets and unknown elements of Mormonism and polygamy. I was greatly disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The power of finding out for yourself","review":"Whether we agree that what is written in this book is the truth or not, we all have the ability to find out for ourselves what is the truth and what is embellishment. Controversary always stirs curiosity, and brings about questions. We have read one man's opinions based on a few statments from others. There are thousands of journals, books, and records that tell the story of the early mormon church. Find out the whole story, not just portions. What really happened? Will you believe the statement of one or of many? Use your power to find out the truth and ask questions! Then the true power of writing will come to pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Like It.","review":"I read about 1/3 of the book before I realized that it was just a repeat of the same terrible situations but with different players, The situations were so terrible that I put the book aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappoint","review":"The author treads no new ground. The book relies on second hand sources to try and expose the Latter-day Saint Church. Not until the last paragraph of the book does the author finally confess his own bias. I felt the book was a cheap shot at the Mormon Church and its members."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factual, but boring.","review":"Anyone interested in learning about the Mormon faith and it's origins may find this book tolerable. I think I found it boring because the cover and other sources made such a big deal about a pair of murders in the book, that I thought that was what the book would focus on. The actual part about the murders was very well written and extremely interesting, but it isn't as if murders don't happen in the name of religion and God every day. Most notable about this book would be the correlation one could make between our current situation with the Taleban and the Mormon faith a long time ago. I also got the impression that just about anyone in the Mormon faith can call themselves a prophet. It's a strange book and I got bored quickly and had to push myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-fiction?","review":"Anyone who accepts this book as fact should read the review available at [...]. This review points out errors and biases that are more than \\"small errors (as one reviewer stated).\\"Krakauer, who may have some strengths as a author, states his biases in the introduction. Why would I accept as fact a book written about a group by someone who has an axe to grind about that group? If those seeking reliable information about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints read only this book, they are being about as fair and objective as learning about general Christianity from Richard Dawkins. You might, in forming an opinion, touch on Dawkins, but you wouldn't want to form conclusions on Christianity from Dawkins alone. That wouldn't be honest. Krakauer missed badly in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Krakauer uses the same arguments that have existed for decades, only this time around they have been given the spin that it all leads to violence. I was not entertained in the least. I found myself becoming bored, disinterested, and with little motivation to complete the book.Sorry Jon, stick with Everest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking and appalling","review":"This book deals with the history of Mormonism and Mormon Fudamentalism as a counter religion and it also explores and questions the pillars of mainstrain Mormonism. Ron and Dan Lafferty, both Mormon Fundamentalists who commit double murder insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their victims. Beginning with a very well researched account of this crime, Krakauer constructs an appalling narrative of delusion, savage violence and strict faith. He even analyzes the abduction of fourteen-year-old Elizabeth Smart. They had her so brainwashed that she even denied being Elizabeth. These Fundamentalists believe that the mainstream church went astray when they renounced polygamy. After finishing this book, I'm still in a state of disbelief. John Krakauer is an amazing writer and I think that this is his best work yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"It occurred to me while reading this that if they taught some of this stuff in my highschool history classes I would have been riveted!!!Here Krakauer's investigation of the murders perpetrated by Ron and Dan Lafferty is typical of his style. He creates a fascinating story without attempting to manipulate his reader, even when the sensational nature of the subject might lend itself to that sort of treatment. Instead, he provides a personal, but at the same time even-handed analysis of the murders and of contemporary Mormon fundamentalism.I think that those who criticize Krakauer for unfairly victimizing the Mormon church have not read the book carefully, or at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"I have to say that this book fascinates and frightens me. I was a non-mormon who lived in Utah for several years, and no matter what the mormons may say about this book, it holds many more modern-day truths than it doesn't. Polygamists are still alive and well in Utah. They are still fundamentalists, they are still brainwashing and abusing their multiple wives, forcing them to wear dresses and to wear their hair a certain way , to marry their uncles and cousins and they make no effort to hide it, but rather seem proud of it. You should be afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating American History","review":"Wow. This is a book that makes you want to wander the American History section of the public library in search of GREAT STORIES about our country's past.This isn't a whodunit true crime book, but rather a whydunit looking at social origins. Krakauer is very careful to distinguish between the mainstream and fringe (Fundemental LDS) societies. Anyone who reads this book and believes it is about all LDS members really wasn't paying any attention.This book calls into question the fanatical expression of religion in the United States. Though it only speaks about FLDS specifically, most readers will probably consider other new American religions or sects as they read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a real eye-opener!","review":"Krakauer's writing style is easy-going. His ideas flow seamlessly, culminating in an insightful perspective on a little-known religious community. He pulls no punches when describing the atrocities in polygamous communities. He is also perfectly honest about Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, Mormon church history, Mormon culture and how all of these relate to Fundamental Mormonism. I recommend that you ignore the Mormon naysayers who protest too much (and who have likely not read the book). This book is an engaging read, whether or not one is connected in any way to Mormonism or Fundamental Mormonism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilt by Association","review":"If a couple of crazies claim they were guided by the hand of God to murder two innocents, what does their heinous act reveal about the beliefs and practices of all other members of their faith? Jon Krakauer is here to connect the dots for you. He does it by telling two seemingly unrelated but true stories in parallel. The first is about the killer brothers Lafferty, fundamentalist believers who want to return the Mormon Church to a polygamist society outside the laws of the United States. The other, larger story, is the amazing history of the Mormons. As though prosecutor, Jon Krakauer carefully chooses words that make his case for guilt by association a bit too creative. Whatever your own verdict, you will appreciate the brilliance of Krakauer's research and the courage of his conviction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent....really. Buy this book.","review":"This is a book about religious fundamentalism gone terribly wrong, resulting in two horrific murders. How society bred these murderers and turned a blind eye and ear to their violent threats is a fascinating, intriguing, well written, even suspenseful story. And yes, controversial. Religion tends to be a highly emotional subject, along with sex and politics. This book has all three!Joseph Smith doesn't come out smelling like a rose, nor does Brigham Young. Does that offend some people? Yes. Does that make the research incorrect or invalidate the book? No. The bibliography looked pretty impressive to this reader.Enjoy reading and learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"Krackauer is a superb writer and although this is not an adventure type book like his other two, I found it utterly fascinating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very enlightening.","review":"After having a couple family members join Mormonism, I wanted to learn more about it. This book is very informative and interesting. I only wish I could have read it sooner and encouraged my family members to read it or atleast think about some of the problems associated with this religions history and doctrines."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited too long Under the Banner of Heaven","review":"I am enthralled with the subject of Polygamy and this is a well written book . . . very clinical, informative, factual and dry book - which is why I gave it 2 stars. If the author had cut it down it would have earned three stars from me. I need just a little more heart and soul for me to grant it a better star rating. I enjoyed immensely the 19th wife. I understand this was not that kind of book, but I put this book away 60 pages from completing it, because it had lost my interest and that was not the case with the 19th wife, not even once."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"Ordered the book for a book club read, just not in to it.

I followed this case very closely and this guy is way off the mark. He should have spent more time with research of the case in question, rather than wasting it on his ridiculous accusations & conspiracy-type story-telling regarding the LDS church. The problem here is the it's obvious the author didn't feel like he could draw enough of an audience by just stating the facts of the case--instead he mistakingly believed he needed to drag in false claims regarding mainstream Mormons. Those who WANT to believe this garbage WILL, and those who are sensible and actually know LDS people and don't have a chip on their shoulders, will realize that this book IS GARBAGE. This isn't the first book of this kind to trash on the Mormon faith, and it won't be the last. Take my advice & just don't waste your time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"Krakauer is highly confused and I can tell that so are some of these reviewers. He cannot give insight into or shed light on something he knows little truth about himself. The church he is talking about is completley separate from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Jon Krakauer is nothing more than an sadly misinformed and idiotic person trying to enlighten his readers with things he has misinterpreted. Books like these are written on every religion with hopes of discouraging the believers and proving to those that don't believe -that their assumptions were correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by Krakauer!","review":"As usual, the author goes deep with this study and keeps us stuck to the pages of this brilliant book."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least he was kind enough to confess his bias - in the end","review":"Krakauer so masterfully intertwines fact with fiction that it is impossible to distinguish one from the other unless you posess a substantial background with which to decode his effort.He attempts to explore certain religions from the perspective of those who engage in abborrant behaviour not espoused by any religion he investigates.In the final few paragraphs Krakauer finally confesses what has already becomes dissapointingly, painfully obvious - he has no understanding of the concept about which he is writing - people of faith - any faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"This is a poorly written book. Seems like the author just wanted to sell something and was in a hurry to put out a poor quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"For anyone interested in a factual, well written book","review":"For anyone interested in a factual, well written book... you'll have to look elsewhere I'm afraid. Mr. Krakauer has lost any shred of credibility he may have had and proven himself to be unconcerned with fact, data, truth, integrity and honesty.It's unfortunate that Jon Krakauer wasted so much precious time bashing a religion he obviously knows nothing about. It would be most interesting to find the true underlying cause for such bitterness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jon's got issues","review":"I totally understand the \\"let's rip on the mormons\\" thing. Everybody's doing it so good for Krakauer. It's a popular bandwagon after all. But now that he's gone and just really, really taken a shot at Greg Mortensen, i mean come on. Does this guy not have anything good to say? Anything at all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time!!!","review":"this book told a good story, but i think he was just trying to get out of trouble! don't judge all mormons by one idiot! all my friends are mormons and are awesome! just cause one does something dumb, doesn't mean they all are stupid. what religion are most murders anyway?? i guarante they are not mormons!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccuracies","review":"As a casual historian of the period covered in Krakauer's book, I am dismayed, even insulted, that a fellow author would twist and omit crucial facts about any group--mainstream or not. Had he included a balanced overview of events from credible (not sensationalism-type) sources, he would have had no story at all. Now I wonder about inaccuracies in \\"Thin Air\\". I've lost all respect for the author. Apparently not what he's \\"Kraked\\" up to be. Sad how quest for notierity and money clouds integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into thin History","review":"I grow tired of pseudo-historians using second and third hand references to support a weak and ill-defined theory. No, I am not a Mormon who lives in Utah, but I understand why they would find Jon Krakauer's latest offering disappointing, if not deceitful. It seems as if Mr. Krakauer set out to write a story about two brutal murders and ended up in a morass of religion he neither understands nor fully contemplates. I am not terribly interested in Mr. Krakauer's unsubstantiated history. And because so much of the book grows on this poor foundation, the real tragedy and story of the murders become nothing more than macro conjecture. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating book","review":"Excellently written, captivating and interesting. A lot of what JK writes about in his book are theological remnants of early Mormon faith and some of the more grotesque outgrowths thereof that the LDS church probably wishes would simply vanish in thin air, but which keep rearing their ugly head from time to time in Utah. To understand some of the strangeness of what goes on in Utah to this day this book is a \\"must read\\". In contrast to Fawn McKay Brodies excellent but thick and extensive book about Joseph Smith \\"No man knows my history\\", this book can actually be read easily in a short period of time as its historic portions are much more condensed to the most essential. The author goes back and forth between chapters on historic events of the 19th century and chapters of more contemporary events (Lafferty brothers). The book is written so well that everyone I loaned it to reads through it in record time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every needs a little history","review":"As a former member of the LDS Church who grew in central Utah I see this book as a very good effort. Growing up in that area, topics like the Mountain Meadow massacre and the role of the Danites in Utah history were never taught or even discussed. The early life of Joseph Smith was always glossed over in giant leaps. No organization is perfect and no organization should be quite so squeamish about a little scrutiny. Religion in early Utah had an ugly face and a good face too. Power can corrupt anyone if they hold it too long"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good account and excellent research!!","review":"When i bought this book i was very curious as to what i should expect from it.I was raised a catholic but i no longer practice the catholic faith and i have never encounter or talked to a mormon in my life so i thought i was going to be impartial with this book.I think Mr Krakauer did a terrific job in researching this job and his narrative is excellent.He tells the story pointing out his sources and with exactitude towards the truth.If he had any intentions as to debunk the Mormon Faith, i certainly never saw it.In other words, it is my opinion that Mr Krakauer's work is very well presented and rationale.The book is very interesting and i consider it a page turner.I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand what's going on in the Mormon Faith and who wants to know mora about the history of that faith and the state of Utah...Kudos to Mr Krakauer"},{"rating":"2","title":"not anti-Mormon","review":"This is a fantastic book. Krakauer does an incredible job of merging history lesson with compelling narrative with probing inquiry into the sometimes contentious balance between sanity and religious belief.Krakauer does NOT equate the Laffertys with mainstream LDS; rather, he details the history (and let's face it, it's a nasty, violent history) of LDS to show that the originators of religions-- those heterodox souls who claim direct revelatory experience (whether they be Laffertys, Joseph Smith, Mohammed, Jesus, Jim Jones-- you name it)-- ALWAYS live on the razor's edge between the keenest perception and sheer lunacy. Can't we all, relgious and non-religious alike, just admit this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hoping my review will meet with persecution so I can form my own religion too!","review":"Fantastic read. Not much I can add that other reviewers haven't. Regardless of how spirtually enlightened you think you are, this book is still an excellent read, just for some perspective about some folks who have unquestionably taken it too far. I hear so many folks scoff and laugh at religious groups in the Middle East who seem to have taken an element of spirituality and bastardized it into an excuse for violence and/or persecution of others. The stories in this book are just small examples of how this goes on in the good ol' U.S. of A. too, every damn day! It's happened since our beginning. These tales are from one particular religion, but they run rampant throughout our society. So, don't feel bad LDS members, all of the other groups have their skeletons as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Expose on Mormonite Polygamy & its Consequences","review":"This book is a really heartbreaking story about \\"fundamenalist Mormons\\" living virtually autonomously in rural western U.S. towns and clinging to the misguided \\"plural marriage\\" practices that \\"mainstream\\" Mormons abandoned a century ago. I know that \\"mainstream\\" Mormons won't like having these stories told, but Mormonism arose in the age of the printing press, and a good researcher, like Krakauer, can follow an ample paper trail.Krakauer's a great writer, but he needs a good editor and doesn't have one. There's a misspelled word on virtually every other page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Osmond Mormons","review":"Jon Krakauer leaves the mountains and wilds behind and sets his sights on Mormon country.The focal point of the book is of a 1984 violent murder of a Mormon woman and her daughter at the hands of two of her brother in laws. The brothers, believing they were spoken to by God carried out the brutal crime with hardly a thought. It's an interesting read that moves beyond the murder and takes a greater look at what was behind it, religious fanaticism. Be it Muslim, Mormon, or Christian, Krakauer loosly touches on what makes these people tick, while specifically examining the Church of Ladder Day Saints, and it's founders.I found much of the history interesting, although felt it started to get a little bogged down by his sometimes heavy handed point in reference to fanaticism. Still it's a fascinating read about a group of people living in our country that many people probably don't know anything about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"The book was too long, very descriptive. It kept switching back and forth in time, many many characters, Sometimes too complicated to follow. I thought I was going to enjoy this book, but I didn't even finish it ( very unusual for me)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Under The Banner of Heaven","review":"This book is worth reading. Krakauer is a wordsmith so have a dictionary handy or read it on a Kindle. The content, if even half of it can be believed, will make you sit up and take note. I have known several mormons, but had no idea about the belief system they followed. They were good people. I realize that fundamentalism in the mormon faith is like fundamentalism in any organized religion. That is to say some people are unable to take it in moderation. The same as with alcohol or food. However, I'm not sure religion was ever meant to be taken in moderation. Our love of the deity must be all consuming yet allow us to function on earth rationally as social human beings while preparing for eternity. This book portrays the mormons as not following a deity, but the revelations of one or two men and their carnal desires. How scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO THE READER....","review":"I REALLY want to listen to this book. I was raised a Mormon and love history about that church. However the first disc was difficult. The reader isn't that great and there are so many facts tossed out all at once about the history. The book is really about a murder and the killer was told by God to kill two people. So far the READER isn't helping and it's a shame. I hope it will get better on the 2nd disc or else I just won't make it through."},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth is out there--just don't look here","review":"A book so full of errors is a disgrace and should cause the reader to wonder what else the author got wrong. Krakauer doesn't even seem to know who the president of the Mormon Church is--doesn't he have an editor or fact-checker? Every church has a few bad apples, but to implicate an entire church based on the actions of two ex-members (who were excommunicated--obviously the church recognized that they were off their rocker) is pretty sad. Following this logic, each time there is a crime, we should find out what religion the person is and then blame the church in question for their actions--ludicrous and ridiculous.Krakauer should stick to mountaineering--he doesn't know enough about religion to do the subject justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would like a refund please!","review":"He had one good book and this one was not it. I was so disappointed in this book, that I wanted Barnes and Noble to give a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Mormon claptrap","review":"This book tries to do for Mormonism what the Protocols of the Elders of Zion does for Judaism, and is just as blatantly anti-Mormon as that tome is anti-Semitic. The central premise of Krakauer's book, based on antecdote and innuendo, seems to be that if you grew up in a mainstream Latter-day Saint family, you're just a couple of philisophical shifts away from becoming a wild-eyed homicidal religious maniac. Meanwhile, in the real world, millions of Latter-day Saints quietly raise productive, tolerant, law-abiding citizens, whose simple lives of goodness are ultimately the most eloquent refutation possible of Krakauer's rabid stereotyping."},{"rating":"1","title":">>SNORE<<","review":"As an obsessive-compulsive type, I typically have a horrid time quitting a book before finishing it. IN this case, however, I had virtually no qualms about packing it in three-quarters of the way through.I expected this book to be fantastic, a riveting \\"In Cold Blood\\"-type take on a heinous crime. Instead, it was a long (and I mean LONG) discussion of the Mormon faith.While it's true that the murderers were at one point related to the Mormons, their particular brand of \\"Mormonism\\" bears about as much resemblance to the faith as McDonald's does to gourmet cuisine. They may come from the same place, but they have diverged enormously along the way.I found the link between the history of Mormonism and the Laffertys' crimes to be tenuous at best, and couldn't bring myself to handle another few hours of 19th century history just to get to the end of this arduous read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unprofessional and poorly researched","review":"As a fan of his other novels, this book was a great disappointment to read. I have also written about the Mormons and their church while working as a journalist throughout the world, and I have researched many of the same stories. His slant and deceptive writing style were a shame to read from a professional viewpoint. I am familiar with many of the sources he used, and it is unfortunate he chose to focus on those with \\"bones to pick\\" with the Mormon culture, so to speak. I didn't feel he was objective at all. Agnostic yes. Objective, no. But hey, if it makes a bestseller, who cares if he's honest? Extremely disappointing coming from Krakauer."},{"rating":"1","title":"nonobjective","review":"I repect Mr. Krakauer as a writer, however, he has taken on a subject here that is ill served under his biased view.Thesis-antithesis-synthesis. He provides the first steps well, but admittedly is incapable of providing a synthesis to his work due to his anti-religious worldview.Until he has honed his skills to the level of scholarship and the ability to suspend his own prejudice to an acceptable level, he should avoid such controversial themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story not bad, but facts are misleading.","review":"I found this book somewhat interesting. I must agree that religion can sometimes be misleading. I too agree that many fundamentalists from many religions take things too far in many cases. I find the study of human beings very interesting and I love to indulge myself in the study of human nature. I would like to say that I enjoyed reading this book, but it was full of 'facts' that just aren't true. I am not speaking about most of the book, but the story of early mormon history was poorly written. If you are looking for a book about religious fundamentalists this is an interesting book. If you are looking for a book about the truth of early mormon histroy this is about as far from the truth as you can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"The man has an agenda...","review":"He claims to be objective, but I (a long inactive Mormon, and able to be quite critical of the church) found an implied equation between the extremists he focused on and the larger LDS institution as a whole. I rate it P for Propaganda.Better views into LDS life and culture are available."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Story of no Faith","review":"The book starts out telling the truth about some Mormon history.As the book progresses he quotes others and their disgust of religion,which many of us hate also hate.The replacement of gods best for us and mans best for us is unacceptable. He then leans on to a tree of knowledge, mans great wisdom. Later his attack on christianity and all those beliefs (except for giving us the modern day calendar) leaves you spinning. At the end of the book HIS truths come forth........they are....no hopes, worthy faiths, nothing except his wisdom and the culture he accepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing, biased, poorly written","review":"Right off the bat, let's get this straight: Krakauer is not a writer; he's a reporter, and not a very good one. This story involved a cult that was an offshoot of Mormonism, but Krakauer manages to leave uninformed readers with a undeserved negative impression of the mainstream Mormon church. If he's going to report, he owes it to reader to research his subject well and report without bias. As a reporter, he's a hack. As a writer- well, there's no art here. I'm not a Mormon but I live in the epicenter of that religion, and have plenty of contact with both conventional and fundamentalist Mormons - and Krakauer's account has little if anything in common with either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book on LDS and FLDS beliefs.","review":"I am enjoying reading this book, but I can only read a little at a time. It is a huge amount to process on each page. And, nearly every page has footnotes. I believe that the descriptions are very interesting and make me understand where my LDS friends come from on certain subjects. I also believe that the purpose of this book is to inform people outside the LDS faith and not to make judgement on FLDS or LDS beliefs. I recommend this book to those who are curious about the Morman religion and those who are already in the Mormon religion. I believe that there are a great deal of Mormons out there that have never taken the time to fully understand their beliefs and where they came from (ie faith in the word of the Elders and Prophets - the LDS church discourages members to research other faiths or viewpoints). I recommend this book just as I would recommend a book about Catholicism to a Catholic or non-Catholic alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under the Banner of Violence","review":"This book is particularly brutal - especially in light of the \\"religous\\" zealots that are chronicled in the pages. However, it is a stunning reflection of the times... both pre-Civil War and the current state of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening","review":"Great book! I couldn't put it down. I also read his \\"Into the wild\\" recently, that one too is very engaging and though provoking.\\"Under the banner of Heaven\\" shows how extremists in any religion take the same same messages as the mainstream followers adhere to in a literal and very violent direction. You can clearly see how the Mormon, Jewish, Muslim, etc extremists (terrorists) are the same types of hateful, narcissist, dangerous people with almost identical ideologies.The book is very well written, but can be overwhelming to some readers, I imagine, due to the vast amount of factual information woven into the parallel story lines. It will also be a quite disturbing read to LDS folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the nay sayers","review":"John Krakauer is a decent author not one of my favorites but decent. The book is well written and definitley exposes some of the darker corners of an already dark religion. Having lived in Utah for 8 years (in some of the smaller communities I might add) I can see that Krakauer did his homework.I would say to anyone read the book and decide for yourself if you think it is good. The less you know about the LDS faith going into this book the better. The Book will only make you want to explore the LDS religion further. And let me be the first to say that when you do you will find it is the most fascinating work of fiction. Jaw dropping what people believe. Makes L. Rom Hubbard look like a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful beyond belief","review":"I've always been fascinated by the Mormon faith. Jon Krakauer did an amazing job of comparing modern day Mormon beliefs with the deeply complicated story of how this faith came to be. Outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy Kindle version","review":"This book is excellent, but the Kindle version has some drawbacks.First, the footnotes. This book has plenty of them and there is no (good) way of reading footnotes on the Kindle. I can only imagine what it must be like to read David Foster Wallace on this device.Second, the maps: this book has maps accompanying several chapters. The maps are not usually necessary to understand the chapter, but they are a nice addition. Or rather, they would be a nice addition if you could make out any of the detail on them. They are rendered in light grey on a lighter grey background (on Kindle 2). Furthermore, they are heavily compressed. It is very difficult to tell what the maps are depicting and impossible to read the text on the maps.The Kindle edition is a disappointing adaptation of an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life-Long-Learner's Dream Book","review":"Quite to the contrary of most of the reviews I've read on this site about this book, I've found that Krakauer not only portrayed the Mormon religion as accurate, but also as a compelling, struggle-riddled quest for identity. At times, I felt that he sided with the LDS, and other times, against them. This is the true mark of a writing genious- to be able to sway a reader back and forth and introduce them into all aspects of the subject- not just the one he himself believes in. His accounts of the many rapes and murders associated with the FLDS are, in fact, graphic and heart-rendering, but they are also told with an essential honesty. Well researched and ingeniously written, Krakauer exceeds in this book, making the reader frequently stop, put down the book, think about the messages, and then pick the book back up, anticipating the next true twist. A must-read for life-long-learners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under the banner of heaven","review":"Regardless of religion, these are bad people, the Laffery Brothers. Jon Krakauer has used his skills as a writer to paint a picture of the United States not often seen.While we worry about other fundamentalist in the world we allow these people to break our laws, hurt others, lie, and do all those things we blame terriorists for.Readers will find their faith challenged and wonder where the laws of the United States are in Utah and Arizona are enforced.A read for all those who want to be informed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Objective and well written","review":"Krakauer did a wonderful job of being objective and interesting. I think some of the other reviewers were a bit sensitive to Krakauer's criticism of fanatics (not Mormons). Lets face it, there are fanatics in every religion, and their beliefs as individuals do not represent any religion as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is a well written book. I knew NOTHING about the Mormon faith before reading this book. I found the information to be very disturbing on so many levels.

A good book for anyone hungry to learn along with wanting to be encourage to think about the subject and discuss it in all directions. Opened my eyes and horrified me."},{"rating":"2","title":"LDS vs/ TRUTH","review":"It is most difficult for a LDS member to read a book about some of the machinations of the Mormon church. As a former LDS member, I was interested very much in the D&C 132 revelation and the \\"new\\" revelations. This is where I believe the author is at his best, pointing to the history of the revelation and then allowing the reader to make up their own mind. Did God say yes to plural wives, and then change his mind, for the government?Did God say \\"no\\" to the negro and then change his mind?This book is a facinating read, although a family tree would do well to help us keep the players straight. Some of the information is not pretty and if you are a LDS you will find it difficult, but then the truth is not always pretty. Two sides to every story? Absolutely, and that is where this book polarizes the reviewers. LDS vs. Truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is not banned in utah","review":"Despite what a previous reviewer wrote, the book is readily available in Utah. In Salt Lake City, all of the major bookstores are carrying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Story with lots of background","review":"Under the Banner of Heaven was an excellent read. I read the whole thing one lazy Sunday afternoon. The author does a nice job of weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and modern fundamentalist Mormonism with the history Mormonism. A very interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as well researched as some reviews claim","review":"I read this book and found the interviews with Dan Lafferty very interesting and chilling. However, as an in-active member (no love lost there) of the LDS Church and someone with family history in the church dating back to it's origins, I know some of the details of the early church given in this book to be incorrect. I have to question how carefully researched the rest of the information has been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good with a grain of salt","review":"I read this book after it was recommended to me by a few non-religious friends of mine. In it, Krakauer takes an in-depth look at the Lafferty murders of 1984. All the while, he also gives you what he thinks is the history of the Mormon church. I say that because Krakauer claims to be an atheist, though he sounds more like an agnostic. Either way, the whole picture Krakauer paints is with that brush. Most of the time, the bias is somewhat subtle, but a few times it jumps out at the reader. As long as you read the book with an open mind, and take it with that grain of salt, then the book is pretty good. Just don't take what he says to be the Truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loaded with errors","review":"A good read and an interesting \\"story\\" however the large number of factual errors casts a shadow over the book's veracity. Some of the errors are so glaring to be comical (i.e. Mark E. Peterson was never the LDS church's president). Dosn't Krakauer have a fact checker?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Under the BAnner of Heaven","review":"I have not enjoyed reading this book. I though it was going to be about the murder.

I am NOT LDS or Mormon. From what I have learned, this book has nothing to do with LDS, it is about the FLDS (Fundamental Latter Day Saints) and they separate themelves from the Mormons as the \\"original\\" faith. They believe they are above the US Constitution and the law. The FLDS are giving the Mormons a bad name, I may not believe the way they do but this is not their way either. These are the kind of books that confuse people and give the wrong impression. This book is so disturbing that I don't even want to give it away...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Sect in Texas","review":"I saw on the internet that there is a Polygamist sect building a Waco-Type compound on a large tract of land down in Texas as we speak.

There are pictures and videos of the compound and the current state of its construction.

Not to mention the predicted effect the FDLS may have on the way our country is run in under a century.I found the book to be a fasinating read and eye opening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book.. somewhat boring","review":"This book was a good description of FUNDAMENTALIST MORMONS... not todays STREAMLINE MORMONS (whatever those really are).I enjoyed this book and couldnt put it down. It got boring in parts where he tried to explain the family histories. (Evangeline chapter etc). I really enjoyed learning more about my own (soon to be former) religion. Many things that I did not know, or knew very little about.Overall if you want to learn about MORMONS, do not read this book. If you want to learn about freaky FUNDAMENTALISTS then read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last page","review":"What astonished me most about this book recounting the murder of a mother and her baby by her husband's relatives in a fundamentalist Mormon sect was the final page in which Jon Krakauer \\"comes clean,\\" as he says, about his own theological frame of reference. In his very last sentences he says he believes that \\"most of us ache to know the love of our creator.\\" What an astonishing statement! After recounting all the horrors that fanatical (and misguided) faith can unleash in the world, the author still feels the pull of the divine. It speaks volumes about the longings of the soul, which cannot be silenced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that Krakauer was biased in his viewpoints in this book. I thought he did justice to the Mormon faith. Krakauer clearly describes the history of LDS and FLDS, enabling us to form our own opinions about the reasons behind this indescribable tragedy. The book was highly educational - I have to admit I knew close to zero about the Mormon faith prior to reading this book. The story of the murder itself was also compelling - highly disturbing, yet incredibly interesting. A great read, especially if you're into the true crime genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cell Salts","review":"Gives brief information on the number and names of the cell salts, and a quick reference on problems and what to use.

Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never. Very predictable plot from beginning to end. And Rosie Perez was truly offensive. A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying. There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other. Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language. Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene. It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way. I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners.

This book is a welcome exception to that rule. Although the author unapologetically belongs to the dispensationalist school of thought, he is not determined to convince you of a specific interpretation within that school. He is not specifically pre or mid tribulational. He is not trying to inspire you with the soon coming of Christ. He is trying to interpret the book of Danial accurately and well. He accomplishes his purpose.I read this book over 30 years ago, when I was a teenager, and it's tone and methodology has permeated my life every since.

Souls of M misses the point that music propells rap: rap is not spoken word."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame attempt at an idea who's time has went","review":"Souls of mischielf purport to carry on a tradition that lies somewhere dormant at the heart of hip-hop. Quite commendable, but with tracks as lame and predicatable as these, it's high time to rethink the aim of your music. I have listened to this album many times to make sure I do not like it; and I don't. These fellas will never be more than local quasi-quasi-phenoms if they don't start playing what people actually want to hear. Black music moves on a dialectic boys.

Great flow and rhymes with jazzy beats and samples. These guys know what their doing but this is when they where just kids and know their all grown up and can rip [stuff] like you wouldn't belive.

Thats when these guys show you what hip hop is all about but get this first cuz its god damn good"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ MY REVIEW> > >THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING","review":"These guys impress me. . .all of the emcees in Souls of Mischeif have so much charisma that their unique voices alone are enough to do the beats justice. . .but their lyrics are amazing. They go from brag raps in \\"A name I call myself\\", to putting down wacker emcees on tracks like \\"Limitations\\". The figures of speech they use in their ryhmes are completely unorthodox and always leave you wondering about what they will say next. All of this is going on over flawless beats. Most of the tracks have a dark 1993 feel about them. . .the bass is raw but there are also some delicate melodys in a few of them in particular. \\"Live and Let Live\\" has a very classy saxaphone and piano. Something else I noticed which I'm sure not many other hiphop heads noticed was the piano in \\"Tell me Who Profits\\". . .it is the same piano in Jay-z's \\"Coming of Age\\" which he made three years later in his \\"Reasonable Doubt\\" album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong size","review":"I had to file the connector on this charger down just to get it to fit my mini.

The result is a surface that looks and almost feels the same as before but once you stand on it when wet you can tell its not slippery anymore.

She does not have what it takes to be a female latin sensation here in the States like her predecessors the late Selena, Jennifer Lopez and/or Gloria Estefan.Her vocals and songs come off very bland. It could be her producers because this production is poor and amateurish. Though Giselle seems like a nice lady I don't think she has what it take s to go to the top. She doesn't have the stage presence or songs to make her a strong pop star.The songs fall flat...all of them. I give her 2 stars instead of 1 because she is trying, but she needs a better producing team, a vocal coach, and a make up stylist, along with a publicist to help her get what she needs to be a hit.Otherwise Giselle is a bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The book was sent on time, and it cost less then other places that I looked at.

It is March 10 and a bug they (finally) acknowledged in February is still not fixed and apparently never will be. Nothing important, just the program not applying deductions to your return raising your tax payment. You know, minor stuff. The interface? Don't get me stated. Horrible. Support? India, of course. Because they are experts in US tax law.It is time to move on to another product. Turbo Tax is now relegated to the status of being a formally good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life!!!","review":"I cannot believe how much one book has changed my life! I look at my role as a wife and mother so much more differently now! Happy Housewives made me feel proud to say I am a stay at home mom. Darla Shine has given me the validation I was searching for. I feel great. I love this book. I am motivated to be a better wife and mother. I am proud to admit I enjoy homemaking. And when I think of all the years I wasted worrying about my career I could just scream. All that matters are my kids. This is my career now. Thank you Darla for the kick in the behind that I needed.Every stay at home mom needs to read this book! You will laugh your tush off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Love, Love this book!","review":"I was shocked when I started reading this book, because I thought I was the only mother who felt that being a stay at home mom is a hard job, but great. This book has great advice on how to pull yourself out of the mode of complaining all the time and take care of your kids, your house, and your life. Most of the advice given was things I actually already do (I clean my house myself, cook dinner, etc..)but it was so great to hear that someone else does, too! The book is honest, funny, and helpful. I wish Darla lived in my neighborhood! I've thought of dropping copies off on people's porches who need to read it and quit complaining about being a mom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow... This was REALLY Bad!","review":"While I agree with the author's premise - that being a stay-at-home is a vital, worthwhile and completely awesome job - I cannot believe such an unorganized, poorly written book ever made it to the printer. It was like a bad stream of adolecent drivel. Again I agree with the main idea - but the execution was terrible. Don't buy this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I've ever read!","review":"It was the most amazing book. Darla is down to earth and tells you how it is. I LOVE LOVE LOVE her book!! It made me want to be a better mother & wife and stop whinning. I'm cooking home cooked meals everynight and keeping my house perfect! And I don't expect anybodys help b/c I now know how to keep it all together. Anyways, the point of her book is for us to realize that being able to stay at home with our kids and seeing them grow up is the most amazing job you can have and you should be proud of it. I honestly think this is the all time best book out there!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Honest","review":"I stayed at home with my children and agree with Darla's message that if you're lucky enough to be home with your children, enjoy it and put your best effort into it. Was/is my home as clean as Darla's? Was I always groomed and coiffed? Probably not, but the point of being a \\"Happy Housewife\\" is that taking care of yourself, your family and home, is an important job and you should do it in the fullest way that gives you satisfaction. Read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me embarassed to be a stay-at-home mom","review":"I'm only on page twenty of this seemingly endless rant of a book and already two things are very clear: The author is what my mother would call \\"a piece of work\\" and not in a good way, and she makes an awful lot of assumptions about other women.For someone who admits to bungling her children's early years by being a \\"self absorbed brat\\", she certainly pulls no punches on judging other women. So far this book seems to be nothing but fodder for the \\"mommy wars\\" that continue to rage on both sides of the stay-at-home/work-outside-the-home issue. Women need sisterhood and solidarity, not belitting assumptions about how the other half live.This book makes me embarrassed to be a stay-at-home mom. Heaven forbid anyone thinks that this speaks for the majority of us.I'm really glad I checked it out of the library and did not waste my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the money!","review":"Darla Shine makes some good points but is annoying in her message. Her bossy tone isn't too great either. We're all not a size 4, or want to be, and simply telling her readers to not eat crap isn't helpful. I also found her recipes to be simplistic and using too many processed ingredients for someone who claims to believe in the value of organic foods. And to blame the feminists for \\"selling us a raw deal\\"?? If only husbands and our government got on board with childcare and housework things would be quite different. Darla Shine's views are one sided and unresearched."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think millenials and younger can relate to this ...","review":"I really can't understand why someone would give a career as a television producer (my dream job!) to stay at home and be a housewife. I would be miserable too, except I would solve it by going back to work and making my husband pull his share at home. Newsflash: the world doesn't work like this anymore, Darla. Men and women are equals and husbands and wives are partners. Why should the woman be expected to sacrifice everything for her husband? Ridiculous pile of sexist rubbish. This should come with a warning label, what a bad example for young women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite sure about this bigotted attitude","review":"Shine seems to criticize other women who don't agree with her. That is Bigotry any way you look at it. Very disappointed that \\"Sisters\\" of all races and stations in life cannot love, respect and support one another. I gave the book to goodwill, maybe someone else will benefit--"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I was expecting","review":"I really wanted to love this book but the writing was horrible. I am surprised the editor let this book slip through the cracks. I thought the premise was good but wish the writing was a bit more professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the More Affluent Only...","review":"While I commend Darla on her decision to stay at home, her targeted reading audience is highly limited. Cutting costs means doing without the nanny, housecleaner, and cooking meals using organics. When the author initially stopped working, it meant days at the gym or the salon. Her discussions and examples are limited to those who have chosen to give up a well paid career to stay at home. Her \\"bargain\\" store examples for cutting costs in clothes is way above the Walmart budget or second hand options for many American families choosing to live on one income.My suggestion: Save your money on this one unless you are in her income bracket. Currently, there are many good books written by women who truly understand what it means to raise a family on one income. It can be done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, but not for the average","review":"I thought the book was funny and laughed out loud reading it to my husband. But..... I am a not so upperclass work at home mother of three. I need help with reality and the fact I will never be financially rich like her. I was hoping this book would be more open to everyone but I definately think she wrote it for a certain group."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!","review":"Do you love to hear spoiled women talk about how hard they have it with thier maids, nannies and how you should dress like them, eat like them, and reform your style of thinking to be exactly like them...THEN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU! Super annoying Darla Shine spends 90% of the book telling us how fab she is!!! She tells you how other people repulse her because of the way they shop, eat, act, and dress then goes on to give such handy tips as you can wear sweat pants as long as they are tight?!? She also seems to have some pent up agression towards the television show, desperate housewives, taking the title as a personal insult. Darla is most definitly desperate but a housewife...no not really... SAVE YOUR MONEY and call the meanest most shallow woman you know instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"I saw this book on the clearance rack at a bookstore and picked it up, really hoping that I would enjoy it. I wanted to so badly, but couldn't make it past page 40. Every page was the same thing, over and over again. And what's with the \\"I'll talk about that later\\", 4 times by page 18? I'm shocked that this would even get a publisher. It was nasty and full of rude references to other women. \\"I wanted to ram my cart into her fat a**\\", a direct quote! I'm a housewife (not yet with children, but hope to be soon) and enjoy it, I just hope other women don't judge us all on this horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone could have written this","review":"I was really disappointed that I bought this book. Anyone could have written this. Sure, it has some great points, but come on, she's not exactly qualified. I agree with another reader that she is very shallow. Complaining about women who weigh over 118 lbs. isn't cool when the average woman in America is a size 14. Some of the advice was good and made sense, but to me, the writer seems to be a bit self-centered and not aware of the world around her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, redundant, vulgar, and ignorant","review":"Other reviewers have done an excellent job describing almost everything I hated about this book. The thing that finally made me toss the book aside, though, was a little gem that simultaneously destroyed her credibility and cast serious doubt on the credibility of Susan Powter (although I will give her the benefit of the doubt until and unless I actually read Powter's book and confirm): \\"A few years ago she wrote a new book, *The Politics of Stupid*.... She taught me how to eat real food, not a bunch of processed junk. She gives oatmeal as one example. She says everyone thinks oatmeal is a healthy food, but did you ever hear of an oat tree?\\" (p. 44) What the.... Seriously? Where does she think oats *do* come from, a lab? Anyone that ignorant should not be giving advice on healty eating habits. Just my opinion.So disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give. Me. A .Freakin. Break.","review":"If you purchase this book you will be seriously throwing your money out the window.Darla wrote this book for one simple reason....validation. Her husband is NEVER home and has a very high powered career. So Darla came up with this little diddy about how important she is and how vital she is to the survival of her household. Yeah Right. Here are some hot tips for those of you who stay at home:1)Buy tight tee shirts2)Clean your toilet3)Have sex with your husbandSee what I mean-rocket science at its best!!I am a stay at home Mom or SAHM as it has now been coined. I also run a business from my home. I spend money on clothes and makeup. I work out 4 days a week. These are really not things that I needed to spend $25.00 on to learn.Save your money and do whatever it is that makes YOU happy and whatever works in YOUR household under your circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the die-hard feminists, but not a bad read, either.","review":"I'll be honest; when I originally picked up this book, I was very apprehensive. The premise *sounds* good - helping housewives to find happiness with their lives, but what I was afraid of was that it was just going to turn into one of those \\"the man is the head of the household; long live testosterone!\\" books that seem so prevelant these days.Happily, Darla Shine seems fiesty, frank, and full of good ideas. Now, I won't kid you - she is quite vocal about her faith in god, the belief that women should be cute and slim, and feels that feminists are pretty much on the wrong track. I didn't find any of this overpowering, however; it's more like the occasional rant, that I would just skim over. In the end though, I think she makes some good points, and is definitely on the right track, even if her personal philosophies don't *quite* jibe with my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this book was even published! Don't buy it!","review":"I just finished chapter (or step, in her book) 1 of Happy Housewives. And after getting through these first 15 pages I'm left feeling anything but happy and wondering how the author, herself, can say she's happy at all? Her tone is completely negative, crass, offensive and (to use one of her choice words) downright b*tchy! This woman is a horrible writer, for one. I have a hard time believing this book was written or edited by anyone with higher than a jr. high education. The first chapter was spent repeatedly bashing the show \\"Desperate Housewives\\" and using offensive language in doing so. While I agree with Mrs. Shine's underlying values in choosing to leave to work to raise her own kids, staying in a faithful marriage, etc... I cannot accept this woman as a voice for the stay-at-home mom. This is not the type of book you want to buy if you're really looking to be a happy housewife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I'm not sure how this book got published. It is wordy, redundant, and often contradictory. In her chapter intitled \\"Make your Marriage a Priortiy\\" she says to \\"have sex together and that is pretty much all you need to do.\\" She recommends that women stop being \\"bitches\\", yet spends much of this book bitching. I think she is trying to be funny. I laughed aloud while reading this book, but not because of the author's wit. It is neither funny nor poignant. Try \\"Mitten Strings for God\\", or \\"Busy But Balanced\\" if you want some meaningful advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Changed my life","review":"I got this book for my wife for Christmas because she is a stay at home mama. It changed my life...as soon as she saw the book title she said she wanted a divorce. She homeschools our three boys and never watches TV. She is very devoted to our faith and reads many books. It was the first time I ever made her cry. This book really bites. Thanks Darla, now pay for my divorce attorney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just two lines of browsing....","review":"and I was shaking with rage. I had strayed on the lines where the author stated that she never considered daycare because her mother nagged her with bad things about it. I literally couldn't read any more. Whether a woman, or man for that matter, chooses to stay home isn't the point. Unless the grandparents are a. paying the bills or b. doing the childcare, butting in like that is uncalled for. If I'd been her, I don't know what I would choose, but I would have told Grandma that unless she wants to not see the kids again until they are 18, she stops nagging me about my parenting."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Too Can be a Happy Housewife!!","review":"This book is the absolute final word on being a stay at home Mom. It is an easy read, filled with great tips and simple steps to getting back your self worth and creating your own idenity while raising your children and being a viable part of your marriage. Darla clearly states that this book is NOT for working mothers so if you are a working mother the material contained in this book may not apply to your situation, although there are some very good points that definately could be utilized by working mothers as well as stay at home mothers. I loved it and found it to be an outstanding alternative to the public perception of the \\"Desparate Housewife\\" that is currently being touted as the distorted reality.Burn your leggings and your sweatpants and buy it-You will NOT regret it:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"She doesn't sound so happy to me...","review":"Shine's book is riddled with judgmental, egocentric opinions that she declares as fact without exception. It must be easy to be a housewife when your husband is making 6 figures a year and you have the financial freedom to basically do anything you want. She totally eliminates any minority or overweight audience in favor of her perfect Stepford Wives perspective. Sorry not everyone has fancy makeup and a gym membership Darla. We don't all look like you. But please don't roll a shopping cart at me because of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Readable","review":"I had high hopes for this book as it looked like it was right down my alley (I'm a happy stay-at-home mom), but I found myself annoyed more and more while reading it. All she seems to do is complain about other moms who complain and it comes off hypocritical, rude and unprofessional - not something I would expect from a published work but more from an online blog. Almost every chapter starts with something like, \\"I can't believe moms today do this\\" or \\"I am shocked at how many moms do that\\". Accept it, Darla, moms are imperfect. Her book comes off more like an angry rant rather than a helpful book. She is also a very poor writer with weak organization. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money!","review":"Loved this book, the only thing that would have made it better was to have photos or illustrations. For a book that isn't \\"conservative\\" or especially \\"religious\\", most of her beliefs lean very far that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I embraced my SAHM title!","review":"After reading this book, I felt empowered. I formerly resigned from my job this year and have been struggling w/guilt. This book helped me embrace my decision and gave me ideas about how to be an even better SAHM. What I found reassuring was that I was already doing most of the things suggested and it gave me insight into what I want to change. Although I still don't buy the idea of needing to clean all by yourself, I found most of Darla's comments hit home. It was one of the best reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"How busy can you be?!?!?!","review":"This book tells it like it is for us working moms. Yes, I'm a \\"working mom\\", working on my duties as a wife and mother. I'm not \\"a career woman with kids\\". How busy can you be? Was asked of me by a close friend who works full time and has two kids in daycare. My friend is a career woman with kids. Those women who call themselves working moms don't know or understand.Darla Shine really understands and gives us the support we deserve. Stand up and be proud of who you are and what you are doing!!!!! You GO GIRL!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good information, but a little crude","review":"I got this book to affirm my choice to be a stay at home mom. I am so blessed that I can stay home, but sometimes the drudgery gets to me...as it does so many other moms/housewives. I wanted to try to focus on the blessings of being home and taking care of my family, instead of the negatives. This book has some very good information to offer, but the author can be very crude and negative. Some of the words she uses really turned me off, and I ended up putting the book away because of it. I get it back out sometimes if I need a little pick me up, but I try to focus on the good parts and skim over the bad. Overall, I would not recommend this book. One that is full of the positives about being a mom without the negatives is \\"The Momstown Guide to Getting it All\\". Would definitely recommend that one over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"I really wanted to like this book because I am also tired of all the whining that goes on (especially if it is from me). However, the author was shallow, random, hypocritical, and annoying. I agree with the premise that we should all encourage each other to be stronger and take pride in our role as Mom, but this woman is not qualified to hand out the advice. She is amazed that anyone would go out without makeup but admits sending her kids to school without brushing their teeth. She also admits to letting the skip school to watch a movie.This books was so shallow in its recipe for happiness beginning with tight t-shirts and lipstick. It did not resonate at all with any kind of love or joy in what she does. She was petty and mean throughout. It reads like an emotional rant of things that bug her. I really cannot believe anyone published it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desperate Housewife no more!!","review":"Ok, I wasn't really that desperate, but the reminders in this book about what being a HAPPY housewife is all about were fantastic. Darla hits the nail on the head and doesn't beat around the bush. I am blessed to be at home with my kids and this book helped me remember that! Darla is no-nonsense and she's not apologetic for her views! Her sassy charm shines through the pages and makes this a really fast read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This book has really good advice for the housewife, whether you're taking care of kids or an aging parent (like me). Although the book isn't written that way, I use her advice for creating a happy home and dealing with children and apply it to my life. Thanks, Darla!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I have never written a review for a book in my life, but three chapters in and I feel compelled to say something. I am also the authors target audience. I'm a married stay at home mom, my husband and I are wealthy, I am pretty, stay in shape, cook my family healthy meals and keep my house spotless. That being said, I really am quite turned off by this book. It's basically just about the author bragging about how perfect she thinks she is, and I find her to be quite arrogant. I live in the same way that she does, but I would never go on and on bragging about myself as she does. It's really quite discusting. It's as if she thinks everyone should aspire to be just like her. I find her constant praising of herself to be quite a turnoff, and will not continue reading. It's a shame, because I'm always looking for fun books to read to entertain myself with, but this will not be one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"she sounds kind of like a stuck up know it all","review":"Even though the author annoys me I kind liked the book. She is really just saying common sense but her way of writing kind of gives the impression that she thinks she is the perfect wife. It was ok"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This book is GREAT! It is a wonderful perspective on how to simply be happy. It is a gentle slap in the face. The combination of common sense and \\"duh\\" moments this book brings to the surface makes you wonder why you haven't been doing that all along and how easy it is to make just a few changes for a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Planet Do We Live On and In What Era?","review":"Disappointing. This is a shallow book by someone who appears to be a smug narcissist. \\"I am thin. I look good,\\" she says in the beginning of the book. But what about her qualifications as a writer and \\"expert\\" on the subject? For an unusually intelligent exploration of keeping house, read Cheryl Mendelsohn's \\"Home Comforts.\\" And leave the psychology to psychologists. All this author seems to know about marriage is how to manipulate men with sex. She thinks men -- and life -- are so simple that a woman merely has to do \\"the nasty,\\" as the author so eloquently writes, with her husband and she will get anything she wants. I just hope she has no daughters. What a sad lesson to pass on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Note to Sean Hoade Below","review":"Based on your other book reviews, you seem portend to adhere to Buddhist teachings, and Christian, which means Compassion, not judgment and wishing others harm as you do, so unnecessarily.

A good album all-around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous debut album","review":"If you are a fan of R&B; music there is no way you can give this album less than 5 stars. It's a classic. The crazy thing is it's not even R. Kelly's best album. That honour belongs to his self titled 1995 release.12 Play boasts the smash hits Your Body's Callin and Bump N Grind. But it also includes other quality tracks like Summer Bunnies, Sex Me and It Seems Like Your Ready. There is also a great tribute song called Sadie which is a nice change up from the sexually charged theme of the album.This album really launched the career of R. Kelly and put him on the map as one of the powerhouse r&b; acts of the 1990's and early 2000's. High recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 10 Album Of All Time","review":"Just a classic CD on this one. Wow, from start to finish, this album is just loaded with tracks from \\"Your Body's Callin'\\" to \\"12-Play\\". My favorite track is \\"Seems Like Your Ready\\", a slept on classic song. To me this is where R. Kelly starts production spree of songs from Hi-Five's \\"Quality Time\\" on. Of course, the two stand out songs with the remixes for \\"Bump & Grind\\" & Your Body's Callin'\\". So please get this one because it is a definite can't miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST R KELLY CD EVER !!","review":"This is the best r kelly cd ever in my opinion, its hard to pin point R kelly because he really has written, produced and remixed some of the best song out .....He is the closest musical genius right under Prince."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff!!","review":"When this album first came out, it was hot!

Kelly rules no matter what any one says.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album , NOT HIS BEST....4 STARS.","review":"This album is a great album, a classic because of Songs like:Bump Grind, Your Body\`s Calling, Sex Me I & II and 12 Play track.Really this songs makes R.Kelly 12 Play ...But get me wrong this is Classic R.Kelly Bump N\` Grind Album so you know what I talking.

They get the ball teed to the right height for her and they're easy to find after the shot due to the bright orange color. However, this color can actually be hard to see if you're red-green color blind. She plays 3-4 times a week and can get a set to last a year before replacing. The downside is the brush bristles tend to splay out over time so after about 3-4 months it can be a challenge to get the ball to stay on the tee.

The Lacosta stick grappling techniques in the fifth or sixth video (can't recall which at this point) are worth the whole price of the set by themselves, not to mention all the other material.

There is little effort made to build on previous vocabulary, no grammar, no breaking down sentences into pieces, no review, just one sentence of random (to me) sounds after another.I can't believe anyone can learn a language with this CD. Maybe, just maybe, if one listens to it 25-50 times, but there has got to be faster ways.The phrases themselves are OK, not great.

One simply cannot just listen to this and be able to tell what they're actually saying, even in cases where one may have heard some of the words before. The words and phrases are only given once, so there is no chance to reinforce learning or disambiguate the sounds. I recommend the Living Language Korean \\"Complete course for Beginners\\", which comes with a small (but very good) book and a set of CD's.

The vagaries of the market and the stress of spaning widely divergent genres have forced him/her into some very awkward positions, to say the least. First, he/she is derided as a sell-out after the runaway worldwide success of her Thriller album two decades ago. Then, to restore his street cred, he resumes the bad@ss macho posturing to give a shout out to his homeboy Osama, thus giving a delicious frisson of aging enfant terrible to his already schizophrenic image. But all those years of groping little boys and slicing up his face to look like Diana Ross have rendered the carefully crafted image permanently bogus. Castrati can never become gangstas again, no matter how many hormone injections they take at Swedish transgender clinics. Miss Swish should have stayed in her closet and faded into well-deserved obscurity.

I was very happy when I first bought this. It worked great, coffee tasted good, I only had to make coffee once in the morning. Unfortunately, a few weeks after we started using it, , it started \\"re-perking\\" my coffee when it wasn't supposed to, several times a morning, and burned it - YUK.

Problem is 2 years down the road it is no longer working and in need of parts and the only part available is the spigot for $9 which is not what I need. I figured that for about $100 it should have lasted better than 2 years and if I could get the parts I at least would still be able to fix and use it.

In fact I like weird. This book however, was way out there and not in a good way. It tried to be lyrical prose - kind of sing-along style with no coherent flow. I was disappointed because I like the idea behind the book and the cover piqued my interest. This writer has talent but it felt like she was cooking up a bunch of hors d'oeuvres and then serving them without a tray, napkins or toothpicks.

It was a little too weird and not in a good way. I was bored by some of it and I didn't really see the point.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"...and so was I","review":"I read these 5 star reviews and the synopsis and couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I like odd. I read the first few pages/chapters and thought it was \\"different\\", but kept waiting to be taken away to a dreamland carnaval.

Very interesting premise, but I was quite disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"This is such a well done book! There is a preface with interesting information about the author which, in my opinion, makes the book even better. The book is printed as hand-written in the author's pen, a nice personal touch.

She is already outgrowing this cars seat, and she is always sweating in this seat. It is easy to use, but for the money, I thought I would be able to use it longer than what I'm going to be able to use it for. She was almost 7lbs when born and was cramed into the seat, I had to take the head support out right from the begin because the seat is so narrow, you don't need it anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"TWIN mom- son hated his seat at 4 mo, daughter at 5 mo.","review":"I love my Peg Perego Duette stroller, and the Primo Viaggio car seats snap right into it, so I was happy as a clam, until 4 months, when my son was so \\"hunky\\" that he no longer fit into the seat. I had to buy a convertible car seat for him (which is not even as nice as the clip in's because you have to completely take the baby out EVERY time you run an errand). My daughter is more petite, but she got fussy in her car seat by the age of 5 months. I know people with the graco car seat system and they are 7 months along and STILL fit in the car seat. So, I truly wish this seat would have been wider. I agree with other reviews, these seats weigh a lot too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Carefully","review":"Think carefully when deciding on what car seat is appropriate and works best for your child and your vehicle. I agree with the other posts regarding how quickly a child will outgrow this carseat. I am very disappointed in that respect.On another note, I am not at all impressed with the ease of the harness system which I seem to spend a great deal of time untangling after every use. This may be common in most carseats, but this one is incredibly frustrating! I also want to cmment on the tension-fastening system... it doesn't work very well, and upon pulling to increase the tension, the \\"button\\" mechanism broke (trust me, I am not that strong).There are several other brands out there that I should have given a closer look at before I purchased this one. This just goes to show you that simply because an item costs more, it doesn't mean it is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I definitely feel that this seat is worth the extra money over the other popular seats. It seems to have more cushioning and just feels more substantial. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the seat is warm. My son (who is 3 months now) sweats terribly in it, which is a problem since we live in Florida. He outgrew the head rest rather quickly, but he also had great head control and he hated the head rest -- I think he felt too confined. The only other drawback about the seat is its weight - very heavy. A plus is that it fits my Maclaren Global stroller very nicely. All in all, a good, safe seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my babys life","review":"I was given the car seat from some friends of my parents. We had just had our 3rd child..unprepared..call it a suprise baby and had nothing. The seat was much better than any I used with my other two children. The baby fit so snuggly and it is perfect for undoing and readjusting straps. She is a hearty girl..now over 14lbs at 3 months and fits perfectly in the seat. I can set it on grocery/shopping carts and it is easy to carry (besides the weight of baby). We were recently in a major head on collision totalling our van. The baby and my 4 year old were in the car and because they were in the safest car seats they both survived. My baby I believe was truly kept safe by the carseat. It is a sturdy, secure, excellent made seat and although I would not have originally put the money out myself for such a pricey seat with the 3rd child, I would now. I recommend it to everyone I know. There is no price for safety and it's the best seat out there for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from Primo","review":"For starters the instructions are vague. It is very difficult to remove and install outer cover to wash. Difficult to get in and out of the car. Doesn't fit in our stroller or shopping carts. Is uncomfortable for the child. The straps constantly get twisted. My daughter is now about 16 lbs. that combined with the need to wear cold weather clothes will not fit. I would have returned it except it was given to us as a gift from a close friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many problems for the price","review":"For the price I paid for this car seat, I wouldn't have expected so many problems. The canopy doesn't cover the babies face as far at it should and continues to slide back as the baby is pushed in a stroller or snap-n-go. The handle is very hard to move and the head rest never stayed in the shape it was suppose to. After putting my infant in the car seat, I would have to spend several minutes trying to fix the head rest around his head. Lastly, the fabric is very hot and the seat is heavy. Save your money and go with a less expensive seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel system","review":"This travel system is very easy to use! Make sure the car seat works in your car before purchasing. The new base does not work in some cars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great,but not practical","review":"Love the fabric and look, but the car seat is very heavy, and I was very disappointed to find out that you can't travel without the base. What a pain it will be to lug this heavy car seat & base when I travel! The Pliko stroller is five stars though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only good thing is its safety rating!","review":"We have been using both the infant seat and it's matching stroller now for three months and I am anxiously awaiting my 3-month old son to outgrow it! The only positive thing I can say about this carseat is that is is definitely SAFE. However, it is much heavier than other brands and because of it's super-thick padding, it is hard to get my 15-pound son in and out of it. He's 25 inches long and just about reaches the edge of the seat. This carseat is also VERY heavy, and more importantly it does NOT have any fabric or anything on the handle with which to hold on. This makes it necessary to hold the carrier in the crease of your arm. I do NOT recommend this carrier. The stroller is also not one I would recommend. It is very compact, which is its only positive attribute, but it is difficult to snap-in the infant carrier to it. I will NOT be using our Peg carrier nor stroller with baby #2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is a great seat. It's easy to latch in your baby (once you get the hang of it) and get a good, snug fit. Our son would fall asleep in his car seat almost immediately every time we drove anywhere. I never had any trouble taking the seat on and off the base, or snapping it into the pliko stroller. Also a huge plus, it is compact enough to fit in smaller cars -- we have a vw beetle. The only drawback for us is that this seat is only for rear-facing use, and really is only suitable for newborns and smaller infants. Though peg perego says it can be used from birth to a year, at six months our son outgrew it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"We bought two of these carseats before the baby arrived. We thought we were getting the BEST for her. We were so upset when she CRIED AND CRIED every time we took her anywhere in the car! After six weeks of this, my mother finally suggested that this carseat might just be too snug and uncomfortable for the baby. My husband bought a Graco infant seat, and our lives changed for the better! Our baby was VERY UNCOMFORTABLE in this very snug, small carseat. Don't spend the extra money on this when you can get a better carseat for less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"We purchased this seat for my son because we liked the other Peg Perego products but my infant son cried every time we put him in the seat. It was impossible to keep the belts open to put him in - we had to drag the belts and buckles out from under him. He was hot and uncomfortable and hated car rides. I switched him to my older Evenflo seat and he loves it, naps in it and likes car rides. I share this with everyone I know and hope others can skip such a costly mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Inconvenient","review":"Don't waste your money. This carrier is very deep and narrow which causes my baby to overheat easily and makes it very difficult to get her out of, which causes an otherwise calm baby to scream. It is also heavy and difficult to get in and out of the car. The sun guard is so short that it's useless. The seat is so small that I'm sure my baby will out grow it in a matter of weeks, not months. Two of my girlfriends purchased the same seat and have the same opinion. Reconsider buying this and look at Graco-they are much easier to deal with!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Quality but Much Too Small","review":"I purchased this car seat that fits nicely into the Peg Prego stroller. I was extremely disappointed to see that my baby out grew the shoulder area in less than 1.5 months. He was only 12 lbs and 23\\" long when he was no longer able to fit in it. I have been using my sister's Evenflo car seat and it is much more comfortable. I realize that safety is one of the reasons for the snug fit but if the baby cannot fit in it or if he/she cries everytime you put them in it, it really doesn't justify the purchase. Therefore, I have a brand new $... car seat in my basement that I will probably never use again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabric Too Hot","review":"I really like Peg Perego products, & believe they are of good quality, but the fabric on this carseat makes the baby way too hot! I had to have my mom make a cotton insert for it to help keep baby cool & that has made a big difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot!","review":"We bought this carseat and matching stroller. We love the stroller. Our son is uncomfortable and hot in this carseat. We have recently purchased the Britex Marathon. Hopefully he will be more comfortable in the Britex carseat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Petite buyer beware!","review":"Mu husband and I did a lot of research before purchasing the Pliko travel system witht the Primo Viaggio car seat. We selected the Pliko travel system because we loved the lightweight stroller, and knew Perego was top of line in quality.Our big mistake - I never tried removing the car seat from the car base before making our purchase. The release mechanism on this seat is probably the worst design in the history of car seats. If you have small hands like I do, you will be unable to remove the seat from the base without tremendous difficulty. I was completely exhasperated after 30 minutes of trying! We returned the travel system, and were so frustrated that we gave up on Perego, and are now in the process of looking at other brands. My advice - try the release before you buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it","review":"My husband and i truly love this car seat. We haven;t had any issues with overheating altough our son was born in cold January. He was a big boy weighing in at 9.4 lbs, and he is quiet comfortable in this seat. Now at 12lbs we are still satisfied with our purchase. Saftey comes first and if that means he only uses it for the first 3 months of his life, so be it. We would certainly reccomend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Car Seat","review":"My sister and brother-in-law loaned us this seat when our baby was born (they kept the rest of the travel system), and it worked great for us. It was easy to install, and very easy to strap our baby into. If you have a higher car (like our SUV) then it can be a bit of a struggle to lift the seat out if you're on the short side. If you don't want to spend the extra money on a travel system, or you got your seat second-hand like us you can purchase a universal car seat carrier (Kolcraft makes a great one for $30.00) that adjusts to fit up to 12 different infant-seat brands. We used this with the seat until she outgrew the seat, and it was a great investment. When we have another baby we can just purchase an infant seat to use with the stroller frame. All in all, we were very happy with the carseat."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth the $$$","review":"No question this is a great car seat for us. With a child that has always hated the process of getting strapped in it is a lifesaver not having to complete the task with each stop. I truely don't find it heavy even with my little one reaching 15 lbs. I welcome the workout. We have the venezia stroller as well and are certainly getting our monies worth. I absolutely love the system and dread the day we can no longer use it.

I LOVE PEREGO STUFF BUT THIS IS HORRIBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I chose Peg Perego because I wanted the best for my first baby. Plus it was the only brand that had descent colors. I didn't want navy plaid. What a waste of money. The seat is very heavy and the base is very difficult to install. If tightening the baby in while the seats already in the car the plastic around the release button pops off every time. I bought the Atlantico, Peg Perego stroller to go with the carseat, also very disappointing. The way the straps are designed with a piece of plastic that hooks them to the back of the stroller seat is a total design flaw. Now that my baby is 3 months old and can sit up the plastic stabs her in the back of the head. All Peg Perego strollers have the same strap design. I would get rid of the stroller and buy some other kind if I didn't pain nearly $$$ for it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HOT!!!!!","review":"This is not a good infant seat, very small. My 3 month has already grown out of it at 1 month (13 lbs) It's not worth the price. I was expecting to use at least a few months. The material is the worst, baby gets SO HOT!!!!!!! and very fussy. The shade is very small does not cover at all. The straps are useless, once you get the straps over baby, poor kid can't even move. Don't even look at this one, it is so not worth the money......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not user or baby friendly","review":"(1) My newborn baby was only 7 lbs when he was born and was very cramped in this chair.

The second worst decision was buying this one to begin with. Trying to buy only the best for my son, and knowing that Peg Perego products are highly rated, we opted for this seat.We could never get him comfortable in it. He cried and screamed every time he was in it. It was painful to take him anywhere. The straps were impossible to adjust. He was always hot and he outgrew it before he was 4 months old (and way before the 20 lb, 26 inch limit). Once we got him into his Britax Roundabout convertible, I was able to go out of the house again. He actually laughed during the first trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst carrier EVER","review":"this is a review from a father who has been using this for over 3 years on 2 children.I wish I can give 0 star! but there is no option for one star.the shoulder padding constantly rotates and eventually the shoulder strap digs into your shoulder.

Kim Kashkashian, a masterful violinst (for the unitiated try the soundtrack to Ullysses' Gaze, a classical CD so achingly beautiful it evokes new emotions with every listen), adds exquisite accompaniment over subtle evocative percussion. The resulting music is moody, meditative, sometimes melancholy, sometimes exultant. This is ECM jazz close to its very best. The only thing that stops me short of a five-star review is the absence of a pianist -- and Garbarek has played with some of the very best. Doesn't matter. Take this CD on its own terms and you will be hard-pressed to find anything more heart-stirring in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despues de tanto tiempo.......","review":"Mi pimer contacto con Garbarek fue en 1976, escuche de una sentada los albums (todavia en vinil): DIS con Ralph Towner y FOLK SONGS alternando con Charlie Haden y Egberto Gismonti, para mi fue toda una revelacion, me parecia una musica con un sello especial, de ahi en adelante fui un fiel seguidor de Garbarek, me parece un musico que lo puedes identificar, porque Garbarek solo suena a Garbarek. Pasaron 5 largos anos sin noticias discograficas y ahora me encuentro con IN PRAISE OF DREAMS, la verdad, esperaba una obra mucho mas elaborada, con mas produccion, con mas elementos de novedad (musicos nuevos, sonidos distintos, etc. Me gusta este album pero la espera fue demasiado larga para el producto que entrega.

I hope his wonderful talent will be widely discovered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as he is live.","review":"I've seen Joey Edwin perform locally and he is quite good...smooth voice and guitar. This CD is not representative of what he sings live...perhaps mostly because it is his own stuff...the lyrics are horribly simplistic and the music is not much better.

Wow...what a major dissapointment! This movie is terrible...let me qualify myself by saying that I enjoy bad films, Plan 9, Astro Zombies, bad horror, etc. but his movie is BORING! They spent all their time on a boring melodrama about Toulon as a young guy. The actor who plays him is a boring, \\"pretty-boy\\" whose french accent makes you want to string him up and make him dance! The only good thing about this movie is the hot chick.... The puppets look awesome but no CGI or stop-motion from David Alan just boring real puppet action which is fine for a 5-year old but these things are supposed to be alive. Please don't waste one dime on this one, if you're curious like I was simply rent the VHS. Be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Retro Piece Of...","review":"This film is really not even worth the time it took to write this review, however, it has been written to prevent some poor individual from actually having to see what I saw. It has bad accents, bad dialogue, laughable costumes, wretched effects and minute amounts of violence. The dolls, retro or not, just plain [...stink]. The dark clad villians are even worse. I usually enjoy Full Moon videos but this is one that should have never been given the green light."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all abot the RETRO","review":"Personally, I liked PMR. I wouldn't say it was the BEST out of the Puppet Master series, but you must understand the fact that the character Toulon is in fact a storyteller...which is what he's doing in this film. When you take the entire series under the light of Toulon telling a story with his wonderful puppet friends, it gives the Puppet Master videos a sort of creepy Captain Kangaroo vibe. It's like Jim Henson came back from the dead to teach us that we shouldn't have made Elmo the star of Sesame Street...All I can tell you is that watch each Puppet Master movie with a fresh eye. Forget about what you saw in a previous PM movie, and take in the new story line. It's like watching a new Puppet story. Each film is special in its own way, just like Toulon's lovable, mighty puppets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BACK TO THE FUTURE/ RETRO","review":"THIS WAS A FUN FILM!

I LOVED THE OLD THEATRE AS WELL AS THE SNOW. I FELT AS IF I WAS IN A LAND FAR FAR AWAY. A FRIEND SAID IT LACKED HORROR AND BLOOD. I THOUGHT IT WAS REFRESHING TO SEE A REAL LOVE STORY INVOLVED IN A HORROR MOVIE. IT WAS AN OLD TIME HORROR MOVIE AND I LOVED IT. IT WAS ORIGINAL AND HEARTFELT.

It's not even worth watching unless you like watching hot guys crash in burn in such a horrible movie.

However, this was his worst book ever. There were so many characters in this book that I couldn't keep track of them all and finally got so frustrated that I didn't care who they were. Of course, being a die hard Robert Parker fan, I read it to the bitter end, but it wasn't worth the effort it took to turn the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intaglio","review":"The best part of this novel is the dialogue, some of it, although I find Hawk a bit tiresome and overdone. The worst part is the contrived plot. Perhaps there are too many dead bodies, to the point that the initial murder loses its importance and focus.Spenser is not my favorite detective, I might add. He's tough like Mike Hammer, smart talking like Lawrence Block heroes, egotistical, boastful, and never loses a fight. A few flaws might help him.This novel started to drag about halfway and I could scarcely wait to finish it, not to find out whodunit but to be dunwithit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Potshot","review":"I thought Potshot was an indication that Parker no longer felt the need to write a good book; this one solidifies my feelings. I guess he'll continue as long as people buy his books--but this one is a dog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"parker misses by a mile","review":"This latest novel in the suspense series tries to generate a more complex and intricate plot than some of the previous outings, which tend to be notable because Spenser and Hawk are so honorable and the \\"bad guys\\" so deserving of the punishment they receive. But here the killer remains in the shadows throughout, and the reader feels no genuine satisfaction at his eventual defeat. A real disappointment! What a relief that I checked it out of the library and didn't actually but it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Braithwaite is Crazy -- WIDOW'S WALK is boring","review":"He may be a TOP 500 reviewer, but Kent Braithwaite's review of WIDOW'S WALK is way off the mark. This is one of the most BORING installments in the Spenser series, and this comment is coming from a die-hard Boston Red Sox and Robert Parker fan.There are several outright grammatical errors and typos in the book, which leads this non-TOP 500 reviewer to conclude that a) it was a first draft of the novel or b) his editor(s) are getting lazy.Save your $$$; wait for this to come out in paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing 'Walk'","review":"This might have been a relativly reasonable book if Mr. Parker had bothered to use an occasional adjective or adverb, or cared enough about the quality of the writing to do something other than pages of dialogue consisiting of 'Yes', 'Yes?', 'Yes'What a cheat.We learn nothing new about Spenser, Hawk, or Susan, we only learn that Pearl the Wonder Dog is growing old. Aren't we all.If I could give this so-called book a minus star, I would. Parker has proved he CAN write. Why didn't he?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spenser Is Old And It Shows","review":"Larger than usual print, huge margins, a dying dog, a boring Susan; she's even worse than usual. Spenser must be in his 60's, closing in on 70, he did fight in Korea in the 50's after all. Parker writes as if Spenser's still around 40 and it just doesn't work. The young punks would run him and Hawk--another old man now--into the ground.Maybe Parker needs to set his next Spencers in the past, so we can see him again in his prime when Spenser was so incredibly original and exciting.This book is a huge disappointment to those of us who have followed this series from the very start.Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Parker's Best","review":"Another reviewer started the review with \\"I love Mr. Parker's books\\". I agree, especially Spencer books, however, \\"Widow's Walk\\" does not measure up to earlier Spencers. The storyline is old, Susan is tiresome and I, for one, am tired of Robert B. Parker using Spencer and Susan to lecture us on how poorly homosexuals are treated by the rest of the world. Bob, we read your books because they are smart, clever, and captivating, not to hear your sermons. A second problem with \\"Widow's Walk\\" is that we don't even see the bad guy's name until the end of the book. How can we begin to solve the crime with you if the charaters aren't introduced?I am glad to see Spencer back. When the next one comes out, I'll rush out and get it and read in an evening again, but when I am bored some evening and go for a reread, it won't be \\"Widow's Walk\\". Please Bob, its time for another \\"Catskill Eagle\\" or \\"Judas Goat\\". I can't recommend \\"Widow's Walk\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punchy","review":"Just as he must have staggered to his feet when Ezzard Charles was beating the crap out of him way back in '49, Spenser lumbers back into the ring for a few more rounds after a couple of out-of-state beatings (i.e., \\"Hugger Mugger\\", \\"Potshot\\"). He's back on his home turf, looking fat and sassy before a hometown crowd. The whole entourage is in his corner, pulling for a knockout. At first, he looks pretty good, dancing about, landing a flurry of jabs, but then his legs go dead, the clinches are more frequent, and soon he's sleepwalking. Yeah, there's some blood. The crowd always loves that. At the end, his punches go loopy; he's huffing and puffing, covering his face. Then you realize that it's all an illusion: once again old man Spenser's only shadow boxing. These ancient fighters, they gotta know when to hang up the gloves."},{"rating":"1","title":"teribble cd","review":"this cd is so horrible,i would never pay money for it. i heard some songs at some little kids house and it was so pathetic. he should stick to basketball, cause at least there he has skill, and people actually admire him(playing basketball). he should stop rapping, it's gonna ruin his carreer, not that he really has one though. dont buy this cd it's very pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't have ToysRus toys but I had enough love.....","review":"Shaq attacks with a verbal bark.

I can't recommend this masterpiece highly enough. If you're looking for a good quality album to listen to, this is it.

President Reagan was a man of substance, who believed in America, capitalism, and the capability of the individual, and this will continue to be an enduring legacy of his. He distrusted government, and he knew, just like our Founders, that a government that was not constrained would attack the freedoms and liberties of the people. That is precisely why this book is so important. When you read Reagan's letters, you can see that he is articulate and clear in his views of government. This book is even more important today. I suggest reading it. Even those who consider themselves Democrats have a lot to learn -- especially since Reagan voted Democrat most of his life (including for FDR)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating look at one man's view of history","review":"Reading this book, its impossible to escape a few conclusions. First, Reagan was a very warm and cordial man. Regardless of your political views, his decency and civility are very much missed in today's Washington. Next, Reagan was obviously someone who has a grasp of his material. Whether you agreed with him or not, reading this book and others that have reproduced his correspondence, speeches etc. that he drafted personally will forever shatter the mythical \\"amiable dunce\\" that his opponents were quick to embrace. Finally, I got a much better sense of the Reagan the man than any biography I've read so far. Interestingly, one gets a MUCH better sense of Reagan the man and the President than from his autobiography, which was fairly mediocre in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Communicator in Action","review":"An amazing collection of Reagan's letters, from childhood to retirement, on subjects both grand and minor. I was surprised by the magnitude of his correspondence; his ability to succinctly explain his position on a variety of issues was exceptional.So many people dismissed Reagan as an uneducated cowboy. This collection of Ronald Reagan's personal correspondence demonstrates his unsurpassed abilities of self-expression and candor, as well as his heartfelt love of America and the freedoms for which she stands.An excellent read for anyone, regardless of where they fall in the political spectrum."},{"rating":"2","title":"great information from a U.S. hero","review":"This book contains several letters written by Ronald Reagan himself. It is educational and interesting. Regardless of a person's political opinions, this book comments on an important time in American history.

After a search on the internet I finally found the instructions and it sounded cute so we got it. The barking dog house acts as the spinner, you press on the top and count the number of barks and that is how many spaces you move your Clifford pawn. The four Clifford pawns included each have a different color dog tag and you have to find the three bones (out of 12) that match your Clifford. The cutest part is that you use your Clifford pawn to pick up the bone. Each pawn has a magnetic nose so when you touch his nose to the bone he picks it up, revealing the color on the bottom of the bone. (My daughter was amazed that he actually picked up the bone!) If it matches you keep the bone, if not, the bone goes back on the board.I agree that the manufacturer's age is too high. I'd say 3-5 years, as long as you don't let the children put the CHOKING HAZARDS in their mouths."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad merchandise","review":"It was said to be new but when it cane it had a sticker on the movie saying please rewind! when i put the tape in there was static very loud!

I just purchased it and viewed it again, and I still love it. The scenes I can't forget are two different times when Kate and Patrick are running from their pursuers and the twenty-something Patrick refuses to let go of 13 year old Kate's hand. He could easily flee without her, she so obviously slows him down, but he refuses to leave her, even to the point of picking her up in desperation and throwing her over his shoulder. For some reason, that does something indescribable to my heart.

Great concept, great cast, great performances, great dialogues (i.e. the one between Bill and Susan about forgetting your mind and listening to your heart...), great sound track. \\"Meet Joe Black\\" is a movie about death.

'Wake up call' is memorable for many reasons not the least for the guitar of Coco Montoya and Mick Taylor. The stand out tracks include 'Nature Disappearing' a rework of an earlier Mayall track which features the magical playing of Coco Montoya and 'Not at home' a great song featuring Mick Taylor. Also check out the live album 'Life in the jungle' as possibly the best Mayall album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Mayall collections ever.","review":"While not actually a 'blues' album, the roots are not far away.

While having each Russian expression repeated might have added somewhat to the length of the recording time it would have been well worth it to the user. And, in exchange, they certainly could have saved some recording time by largely eiminating lession 1, which spends an inordinate amount of time explaining why one should learn a foriegn language, how great this product is, yada, yada, yada.Also, even with my limited knowledge of Russian I can tell they are not accurately translating from English into Russian. For example, the English \\"I want a map\\" is translated into the Russian \\"I want to buy a map\\".

The video kept \\"freezing\\" and even reached a point to where I actually had to turn off my dvd player because the remote wouldn't function due to the defective dvd. I've read up on this set and apparently UNIVERSAL PICTURES has severe quality problems with their box sets of past tv series. Kind of bums me out, not only because of NIGHT STALKER being a stinker, but also because I was looking foward to the release of ROCKFORD FILES on dvd but will not purchase ROCKFORD because it is produced by UNIVERSAL. Do not waste your hard earned money on this dvd set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Night Vision Needed For Night Stalker","review":"As much as I love the original Night Stalker series I am extremely disappointed with this DVD release. The night scenes, bar scenes and any scene shot in low light are very dark and pretty much unviewable. I hope in the next year or two the studio re-releases this series first taking the time to digitally remaster it to lighten up the dark scenes. I love Night Stalker but this release is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE of Kolchak DVD!","review":"I won't bore readers with my assessment of the Kolchak TV series - you're reading this because you're already a fan. That said, yes, it's great that Kolchak has finally been released on DVD. HOWEVER,Universal has taken drastic steps to market the series as the \`inspiration' for X-Files. Namely, they've jacked up the contrast and DRAMATICALLY darkened each episode, to the point where the premiere episode (The Ripper) is actually hard to watch (people wearing dark suits sitting on dark desks blend into one, and so forth). This DOES have a few advantages - it certainly \`ups' the \`spook' value of the show and conceals artifacts of some of the more shoddy monster suits used in the series. But all in all, the quality of this release is no better than the excellent Columbia House video transfers of a decade ago. Image detail is adequate, and contrary to marketng hype Universal has done absolutely NO restoration work. Shame on the studio! Purchase Kolchak with caution!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great content, fair video quality","review":"With the advent of a new Night Stalker series starring Stuart Townsend, it only makes sense to become reacquainted with the original series starring Darren McGavin. While the new Kolchak: Night Stalker lacks the witty repartee of the old series -- and has less charismatic actors -- the old Kolchak has stood the test of time with its quirky cast and kitschy special effects.The video quality leaves much to be desired, however. Frequent problems with stopping and/or artifacting proved to be an annoyance, but the content still makes up for the DVD's technical short-comings. The worst part of this whole series was that, sadly, it had to end.This is one boxed set I'll be watching over and over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and camp","review":"Fun and campy--vampires, werewolves, mysterious beasts cross newspaper reporter Kolchak's path, but he's the only one trying to awaken the world to their nefarious presence.Darren McGavin is perfect for the role: world-wearily crusty, yet willing to chase down the monsters and win a Pulitzer for his efforts at reporting this hidden world of inexplicable creatures. Alas,\\"Who'd ever believe it?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional 1","review":"These DVD's were everything I remember when they were first televised! A must have for all true fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"forensic buff","review":"I really enjoyed the short-lived series on television. It set the beginning for the \\"X Files\\" It is a big change of pace for a while. Darin McGavin if funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"1974 Cheese TV at it Best","review":"I was ten years old when this came out and loved it. It ran for two seasons then was syndicated. I would catch it at night and arrive late to school occasionally. One must view \\"The Night Stalker\\" with a great sense of nostalgia. It is mid-seventies TV and comes with all the bad acting (not by Darren Mcgavin) poor lighting and effects many shows of this genre have. The Stalker covers all the bases; were wolves, Indian spirits, aliens and robots to name a few. It’s a fun series that has good stories and has a haunting musical score that runs throughout the episodes played by different instruments. I plan on giving these to my Mom when I am done watching. Enjoy the Stalker with your favorite cocktail. Fun stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kolchak rocks!","review":"1970s \\"melo-horror\\" that amuses today. Darren McGavin had the role of Carl Kolchak nailed. He had a cool car, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darrin McGavin at his best","review":"When this series aired, it was one of the few reasons to look forward to thenext episode. Darrin McGavin was a remarkable actor who made this comealive. The topics of interest for a sleazy tabloid reporter were amazing andsensational; Kolchak was always hotly in pursuit of the next story; his editoralways skeptical. Hugely entertaining, even today. No cell phones, no computers, no word processors or IT professionals; just great stories and acting. Quite a few guest appearances by well known stars of the era also made this series one to remember. Kolchak wih his manual typewriter and beatup straw hat was truly a formidable combination! Watch it and see......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as I remember","review":"What more can I say? The show is a flashback to my teen years. No, it's not award-winning production, stories or acting. But it is lots of fun. If you like cheesy, not-very-scary horror with a good sense of humor about itself, I'd recommend Kolchak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took me back to the 70's TV","review":"Kolchak the Night Stalker was a staple of my TV watching in the mid-70's. This set of all 20 original episodes is fantastic. The acting and special effects were ahead of its time. The combination of comedy and horror make this set worth watching, whether for the first time or re-viewing.Cameos by actors such as Richard Kiel, Dick Van Patten, Dick Gauthier and Victor Jory add to the overall success of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the ratings","review":"This Seller's ratings are high, and deservedly so. Excellent transaction in all respects. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kolchak The Night Stalker the complete series","review":"This is in regards to the complete series box set I just purchased. As other reviewers have discussed the picture quality, my gripe is in accord with those that have incountered the freeze problems.I took a chance on perhaps getting one that would pass muster (should have read more) but guess not! The first disk froze up twice and I haven't even looked at the other two disks as I don't collect flawed copies for my collection. This was a good series...I guess Universal Studios hasn't heard of quality control?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A childhood classic","review":"This show had a lasting impression on me as a 10 year....it scared the crap out of me.Seeing it as an adult I see how bad the writing is and especially the special effects, but still love watching it.I now see why Darren McGavin quit the show !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remastering","review":"I loved this old series. And so when I did a search and found it here on Amazon I was very excited.I must say that others say that its not very good remaster,but I dont know i guess they have bad DVD or TV because I found the quality to be excellent. The pictures are crisp and clear even the nighttime scenes.If you love this series like I do you wont be disapointed.I highly recommend this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Night Stinker","review":"FACT - this series stinks the big one. ITEM - this series was so bad even the guy who played him wanted out. After a promising start, a parade of UFO's, rubber lizards and werewolves turned it into Irwin Allen on a bad day. Which was, lets face it, most days. Often shambolic in execution, McGavin mugs it up shamelessly to paper the cracks.I give it a star for some witty lines and the dog episode which I rather liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the series, very happy with purchase.","review":"I grew up watching this series and loved Darren McGavin's offbeat Kolchak character. The story lines and production values are a bit cheeky, but this is part of the overall appeal. Have to agree with other reviewers regarding the transfer; there are some fairly dark scenes in this series and they didn't always transfer well, especially on my home TV (59\\" plasma). Otherwise, I would highly recommend this series. I stream the series using my original Kindle Fire, the new Fire HD 8.9\\" with no issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darren McGavin, enough said","review":"This is a creepy TV show that was made before the advent of computer generated graphics and the kind of advanced make up that they use now. Instead of using technology, they used excellent writing and acting, and made good use of their wonderful actors.Kolchak works for a news agency in Chicago. He is a rumpled, unruly, and daring journalist who sees the monsters when everyone else refuses to admit they exist. He takes matters into his own hands and risks his life to destroy the creatures. Of course, he also wants a good story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"What can be said about this classic series from the 70's? The stories are just the right mixture of mystery, suspense, and humor, unlike the recent attempt to remake the franchise into a more serious horror series. Darren McGavin is Kolchack. I truly believe he made this character his own. Yes, sometimes the \\"monsters\\" are a bit cheesy and the plots, characters, and costumes are very much stuck in the 70's, but that's okay. It is a character tied to an era that tried to make the occult seem more real world like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie and Campy Blend Made for Great TV","review":"Few shows where able to blend the eerie with the campy as well as this 70's classis series. The scripts are never as good as the two original TV Movies, but they are good, especially McGavin's narratives. The acting by most is standard stuff with some wonderful \\"guest stars.\\" McGavin himself is always believable and likable and he sadly died at 80 in the Spring of '06. He was a terrific character actor and this release is a nice memorial to his talents.The sets and make-up are either appropriate and atmospheric or they are laughably silly. This series is a guilty pleasure kind of thing. Just buy this thing and enjoy vintage television and have fun with a bowl of popcorn and your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can write a good review when I like something","review":"Just for the record, this is about the only TV show on DVD that is actually worth owning. Okay so they made only so many episodes, and were only on one season. But this show was rather unqiue in that it was about the paranormal, but it did not take itself too seriously. The make-up and costumes might seem a bit fake, but hey this is 1970's television, a little bit of cheese can often go a long way and with Darren Mcgavin and Simon Oakland play off each other as well as they do, you can watch this show and not take it too seriously. Forget about Scully and Muldar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"A little pricey for such small samples but it came prompt and the products are all of great quality.

This book was so full of mistakes, either in dates or forms of address, that I couldn't seem to warm up to the love story. Never mind that the heroine's name is actually a male's (Alexandre), or that she is the most selfish character I have encountered in a while. The \\"romance\\" takes place during the French Revolution, Alix flees from her chateau to Paris after the murder of her father, she is rescued from near rape by Rafe (an English Earl turned merchant). What follows are 300 pages of innane dialogue, unbeliavable situations, ohhh... did I forget to mention that Alix is pursued by a villain? Bad, bad, bad. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"I liked the writing, the pacing, the story. I could feel the silk, hear the angry mobs, feel the fear. The interaction was believable; Rafe and Alix, as well as a rich array of secondary characters, were multi dimensional. The historical setting added depth and excitement. The writing was intelligent and even.I look forward to more books from this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aburrida","review":"No hay dudas de que el autor sabe escribir, pero al parecer no tiene qué contar.

Round 1 is from Mission Raceway, Mission, BC. Round 2 is from The Wastelands, Nanaimo, BC.These are pretty much the standard broadcast of the MX1 and MX2 classes from each round, as seen on SPEED TV. This is not a bad thing as they are well produced and full of good MX racing action in various conditions.The stars of the series were Jean-Sebastian Roy in the MX1 class and young Ryan Villipoto in the MX2 class. This was the first season of the new classification (from 250 and 125) and some of the 4-strokes are starting to show their heads, but the majority of bikes are still 2-strokes.Each race episode features a \\"freestyle\\" montage to some decent new music and there is a podium and interview bit at the end, but this is primarily just good hard racing.The better value is to get the 2-pack with HIGH VOLTAGE RACING for $10, which has rounds 3 and 4 of the 2005 CMRC season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"I paid almost $300 for the toilet because it has a 4\\" flush hole instead of 3\\".

It was very easy to get into and I could not put it down. I never even considered the idea that someone would move back to Germany during WWII until I read this book. Elanor's insights were extremely interesting because it allows us to see a first hand American view of what was occurring in Germany at this time.Elanor was a very brave girl and should be considered a role model for children everywhere. This book should be a school assigned book because of its historical value and literary merit.Elanor's Story is definitely not your typical Holocaust/WWII book.

I have read numerous books that are from a paritisan's perspective, a survivor, a prisoner, etc. But NEVER have we considered the emotions that went on actually inside Hitler's Germany. This is a must read book for all WWII buffs, and other people besides. Eleanor went through hunger, starvation, and always fearing for her life as well as the lives of her family.

If you are a fan of Bruce Springsteen you will like the hoarse screaming and loose guitar chords. Allright, a few places the guitar shines but the melodi lines and the broad chrorus style singing drags it down into the pit of trivialities. Sorry!A single track, \\"Pain and Sorrow\\" shines though but boy it was hard to get to track 9.

Yes, Jack is the man I want to sweep me off on those adventures. Yes, yes, yes!!I was always disappointed that Mary Brown did not write any other historical romance. Her other books were fantasy and though good could never compare with Playing the Jack. To call it a holiday read, demeans this book.

These headphones are great for me because I don't like just the earbuds--they don't stay in my ears. These however stay in place. They are also great if you only want one headphone in; you can easily hook the other on the front of your shirt to keep it out of the way, but still handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality","review":"Good headphones. they stay on your ears & sound great.for the price, i think they are the best on the market"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Like some of the other negative reviews, I couldn't get these to fit well. No matter how much bending and manipulating the ear piece I tried, they just fell out of my ears anytime I moved. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but bad design","review":"I think these headphones produce excellent sound. If you are not moving around too much when you use them then I think they are a good choice. However, if you are buying these for workouts I think it would be wise to look elsewhere. The \\"bud\\" portion of this product is large and heavy compared to the clip so it winds up resting way outside the ear canal and will pretty easily fall out of place. I find myself needing to constantly adjust them while running or at the gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound and good fit","review":"I really like these headphones. I was upset when I broke my old headphones because I didn't think I'd find another pair that worked as nicely or fit as well, but these fit the bill. I use these on my Creative Zen, so I listen to music as well as movies. The sound is great for such a low price. I wasn't expecting that. I figured I'd hear a tinny quality, but that wasn't the case at all. I love the way the earclips go around my ears, just like eye glasses. They are better than having earbuds that pull out very easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not perfect","review":"I used this for about 2 months and so good so far. I jog about 3x a day and these do move around however it's better than the non-sports clip because at least they don't fall to the floor. I have to keep adjusting them constantly. I'm hoping the panasonic ones would do better staying in my ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earphones for the gym!","review":"This is the third type of earphones I have purchased within a month and these work really great! If you are just interested in listening to music while working out and not worrying about sound quality, (such as having the bass be powerful in your ears) then these will be perfect for you. I have small ears, so it was nice to be able to bend them into the shape I needed for them to stay in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"$50 ???","review":"I got these two years ago. They were $12 then.

I'm not expecting much, especially since I only use them for running. But, the buds themselves have this funky oval/diamond shape, and they constantly fall out of my ears, even after I spent a good deal of time adjusting the wire behind-the-ear holders.

I have been trying to find headphones that you can run in, that will stay put, and sound good enough to block out others when you run in the gym.

The clips will hold them over your ears just fine but they sound rather weak if they aren't in your ears. They seem too big and keep coming out of my ears when I run/rollerblade.Edit after seeing a couple comments after mine:I'll agree they do not fall off my ears because of the clip, which is why I originally thought they'd be good for running. The problem I have is with the actual bud coming out so they are closer to just hanging over my ears. There is a big difference in volume/sound quality when they are pushed tight in my ears compared to what I would consider \\"falling out.\\" When they are not pressed in tight, I have to turn the volume up and they sound more muffled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Quality Sound","review":"Not much to say. The quality of sound is amazing. These headphones are THE only ones I use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sturdy, but otherwise not that great","review":"I've been using these headphones for a few months at the gym.Pros:- They are sturdy and well-made.- Sweat does not seem to bother them.Cons:- They don't fit well in my ears. I don't have a problem with most earbuds, so this is unusual. The buds are large and the earpieces don't give much support on me - they fall out easily.- The earpieces are not adjustable.- The sound is just not good when they're not in your ear canal. No bass at all, and the other frequencies are muddy.Summary:I would not recommend these for those looking for good sound. I would also not recommend these for people doing vigorous activity where they're likely to fall out."},{"rating":"1","title":"If my ears were bigger...","review":"...I might be able to give these more stars. I can't comment on the sound quality because these just don't fit well enough to tell. There's no hope of my using them on my runs.

They stay on my head very well while working out and are adjustable to fit many different shapes and sizes.If these break I'm still not going to complain. You know why?

In this day of high definition video one has to wonder why there are so many companies getting away with riping of the customer like this one does. I'd sooner pay double to get a real high def video.

It came out 15 or more years ago on VHS, if I remember right. The overall production quality and level of performance might not be as polished as what you would see today in most martial arts videos, but for it's time it was a good introduction to the style. A basic white crane form is presented, and a two-man form is shown which was interesting as it shows the footsweeps. The white crane style has very many forms, like choy li fut, and I don't know what this one is as I'm not expert at this style, but it would have been nice if they had said which one it is. Also shown are the basic stances, footwork, hand and foot techniques. White crane is considered a very refined style of kung fu. In such a brief introduction, it's impossible to go into that level here, but overall, a decent intro to the style from a time when there wasn't much else out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patch Adams - Collector's Edition","review":"Really like this movie a lot.

This is one of the worst movies I have ever sat through. The way this story is put forth is just way too far fetched and almost insulting.

I can't believe anyone wouldn't want to take a shower after the scene where the \\"terminally ill\\" children show up to his hearing with the red noses on. How bad of a movie maker do you have to be to take a true story and make it unbelieveable. It's ironic that a movie which touts non-conformity is made up of formula and cliche.

Fairness is an essential part of who Como is. My conclusion is that if Mr. Williams were really a doctor he would be smart enough to know that it is futile to try to kill the world with his movies. But, in my humility, Mr. Williams is doing an ok job at it. During my second viewing, I ruined my new leather sofa with glass shards from my popcorn bowl...but these are pointless details. I simply ask: Why does Robin Williams want to kill the world with this relentless attack of disease-spore \\"movies\\"? In case I haven't made myself clear--and Como isn't always clear--I didn't like this \\"movie\\", nor it's disease.

This is a heavy-handed, incredibly manipulative movie that somehow most everyone bought into and loved. Unbelievable. Robin Williams overacts so much that you can almost hear him screaming for an Oscar. This isn't the type of film that wins awards, it's the type that's made to win them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MOVIE THAT SAY'S ONE PERSON CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE","review":"This movie invokes the belief that one person being themselves and being happy who they are can make a significant difference in this crazy world. It shows that compassion and love are not dead and that it's okay to become emotionally involved. It was truly a touching and warm movie which I hope will result in people trying to emulate this type of behavior.

Granted it did get dramatic at one part, but the drama didn't drown out the comedy. This is one movie that really made me feel good. Bitter people, and bitter reviews really don't do this film justice. If you don't buy it, do yourself a favor and atleast rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never saw it coming.","review":"This was the best movie I saw in 1998, period. I went into that theatre expecting some good laughs in classic Robin Williams style. And i received just that, a performance that reminded me of his old stand up routines. The comedy was historical, something that many othersa will try to live up to. But it also brought me to tears, something I never dreamed I'd do in a Robin Williams movie. This movie was perfect, made you laugh, made you cry and was emotionally charged through the entire length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patch Adams is a unique individual.","review":"One word to sum up my thoughts of this movie....INSPIRATIONAL!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding storyline very touching movie","review":"Robin Williams played a very good part in Patch Adams.

Not only it is funny, but also very inspiring.I am studying medicine and I see myself in Patch Adams. It always tears me apart when I here that we are supposed to behave like heartless machines. Patients sometimes need a friend more than a doctor. \\"We must learn to treat the patient as well as the disease\\"; \\"Our job is improving the quality of life, not just delaying death\\" are some of the ideas I had already thought about before watching this.And relax all of you: the fact that a doctor is much friendlier than usual doesn't necessarily mean he is less competent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment...","review":"After Robin Williams's Oscar winning performance in \\"Good Will Hunting,\\" it is depressing to see him in such a trite, predictable film. Though \\"Patch Adams\\" isn't without its amusing moments, these scenes aren't enough to sustain the movie. The film attempts to manipulate the audience with cliches and over-the-top emotional zeal, the worst being the scene with the butterfly. Okay, maybe that's NOT the worst...the scene in which Patch defends his right to graduate goes way too far. It is clearly included to give Patch one more chance to stand on his soap box, and it is, perhaps, the least necessary part of the film. Also, the attempt to recreate the emotional pathos delivered successfully at the end of \\"Dead Poets Society\\" (when the students all stand on their desks to show their support for their teacher) by having former patients come into the room wearing clown noses falls flat. Overall, I do not recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stinks on ice","review":"I do think Robin Williams is a unique talent but his messianic complex is getting out of hand. I am not suprised that this manipulative piece of fluff was made or that it is bad, but the adoring reception given by much of the American public astonished me. However, the number of people who loved this film does give insight into condition of the American political system and how we wind up with the leaders we do. For this film, there should be a zero star category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly trite.","review":"I am completely stunned by all the positive reviews of this movie. I guess the American public is not very hard to please. Robin William's silly antics left me cold. If Patch Adams was supposed to be such a feel-good movie, why was I in such pain every time he put that stupid enema bulb on his nose? I found myself desperately hoping that the real Patch Adams was nothing like that. I have not seen such a painfully awful movie since \\"North.\\" Everybody keeps talking about these tearjerker scenes. Did I miss them? Maybe I was too engrossed in my own agony."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad, sad commentary on public taste","review":"This movie is intended to be a charming, witty, uplifting tale of a doctor who sees the whole person in his patients. What it ends up being is a marathon session of a guy being a dumb jerk to the professionals around him. I thought the part where his cult-like views get his girlfriend killed was especially charming. It was a nice touch that he feels sorry for himself and glosses over the fact that it was his ... world-view that got her killed.This movie was bad, not for the style or the directing. It is bad because of the terrible dogmatic hippiness of its message. This \\"fight the establishment\\" [material] wasn't useful in the 60's and it is equally trite and puerile now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mentally Senile and Challenged","review":"There's nothing funny about this short-sided comedy.

While at times it may be hard to believe, I think the deeper message behind the film is very important, especially to those in the medical field. So what if doctors get emotionally involved with their patients? Being in the medical profession myself, I often find that things can be too cold and scientific. It's very refreshing to see a doctor who cares, a doctor with a heart. So while Robin Williams' character may be a little obnoxious and even somewhat unbelievable at times, this movie is downright heartwarming and inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin Williams at his best !!!!","review":"\\"Patch Adams\\" is a wonderful film.

Through his schooling, he is faced with many people that say he is not serious enough to be a doctor.

Bun B's rugged flow and menacing lyrics nicely offset Pimp C's playalistic style. The beats are strictly playa beats that you can ride to or just chill and bob ya head to. Never corny and always on point. Pimp C is definitely an underated producer. Every song bumps but the classics are \`Return', It's Supposed To Bubble, I Left It Wet For You, Feds In Town, and Front Back Side to Side. This album, being nearly ten years old, does not have a dated sound and wouldn't sound out of wack on a mix cd of recent songs. It would fit right in.

Where so much that is written about the experience of new parents is advice driven and vaguely judgmental, this book has the perfect empathetic air. So many times while reading this book I would think \\"oh yes, that is exactly what I have been feeling!\\" My only advice to expectant mothers would be, buy this book, wrap it up, and give it to yourself as a gift for that moment when you are back home with your new child!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only negative thoughts and perspectives","review":"I bought this book thinking it would help me to understand the different aspects of raising a child in the first year.

I understand that the author was perhaps trying to be realistic and I am sure that many of these statements are in fact true.

Telling the story of Grace Marks, she spins the controversy every which way, in trying to discern her status as murderer or merely accomplice. We are drawn into Grace's world, gently, effecitvely, and honestly, as she spins us the tale of her life as complexly as the quilts she creates.Atwood's writing style is crisp, clear, and creative, making for an diverse and interesting read. Her descriptions are amazing, and at times, you feel like you are reading poetry in prose. Her command of vocabulary, as well as comand of accurate historical facts, all lends itself to a well-told tale.You cannot miss this read.

I also really liked Atwood's style of writing & the way she inserted letters into the narrative which helped the characters to come alive. This is the first book I have read from Atwood & previously I had the misconception that Atwood was chick-lit. This novel has it's basis on true events regarding a murderess in the 1800's & the attempt to find out not only if she committed the crime but also if she was insane.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read in a long time","review":"Alias Grace is a very serious but wonderfull book. Grace is as real as a character can get. Ms. Atwood has written many fine books but this one is the best so far. I haven't read all of them yet. Lady Oracle was given to me by a friend and since then I've read six more books by Margaret Atwood. Buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice and Simon the conundrum of their lives.","review":"As the story of Alice and Simon unfolds, I was drawn to a conundrum of whose lot was more dire. Alice, held in the confines of the penitentiary or Simon, confined by the conventions of society. Each created a life that met the expectations of others, they never seemed totally independent but more dependent on their ajoining ensembles, and the paths these characters chose. Or was this the real story? As I read the novel new layers appeared, sudden revelations made me question who faced greater difficulties Alice or Simon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Detailed but Ponderous","review":"The opening chapters filled me with hope for the remainder of the novel. The language was lyrical and satisfying, with an intrguing story which, one hoped, would reach a decent climax and conclusion. However, as the narrative progressed, we're overwraught with unnecesary detail, page after page of unreal recollection and boring prose. The book segways into a disappointing monotony which leaves the reader cold, no longer interested as to the fate of the protagonist. What's more, I found the book frustrating to read because of Atwood's inability to portray male characters accurately. She seems to believe that every man walks around with highly debauched and fetishised views of women. The ending is disappointing, yet somehow satisfying. It takes a good deal of effort to drag yourslef through the closing chapters, but here, at least, the narrative has some direction. The book is very long, unnecessarily long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Book","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. As you get deeper into it, each character gets more depth with a surprising end. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Atwood Turns Out Another Winner","review":"I've never been a huge fan of fiction. Biographies, history, reference and non-fiction fill my bookshelves. However, of the few fiction writers I read, admire and respect, Margaret Atwood is my favorite. I've read every one of her works with Alias Grace being the latest. It's a definite winner. How many authors can make you care about and root for an alleged cold-blooded murderess? Atwood has that wonderful talent for making her characters a part of the reader's life, like a best friend, and that includes Grace Marks. I found myself wishing I could invite her and Dr. Jordan to dinner because they were so intriguing. The book takes you on an honest and fascinating journey into the mind of a compelling woman. Loved the book! Love Atwood"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Atwood's best","review":"This is not Atwood's best book by a long stretch. 'The Handmaids Tale', 'the Robber Bride', and the especially exquisite 'The Blind Assassin' are much more enjoyable. This book is slow, and does not have the wonderful turns of phrase that her other books have.While she does a good job of leaving the reader guessing as to the guilt or innocence of Grace, the question, of course, cannot be answered (being a true story) and leaves you disappointed. The prelude to the crime (Grace's history) is the best part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Played Out","review":"You've read this book already. Trust me.Alias Grace is too pretentious and long-winded, even for Atwood. I could see others enjoying this, but it's too tame and contemplative for me.

But if you want to read her best work, read Life Before Man, not this unnecessairily dense and pointless tome. I have felt that ever since Atwood \\"sold out\\" to Hollywood for the HORRIBLE, SOULESS film of Handmaid's Tale, she has lost something significant as an artist and this book simply proves that. I was especially disappointed by the TEAM of people she had working for her on this book. Is that how ART is created these days? With corporate teamwork? I have been shocked at the great reviews for this book. As if people have been blinded by the sheer size of the book and Atwood's reputation. Don't buy into that. If you must read this book (and believe me, you won't miss anything by not) save your money and get it from the library. At least then if you can't bear to finish it, you can take it back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A suspense thriller this is not!","review":"I read The Handmaid's Tale and hated it. I bought this book because the newspaper reviews were terrific. I struggled to get through it. The prose of course is excellent. Otherwise I would rate this book a 2. This was not a mystery.

I won't reveal the twists and turns, but, at least in the book on tape version, there are few true surprises. That it is based on a true story makes it more interesting. But, reliance on dream symbolism and hypnosis are overwrought and overused techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"Whereas Oryx and Crake fasinated me, Alias Grace frustrated me.

It's the mid 1800s and women aren't subject to the death sentence, only the living death of perpetual mistreatment in the asylum.Skipping between Grace's past, the murky events surrounding the murder, and her present in which everyone is obsessed with Spiritualism, Alias Grace shows just how much crazier the world was when it was directed by spooky and morally pretentious feelings.

Though no one who reads Atwood should be surprised by her orderly, logical, deeply considered characterization, Grace Marks is a new high in Atwood's repetoire. Atwood's word play also flits around the book, and riffs on certain terms reflect and reverberate with studied meaning. I won't spoil it any more for you. It's an excellent book.If you like deep, creative, intelligent literature, try the following:Rabid: A Novelby T.K. Kenyon,Sex Wars: A Novel of Gilded Age New Yorkby Marge Piercy, andOrlando (Penguin Modern Classics)by Virginia Woolf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expertly written","review":"You really have to give credit to the author for this book. The Canadian society of the nineteenth century is portrayed with detail, thanks to the research carried out by the talented Mrs. Atwood. This clever writer uses many techniques which contribute to the originality and the uniqueness of this novel, like shifting the point of view from Grace to Dr. Jordan, or allowing us to read the letters exchanged by the various characters of the book, which I really enjoyed. I also liked the idea of including the transcripts from Grace's confession and other accounts, which neatly frame the story into the real events.Why not five stars, then? I am not sure, but I think that the murder story did not really grip me that much, and Grace was a slightly annoying character. I was much more interested in Dr. Jordan, his findings, doubts and fantasies.Overall, a great book, wonderfully written and highly recommendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolutely Fantastic Book","review":"Alias Grace is an extremely well written, very entertaining tale of murder and deception. Although the story was hard to follow at times because of the changing time periods and narrators, the shifting only added to the wonderful sense of mystery and intrigue in this novel.I couldn't put the book down, the suspense was wonderfully executed.This book is not only entertaining and a source of unique Canadian history, but Atwood cleverly relates many themes of the period novel back to our modern society; reflecting on issues such as stereotypes and sex roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Margaret Atwood's cure for insomnia","review":"This book was ordinary and a bit boring. It wasn't thrilling or unusual in any way--which is why I read Margaret Atwood. It really didn't make me think--it read very much like a documentary. The pychiatrist didn't really add to the story, in fact, he subtracted from it. The prose is beautiful, which is the only reason why I finished the novel But, if you are expecting Margaret Atwood's typical style of weaving an intricate, chilling yet realistic plot, and shocking you with her vision of reality--this is not the novel to read. It was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful cover, horrible plot.","review":"I am a huge fan of Margaret Atwood's. \\"Alias Grace,\\" however, is a large disappointment. The psychiatrist is boring, Grace is undefined and underdeveloped, and the ending is completely unsatisfying. The only reason I haven't sold it at a garage sale is because the cover is gorgeous. This novel is not worthy of the Atwood name. Read \\"Handmaid's Tale\\" or \\"Cat's Eye\\" instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alias Grace by Margaret Atwood is an enticing story","review":"I'm always eager to read anything by Margaret Atwood because of her sincere understanding of not only the female spirit but of the soul of humanity. In Alias Grace Atwood gives us the voice of Grace Marks as she moves through her Victorian life. Grace is convicted of participating in a news-making double murder. Atwood's story is based on an actual crime and she complements the tale with real - and sometimes raw - human emotions. A doctor searching for his own identity looks into Grace's psyche with experimental psychology for the mirror that will reflect his purpose. Grace herself remains ethereal and spirit-like throughout her narrative. Was she a murderer? Is her confusion and innocence a ruse to disarm those around her? Because these questions aren't clearly answered the readers of Alias Grace are captivated by every word, every incident, every symbol. You'll want to start reading this book again after you've finished the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Atwood!","review":"Alias Grace is a great novel. I reviewed for my local libraryand when I saw the size of it, I thought this is going a longand really boring book.

You wouldn't believe how manynights I was up to 3 or 4 in the morning because I couldn't put thebook down.The only problem I found with the story was at the end, I felt theauthor was grasping for material slightly.

I like to be informed, but I prefer to hear all sides of an issue so I can make an informed decision. I was hoping for a news magazine that goes a little more in depth than, say, Time Magazine.

Excellent bonus: each song has a reference or two to a recorded source, so you can hear the way it's done by pros. The only negative is that occasionally the version of the tune (or its transcription) is over-simplified, or, in some cases, a non-standard version.

If you're a beginning skater who wants clear instruction off the ice, Figure Skating for Dummies will meet your expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative Book by a Champion Skater!","review":"Kristi's book, written along with the help of her coach and a sports writer, is a must-have for the person who loves to watch figure skating. In easy to understand terms, along with photos and diagrams, Kristi explains jumps, the different disciplines (men's, women's dance and pairs), judging, basic skating, conditioning, coaches, great web sites...it's all here! I've had my copy for a year now, and have referred to it again and again for clarification on many issues (was that a lutz or a salchow?).I've been watching figure skating since Peggy Fleming won the Gold Medal at the 1968 Winter Olympic Games in Grenoble, France, and I thought I knew a lot. I was wrong!For the armchair fan, this is the only book you'll ever need!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Factual, technically superb and entertaining.","review":"Kristi's book is a great one to read if you are just getting interested in the sport of figure skating. She provides all the imformation beginning skaters want to know, from choosing music to how to do a triple lutz. The only part that needed work was the amount of detail on choosing boots, blades, etc. Even so, this is one of the most informitive skating books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best FS book I've read","review":"I wasted a lot of money on figure skating books prior to buying this one. This book includes everything you need to know if you are a skating parent or are new to figure skating. A lot of books either speak to you as though you are an idiot or they are too advanced. This book is just right and packs EVERYTHING you could ever want to know about FS into an easy-to-read and enjoyable format. Buy this one first, you won't need to waste your money on other books.***2010: a little outdated now, but still great overview for beginner.***"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dummies?","review":"The title might just as well be \\"Ice skating for aspiring professionals.\\" In any case, a wonderful book about skating, well written and clear.

I bought this CD on impulse, which I never do. Thankfully, it turned out to be excellently done, mixing Gaelic and African influences with the drum beats and bagpipes, Irish fiddle, recorder, and techno beats. If I had to classify this music, it would be Jungle/Trance with Irish influence. Eirann's lyrics are moving, and the transition between the fourth and fifth track is perfect.

It was a very basic, vengeance film and I thought the whorehouse scene at the end was fantastic. My favorite line in the movie is when William Devane says to Tommy Lee Jones, \\" I found the men who killed my son\\", and Tommy replies, \\"I'll just get my gear\\". No other words were needed. This is a Classic American International Schlock movie, but with a great cast like Luke Askew and Dabney Coleman when they were nobodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Mediocre DVD","review":"Warner Bros. does a good job with their on demand DVDs and I was hoping for the same level of quality from MGM. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the \\"Rolling Thunder\\" disc. MGM did a sloppy job when they prepared this movie for DVD. This is most apparent in the interior (low light) scenes when flickering horizontal lines follow the actors as they move. This is distracting and certainly not what you would expect from a home video released by a major studio. Also, the DVD cover art looks like it was Xeroxed at Kinko's. I hope that someday Criterion or Blue Underground will give this movie a proper DVD/Blu-ray release.Bottom line: \\"Rolling Thunder\\" is a great movie, but this DVD is not worth $17.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rolling Thunder","review":"A classic gritty film. It has a young Tommy Lee Jones and Willem DeVane playing P.O.W's returning home. I won't spoil the plot but the last 5 minutes of the film was considered ultra Violent back in the 70's.Tommy Lee Jones and Willem DeVane did 2 movies together on screen. Rolling Thunder was the first. The second time you see them on film again is Clint Eastwood's movie \\"space Cowboys.\\"Did you know?. Clint Eastwood originally had Sean Connery in the script, but Sean kindly declined the role and Clint chose another actor played by Donald Sutherland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad business","review":"How do those who own the rights to this and other American made movies profit from denying those in the U.S. who really love this and other region exclusive movies the opportunity to purchase for viewing on Blu Ray consoles here?

This marketing strategy only serves the interests of bootleggers who find ways to satisfy a demand for unnecessarily rare movies. What a waste of effort! And for what?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underrated rap album of all-time","review":"This has to be the most slept on hip-hop masterpiece to ever get a commercial release. Most Hiero fans inexplicably seem to prefer Del's solo release \\"No Need for Alarm\\" released around the same time, and although that album is good, this one is much better. Even Del comes off better in two songs on this album than he does on his own. While other Hiero members' best work often shows up on other places than their widely released albums, this record contains many of Casual's best songs. The beats are incredible, the flow is dope, and the lyrics have depth. Even Saafir comes off good on one track. \\"Get Off It\\" is probably my favorite song, but there are many great ones. Better than \\"No Need for Alarm\\" and very close to the apex reached by \\"93 til Infinity\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Hard Rhymes","review":"Casual is still an unapologetic battle rhymer. In his voice you hear the power and arrogance that he needs to dispatch other rappers in face to face combat. Lyrical battling is alive and well in 2K1 and this album still rocks. It has a jazzy vibe kind of like 93 til or Coast II Coast and I put it up there with those two as West side classics. Cas should be dropping his follow up which is almost ten years late, but joints like Chained Minds, Thats How it IS, and This is how we rip will satisfy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"This book makes you think maybe the aliens people claim to see are the Biblical angels and demons written in the Bible.

The Biblical view is the most sound I have read. Who, what and where they are from, according to the Bible, Makes more sence then any other view I have studied. Fallen Angels makes a lot more sence then Aliens. The more you research what the Bible says on the topic the other views become more fantasy. Satan, of course, would rather you beleave in the Alien fantasy. I give this 5 stars due to I have studied other material relating to the same outcome, The biblical view. It tips the scale compared to other views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you swallow Missler's claims...","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago after hearing Missler speak at a local Calvary Chapel. I bought the book because I have always had a small interest in UFO's and Missler's presentation was somewhat interesting. Yet during the presentation he casually accused the Reformers of the 16th century of not going far enough in their theology and \\"discovering\\" dispensationalism. He also made bizarre claims of the Niphilim which no theologian has EVER made in the history of the church.After you buy this book, purchase Richard Abanes' book, END-TIME VISIONS. Abanes exposes Missler's use of white-supremacist literature and Missler's inflated claims about his (Missler's) credentials."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load","review":"Missler has pulled the wool over many a Christians eyes in the past. This is another \\"wooly\\" story. I would save my money on this one and go get a good CD or some other book, just not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Be Fooled!!!","review":"In quite a disappointing turn, Missler and Eastman have taken one of the most intriguing prospects of our time (the possibility of alien life in our midst) and have turned it into one of the most conniving bits of propaganda that I've seen. While many of the subjects are fascinating and appear at first to be founded in genuine research, only in the final chapters is the authors' intent revealed: to convert the masses to devout Christianity. With such quips as, \\"If you are about to be abducted by an alien, fall on your knees and praise the Lord,\\" the authors destroy all scientific credibility in the area of UFO's. I'm sorry I was suckered into buying this propaganda pamphlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sort of subterfuge for religious promotion","review":"This book is not intended as an objective discussion on alien encounters. It is deceptively portrayed as such, but it is merely an attempt to convert or persuade readers towards believing in some sort of fundementalist cult mentality. It does great harm to the scientific investigation of UFOs when such publications attempt to ride on its popularity for religious fanaticism or other ulterior motives. This book was discarded rather than given away due to its spurious intentions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A non christian point of view.","review":"The authors really had me going for a while. They lured me in and then put the clamps down on me. I thought the book in all was very well written but from a point of view that there is no such thing as a god, I would have to say they are trying to \\"recruit\\" you into the christian way of thinking.

Full of factional information, rational hypotheses and extremely credible conclusions. I have lent my copy to someone who wants to know more but I need to reread it. I want my book back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptively Informative","review":"As I started reading this, I thought it was a pretty good recap of the more well-known UFO cases out there. In fact, the first 100 pages or so lead the reader on quite well. What do I mean by this? I was expecting impartial journalism here, but this book is a decidedly Christian oriented book. Heaven forbid we are talking about genuine aliens from other planets. While I stopped reading this book abruptly about 30% through, I sensed that it was leading the readers to the notion that UFO's are demonic. While I understand this is a valid theory, I wish that the I had known ahead of time what direction this book was going to take. I would never have purchased it. This might be a good book to have in your library of UFO books, but it's not one that I will be referring to very often, as I just do not buy the demonic theory to explain this very complicated phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demonology takes Alien Form","review":"The book starts with the usual information about sightings and alien abductions, much of which is available on the web. The author then starts to make connections between the sightings and biblical stories and postulates that \\"fallen angles\\" are actually aliens. He draws heavily on the writings of Sitchin and Whitley Strieber to bolster his argument, and the Bible, of course, which is the main source of his argument. He takes the entire analogy too far, citing Revelations and trying to make it fit into his argument. The conclusion is that aliens are coming soon, they are not nice, and they will destroy us, so accept Jesus as your savior before it's too late. I was disappointed to have wasted my money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Incredulity...and beyond!","review":"Chuck Missler is quite an interesting person. A former intelligence author for the US military, he now tries his hand at being a self-styled \\"prophecy expert.\\" His long history of conspiracy mongering serves him well in this regard (as Amazon doesn't allow the posting of URLs, you will have to search for his site yourself to see what I mean.) The book has more in common with Roddenberry than with Revelation. The notion that aliens are behind much of demonic activity is simply insupportable from Scripture. And the logical leaps made in this text border on the ludicrous. Those who avidly absorb the writings of Jack Van Impe, Tim LaHaye and Hal Lindsey will love this book. Thinking Christians will be appalled that such stuff could get published."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slick fundamentalist bait-and-switch job.","review":"As a serious researcher on the psychology of belief systems, I was very disappointed at the deceptiveness of the authors' approach. While they seemingly did a great deal of research, it was selected mainly for its usefulness in their plan to engender fear in order to promote conversions. They even repeatedly stated that the material should make the reader fearful. Please, gentlemen, if you yourselves are so fearful, spare us your hysteria.Material which could well deserve careful and sensitive analysis was instead treated with the utmost credulity, a criticism that has also been leveled at Missler's treatment of the Apocalypse and even the Y2K computer problem (the so-called Millenium bug)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iridology Flashcards / Tarjetas de Iridología by Frank Navratil","review":"These cards are an useful aid to iridology and have succesfully helped me in identifying all matters regarding the eyes.

They seemed like a great deal, and I hoped he could use them for an upcoming overseas trip. We were very disappointed when we received them. Although they're advertised as having \\"maximum isolation,\\" we could easily hear ambient noises while wearing them; there was no obvious noise reduction. In addition, a person sitting next to the listener could hear noise from the headphones even when the music source was at medium volume, which would make them inappropriate (or at least inconsiderate) for a long plane trip.On the plus side, the sound quality seemed good and the ear pads were comfortable. They'd probably be good for watching a movie or playing video games at home in a quiet environment, but not at all suited for travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I agree with another reviewer who commented that the treble is muddy-sounding. In fact, other than the over-emphasized bass, the overall sound is fairly muddy. As far as Koss' famous \\"lifetime warranty\\" is concerned, I obtained these through that program - when I sent in a pair of studio professional headphones which needed only foam earcushion replacement - and received back these [less expensive] portable-stereo headphones. When I contacted customer service, I was told they had already thrown away the ones I sent and had decided these were a fair substitution - if one ignores small issues like twice as high distortion, shorter cord, less expensive, etc. For their warranty service alone I wouldn't recommend a Koss product; however, their A250 ... is actually well-regarded by some professional reviewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice headphones for the money","review":"I am not a headphones person, but my iphone buds weren't cutting it for the long days at the office. I bought these in anticipation for comfort and sound. These headphone definitely delivered both. Overall, I am very happy and it does have base which is always a plus. Hope this helps anyone looking for a decent pair of headphones that are not going to kill your wallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cord is too short! Only 3 feet.","review":"I have always used Koss headphones, and this one was a mistake. The sound quality is 'OK' --no better or worse that most low-end headphones (i expected more, due to the specs, which is why i bought these). They are very comfortable, and very nice to look at, and have more than enough bass. However the cord is less that 3 feet long, which doesn't even allow me to lean back in my chair at me desk (i plug it into my desk speakers). One other thing i noted, is with very high volumes the sound takes on too much midrange (makes it sound like it's coming out of a cone)."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIGHT WEIGHT,& COMFORTABLE with GOOD SOUND","review":"I'm on my second pair of these. The first ones broke where the mesh attaches at the top and leatherette on the ear piece wore and started to flake off. Typical of all this type of earphone, I hear. So they are rather fragile. I bought both pair at Radio Shack (over paid at $50.) The sound quality is great! I would rather listen to these earphones than the speakers. Sounds a lot better. However, they are on the cheap end of the earphone market, so I want to try a pair of high end Sonyies for comparison. For the money, the Koss UR40s are light weight, comfortable and sound great.

Excellent sound output at this price. There are 2 reasons for me not giving this product a 5 star rating is..1) Little too bulky although collapsible.2) There is no microphone built with it. Other products like Planotronics have microphones along with the headphone at the same price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent headphones that won't break the bank","review":"I've owned a pair of these headphones for over 10 years now, and I have to say that they are very comfortable and the sound is very good. The bass is clean without being hyped like more modern headphones. These are not closed-back phones, so they do not block out external sounds and if you crank them, the person sitting next to you can probably hear what you are listening to.

I wasn't super impressed at first. The cord is very thin and I did eventually ruin the headphones by tripping over the wire. They are super light, but that makes them feel cheap.However, they perform well and they work ESPECIALLY well when walking down the street, because they seem to only cut down ambient by about 3db. I use these in my car while I'm driving, because I can still hear everything around me. Paired with an iPhone 4, they are great for talking on the phone too, as long as you can keep the phone's built-in Mic close by. I use a shirt pocket.They are so lightweight that I've forgotten that I'm wearing them.

I have ordered headphones from Newegg and had to return them; I have persuaded clerks to remove headphones from their packaging so my son can try them on; nothing has worked in the last year and a half. Then I discovered the Koss collapsibles. There is a compromise; sound is less than actual studio quality, but ambient sound is largely blocked, making up for loss of range. This is why my sone requested circumaural headphones in the first place--he hates the feel of earbuds and the need to turn up the volume to block ambient noise. Even though they fold up into a tidy pocket-sized package, these headphones are STURDY--no clicking, no cutting-out, no wobbles or crackles. Best of all, they are NEVER uncomfortable over glasses. And for all this, the price beats EVERYONE else.

Shabazz, Mustt Mustt, Night Song, any of these albums offer a better picture of his music. I do agree with the review in that these arraingements of his songs don't seem as \\"his\\" as others do. They are radical departures from his signature style and don't really allow the listener to experience his voice as is; including too much out-of-context accompaniment (a saxophone? please, never again...) and generally being overproduced, robbing the songs of one of their best qualities - always having the emotion of being spontaneous.I love Nusrat and his music, but I recommend skipping this recording in favor of almost any other."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"All i can say is that i could have taken this CD from a friend ,but the songs are so amazingly re sung live in concert that i had to buy it.Some people may say that Nusrat didnt sing much in the album but i think its not true,even though Rahat chorus and gives occasional raags in the middle the NFAK voice is immortal as ever....its a good buy i think"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid.","review":"I agree 100% with the Amazon review.

I had been very intrigued by the pre-publication description of the plot and was actually looking forward to reading it. In my opinion, it is a total flop.The only character that was somewhat developed in the story was Claude, all the other characters were completely flat. I found the language of the book very much artificially constructed, as if someone was trying a bit too hard to come up with good metaphors. Part of the story line was just way over the top, at times, Claude seemed to be more of a stalker than a desparate lover.A scene which made me laugh out loud because it was so grotesque, was when one of the characters jumped into the grave to embrace the casket at a funderal. I am sure this scene was supposed to have the opposite effect and be very dramatic...Sorry, but I can absolutely not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"I should start by saying that I didn't finish the book. I stopped in the middle because it was simply too boring and I had no emphathy for the main character. I pitied him, yes, but the writer didn't make me want him to succeed. The object of his obsession seemed vapid and shallow, and the writer didn't really explain why he was in love with her (Because she had great clothes and was young and pretty? Come on!) And finally, I guessed the ending as soon as it had begun - trying to have a relationship with someone who is engaged or married - when does that ever workout well?So all in all, I won't even say I'm dissapointed (excepting the money that I lost in buying it).

The Dressmaker follows a 'country' tailor's rise to couture fame while he finds and stalks his muse. The author provides very vivid and enjoyable descriptions of the fashion world, including the inner workings of a famous designer house in France. The rest of the story introduces characters in a rapid fire way, with seldom any character development, aside from the tailor Claude and his Muse, Valentine. The story jumps around from the small French village outside of Paris, to Paris itself and New York. Family, friends and Claude's 'forgotten' wife come in and out of the story line, only providing irrelevant detail and minimal character development to the main story.I love anything and everything dealing with France and fashion.

That's the case in this book when a woman, who almost dies twice in the same day, ends up packing up and heading off for a distant town to find answers to her strange dreams. Somehow, Hooper weaves a tale of mystery and romance and ends up with a twist at the end that maybe you should have seen coming.

I was hooked from the first page. Yes, there was an awful lot of coincidence, two accidents, one near fatal, one fatal, that take place at the same time to identical women who are the same age, but that's okay, because Hooper deals with it in a way that makes us believe.

The covers often have a mixed signal from me. Their cover of \\"Take Five\\" is definately original but I am not too fond of how they converted a 5/4 timing into just a conventional 4/4 track but apart from that, this is still a great song. The cover version of Art of Noises famous 1984 classic \\"Moments In Love\\" is beautifully done and has it's own character altogether but I wish it was much longer. The second half of this album is stronger with the beautiful \\"Eternal\\" and \\"Power of Life\\". The closing track \\"Farewell\\" brings back some of the classic DF of their early years but even that is a far cry from beauties like \\"Quiet Beauty\\" and their \\"California Grooves\\" release.

Though a Kindle book does not have facing pages, we could at least expect one page with Italian text, and the next page with the corresponding English translation, etc. Note that I checked this with the Kindle sample on the Kindle iPad app, but I presume this would also be true on actual Kindle devices.Since this was not done, I can not recommend this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Not Make It In Today's World","review":"One of those classics that would not make it in today's world.

I admit I ordered this book haphazardly before reading into the author and the reviews available online, however, it would be best to warn other customers from buying this book. For starters, this book is a masquerade of scholarship. It is riddled with facts that are simply wrong and conclusions that strech across the grand canyon. A perfect alternative to understanding the Traditional School of Thought from also a historical perspective that is more objective and respectable, one should look into Harry Oldmeadow's Traditionalism: Religion in the Light of the Perennial Philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"Although the subject is important, the author falls into the all too familiar trap of if anything criticizes modernity then it must be bad. And to get effect the author peppers the text with references to fascism. The intellectuals discussed inthis book have criticized modernity for its pauctiy of spirituality, and have challenged the notion that modernity or democracy satisfy man's spiritual yearnings. Nothing the author has said in the book provides a counterveiling argument. Finally, in many instances the so-called traditionalists have opposed dictatorship and in the Muslim world fundamentalism (for its acceptance of many premises of modernity). Bad book on an important topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Againt any true spirituality","review":"Mark Sedgwick's Against the Modern World , more a detective story than an academic work actually, can hardly be considered as a reliable source on the Perennialist/Traditionalist school. Its intellectual shortcomings and even factual errors prove a contrario that no study of the Perennialist school can be seriously pursued without first-hand knowledge of the Perennialist writings and a sufficient background on the traditions and authorities to whom the Perennialists refer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poorly Written Introduction to an Interesting Social Movement","review":"Traditionalism is an interesting idea. Basically it's a combination of the sort of standard new age idea that all the worlds religions share a single basic kernel of truth coupled with a deep hatred for the corruption of the modern capitalistic world and a distrust for the average person. It has been closely allied with both the new age movement, and fascism at different points. Add in a bunch of masons and western Sufis, and its an interesting and unique movement. It deserved a better book that this one.Mr. Sedgwick, frankly, is not a strong writer. Every character and idea he introduces is labeled \\"pivital\\" and \\"key\\". And the narrative history of the movement is often hard to follow. This just goes to show that if you pick an interesting and controversial subject matter, you can get your book published, even if it isn't very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"What fans have been waiting for...","review":"It's about time! A cleaned up version with all the extras.I give 5 stars for this release since it's clearly intended for people who are already familiar with the movie. Haters go elsewhere to rant about bad the movie is.This edition is for those who want more of an over-the-top, surreal, gory, sexy, slutty version of Rome. Everything else is just pale shadows. You just know (or at least hope) the Romans were a lot more like the ones shown in this movie than any watered down version. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray","review":"You know what the problem is? That after watching HBO's Rome series nothing comes even close. I thought Id go for this when the price was right at about $11.99. BTW thats about the top price for it imho. True its a 2 disc version and Region free (am in Australia). At least I managed to sit through it all, was amazed how graphic the sex scenes were considering when it was made. Quite pornographic which I find well at least theyre telling it like it was, plenty debauchary. McDowell was over the top. Im not to familiar with the true history of Caligula, but this cant be a close rendition. Alot of poetic license in use. Not much in sets used could almost have been a stage production. Either way the blu ray transfer was bearable, Id say 80's DVD quality perhaps. I didnt bother checking out disc 2 yet.

Here were some highly accomplished actors like Malcolm McDowell and Shakespearean actors Peter O'Toole and Helen Mirren in the most brutal [scene] I have ever seen. After witnessing a lawnmowerlike thing chop off the heads of a bunch of people buried in the ground up to their necks, some beastyality and the so-called *blessing* of the bride and groom by the emperor - complete with a daisy in the [rear], my husband and I left the movie early in total horror and disgust!

This movie could, and should have been filmed with more discretion, however it is obvious to me that it was an opportunity from the beginning to somehow legitimize an industry that is systematically destroying our culture. No thanks Bob. The sex in this film is explicit and real, including the orgies. This is something I would hope that our culture has risen above.

Great performances, excellent actors, and a plot based on true facts. Yes.., it has porno parts, but it is NOT a porno movie, it's dynamic and heavy plot is divided by porno parts that show, perhaps for moments overacted, how Roman orgies were. About the violence, well, I would say it's not as violent I heard, the violent scenes perfectly fit in the plot and simply transmit a heavy sense of power, the power Emperor's and their closest people had over the rest. McDowell is the perfect Caligula, O'Tool shines as Tiberius, and the rest fit perfectly well.

It's really about the same thing (Is \\"Caligula\\" about anything really?), is more historically convincing (tho' hardly accurate), in Italian (a great help in creating a cultural reference), and just a better ride into the Ancient Western World. \\"Satyricon\\" too has no discernable plot, but then it comes from fragments of an ancient story....part of its charm.Yep...forget this mess, and buy \\"Satyricon\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"No.","review":"The only thing that recommended this film when it was first released was that it was as near XXX you could get for a mainstream film with top actors.It does not hold up to the test of time.

Production values, editing, storyline could hardly be worse. The humor begins at the opening credits ... Bob Guccione! ... and Gore Vidal! Do you really need more? It just goes downhill from there. I suppose they managed a few decent name actors of the period due to the subject matter, Guccione's involvement and the overall low tone of the times.

I've seen pornography before, but unless you are addicted to it, it didn't phase me at all. It was like a DVD version of Penthouse Magazine. It was slow, it was \\"messed up,\\" like Guggione is/was, but it's the S L O W E S T movie I've ever seen, and it doesn't even bother me that I don't like it.

Today its just tacky and unpleasant. It is shockingly bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic Masterpiece.","review":"Most people just don't get it. They see this movie as pornographic filth. The truth is that Bob Gucionne wanted to create a film that actually depicted the depravity of the roman empire, and he accomplished his goal. Because of our dogmatic views of our aversion to the porn industry, we have completely overlooked the directors original artistic vision. Caligula unrated is a masterpiece worthy of the ranks of Citizen Kane, and The Godfather. This movie is incredibly well done. Peter O' Toole delivers an epic portrayal of Emperor Tiberius. Malcom McDowell is great as Caligula. Ann Savoy and Helen Mirren round off this steller cast, and deliver performances that are nothing short of acting at its finest. Yes, I know it contains fifty minutes of x-rated content, but why watch part of a movie, when you can watch the entire masterpiece today. Watch this film as it was intended buy Caligula today, and see film that his stil ahead of its time in regards to society social standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated vs. Unrated","review":"Don't make the mistake I made.

Now on to the DVD. I bought a copy of this horrible ... only because the cover said Digitally Remastered and Fully Restored. The film quality of this DVD is unbelievably bad. The whole thing is very grainy and there were even parts were I could see scratches in the film and also where it had been repaired. I have movies on VHS tape that put this DVD to shame.

After that, you're left with the feeling that Tiberius hates Caligula, Caligula *loves* his sister, and not much else.It's just a sort of aimless, purposeless, display of decadence. In the end, Caligula decides to kill everyone in order to take their wealth and keep the games going, and everyone rebels.It's just kind of disgusting and hard to make sense of, with no redeeming features. Avoid this DVD at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible transfer - Don't buy blue-ray version","review":"Save your money, don't buy the blu-ray version.

It was too drawn out and I would never think a movie made in the late 70's would have so many sex scenes and be unrated. All in all I wouldnt watch it or buy it again. The story line of the Romans was I think a bit far fetched. If they did behave in that manner and lived in that manner then they all deserved more than death. I just think it really was a waste of two hours when I could have watched something far more appealing. Although Caligula was insane by all means it was just a bit much going on and on and none of the other characters had a chance to progress in the movie it was all about him and no one else. I really didnt appreciate the way they killed his child in the end that was totally disgusting. Well actually the whole entire movie was disgusting from him having and incestuous relationship with his sister to him basically raping a virgin on her wedding day. It was just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caligula","review":"The story had possibilities given the cast. However, it was ruined by the graphic violence and the orgy scenes.

It is a little under 3 hours, which seemed like 3 days, and there is only about 20 minutes of decent film. The small amount of story that is somewhat portrayed is simply stepped on by asinine porn. The most triumphant scene in the movie is where the Roman soldiers attack the phallus-humbling papyrus stalks while flailing their genitals to and fro. This movie is ridiculous.

Too much fixation on graphic, artistic recreations of sexual violence, while almost ommitting the greater portion of his violence against people in every forum of life.

Guccione hired an art deco designer, some great actors, a director who couldn't speak English, and some of the best looking naked bodies around to film this mess. Guccione focuses on the evils of Caligula and portrays them exfcessively, graphically, and disgustingly. He ignores all of Vidal's lessons about politics, the evils of power being concentrated in one hand, etc. The result is creepy, sick, an anti-aphrodisiac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent movie but Blu Ray version is awful.","review":"To be brief, Caligula is a 5 star film for it's realistic portrayal of decadent Rome.

It takes a stylistic note from Fellini's later work such as \\"Roma\\" and \\"Satyricon\\" and then just sort of goes crazy, filling the screen with mutants, bizarre scenes of extremely graphic violence and extremely graphic pornography. And the fact that it stars Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud, all brilliant actors, makes it all the most fascinating. And, in fact, they are all very good in this movie, in an over the top way. But really...in a movie like this how could you possibly, even for a second, think to play it seriously.

The film is historically debatable on any count and no one's watching this excrement on film for history anyway. I truly believe you can pay Malcolm McDowall to do anything but Helen Mirren is totally debased here. Scatalogical in the extreme, \\"Caligula\\" stands as a total embarrassment to one and all.

It was one of those movies that all my friends said we had to see, because it was so controversial. Controversial it is. Good it is not.I've heard through the years that Sir John Gilgud did not know that the part he was playing would be in a film showing explicit sexual acts and degredation. I find this hard to believe, given the producer of the film - it was Penthouse magazine.That said, Caligula is dull, dull, dull. It is only the scenes of horror and sexual predation that make this film rise above the sublimely mind numbing - and that's really sad.You know you're going to watch it, because you're curious, but just know this: after you watch this repugnant film, if you're anything like me, you'll want to bathe afterward. It's really a creepy gross film."},{"rating":"1","title":"some stars pretended to be going somewhere else","review":"I read an interview with one of the principals (O'Toole?) in which he said he ran into Gielgud on the plane on the way to filming this miasma and that both he and Gielgud pretended to be on their way somewhere else, neither realizing that the other had been bribed into appearing in this sad yet expensive waste material.Funny thing is that I think I saw it when it first appeared, imagining incorrectly that it might be more erotic than bleak. Afterward, I pretended I had seen a different film. Closest I'll ever get to being like O'Toole or Gielgud.I only visited this site because I was curious about a Roger Ebert quote that linked to it.

In fact, he should be applauded for having the courage to make an adult film that had the power to shock and repel. Yet he should also be lambasted as, ultimately, it is down to him for the bad direction, bad editing, and for approving a script that sorely needed an editor. If Caligula is not quite a success in terms of filmmaking it is however in terms of money making as it became one of the most successful independant films ever made.Is Caligula a film of merit?

I HATE DUBBED FILMS! McDowell is great, but I thought his dance scene looked silly. I loved Gielgud, and O'Toole's character was really creepy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"T&A Can Be Boring...","review":"That last half hour is really tough to get through...thus the one-star. It's definitely a walk-out/turn-off movie.If it were cut down to 90 minutes it would be a pretty good time. But I can still recommend it on a good 5 or 10 minute basis...if you know what I mean.It's just a wacky, crazy movie. Goes from historical epic...to soft-core porn...to historical epic...to hard-core porn...and on and on like that. As porn it's pretty good. As a movie...pretty bad. Still would have been heaven on earth to find on late night cable as a lonely 12 year-old though."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is really a disappointment","review":"What a disappointment this movie was. I remember when I was much younger, and heard about the making of this movie. I wanted to see it big-time. Now, after I've seen it much later on in life, it stunk. The nudity wasn't even worth the watch! Penthouses 'bomb', is still alive, but it isn't worthy of wasting your time on it. Avoid it, and save your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's All Greek To Me","review":"It all began by my being really bored in my High School Social Studies class, where the teacher would go on and on about the greatness of Western society, that finally made me really take a look at world history for what it was.In class, we studied the Greeks and the Romansd and the greatness of their contributions to a civilized society. I followed thius up with a long trip to the library and found out that greatness was produced by a bunch of freaks.What this film did was simply put a visual action to the descriptions of their societies, buried deep within the stacks of the New York Public Library.Each time I thought that I had seen the grossest thing possible, the next scene would top it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"I rented this movie once and couldn't finish it; it was too gory! Compared to some of the acts of torture in this movie, Abu Gharib was a walk in the park. There's also plenty of graphic nudity and sex, which can be a bit off-putting, especially when it higlights Emperor Caligula's somewhat outré tastes. Nowadays, he might be classified as a sexual predator and/or a serial rapist.This film is not intended to be historically accurate (which is virtually impossible, anyway*), and lives up to its' billing as the first $15 million porno film ever. Watch it if you dare, but don't say I didn't warn you!*There are very few accurate historical sources on the reign of Emperor Gaius (Caligula), A.D. 37-41.

It's A GREAT HISTORICALLY ACCURATE MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just disappointed","review":"I finally broke down and bought the movie. It does have some decent sex scenes, it's just very choppy. I am not sure if they were trying to show how crazy stuff was back then or the movie makers were just unexperience.

Try to find someone who has it this way you can watch it and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrated, understated.","review":"After reading many many reviews, I purchased the unrated Korean version, thinking it would have less editing. Totally the opposite. I would have a hard time rating this \\"R\\". It is more like \\"PG\\". The only reason it wouldn't be \\"G\\" is that there was a tiny bit of blood and I think I saw three breasts. Having seen the film in 1979 this version is a complete disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs way down","review":"Despite all the hype of being the most controversial movie every made in the end it is just a really bad movie.

Wish I hadn't wasted my time on this idiotic (not even sexy) movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring epic ever (Can I have this 3 hours of my life back?)","review":"I watched this movie after my boss said how brutal and gruesome it was. I waited with anticipation for this supposed gem to come in the mail. I watched it last night and I have to say it was the worst waste of time I have ever unfortunately spent my money on. It definitely fits into the \\"soft core porn\\" category but other than that there is nothing to this movie. The first 40 minutes is slightly entertaining but it quickly drops off after that. I have nothing good to say about this movie and advise others to steer clear of this disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caligula (3 disc) Imperial Edition Was Rather Disappointing","review":"The reign of Caligula was interesting from the point of a madman having his way with the Roman Empire. I did not find the additional information on the additional discs to be of much interest from a layman's point of view (perhaps a historian would be more interested). If I had it to do over, I would have just purchasd a one disc DVD. However, the costumes and scenery were great! And unfortunately one still shot in an advertizement did not appear in the DVD itself.Perhaps packaging was better done for other customers, but the box I received the DVD in was oversized without any padding allowing the DVD to shift from one end to the other in shipment with some resulting damage to one of the discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic for a great price","review":"Even though this is adult fare, it is a classic filled with spectacular performances by the likes of Peter O'Toole, Malcolm McDowell and the indomitable Helen Mirren. I bought a used copy and it was in vintage condition and played well."},{"rating":"2","title":"My rating & review of Caligula (Unrated Version)","review":"I have to say that Caligula may somewhat be shocking for it's explicit and sexual content and details of torture of people and animals, however I found the movie to be an outstanding film. It's integrity takes you to another level where the past of the Roman days comes alive. Sex was truly exploited then and almost everything and anything was quite normal. Malcolm McDowell did a brilliant work as Caligula. It's the best adult film of all time. It's the most memorable late 70's film and it's sad how Hollywood doesn't make great movies like the ol' classics. A must see!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with the edited version!","review":"I have not yet seen the unedited version of this film but I made the mistake of renting the edited version a few years ago. Don't do it, people! They must have had to cut out so much footage, the plot is completely hard to understand and all of a sudden it's all over. However, it was almost worth it to see Bob Guccione at the end come on screen and say, \\"Hello, I'm Bob Guccione. What you have just seen is a drastically edited version of my movie Caligula. I do not approve of censorship. If you would like to order the unedited version through the US mail, where FEDERAL laws, not LOCAL laws apply, please call...\\" Believe it or not this short little spiel actually inspired a lengthy intelligent discussion amongst me and my family concerning censorship, etc. But otherwise, stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The mineralogy section is a disaster.

Upon checking it out I found, to my horror, that the mineral entries are essentially worthless. There are an appalling number of omissions and errors. I cannot express too strongly how disastrous this portion of the book is. I have not done a similar check on the geology terms, but there is every reason to believe they are just as bad as the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent content, typesetting poor","review":"Five stars for the content, three stars for layout and typesetting.I own both volumes and I highly recommend both of them. The breadth of coverage is amazing and yet the authors are able to go deep without becoming murky.My only complaint is the layout. Both volumes contain an inch and a half of margin on each page and the font is very tiny. It would be nice if the font could be enlarged and all the wasted white space put to better use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful, But Confusing","review":"This is a great book for a someone who is familiar with the Java language. However, I would not recommend this book by itself. It can be confusing and complicated at times. Best if you have another book to supplement this one. Also does not have any programming \\"assignments\\" so you will have to come up with your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used for an Advanced CS course - it's Great!","review":"I use this book (and its Volume I) for a course I teach at the University of Delaware. It's wonderul. It's definatly written with the experienced programmer with lots of experience but none in Java in mind. You can really pick Java up quickly with this book and it makes a good reference material as well. If you already know how to program and want to learn Java and experience the powerful features of the language and the APIs and class libraries that come with the Java 2 SDK, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition not a good buy","review":"Like many reviewers I find the the Core Java series to be very valuable. However, be forewarned that the kindle edition is not a good representation of the book. The figures are completely useless either because they have not taken the time to convert them properly or because the kindle technology is simply incapable of displaying non-text content properly.

It is energizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"This was required reading for one of my classes and reading it was about as enjoyable as being choked to death. Sirine, Abu-Jaber's heroine, is described as an exquisite chef of startling, almost unnaatural beauty and seems to be sexually desired by almost every male figure in the book, but I have no idea why. I kept waiting for Abu-Jaber to reveal the character for the reader but it never happened. Sirine is totallt one-dimensional. Yeah, she's a great cook, but the woman is totally without any interesting qualities, has never travelled,is completely uncultured and literally does nothing but cook and when she is not cooking she is either thinking about cooking or is hanging out with sn also unbelievable character, the suave and mysterious Iraqi professor,Hanif. This book is the equivalent of a 21st century dime-store romance. If you are intrested in literature by Arab-American women, do yourself a favor and pick up some poetry by Naomi Shihab Nye instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting unique characters.","review":"This story was very interesting and entertaining.

This is a great book, I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"There needs to be a better restoration for DVD","review":"Having first seen this film in college in the early 1980s, I was looking forward to seeing it again on DVD. I must say that while the movie itself is fine, the DVD needs work. The colorized version is dreadful. It has reduced the running time of the original film and the colorization is not good. The dubbed English is at times unbearable. The B&W version on the same disc has the original Italian soundtrack with subtitles and has the longer version of the film; however, it is not a clear print. Won't somebody (like Criterion) please do a serious restoration of this film for DVD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong language","review":"This is great movie and all the other reviewers say is true. But if you can, do not get the version offered by Amazon, dubbed in English. Get the one in Italian, with subtitles. The English voice of Jesus does not capture the rage the Italian counterpart expresses. Also, the Italian original is 137 minutes long, the dubbed version only 122. I am not sure which scenes are missing. But there was one in the original with a communist era official funeral music. That one is sadly absent in the dubbed version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware : Language","review":"This is an italian movie, with the original language track in italian, and the Synergy box featured is in french. You would expect at least one of these languages, if only in subtitle. The disc I received has an ENGLISH DUB ONLY, and NO subtitle.There was no warning about this in the product specifications, and none even on the box. Deceptive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie - terrible package","review":"The Gospel According to St. MatthewThe film itself lives up to the hype. I was hoping that the Legend Films release had something more to offer regarding the black and white original version, mainly better subtitles that don't wash out in some scenes, along with a better translation in some scenes as well. The colorized version sucks [like all colorized versions], plain and simple - truncated by 50 minutes to 90 minutes in length, English dubbed, and is not the same experience as watching Passdolini's original vision. It simply represents everything that is wrong with Christian marketing these days - the compromise of artistic integrity for a quick buck. Had Legend Films brought us a truly better print in all its black and white glory with some bonafide extras I could easily overlook the release's shortcomings. Hopefully down the road this masterpiece will get the treatment [Criterion, preferably] it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film, poor transfer","review":"Surprise, surprise. Waterbearer has produced yet another poor quality Pasolini DVD. While this disc admittedly isn't as bad as their release of, say, Porcile, it's nowhere near the treatment this film deserves.As with the other Waterberer Pasolini DVD's, this one features burned-in subtitles that are really difficult to read, no chapter stops, and the same 30-minute documentary.I understand that there is a superior Region 2 release of this film, but I don't have a region-free player so I can't really verify that information.This is a fantastic film, and deserves better treatment. For now, however, this is all we've got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw it on the Screen in 1966.","review":"The day I turned 18, I took the day off from school to register for the draft and ruminate about turning into a man during the Vietnam War.

It should have Italian language and subtitles but instead features a stilted dubbing in English. And it has no sections or chapters.

It just didn't appeal to us.The teen found it weird, the college student scary, and my wife thought it hard to watch. I just thought it was a bit too artsy fartsy. I guess we're all too shallow and unrefined, but...we did try.Venice Film Festival gave it three awards, the Academy Awards nominated it for three, and Roger Ebert gave it a big thumbs up.I gave it two of five stars for the score and focused dialog; however, I didn't make it past two-thirds of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gospel goes Kitsch","review":"OK...i loved it actually despite of it's horrible English voiceover. But one has to be a film buff to appreciate it for its genre and for the time it was filmed.

I don't know if this has anything to do with the book being translated from italian to english, but inexperienced bakers will be left feeling a bit perplexed by the 'spartan' instructions. The measurements are also in metric units instead of the standard U.S. cups and tablespoons.Being that I have baking knowledge from working in bakeries and restaurants, my personal opinion of this book is that it's worth the 60 or 70 euros that my husband spent on purchasing it from the publisher. My only regret is that it was not the italian edition. I am tending to believe that perhaps some key steps in procedures may have been lost in the translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album from Short...EVER!","review":"This is old school at it's best, with the best on the mic.

It helped me maintain my awareness of the complexity of the lives of the people serving tourists around me. The narrative is smooth and colorful, moving and insightful. The domestic violence theme portrays an extreme but nevertheless accurate story of how a woman copes. America cannot truly see her situation for what it is until she sees a pathway to escape. The drama is palpable, and the scene of final confrontation made me cry. Kudos to Esmeralda Santiago, a truly gifted writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable Tale","review":"I'm a big fan of Santiago's work.

Esmeralda has done it again. The descriptions, customs, curiosity found in this book make you feel like your watching a moving rather than reading a book. You can almost feel the Vieques breeze. Domestic violence is a terrible social problem plaguing our society today, especially among Latina women. In our mothers time perhaps, this subject was unspoken. But today, I hope, Hispanic women are breaking free from the chains of domestic violence. I hope this book gives inspiration to my Latina sisters to end the cycle of abuse! Thank you Esmeralda for handling such a sensitive subject, with care and sensitivity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fantastic book","review":"Reading \\"America's dream\\" brought me back to Puerto Rico. I can certainly relate to not coping well to my first American winter, after years in the run. Reading how America, after a long-term, damaging relationship, decides that \\"it is her life, and she is the one in the middle of it\\" is an inspiration to me. The best developed character is America, of course. Other characters, although not so well defined, by turns influence America's life: Karen Leverett, the woman who hires America to care for her children; Rosalinda, America's rebellious 14-year old; Ester, America's alcoholic mother; and Correa, the abusive lover and father of Rosalinda.

By outlining the variegated meanings and understanding's of the modern, from the Cartesian Cogito, to Marx's Capital, Jameson attempts to reach a coherent and comprehensive understanding of the period itself. However, Jameson falls into web of philosophical and ideological narratives from which he cannot remove himself.

Ackerman focuses on individuals whose childhoods were mainly marked by, I guess you'd call it, SEVERE alcoholism.Nor is this book is well written, the information could probably be better presented as the charts and graphs he wants to interpret. But it's still not very useful information.I just can't get into the perennial victim space; maybe that's why it falls short for me. On the other hand, I absolutely display the evidence of an \\"adult child...\\": I have no children (and no desire); finally made a late in life marriage that is failing now, attraction to all the wrong sorts and an ingrained tendency to want to please everyone all the time.Interesting bits in the book, but too much heavy mining for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epiphany of understanding!","review":"While my family was not one of staggering drunks and physical or overt verbal abuse, this books sheds light on why I feel the way that I do! It's easy to get turned off at first by the overt drunks experiences of many of the people's stories presented here if you yourself didn't experience that. The MOST valuable part of the book is a look at different personality traits that you may have developed during your not-so-normal childhood. This books points out the positive things that ACoA's have learned from their experiences and how to use those to our greatest advantage, while understanding and working on some of the traits we developed that are not useful to us as adults.

Dr. Wapnicks explanation of Jesus' life and death based on A Course In Miracles is not only logical, it is beautiful.

His book on Clinton is a thoughtful and honest presentation of facts, personal contacts, assessments, and opinions of both Bill and Hillary (primarily Bill). Morris dispassionately provides the Rosetta Stone which decodes the Clinton's in a fair and articulate manner. He is hard on Bill at times, yes, but he often praises Bill's strengths. It was an awesome read. You can get a lot out of Dick's book without Bill's, but you will surely be hoodwinked if you read Bill's book by itself.

I EXPECTED MORE."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad buy","review":"I bought this espresso/cappuccino maker to make coffee for my husband, but to my dismay, the milk frothing system failed on the first machine I bought, so I had to return it. Strangely enough, it failed again the second time. After calling the customer support line for Mr. Coffee, I found out there was an error in the instructions provided with the machine, and that I was needing to add more water to create more steam pressure. Sure enough, they were right. But now, a month down the road, the frothing system again fails to function, even using the new recommended procedure. I suppose you get what you pay for, but you're really better off avoiding the frustration this machine will bring you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine for a year, now it won't.","review":"It never made the best espresso, but it made drinkable pseudo espresso for a while. After owning it for a year and using it four or five times a week, the lid to the tank of water became stuck. Nothing I could do was able to pry it loose. Obviously you need to open that lid to add water to make espresso. So this is a fairly significant defect. Before it got stuck I did notice that it was leaking steam from the opening but there seemed to be no way to stop this. Plus, I have not been motivated to try to repair it because the espresso it made was not what I was looking for.I think I am going to have to get one that is more expensive but perhaps more like the espresso I am looking for. And more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"fragile parts","review":"This is a cute little machine that worked well three times. However, on the fourth use, the plastic top of the glass pot had fallen inside after washing, and when I pulled it out, the glass broke on the pot - big break and full pot crack - the whole thing is useless without the pot. This is a much too fragile glass container for daily, early morning (read: not quite awake yet) use. I reccomend getting something stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"True Material\\"","review":"By Albert C. Bender, Author of \\"YOU ARE FOREVER IN TIME\\"This book clearly ampliefied for me, this authors knowledge and Intellect on the subject written. It provides information that truly moves to the core of the subject matter that the author speaks about.It is well written thought-provoking throughout. I recommend it highly. I believe that some of the authors critics should do a little reading on Ancient Greek,Roman and even Indian history. They will learn that the \\"Madonna figure\\" is but an ancient symbol, that goes back centuries before, in those cultures.In ancient times people believed very strongly in Astrology,Mythology, Myth Making and Cosmic Evolution. Gods born of virgins can be found in every age and country. It was an old and universal myth at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Product","review":"This table was better constructed than I expected it to be when I ordered it.

This table would be better if it had two prongs rather than one and maybe a little thinner, like the metal bottle holders. I have to be careful when pushing it into the ground that I don't break it as the stick is fairly thick, in addition if I place something on one end rather than the middle it tips over a little and stuff slides off. It comes in a plastic drawstring bag making it easy to pack up and carry."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important look at a flawed policy","review":"Craig Eisendrath is a unique voice in the debate over the neo-imperialism of the Bush 43 Administration. He worked in the U.S. State Department during the Cold War, quitting in disgust over the lies that the U.S. was telling about the Soviet Union's nuclear capability to justify to the American people our aggressive posture and the enormous expense of beefing up our military. This unique historical perspective makes him a highly-informed observer of the current administration's efforts to throw dust in the public's eyes to justify its blindly hegemonical goals. He's been there and seen that, and is seeing it again. This is an important addition to the discussion about America's foreign policy in the new century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cowboy politics","review":"In almost every category the Bush administration seems to be involved in a srew-up resulting from arrogance mixed with muddleheadedness. This gang is radically disruptive and prepared to tear up even normal standards as political givens. This book recounts this brashness in the realm of foreign policy, and especially in the lead up to the Iraq war with the alienation of its own allies by this tough guy administration of PR imperialists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misplaced blame","review":"What's the book about? It is a Bush basher, not much for deep stimulation over the real problems facing the U.S. and world. After the tragedy of 9/11, both sides of the U.S. political forum called for muscle and action in foreign policy and military action against terrorists. Goodman does not say what the threshhold is for dealing with dicators with Weapons of Mass Destruction. When should we act? Wait for which countries? Bring all to the U.N.? It had the potential to be a deep study, but turned out to be another angery Anti-bush book, which is fine by the authors, but does not address today's, and more importantly, tomorrow's national security concerns. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"the title track might throw you","review":"This really is a great Shorter record, but sometimes I play this record for people and they just don't get the title track. It must be the augmented chords...if you want to check this out I might suggest saving the title track for last. Yes or No is a classic. Deluge and Mahjongg are beautiful. I'd put this second or third in the Shorter catalog (1 and 2 being Speak No Evil and Night Dreamer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative of Coltrane--Shorter in limbo","review":"Derivative of Coltrane without that master's confidence, this is quickly dull listening, being repetitive and far too careful. Additionally, the fade-aways I find to be cheating. Certainly Shorter is finding himself here, but the uncertainty of direction is clear. Missing the fire of his work and compositions with Blakey, and certainly not near the artistic integrity of Adam's Apple. A Shorter fan, this is nevertheless a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wayne's Best","review":"This album is often frowned upon by jazz listeners who tend to find it too edgy and \\"different\\", but it has had a special place in the hearts of jazz musicians for years.

If you love Wayne, invest in this album. If you're just starting to listen to him, I recommend \\"Speak No Evil\\" or even \\"The All Seeing Eye\\" for the more avante-garde listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Album, Surprisingly bad sound quality","review":"This album is great, classic Wayne Shorter stuff. I'm writing this review because unfortunately the digital remastering is surprisingly poor. Usually you can count on a RVG remaster to be excellent, but with this one, there's a noticeable crack-up or buzz in the EQ of Shorter's saxophone that makes listening to this album on headphones somewhat torturous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent scholarship & extremely well written; a must read!","review":"Here's a book of true depth and scholarship.

It's very quiet, and on low you hardly hear it at all. It puts out a good amount of air and is very smooth with little vibration. I have other floor fans that are too noisy and put out too much air for in the house, but this one is perfect. It's well made and I'm sure it's going to last for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Really Blows...A good thing!","review":"I've had this running most of the day and evening for about three months now and it has worked great. I keep it in my bedroom for two reasons. One is white noise to drown out my wife's snoring, the other to circulate air which gets bad from all the gas being let into the atmosphere from my wife and dogs. I too was a owner of a older Patton fan that finally took a dump. After reading the reviews and seeing it is made in the US Like Patton was, I bought one. I will probably buy another to put in my lower level. This one would be for air circulation, not survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Air King 9214","review":"This fan arrived one day early and worked flawlessly out of the box.

Wrong! This book is random experiences that the author has had with different women during his womanizing. This is nothing more than a collection of cluttered confusion. There is no chronological order for the dates and times that are listed on the pages. This is not in a memoir format but just the author's random thoughts that have no rhyme or reason.

They are the same price and offer a better riding position that is more like a race bike. If you insist on the clubmans, you'll also need to get handlebar risers that give you a 1\\"-2\\" rise and a 1\\"-2\\" back-offset. Otherwise these bars place your weight way too far forward and you're going to be off balance for high speed turns(you'll end up putting all of your wight on the front tire, which only adds to its wear and makes the back end drift too much at high speed).Also of note... if you ride your bike more than 30 mins a day with these, you better be about 20 years old or they'll tear up your back something fierce. Go for the drag bars or buy the superbike bars and install them upside down.

But leave it to those idiot's at the record company that purchased the rights to this album to force E-40 to rewrite the songs and rerelease this watered down version post 1993. What a sad day in history. If you can find it look for the original in small used cd stores. I have the original on tape put it is slowly deteriorating because I play so much. Even after 12 years it still is the most hard hitting rap album of all time, The original that is. Not this water down garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooo!

Infamous is a lot more convincing and interesting, and the acting and supporting cast are much better than the Philip Seymour Hoffman version. That said, it still doesn't have the power and depth of the original \\"In Cold Blood\\" with Robert Blake. I don't think any remake will ever be able to match it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And the winner is...","review":"I'll just add my voice to those who found this a superior film to the earlier 'Capote.' It is more robust, well-rounded, and more interesting than the latter. This film is truly a 'film' and does not pretend to 'document' the story of Capote and the writing of the famous book. There is more opportunity to see the range of dynamics at work intrapsychically as Capote displays contradictory and complex feelings toward his subject. It is also aesethetically more original--one can see the artist/writer/director at work here, shaping the story, rather than allowing the original story, i.e., that of Capote researching and writing the book, shape it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd!","review":"This dvd only plays in licensed devices.

Absolutely absurd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infamous","review":"This version of Truman Capote's life far outshines the \\"Capote\\" one. The depiction of Capote is so much more real to life thanks to an absolutely marvelous acting job by Toby Jones (Painted Veil, Amazing Grace). Jones miraculously channels the soul of Truman Capote. There's humor. There's sadness. And there's a depth the 2005 version did not have. If you haven't seen Infamous, you're missing out! I pre-ordered the DVD so that I could have it in my collection as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible acting all the way around.","review":"It's difficult to watch this movie after having seen both Capote and the original version of In Cold Blood.

I have never come across a similar situation where two films issued close together cover the same ground. However if the quality is as high as this then that is no problem. This film is more sympathetic a portrait of Truman Capote with a cast and script of a higher standard. Daniel Craig is electifying as one of the murderers and worth the cost alone.

Pontificating and ponderous story from a young Dave Eggers wannabe whose works steals more than innovates. ... ...The writer's connections as a magazine gossip columnist have no doubt helped him finagle a deal for this over-hyped book. The charming Amaden curiously brags about his manipulative abilities in a recent New York Times blurb (4/6/03), a piece that characterized him a self-absorbed, image-obsessed hipster clawing for fame. Many seem to have been taken in by this yawning, pseudo-realistic shout-out to his childhood buddies from Rockville, Maryland, but the story has little point beyond the story of a kid coming of age with divorced parents. Oh-- it takes place in the NINETIES.... Mark Kostabi, meet your literary match."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Chick Lit Tripe","review":"Will it never end? Another meandering metrosexual book that does absolutely nothing for our generation. An imititation of an imitation of James Joyce, who was imitating a million monkeys sitting at typewriters. The characters are boring. The plot is non-existant. The blurbs are outrageous. The hype is unbearable. The editors at the corporate conglomerates will lose their jobs, and they will have to go hype mutual funds instead. They will be tried by the greater public for spamming the tables at Borders and Barnes and Noble with this insignificant trype, killing trees and engaging in deceit under the guise of irony to pay the rent for their NY roach-infested studio apartments.

I tried to get at least half way through, but alas the convoluted, coagulated text was unreadable. I think the people who wrote raving reviews were friends or Harvard professors. Thank the lord for the Kindle's dictionary function without it I would have been unable to decifer what the words meant, and a lot of them were in French and the Kindle does not have the French dictionary feature. So I had to guess on those. I would love to be this author capable of such grand text, but I think it was an injustice to the author that he wrote such a difficult to read masterpiece. And maybe it is good that the world does not know that Mr. Jefferson was a depressive wreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another unreadable book and another putdown","review":"It is perhaps hard to be sure this book is a putdown. For some, finding that Jefferson wasn't always rational and calm may make him more human and therefore more appealing, but for me it is a downer. He seems to have had a miseable inner life. Thank God that he was able nonetheless to do a lot of good. The book helps to explain many of Jefferson's wrongheaded views: about Hamilton, about the radicals in the French Revolution, etc.The author is talented but he quotes so extensively from Jefferson's own feelings, which in themselves are so unreadable, that the book necessarily becomes unreadable.This may indeed be a useful contribution to our knowledge but I could have done without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This is a worthwhile read for anyone wanting insight into Thai history or Thai culture the same way as \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" should be required reading for anyone studying 19th Century American history.I liked the book, but it is an intense read, and it isn't all that upbeat from a western perspective. There is a lot of sadness associated with the passage of time, and as an epic spanning the reign of four kings of Thailand, there is ample opportunity to see this in this work.I have never attempted to read even parts of the work in its original language, but I was entertained to see the another review saying that the content was much different.

He sees her broken heart and her terrified spirit; he sees she is being torn to pieces by the feud between her clan and another, a war that nearly killed her. He finds himself loving her despite her reputation and the fact that her father wants her to marry someone more noble.** The Linnet makes a strong statement about the power of anger to destroy one's soul, and the effects of revenge. More than that, it shows how love can heal the most broken soul. **Amanda Killgore"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is my favorite music - I listen to it almost every day.

I was hoping for an informative, interesting account of her life. I was greatly disappointed.Felix's book is badly in need of editing. First, the book contains obvious factual inconsistencies. In one chapter Laura's eyes are referred to as blue, in another, green. The book also contains numerous grammatical errors. Finally, Felix includes many confusing and completely unrelated tangents. For example, the first chapter contains a paragraph lamenting the plight of Native Americans in the 1800's. I'm not sure what that has to do with Laura Bush.This book has the feel of a hastily-written English assignment turned in after the first draft and padded with meaningless drivel in order to fulfill the word count requirements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very shallow and not worth reading","review":"Someday an excellent biography of Laura Bush will be written, but this isn't it.Indeed, this book is a great disappointment. It is shallow and uncritical; a \\"puff-piece\\" that could have been written by White House operatives or the Republican National Committee, either of which might have done a better job; short and amateurish; and it contains \\"filler\\" material about book festivals and the like that absorbs many of its 200 pages.Having read Julia Reed's June 2001 article in Vogue just before picking up this book, I was astounded by the difference between a well-written, insightful piece of writing and this wasted effort. It is clear that the author merely parroted other writers and provided little that we didn't know already about the lovely and talented Mrs. Bush.Surely Our First Lady deserves better than this.

I try to finish every book I start because there is usually some gem or life's truth waiting to be discovered. However, after she rambled on for 101 pages, Gabaldon decided to describe a hemorrhoid operation in great detail. Did her publisher require her to fill 1400 pages, and that's what she came up with?

After reading 101 pages (out of 1,438!), it was time for the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being a successful author means finding editing is gone?","review":"Knowing that Ms. Gabaldon writes in blocks or vignettes, the lack of transitions between chapters, including one chapter that seemed written earlier, but put into the story at a later point (past the fever/haircut), implies editing that is less passionate or less particular about the story than all of the fans.At the end, everyone is a villain. There is no one left to like among C and J's friends and extended family. Personally, I could have had MUCH less of the hemorrhoid ligature and Manfred's complaint. Even with personal knowledge of Patent Ductus Arteriosus, it seemed like the idea was to extend the page count, not to write a cohesive novel.There are similarities to the Harry Potter series.

I have read them multiple times and gave them to many friends. Therefore I muddled patiently through the Drums of Autumn and, yes, staggered through The Fiery Cross. When I picked this one up, it was with trepidation.Perhaps somewhere in this book is a plot, but it won't be found by me. I didn't make it past page 30. I agree that Ms. Gabaldon can write a lyrical sentence, paragraph, chapter and book, but she has fallen too much in love with the words she writes. When a writer gets bogged down in every detail of every scene, the narrative flow gets lost, and the story goes with it. I am sorely disappointed. I am sad that yet another writer and her editor do not understand that selling a zillion books doesn't mean that the story needs a zillion more words. Her readers deserve more respect.

Sadly the sparkle of her earlier books is missing in this work and her customary brilliant descriptive narrative flounders with the superfluous use of adjectives. She has, of late anyway, started subscribing to the school of using ten adjectives when one would do.

In fact, I deliberatly slowed down toward the end of the book because I did not want to finish it! I loved every page.

I finished the 900+ pages in a week, and started thinking with a Scottish accent and almost cried when it ended, because I didn't want to leave the characters \\"ya ken?\\".The way that Ms. Gabaldon tied up story lines, completed characters and jelled the whole series together is wonderfully done here, I believe.A funny coincidence, just after finishing this novel, I turned on the tv, and public television had on \\"KIDNAPPED\\" by Robert Louis Stevenson. One of the main characters is a tall, handsome, red headed Highlander!!! And all I could think of was, \\"HA!!!, he has NOTHING on Jamie\\"!!!!Ms. Gabaldon, I am forever in your debt for this wonderful series, and I thank you for letting me share in the character's lives once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"memorable characters","review":"It seems that no matter how long it is between books, I just can't forget thecharacters. They are so,so very well defined!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again I was spell bound.","review":"Once again Diana Gabaldon has done a wonderful job of captivating her audience with the continuation of the Outlander series in this book. Her discriptive writing makes you feel as though you are there with each character. This book as the others in this series is hard to put down and yet you don't want to finish the book because you don't want the journey to end. There is war and violence, hardship and joy and it is the most wonderful love story I have ever read. I have read the entire series twice and I am sure I will read A breath of Snow and Ashes again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic book!","review":"I really really liked this book! I have read all of her other 'Outlander\\" series, and I have been hooked ever since!I won't go into alot of details about the book, except to say that this is a continuing story of the Fraser family.I found 'A Breath of Snow and Ashes' a touching book, but also filled with action, and even more insight into the main and minor characters. I find myself more drawn into the lives of Claire and Jamie with each book, and I wonder if there will be another one?My only complaint is the long wait between books(which I understand), but other than that I was a very pleased. Diana Gabaldon is an excellent writer, and she does a great job of keeping the story moving, and to allow the reader to see more depth in each individual character. I would recommend this book to those looking for an excellent read-something with substance to it. Even if you are a first time reader of the 'Outlander' series, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY WAY WAY too much sex","review":"I'm no prude, but when a book needs to rely on sex every page or 2 it gets really tedious. Please. It isn't necessary for the plot. The participants were married for heaven's sake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"If you are looking for something to read that is like a real life story then this is the series for you...........each and every book keeps me captivated!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still love Jamie Fraser","review":"A little slower than her first books in the Outlander Series. But of course, it's a cliff-hanger ending and makes you ready to grab the next 1K+ page book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana makes history come alive!","review":"Diana Gabaldon has a great ability to weave her complex story and many characters with history, thus making it all come alive and real. When I read her books I feel like I am there and have a greater understanding of how it must have been to live during the birth of our country."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Addition to This Huge Story","review":"Another massive tome about Claire and Jamie. I loved this book, as I do all of Ms. Gabaldon's work. This volume in the giant saga advances the story in many ways. Some plotlines were expected, but she managed to surprise me many times. Much of this book takes place in colonial America and focuses on the approach of the Revolutionary War. It is a fascinating time in our nation's history. I have learned a great deal while enjoying this story. I love these characters, and look forward to reading the next volume. I only wish there were more books in the series already published. Write faster, Diana. I can't get enough of the Frasers.Michael Travis Jasper, author of the novel \\"To Be Chosen\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not disappoint!","review":"Bravo! Diana has done it again. I was intrigued by the twist and turns, the character maturity and the surprises in between. This book does not disappoint...worth the read and the wait. Will there be another book after this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gabaldon's last book hard to put down","review":"This book was extremely hard to put down, and even though the descriptions are intricate, the scenes sweep you along and you find yourself immersed in the characters' lives, turning the next page to see what happens to them. I hadn't found a book for a long time that kept me reading well after the time I should have gone to sleep. I love the characters of Jaime and Claire, and at one point I suspected that Brianna and Roger were gonna call it quits. She's strongwilled, and he's a nice guy, too nice, and decides he wants to become a minister. I couldn't imagine Brianna willing or wanting to sit through 3 hours of his sermons (which was the norm for Presbyterian services). I almost thought she was going to have a passionate affair with her cousin Ian, who I consider much more attractive in character if not in looks (according to the author's descriptions). But overall, it's a totally satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow & Ashes","review":"Book arrived in very good condition. Haven't gotten to it reading wise, going through the whole series. Happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiobook - A Breath of Snow and Ashes","review":"I guess I must've missed the part of the description that said this audiobook was abridged - but I started listening to it, thinking I wouldn't notice the abridgement. After all, the jacket said the author had approved the version. After listening to 3.5 CDs I realized I was missing some important details. So I popped it out and set it aside and hope to read the book (which I own) sometime when I get the chance. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breath of Snow and Ashes","review":"This latest entry in the Fraser series made me care, again, about Claire and Jamie and Bree and all the rest and finally brought home to me the day to day horror of living on the brink of civil war...which is surely what our revolution was. I reserve 5 stars for the best of the best. Outlander gets 5. In reality, ABOSAA should be perhaps a 4.5. Whatever, I loved it. I think every other follower of the Jamie/Claire adventures will, also. Diana is back in form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ending to the series","review":"Finally the last epic of Claire and Jamie, Diana G has compleded the series in a good way, I was satisfied with the completion, it was time for the end to come, after all how many war's could Jamie still conquer! Good read, recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated and Boring","review":"I am mystified by all the glowing reviews I have read here. After the disappointment of \\"The Fiery Cross,\\" I was sure the next book would be more in the style of the first three excellent books in this series. Unfortunately, I was wrong. This book is filled with endless boring descriptions of Claire's medical practice and the diseases she attempts to treat with her 20th century knowledge. There's also way too much of Brianna, Roger and the annoying Jem. And Roger's religious endeavors are a sure insomnia cure. The real action of the book doesn't take place until the last 100 pages or so. The book would have been much better if Claire and Jamie actually lived in Philadelphia or Boston during this period of time instead of North Carolina. All in all, a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bloom is off the rose","review":"The series should have ended before this volume. It's bloated, repetitive, boring, and self-indulgent, not a cohesive story but a collection of vignettes, often unrelated to the main characters we know and love. A sharp editor should have sliced this huge book in half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I am in love with this book and it is even better than was promised on the website! Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"After 4000","review":"Ok, time travel is improbable, but the history of Scotland and the Colonies, the contrast of medical knowledge and practices between the two times, and the characters involved have kept me fascinated from the first book,thousands of pages ago. The series should be read in order. Adventure, romance, suspence: it's all there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have been an avid fan of author Diana Gabaldon, and in love with the character Jamie since first reading Outlander years ago.This book, like the preceding Fiery Cross has been a huge disapointment. Me thinks Ms. Gabaldon has gotten very full of herself.......so many words, so little story line! It's like being at a cocktail party and listening to someone who loves to hear themselves talk, go on and on and on and on.... Enough of all the tedious, boring details, Diana. This book could have easily said what she wanted it to in about 1/3 the amount of pages. Maybe we wouldn't have to wait years for the next book, if she'd just cut the length. This book wouldn't win over any NEW readers, how could someone who hadn't read ALL of the previous books even begin to be interested in this overlong, overblown story."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pick up","review":"I found this book to be a pick up in a series that seemed to be dead ending. I enjoyed it, but there were some inconsistencies that really bothered me. Otherwise, this is a great continuation of the Outlander story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breath of Snow and Ashes","review":"I enjoyed this book as I have all of the other books I have read from this series. It is obvious Diana Gabaldon researches as she writes. Flora and fauna are correct for the area and, as far as I know, so are the everyday living events, i.e. food preservation and cooking. Fiction is still fiction but her writing makes it seem more like nonfiction with a fictitious ease of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Read by D.G.","review":"Overall I give this book a thumbs up. Although it contains several exciting and anxiety-filled subplots that D.G. readers have become accustomed to, the focus of the story is not entirely on Jamie and Claire. Instead, the author devotes half the book to following other characters such as Jamie and Claire's daughter, Brianna, and her family, in addition to events leading up to the American Revolution.I am a huge fan of Jamie and Claire's exploits, so I tend to get bored in spots that contain descriptive dialog instead of plot twists. I also got confused a few times while reading the book because the conversation did not flow naturally... I had to reread a few parts to figure out who was saying what to whom - as if Diana was in a hurry when she wrote the book.Nonetheless, A Breath of Snow and Ashes is worth reading for those of you who wish to follow the continuing saga of Jamie and Claire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oregongal","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I felt like the story at times was disjointed and hard to follow. Some scenes in the book seem to be a repeat of scenes from the previous books. After reading the other books in the series I was looking forward to the continuing story of Jamie and Claire but after struggling through this one I wonder how much more there is to tell. The writing is nothing like the first fours books. I could hardly put them down when reading them. This one I couldn't wait to put it back and on the shelf and be done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite done","review":"An amazingly well written book about the years preceeding the Revolutionary War, including some uprisings in the Carolinas that few people even know about (even historians). For all the fiction, there are layers of fact that sublimely assist in the story.There is much to be said about what this book is not; for starters, is not a conclusion to the storyline, it's not a summation or ending of the tale, and it's definitely not a satisfactory stopping point. There are many items and questions left unanswered, especially with a teaser in the back that is an excerpt of a the 'last' novel in which Jaimie leads a regiment of soldiers in battle during the American Revolutionary War."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I'm only 50 pages into this book, but I have no desire to read anymore. I'm bored to tears. There's one too many POV's (every character, it seems, has been given one) and there is NOTHING happening. We've been dropped into the middle of daily life in the 1700's. Doing wash, raising children, watching our neighbors get married. There really is nothing more interesting than that happening, and from reading the other reviews, I gather that's all there IS to this book. I started to read it for the love of Jamie and Claire and I feel...deprived. Sorry, but I don't recommend this one. I'd rather re-read Outlander again than trudge through this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying, as usual","review":"Gabaldon paints her books with thick color. Her characters are so well-developed that I feel I know them all very well. A Breath of Snow and Ashes closes some questions left from earlier volumes, and rounds out some character detail. I don't want to give anything away here, but it was a thoroughly satisfying read. Happily, it also leaves an opening for further Jamie/Clair volumes.After reading this 6th book in the series, I started with Outlander and am re-reading them all. They're giving me as much pleasure the second time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again satisfied....","review":"If you have read all of the other \\"Outlander\\" books, and are still compelled to read more of Jamie and Claire, you will not be dissapointed. I think some of the reviews I read were extemely harsh in disfavor of Ms Gabaldon's latest editions, I challenge them to find another author that will go to lengths she does in character developement and still keep the story alive and \\"in love\\". I hope this is not the end and she will write of them again! I enjoy the maturing of Jamie and Claire, and think you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"It seems to wrap up too fast","review":"I have read the entire Outlander series, and have even ventured to Scotland and happened to see Diana's books on display at the Culloden gift store. I have loved every moment of these books - in fact, I listen to the audio versions when I am in my studio painting. My problem with this (unhappily the last one) of the saga is that I feel like she rushed the last few chapters. And I am still confused about (spoiler) the last scene where Briana doesn't know who \\"Jeremiah Fraser\\" is. Duh- isn't that Jemmy? It just seems like such a meticulous writer as Diana is, that she seemed to wrap it up very quickly in the end. And I wanted more...she promised more of William and John Grey,"},{"rating":"2","title":"another excellent book","review":"love this series, every book keeps you glued to the pages with interest. im sad the series is almost over"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Ok - what is going on here with our awesome series? I loved the first 3 books, the Fiery Cross was pretty good, but this is horrible. The writing is disjointed and actually gets very boring sometimes. Ms. Gabaldon goes into detail ad nauseum in so many areas that I am, at this point, just forcing myself to finish this book. I cannot identify with Brianna at all - she seems so aloof and snotty and selfish. Where are the passionate scenes between Jamie and Claire? The intimacy seems forced and shallow. The plot seems to go this way and that with too many tangents. I am SO very disappointed in this book and will not recommend it to all of the other people that I got hooked on this series. It is not worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book","review":"My wife bought this book to read on her kindle. She enjoyed it very much and it was a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I love the way Diana wrights these books. Start at the beginning of the series though so you will know what is going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"In love with this series!","review":"I don't know how she manages to have such lengthy books and a long series and still an excellent plot but I simply can't get enough of these books. Great amount of suspense and I love the historical fiction aspect as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book. Love series","review":"I have gotten into this series. I just order the new hardback book, we can't get in the us, from Amazon in the UK....."},{"rating":"2","title":"There has to be another one...","review":"I was out of work this summer and read the entire series between July and September, couln't wait to get my hands on this one. I found the events and the characters darker in many ways than in the other volumes even though the wit and humor of the characters was familiar and warming. I hope the box of letters means that there will be another Outlander in the future...too much left unresolved for this to be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment. I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rabbits of Fraser Ridge","review":"Does our beloved author have sex on the mind, or what? She certainly has it on almost every other page. And THREE days after the incident Claire believes she can detect signs of pregnancy? Ah well, at least they are back. I didn't have as much scorn for FC as others, but this is certainly better. In a nasty war-that was in large part a civil war-the Carolinas were quite possibly the nastiest place to be and possibly more suited to her characters, I think, than Boston or Philadelphia would be. I would like to see them more involved in the mainstream events though. I approach the ending with trepidation due to the wails of other reviewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"She did it again...","review":"Wow, was I glad to read other's fine reviews. I have been a fan since Outlander and have literally read the first three books over 10 times each. I took the time to reread all the previous books in September before \\"Snow & Ashes\\" and I am glad I did so. I love them all but not since Outlander and some of \\"Dragonfly\\", have I been so emotionally involved. This book took me almost a week to read (I work full-time and have kids)I finished it and immediately reread it. Great job, Diana, you are an amazing author. And yes, I am somewhat embarrassed about my unseemly Jamie and Claire addiction, but I live with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise for Diana Gabaldon","review":"This is the last book in a wonderful series by Diana Gabaldon. It is simply great. She has a very engaging way of writing that puts you in the book and lets you experience what is happening as if you are there. It is obvious to me that she thoroughly researches her book's time frames as they refer not only to people, but to their way of living and to the sciences available. I am not a history buff, but I have learned more (and enjoyed it) reading her books than I have learned from any other source to date!"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],H={key:0},R={key:1};function B(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(x,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-22698d0d"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/26.md","filePath":"guide/26.md"}'),N={name:"guide/26.md"},P=Object.assign(N,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
