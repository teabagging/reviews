This is quick and easy and still allows for fast removal for emptying the canister. The sanding pad does wear out from time to time.

It had very low noise when operating through the air gap faucet, unlike the other reviewer said the noise was high. My drain line was very short, about 12-15in, that may be why.If I have any complaint, the only one is after i used this RO to supply water to my frige.

My other RO system (different brand) in other house reads 15'ish ppm, but thats had its filter changed a few months ago. Hopefully after more usage or another flush, it'll go down a little more.One complaint i had with this RO system was that the included faucet is pretty annoying as the air gap goes through it. So whenever the RO system is working, it'll make a whirring/ whining noise and i could hear the water going through.

One might wish it to be a bit less vast, but if you can make your way through it, you will learn a lot about the subject. Slight demerits, from my perspective as a fine arts photographer, are that (1) the primary target audience seems to be Photoshop users who are doing work for someone else, and (2)some of the techniques described seem excessively complex, as though learned during the use of earlier versions of Photoshop. However, there is no question that this is a thorough, very useful, and clearly written treatment, as are all Eismann's contributions to the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly illustrated & badly in need of a an update","review":"For a book that purports to be the bible on all things masking and selecting in Photoshop some of the images used to illustrate the techniques described are practically useless, particularly in the way selection edges are treated. Photoshop's ubiquitous marching ants are often invisible.Also, with Photoshop CS5 now available a text based on the first release of CS is starting to look pretty dated. Sure, most of the techniques described in the book are still available in CS5, but so are 4 generations of product development and additional tools that perform tasks in one or two steps, instead of the six or seven this book describes.Useful if you want a first principles understanding of where Photoshop has come from, and how it works, but if you just want to do stuff I suggest many of Scott Kelby's publications would be a better option."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"For all the reasons every other reviewer mentions, and more, Katrin Eismann is the best on Photoshop.

The pads that they require are great, but get all full of paint in a very short time. If you use these pads with a grinder, it works fantastic!

I have needed to remove multiple layers of paint from window sills and a garage door before, and am looking to do so soon again for a different house.I am hoping to find a tool that can do paint removal better than what I've used so far. I thought I would post my experience here for others to learn from.I've used a torch, heat gun, belt sander, finishing sander, and an air-powered dual-action disc sander. I just wanted to post that if you want light weight, the air-powered dual-action sander isn't bad. Use 50-grit sticky discs and plenty of compressed air (6hp and 230V is probably better. I used 4hp/120V and paused to allow the compressor to catch up.)The torch makes for larger, less windblown rubbish, but is somewhat slower and when I got annoyed sometimes scorched the underlying wood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product..watch out for gummed up disks.","review":"I am using the 7403 on a 102 yr old Victorian home that my wife and I are restoring. The 7403 works great until you get to the point where the latex builds up and gums the carbide disks. Shy of a heat gun (take it off the 7403 before using the heat), nothing really removes it quickly. I have a total of three disks and it seems that perhaps 6-8 disks would have been better. I keep switching them out as they gum up with paint. At the end of the day, I use the heat gun on all of them and clean up w/ a wire brush.Our house has seven layers of paint and a layer of stain below that. If you have fewer layers, you will be most likely better off. A previous review mentioned fatigue, due to the weight of 7403. This is especially true of overhead use (under porches etc.). Plan on resting every so often or you will be sore for days on end.The short story is that it works works well, but plan on sticky disks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great motivational poster","review":"High quality printing, very pleasant looking poster, the view and the message are very inspiring.

On Stage is a good brand however, the 3 guitar stand is disappointing. In fact I would have sent it back had I not thrown away the box and the invoice that came with it. Overall the construction is good but the arms that support the guitar necks are not long enough and so the headstocks are about 1/8th of an inch apart and if you're not careful the heads and tuners bump into each other.

A lot of the reviews for other triple guitar stands claimed problems with sturdiness and not enough separation (guitar heads banging together). This one was a bit pricy but the single review stated that it was very durable and strong.After receiving this stand and assembling it (which was fairly straightforward), I have found this guitar stand to be indeed durable and strong. I have 2 electrics and one acoustic on it. The guitars do not touch and the material used for the stand's construction is strong yet soft. Overall, I would say this is probably one of the better triple guitar stands out there. It is a little pricy, but still a decent value."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH A BROKEN GUITAR!!!","review":"yeah it's a great price, but a triple guitar stand is supposed to fit 3 guitars on it.

He wanted a stand so we chose this one. It did not specify what types of guitar it would hold. This stand does not accommodate acoustic guitars.

About 95% have no problem, but quality control is a bit lacking and some bad ones are inevitable at this price. All disks are made to absorb water and expand to form a very tight bond when coated with wood glue - that's part of what makes them work. They come in non-resealable plastic bags and are fine when they arrive but if you use some and don't put the remainder in something water tight, they will expand and become too big to fit. That's not just these, but ALL wood disks. It would be great if they came in resealable containers, but they don't, so have some gallon size ziplocks on hand when you open them and don't get them wet. Great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"biscuits","review":"I've seen some reviews on these biscuits where some guys had problems with cracked or some other problem with the biscuits but from the order I purchased I may have had a handful broken.I guess the company listened to the reviews and corrected the problem.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of biscuits","review":"Not sure what the others here are griping about--I've only used a couple dozen so far, but every one fit perfectly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality control seems to be missing","review":"I recently opened a brand new sealed package (read: not having been sitting around open to humid conditions) which I bought here at Amazon.

There a flashes of a genuinely humorous sensibility, but they are too few and too poorly placed, often coming after a melodramatic episode, producing a high level of dissonance. Not to horrify the author with a PC remark, but many scenes and character-deliniations are truly offensive, and if one substituted 'black', 'Jewish', or 'Catholic', etc., for 'Arab', the disgust level would would be off the chart.Certainly a potential reader should make up his own mind.My best advice: don't get the book dirty, as you may decide to return it after reading the first few rollicking pages and then arriving at a turgid bog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody does it better","review":"I have read Supreme Courtship, No Way to Treat a First Lady, Boomsday and now Florence, and I loved every one of them whether I agreed with the profile of the person or concept being pilloried or not.

It revolves around an American woman, bent on freeing Arab women from chop-chop of hands and heads, starting a TV station that is nothing like what the emir had authorized.One reviewer says this is insulting to Arabs.

The metal crosspiece is dangerous and unnecessary. You don't need them. Put the 's' hook directly onto the harness. Instead of a weight or waterbag use a handle tied to the rope. I use a short piece of plastic pipe for a handle. A small hand barbell could be used. I pull on the rope gently and steady for 15 - 30 seconds then release gently. after a few seconds I repeat. I do this for 10 to 20 minutes. The purpose is to stop the muscle spasms (which is the cause of the problem) with out stretching the ligaments to much. Continual pulling for several minutes at a time often causes more spasms, even muscle injury, and stretches the ligaments causing possible further injury because the bones are not held in place properly. Do not continue if this causes pain! And remember to drink more water to inflate the sponge like discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"This product was what it was represented to be and they shipped it to me quickly.

Fluid lines, interesting harmonies, great melodic ideas, clean technique...he's got it all. This book and CD are very useful for understanding his style. I would recommend it more for the player who has some traditional background in music theory, than for a beginner. Pat's ideas on music are not exactly standard. They are pretty easy to understand and use, though. The books format includes musical material written by Pat. The examples are written in standard notation and tablature (always a 'plus' for me). There are very few 'typos' to deal with. The ideas used as examples are wonderful. The CD included is froma video of the book, and is performed by Pat himself. It's nearly worth the cost of the book by itself, but having the notated form to look at while you're listening makes it even better. I fully expect to benefit greatly from exploring these ideas myself. And I expect to buy volume two also."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Ripoff","review":"I totally agree with the previous review. This Dvd is pointless. I also had high expectations!!!! Unlike Classic Albums (The Making Of Machine Head) Dvd, this release only has one member involved with Burn (Glenn Hughes) commenting. The others involved with Burn were only heard from via old boring archived footage. There was no discussing how the band came up with the song ideas or any other insight which could have made this a potentially interesting Dvd. I also thought that the little archived live footage that was contained, also lacked quality production. Last but definitely not least, this release was being reviewed by critics nobody has ever heard of, with possibly the exception of Gillan's bass player, and he was biased toward the Mark 11 lineup. I honestly dont know why they bothered to produce this Dvd, there was no ambition!!! How naive of me!!! MONEY!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to beat a dead horse but..............","review":"As the previous reviews have stated, this DVD it pointless. It sort of reminded me of those boring high school conversations about which album is better and who's a better guitarist. You like what you like and you don't need critics telling you what is better. I think Burn is a great album from beginning to end (well, maybe except for the instrumental) but that's my opinion. I was really hoping for some insight into how they recorded the album and a review of the creative process. After watching this DVD, I'm still hoping. Don't waste your money. However, if you are still interested, buy it from me ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting Voice!","review":"I'm in my 20s and love jazz/standards.

What a beautiful rendition of Johnny Mandel and Dave Frishberg's tune.Thank you Stacey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"It took me a while to get turned on to Stacey Kent, because she doesn't get nearly the hype that Diana Krall and now Jane Monheit get (Krall deserves it, Monheit needs to grow as a singer before she will). But having heard Dreamsville, I'm excited to have found a new artist to add to my playlist. First, there is that voice: sweet yet breathy and seductive. Add to that the fact that she knows how to truly sing, not just exhibit her vocal skills (something Monheit desperately needs to learn). Kent makes each song her own, yet does it in such a way that the song retains its identity. There's not a weak link on this CD, but for me, \\"Hushabye Mountain\\" stands out as a showcase of Kent's ability to breathe emotion into a song. Be warned, however: if you're one of those people who think Krall's \\"The Look of Love\\" is \\"boring\\" because \\"all the songs sound the same\\" (i.e. because there's no \\"Hit That Jive Jack\\") then this album may be a bit above your musical appreciation skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning to Succeed","review":"Where Confidence really succeeds and differentiates itself from other Business Books and Self Help Books is that it looks at the foundation of winning, how to build a strong basis for success.It teaches that much like poker, you can do everything right and have the wrong result, and you can do everything wrong and get the right result, but that over time, the only way to succeed both professionally and personally is to set yourself up for success with the right attitude and beliefs.Confidence is a must read for entrepreneurs and corporate employees alike. It leads the reader to ask vital questions about whether one is setting themselves -- and their team -- up for success or failure.Applying the lessons in Confidence can inspire an individual or team to believe in themselves and create long business winning streaks. From salesman to project managers, the tools in Confidence can significantly enhance your business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Verbose, Repetitive, Does not respect reader's time","review":"This book is overly hyped. It seemed to start well but about half way through I found it hard to continue. The book goes on and on saying the same thing - none of which is very insightful - over and over again and again . The author has picked up three themes for confidence - accountabiliity, collaboration and initiative and twists every example to suit this theme. In most examples these are just one piece of the puzzle and in no way the complete solution by themself. The book could have been a third of its size and could have probably doen a better job at getting the point across.in short - your time is better spend on other things. The only cofidence you need is to say No to this book and know that you will not be any worse off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a pass...Nothing new here.","review":"Repetitious. Long-winded.

In retrospect I wish I had first gone to Amazon to check the unusually high number of 1-star reviews this book has received.The core message is that winning leads to more winning by attracting resources and talent and building confidence. Likewise, losing leads to more losing by detracting resources and investment and eroding team confidence. A losing organization can turn itself around by building up the three pillars of confidence: accountabilty, collaboration, and iniative/innovation.The book's message could have been expressed in 1/3 of the space. Instead you have to wade through one repetitive story after another, mainly from high school and college football, ad nauseum.My advice is to save your money and look for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"30,000 foot? or 40,000---whatever its HIGH LEVEL","review":"WHile an easy read, I found this book content free.

But soon (within a couple chapters) I realized that the author had run out of new things to say. While there are some non-fiction authors that can captivate and entertain an audience with a single concept (ie... Gladwell w/\\"Tipping Point/Blink\\"), this author's writing style seems unusually laborious and repetitive -- languishing in incomprehensible detail. Sad to say, but I think I would have been better off just reading a synopsis of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written resource for outdated/irrelevant/80s concepts","review":"There's not an ounce of meat in this book.This book features a steady stream of the author's self-praise and excessive \\"name-dropping\\".

The thesis of the book is never really developed and the text is directionless and slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is boring, tedious, and thoroughly uninspiring","review":"I can't believe the average customer review is greater than 4 stars! This book was a chore to read; I will admit that I could not drag myself throught he entire text. And I mean \\"text\\". This book was written like a textbook. I felt I back in college slogging through my required reading. This book was written as if someone did a whole bunch of research (using many different grad students of course), then tried to compile all the data into a book. The problem is, anybody can do that, but few can do that well. The writer loses the reader in all those details, forgeting to stick to the basics, highlight them with interesting examples, and repeat them often. I know she probably thinks she did this, and she did, just not well. I've never seen such an interesting topic made so boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless Repetition","review":"Long-winded, short on ideas. The thesis of this book can be summed up in one short sentence: Success makes further success easier while failure begets failure. Why this takes 400 pages to say is beyond my understanding. The remaining space is devoted primarily to simplified anecdotes further illustrating this simple point. My Recommendation: Skim the argument over the first 5 pages in a book store. While saving yourself both time and money you will come away with a perfect understanding of everything this book has to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just read it!","review":"A great perspective on sustainability.

Brad Pitt does an excellent job of narration. It reminds me of that line in Frank Herbert's novel \\"Dune\\" - \\"The first step in avoiding a trap, is knowing of its existence\\".

Mary Sheedy Kurcinka's Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles is a terrific one. The information on the temperament types is more brief, but again, you can get the gyst pretty easily, and the practical side is much richer... and that, for me, was more important. In addition, the Power Struggles book also covers the parent's personality type and how to work your temperament WITH your child's and know where the danger zones are."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Virtual Experience..!","review":"Jim, Jerry, & Kathy have given us the opportunity to BE THERE..!

We watch, holding our breath, as the trio actually drive their SUV over these treacherous passes careening dangerously close to their own demise.

The quietest printer I have ever heard, with very good speed, and the colors are excellent, even using my old Epson glossy photo paper. My Epson was hooked up parallel, but the canon only has a USB hook-up. I had to do some rearranging as my laptop only has two USB ports, but that is no problem. The only frustrating thing is that I ordered this about 2 hours before Canon put a rebate on, of $40. I called Canon but they would not honor it, even though I missed it by only 2 hours. If I were buying this in a store, the salesman might have warned me to wait a day, for the rebate.

I was surprised that it did not look like the typical electrolux vacuum(which has the same basic look for years). This product is made by Electrolux in sweden and it is hard to find parts because Electrolux USA is not involved with this vacuum. That is why you are having trouble finding parts. By the way - Electrolux USA has changed its name to Aerus/Electrolux and still has the same quality vacuums as the one I own. I have been told that the Oxygen is a good product but since it is not made by the same electrolux USA company people are mislead into believing that they can go to any Electrolux dealer for service which isn't so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electrolux 6989A Oxygen Ultra Vacuum Cleaner","review":"This is the worst vacuum cleaner I ever owned. Until month ego I used Kenmore canister vacuum. After 9 years I decided it's time for new one so I purchased Electrolux. And today I'm asking myself why? Filter bags are so small, they need to be replace after two times of use. Belt broke after 22 days of use. I tried local Electrolux dealers - they don't stock belt for my model. I called Electrolux parts dept. - guess what - out of stock.

I would never buy this again, and am not ever sure that I'd feel right selling it used to anyone. My biggest complaints - it tips over at the slightest hangup on a piece of furniture or doorway, the fact that the handle only turns one say (Drew is right...it's absurd...and my hand hurts afterwards from trying to keep the power nozzle in line), and my retractable cord is broken after about four uses..it won't retract any longer.Don't buy it - shop around a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of JUNK!!!","review":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS VACUUM. Electrolux took the perfectly good Eureka Oxygen and found a way to sell them at half the price by substituting cheap parts. I owned the original Eureka oxygen for 5 years and it was fantastic. I then decided to use that one for my basment and get the new one for our main floor. BAD MOVE. I've got wires burning up, and handles that quit working after a whopping 2 months of use. I'm throwing it in the garbage now and buying a $100.00 Hoover."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst vacuum cleaner we have ever purchased","review":"My wife bought this based on consumer reports recommendation. What a crock of you know what. With the power head on you can only turn it to the right. What idiot would design something like this. Would you buy a car that only turned to the right???There is also some cheap c-clip thing that holds the power head on. This clip is always getting knocked off and lost and then you are without the power head until you go online and find new ones-- (good luck finding them-- when you do you better bookmark the web site cause you'll need more later). I just had to order 3 more at $5 each!!Stay far, far away from this vacuum cleaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run! Run! Run! from this machine!","review":"I have two dogs, so I purchased this vacuum for its flexibility. The Consumer Reports website rated it highly. It worked great a couple times, then the problems started. The power head began to work intermittently, especially after 10 minutes or so of use. Then the release switch on the power head broke. The bag change indicator doesn't come on until the bag is overfull. That makes it almost impossible to change without breaking the bag and spilling dust in the bag container. Plus, the bag is really small. I drove the vacuum to a certified repair center 35 miles from my home where it's being held hostage. That was almost 3 months ago. As soon as I walked in with it, the guy laughed and said this machine is a hunk of junk. Well, it's still under warranty but I think Electrolux should extend it according to the amount of time it's been in the shop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This vacuum blows..","review":"I purchased this vacuum about 5 mos. ago and I so hate it.

Cheaper vac's have done a much better job. I regret spending the money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy again....","review":"I purchased this vacuum back in July of 2005. When it works it seems to be a very fine vacuum. This vacuum has been in the shop no less than 3 times for various issues. Each time I waited several months because repair parts were not readily available. This last time when the on/off switch failed the shop told me it was connected to a electrical PC board the repair would be $200. That was enough, and I scraped it. Some may say 6 years is a good life, but the Kenmore it replaced was 10+ of solid performance. If you are going to spend for a high end vacuum, stay away from Electrolux. Better yet, ask you local repair shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I could create more suction with a straw! Very disappointing unit backed by possibly the most unhelpful support personnel imaginable. Used for quite some time but still no light comes on for bag full.

I have owned it for less than five months and, as of yesterday, am the satisfied new owner of a Dyson. I became so frustrated everytime I used it. I could not believe the issues with the power nozzle always turning to the right. I showed it to several people and they all had the same opinion as me, it is the worse design ever. Although I thought the suction was good, I ran the electrolux and then followed up with the Dyson and it was just amazing how much dirt, dust, carpet fuzz.... was picked up by the Dyson after I thought the rug was clean from the electrolux. Customer service was very poor from Electrolux. I emailed 3 times before I got a response which said that I needed to call customer service. They just said they designed the vacuum with the wayward power head and there was nothing they would/could do.

Do not buy this product! It began falling apart as soon as I started using it. The crappy plastic clip will not hold the head to the wand and no one has been able to fix it.

We have owned it for 3 months and the carpet power head is already broken. The suction is fair. We are VERY disappointed with the quality of this vacuum for its very expensive price! I grew up with an Electrolux in the 1970's and that thing was an animal! My mother had that vacuum for almost 20 years without a hitch! We're going back to the Eureka Mighty Mite (which is under $100.00). The old Eureka we had did a MUCH better job being that we have 2 dogs and 5 cats. Crazy? Yes, but we love our animal companions! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"lemon","review":"I have had this set for less than two years and although the set performs well it continues to blow power supplies.

Not one can be compared to the other. Even though these songs are decades old they still hold that freshness. Karen Carpenter was one in a million.

Karens vocals send chills down your spine, and Richards arrangements of the songs really tug at the heart strings. Karens life was far too brief, although the legacy of the music we have recorded by her touches millions of people around the world, and especially at Christmas with the many Seasonal songs the Carpenters recorded. This album is a great Gift for the holidays, birthdays or whatever! and is a REAL gem to add to any one's CD collection. What gift is better than the gift of music . . . ?

I am sure that you will never get tired listen to her sing. Second, Richard's arrangement is very superb. The beautiful carpenters songs are the result of Karen's finest voice and Richard's masterful arrangement. Third most of the Carpenters are written by top notched song writer teams (Hal Davis/Burt Bacharach, Nichols/Williams, Richard Carpenter/John Bettis)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Warmest Voice in Pop Music History","review":"For those Carpenters non-fanatics who are looking for a good compilation (of the seemingly hundreds that Richard keeps churning out), this is the best place to start.

My router operates with the power button on the off position. This machine obviously never went though a quality inspection at the factory.The second problem is the router continually locks the bits in the collet. I tried every lubricant imaginable without success. Once the bit is locked in, plan on keeping it in place for a while, a very long while. I have been forced to use pliers to pry the bits out. The freezing complaint is repeated numerous times by other users. I incorrectly assumed Porter Cable (PC) would have resolved this by the time of my purchase.I must be missing something here. For the $160 price the PC 310 cost, you can buy the PC 690LR ($125) with more power and still get some router bits for less. The PC 310 is a dinosaur doomed to extinction. We can only hope PC either re-engineers this product or stops production before it further tarnishes its reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping","review":"Amzn shipping took way too long for me to give this product a positive review- I recommend purchasing elsewhere.

The flashlight has a lightweight feel to it without the battery installed, so it clerly doesn't feel as \\"heavy duty\\" or solid as, let's say, a drill might feel, but I figure what should I expect? Maybe the yellow and black color scheme along with the DeWalt label makes me expect more? But, heck, it's only a flashlight! You can't vary the beam width as you can with a MagLite but you can pivot the head which has proven useful at least once.

He doesn't, thankfully, but the results are nonetheless disappointing.Archer still shows signs of being a good story teller in this book, but gone were the excitement, interest, and diabolical twists to which we have become accustomed in his writing. As others have mentioned, plot twists were mostly uininteresting. They were also excruciatingly obvious (except for one, which was simply wrapped up in two \\"let's get this over with\\" paragraphs near the end.

But this book is..... well, seeming lost, and a little short on the thrills and clever turns we've come to expect.The first half of the book relies a little to heavily on the horror of September 11 for me to be comfortable with it, and the latter part of the book is entirely too predictable. It is as if it is two books trying to be one, and in my opinion neither entirely succeeds.This is an easy read of course, and the hero is a sympathetic character. However, the motivations of the bad guys are relatively ill defined, and none of the action ever rings true.Jeffrey Archer has written many much, much better books - go and find them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How the mighty have fallen","review":"Far below the earlier works by Archer and poorly edited as well.

False Impression is a high speed thriller which revolves around the main character Anna Petrescu, an intelligent protagonist, who (presumed dead on the Sep 11 attack) finds a way to escape and investigate the murder of Lady Wentworth. The events, description of places, and attention to details keep the book interesting. In fact, it is so interesting that you can read the book in couple of days.It was not the first Jeffrey Archer novel I read but it is definitely the one I liked most. Actually, I must say that this one is better than his \\"Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less\\". He maintained the quality of his work even after spending two years in prison.

It fails to excite, surprise or thrill even the most avid of Archer fans. After \\"An Honour Amongst Thieves\\" (which was equally puerile and predicatble) this was the next (and the last) Archer I bought.It seems that in the name of new books, Archer is simply changing the names of characters of his popular titles and torturing us with rehash versions of his bestsellers from 80s - all the stories have exactly the same underlying theme and as we say in India - the same \\"masala\\". With its car, truck, plane chases, evil lawyer/banker blah blah theme, it could well have been written by some 3rd rate Hindi novelist from Merut. I am sure even Bollywood (now with its new race of directors) would not be interested in buying any story ideas from Archer.Disappointing and kitschy.Don't read it even if you are stranded on an Island, with no company.

The heroine is a modern professional woman with a really authentic feel, (I hate drama queens). The story unwinds as she moves around the world attempting to save herself and everybody else while trying to hold on to a very valuable Van Gogh. It's well done with the story twisting again and again leading to one surprise after another. There is tension and suspense, but the level does not leave you feeling like you've had too much coffee. This is a story that stands on its own but coupled with the everyday business of art it becomes it a real treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Crapola","review":"Maybe its just me, but this has to be one of the worst books I can ever remember finishing.

What I found disappointing is that on the first page of the book, van Gogh is an Impressionist, but in all my art history books, van Gogh was a Post-Impressionist. His works were very different from that of Monet or Degas or the style of the Impressionists. Its really easy to open a book and see where he is classified in the world of art. I know that it may sound a technicality and trivial, but wouldn't a person that knows all about art as Anna supposedly does, know that he was a Post-Impressionist? The other glare for me was the Van Gogh vs. van Gogh usage. Although it is used both ways in many places, van Gogh is the proper way - from what I have read. I know my issues may seem small, but I have a little of an art history background and it just bugs a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"You may know 'who dun it' but why- and how it will turn out is the key","review":"A smart and intriging murder mystery by Archer! The book takes place at the time of 9/11 and surrounds the rare and expensive painting of Van Gogh's Self Portrait (the one after he cut off his own ear). It takes place in NY, Bucharest, and Japan and involves double dealings, hired asassins, and tailing people from continent to continent.As someone who has taken graduate art history courses I enjoyed this book but one does not have to be an art expert (and I am far from one) to enjoy this book. He makes several smart jokes and references which break the mold of typical muder mysteries. You may know 'who dun it' but why and how it will turn out is the key. I liked it and would recommend it to people who like suspense and murder mysteries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a disaster","review":"False ImpressionAs an avid reader of formulaic crime fiction, this effort by Archer was pretty poor. Wholly tedious, and with drab dialogue, I really struggled to get to the end of the novel. And to be honest I didn't care if the main character lived or died...surely a bad sign. And ok, if you are going to use 9/11 as a plot point, then you have to make use of it, not treat it as some secondary background character. I keep wondering why the FBI was so worried about an unscrupulous banker, when two plans had just flown into the two towers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same Archer","review":"I always look forward to a new Jeffrey Archer novel - he has a talent for weaving several disparate stories into a explosive ending.

Michael Keaton spends a lot of time watching static on a TV set and listening to static on a tape recorder. Occasionally the static tells him something and he gets all excited and runs out and does something. then he comes back and watches the static again.

The plot is so beyond dumb and the script really doesn't explain much about EVP, his wife helping him from the other side, or the evil spirits.

The director obviously knows the standard tricks of scare, which was the only thing to be pleased by. For example, they had a mirror/medicine cabinet opening scene and made you brace up for the chill and then nothing happened, so that was cool. But ain't nothing else to see here.

His acting is of such superior quality that as one watches him ply his trade, it's nearly magical. His specialty is that regardless of role, he proves believable and convincing. Such is the case with his new film, White Noise. In this role, he plays Jonathan Rivers, a happily married and successful architect, who after losing his wife is visited by those who study EVP or Electronic Voice Phenomena. Seeking some way to communicate with his deceased wife, he struggles to understand and accept the premises that the living can indeed communicate with the dead. The film, like the script is palatable enough, but hardly worthy of Keaton's superior talent. One actor in the film who does enter a surprising performance is Raymond Price who plays Ian McNeice. However, the film itself falls short of conviction and therefore regulated to mediocrity. **"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected so much more...","review":"As previous reviewers mentioned, the script has so many holes as to make this film somewhat incoherent.

I've walked out of theaters during the credits disappointed before. I've walked out content before. But never before had I been so apathetic to what had happened on the screen. White noise flirts with the concept of electronic signals picking up messages from \\"the other side,\\" which sounded as if it could be genuinely chilling. But no... It was a convoluted, self-involved Scooby Doo mystery that decided it wasn't going to stay on the same page as the viewer from the start.

About 90% of the movie is a decent story with the right amount of character development and the plot keeps moving at a fair pace.

Hell, I don't care if it's Michael Keaton or the blonde chick. Either way, nudity would have earned it another star.The film is hardly about EVP. It's about a guy whose dead wife is sending him messages through the static on his TV screen. Amazingly, you can see people's faces and bodies crystal clear within the static. One minute you're staring at snow and the next minute, you can see the clothes that a ghost from beyond is wearing. She shows him something bad that is ABOUT to happen to someone in the community and he tries to stop it before it happens. In this way, it's a lot like the Sixth Sense only not good. There is no back story in the beginning that allows you to get to know the characters and the ending is confusing and unsatisfying. Rent it in case you ever play a board game involving trivia about bad movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"white noise (1.5 stars)","review":"this movie starts out good but just ends weird. there is hardly any exciting parts in the movie and it\`s just boring all around.

It's that terrible zzzzzz noise from sleeping movie watchers who couldn't keep their eyes open. This is another attempt to bring \\"maturity\\" and \\"artistry\\" to the fantasy/horror genre but it fails miserably. It's impossible to feel any fright or tension from the tepid screenplay. Michael Keaton is shown in endless scenes as he tries to communicate with his dead wife. You watch him staring bug-eyed at the monitor filled with static. And then somehow, he's convinced he's made contact with his wife in the great beyond. Oh, yeah, he does have a son, but you wonder how the kid survives because he rarely sees his father. There appears to be a genuine psychic phenomena known as 'white noise'--where voices from dead people have been received via monitors. If so, then this movie needs to be remade with a much better script and a lot more genuine scares than this mess conjured up."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie","review":"i admit i did jump a few times in the movie, but maybe thats becasue nothing was happening the whole movie besides for the 2 scary parts. i didnt get 1/2 of this movie. at the end i was just thinking \\"so wat?\\" basically the best part was the people in back of me wehn...............................................................................................................................the girl jumps off a building 10 flights and survies with a bruise, he falls 1 flight and dies the whole movie theatre was hysterical laughing abotu how stupid the ending was."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll Creep You Out","review":"I thought it was pretty good.

I can live with the physical design flaws but not the underpowered motor. Yes it can 'walk' but that's also a result of the lack of power, the blade is grabbing the wood without the power to cut through. It's not the best 'ergonomic' design, but I could live with that if it would only cut.This is a bad design and in my shop will soon be replaced.

The Dewalt was user-friendly right from the box. If it weren't the boss's tool and the only one on the job I'd send the PC back. The only strong point is that the fence slot seems more durable than the cheezy holes in the thin plastic housing found in the Dewalt. Hold out for the door plane, is my advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased & Satisfied","review":"I purchased this power planer to trim 10 replacement doors in my home.

Included in the roster are talents like Mayito Rivera (in my opinion, the most dynamic salsa singer in Cuba), Feliciano Arango (the legendary bass player of Cuba's NG La Banda, and often called \\"father of Timba-Salsa bass playing\\"), and Los Van Van's top drummer, Samuel Formell (recognized as one of the best drummers of the island). While I do not know the names of the rest of the crew, I can assure the musicianship represents Cuba's best. The video quality is very good and the sound is clear for all instruments.

In order to fit these three episodes into 143 minute running time they cut the episodes to the bare minimum, yet for some reason left in five minutes of flash backs that made perfect sense for tv episodes that are shown weeks apart but much less sense when we had seen scenes less than half an hour before. What really made me mad is the fact that they didn't include the last episode in the mix, so all you have is a poorly edited movie without a true ending.

They had to be.","review":"I bought this album on the breathtaking brilliance of AIR's earlier releases, and boy was I disappointed. I am delighted to accept changes in a band's style, as long as they indicate growth rather than stagnation. \\"Playground Love\\" is a decent single, but most of the rest of the album is MUZAK with a capital BORING. \\"The word 'Hurricane'\\" is a sweet idea, but doesn't stand up to repeated listening. The last track has a few lines from the book thrown in, and the lines themselves are interesting and well-done. Unfortunately they are spoken in a flat monotone with an annoying electronic effect that effectively removes all emotional content. You want Hypnotic and Darkly Imaginative?

Where are these guys from? Where? France? Hmm? Huh? Not bad. Not bad, sir. I'll accept that. Heck, I'll even respect it, I guess. They have every right to make music. Just as long as they don't force it on me. I hope they force some more of 'this' music on me though, because I quite like it.

I guess I should have been more thorough in researching before I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sombre Pop from the French lounge kings","review":"Their first release \\"Premieres Symptomes\\" was breathtaking - a new twist on the muzak/lounge genre. Then came the more polished, more refined, more commercial \\"Moon Safari\\". It took the heart of AIR, and made it open to the world of MTV-culture. It was excellent, but almost regrettably popular.Now AIR have returned with this, and it certainly restores the balance. This is NOT a commercial CD, no matter what the hype. The teeny boppers who dance to \\"Kelly Watch the Stars\\", and the trance-heads who came down to \\"La Femmme D'Argent\\" will be sorely disappointed.What AIR have done here is produce a melancholy, almost tragic compilation of electronica, which has more heart and soul that anything they've done before. The emotions evoked are the only thing that isn't synthesised, so don't let the anti-hype get to you. Buy this album, and forget yourself, and look forward to the release of \\"The Virgin Suicides\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"a strange twist on air's usual tranquil and serene feel. the music is very dark and evokes almost gothic images and yet manages to meet the excellence of moon safari and premiers symptomes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good listening CD","review":"I bought this CD after thoroughly liking Moon Safari and Talkie Walkie.

It is sad that the french duo failed to produce something innovative and unique when the expectations for that to happen were high. I guess they ran out of ideas after Moon Safari, or the pressure of putting out an album of comparable quality got to them. The songs seem more like afterthoughts that never materialized, too close to muzak for my taste. Good thing I can always detox from the dullness of this generic and bland tribute to mediocrity by listening to Kid Loco, or just about anyone playing for free in Golden Gate Park any weekend. Air just disappeared on thin..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virgin Suicides","review":"If you want to know what this album sounds like just imagine Pink Floyd in the 70's getting together with Radiohead and recording a soundtrack. This album had a very melancholy feel. You can actually almost feel death creeping around you while you have the headphones on, especially on the last track. The music genuinely entranced me, it's a beautiful trip. I can't wait to see the film. If you want to get in touch with your demons just put on your headphones in a dark room and feel the sadness."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dunno...","review":"Had high hopes for this one, after the majesty of their previous releases. But their soundtrack leaves me shaking my head (and not up-and-down). Maybe you need to see the film, I don't know. (But then again, I've only seen a few of the Italian films that Morricone scored, and those scores are always sensational) The \\"songs\\" seem, for the most part, like undeveloped snippets of ideas. And Air doesn't give these snippets any time to develop - as soon as a groove is developed it's faded out. And I've always enjoyed the grooves that Air gave us. This album couldashouldwoulda been much better, much longer. A few tracks stand out, but the overall feeling is of ideas half thought-out, half-developed. Overall this is an album that is too conservative, and has too much of a been there/done that feel. No growth, no chances taken. But still I'll probably listen to it 40 times more. After all it's still Air."},{"rating":"2","title":"feeling so sad.","review":"I heard this whole album,and I like it a lot.It gives me some feeling like depress,sad,hopeless.

Whilst it is a succesful soundtrack, in that it creates a fitting atmosphere, the suicidal air is not one which I felt comfortable with at home. 'Playground Love' and 'Highschool Lover' are the two exceptions, but this album is a far cry from the superb 'Moon Safari' and quality 'Premiers Symptomes', both of which are musts. This is an album only for the fanatical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous, haunting","review":"Don't go in expecting Moon Safari 2.

If you are at all interested in the future of music you should look into the Virgin Suicides score. The comparisons to Pink Floyd and Badalamenti are pretty much right on, but there's a sprinkling of DJ Shadow and Dan the Automator in here too. All of these tracks are enjoyable if you have an open mind and an eclectic ear, but your standouts are \\"The Word 'Hurricane',\\" \\"Dirty Trip,\\" \\"Dead Bodies,\\" \\"Playground Love\\" (yes, that song from the Levi's commercial about the French dictionary) and its instrumental counterpart, \\"Highschool Lover.\\" If some of the tracks had been longer (especially the ...kicking \\"Hurricane\\") this album would deserve a perfect score. \\"Suicide Underground\\" is also a fine piece of music, but the vocal overdubs from the film tend to distract the ear from what's going on underneath.

For some reason,as I was reading I thought this book was a love story and so I expected the ending to be a happy one. But when I read the ending- both of them, I realized that this wasn't a love story at all. This was a story about a man breaking free from conventions and finding his own way. This book was about his evolution.The woman is just a catalyst. I read it and got to the \\"first ending\\" and being lulled into complacency by the promise of a happy ending, I thought it was a good one. Then I turned the page and read the \\"second ending\\" and I was disturbed.

The writing therein rendered it unable to be given as a gift. I tried to white out the writing, but only ruined the print which spilled down to the first page of the book and erased the print. I finally had to throw the book away and bought another copy at a local bookstore. I feel that it was a \\"bait and switch\\" sale and not happy with the seller. I won't buy from them again. This was not my usual experience. Generally sales agent is truthful about the product being sold, stating all defects of text and cover, all handwritten notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emperor has no clothes.","review":"This is one of those books that appeal to the pretentious. The author is self-conscious and clever and has obviously written it with literary critics and English teachers and the sort of pseudo-intellectual that hangs out in New York cafes in mind. The actual story was the last thing on his mind and it shows--the whole thing is a pastiche with what plot there is used to parade his annoying characters (Camus or Satre heroes in Victorian dress) and to make annoying observations (all the last word in philosophy circa 1960 but really dull in 2006). Nothing could be more contrived than the alternate endings that one must pick from. The reader does not want to pick an ending, to be truthful, because the author has not made the reader CARE. I think I will continue reading actual Victorian novels, by the likes of Dickens, Trollope and Eliot rather than ever bothering to re-read this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever written","review":"This book was horrible. Not only is the plot bad, but Fowles insists on interrupting it with little tidbits of knowledge that nobody cares about. For example, he spends a page on the derivation of the word blackmail, and a chapter on how to write a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful just awful","review":"I enjoy reading older books and when our library decided to get rid of some of it's older books I found this one among them and took it home. It is one of the most awful books I ever read. The author couldn't make up his mind on who his charactors were. There was practically no plot. The only person who kept me reading this book was Sam I found him amusing. Don't waste your time reading this book. It's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"irritating","review":"This is certainly a parody of victorian pomposity, and made me detest every character Fowles throws at you. The writing style is excessively pompous and hard to follow. There is not one character that you like, or feel for, or care about. If Fowles' aim was to create a cast of characters that bored you to death, he succeeded.He also must have wanted to make you hate him as well, the way he's so up himself in this book; one chapter is devoted entirely to how brilliant Fowles is at creating people out of words.The only reason I had for finishing this book was so I could appreciate the film in greater depth, which (somehow) brought a little character to these two-dimensional, cardboard cut-out representations of Victorian literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usual Fowles","review":"John Fowles has a real problem with writing endings to his novels. Witness this book and The Magus. TFLW is an overly lengthy novel that essentially has a misguided man chasing after a very mentally warped man-hating woman. For years no less! Since Fowles can't seem to end a plot he wrote TWO to end it. So, you can have your pick. What could have been a very nice novel indeed was turned into a pointless piece of drivel. Madame Bovary is fifty times more interesting and has a great ending. Sorry I cannot be more positive about this. And the movie is an abomination of the novel!

However, for a second try, he did pretty good.I'm reading the series out of order, so the start (which requires knowledge of \\"The Colour of Magic\\", which I haven't read) was a bit jarring. Easy enough to get over that, though.The story was okay, and had a fair amount of chuckles and laugh-out-loud moments (horse d'oveures, anyone?) Pratchett will do worse in the future of the series, but by and large will do much better, too.

So you have to read that book first, or you'll miss most of the fun here.Now, other than volume 1 which consisted of several stories building up on each other, this is one continuous novel. I'm sorry to say that it somehow seems as if Mr. Pratchett had taken too large a bite. The first half of the book is just as fun as volume 1. Then, however, it gets a little long-drawn and somewhat dull. The ending is, again, magnificent - quite worthy of Terry Pratchett.This is a definite must-read for Diskworld fans. If you enjoyed the first book as much as I did, you won't find any peace until you have read the follow-up as well.

It is about an inept wizard, Rincewind, who is forced to save Discworld, the world, with the one thing he has never been able to do: magic. One main element is its comical and often different description. Terry Pratchett constantly uses a twist o say something simple in a complex way. Anti-fairytale references and beliefs are a prominent element in this book. The most recurring element is ll the randomness. The problem with this is it slows you down in the first half of the book. The Light Fantastic is full of fantasy, comedy and plainly a few messed up ideas and is definitely and interesting adult read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trys too hard to be funny","review":"This novel is the first of the Discworld series I've read.To me the author appears too impressed with his knowledgeof ancient myth and legend to make and real good jokes.The closest he comes for me is when in the spirit world he meets the fetching girlwho is death's daughter. The most interesting character in the book is a prop:the luggage is a semi-intelligent suit case with legsthat eats people it doesn't like. The failed wizard whoignores the talking trees and isn't allowed to die becausehe has an important world saving spell in his head is the hero.Several of the running jokes like Cohen the Barbarian, the geriatric hero,are in pretty poor taste even.Another book I was so glad when I finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite humor","review":"I was recommended this book by a couple of co-workers who are really into the series and I was told it was incredibly funny. I don't consider myself a fan of fantasy but I have nothing against it either and I like some light reading now and then. This, however, was beyond light. I found it terribly unfunny. It is about about as far from the high-brow humor that one reviewer described as one can get. The humor is of the understated tongue-in-cheek variety but the kind you would expect to find in a hollywood action flick and every pun is so obvious and trite you'll spot it from half a page away. Unfortunately, without humor the utterly predictable story and the paperthin characters are mercilessly exposed. All in all I found it a terribly chore to read, I can't recommended it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely LOVED this book.","review":"Pratchett is brilliantly funny. I've only read these first two, but I plan on reading the whole series.

Sometimes there are deft jabs at our paradigms, other times the story meanders into mythic themes that change mid leap as it were in the book. Sometimes humorous and other times a bad prat fall, but that is the problem with the humor itself and this book universe mix itself.

Meanwhile, Ymper Trymon, a wizard from Unseen University, is trying to find them. A huge star is about to hit the Disc, and all of the Eight Gray Spells need to be said. Rincewind has one of the Spells lodged in his head. If you are new to Discworld, this book is good, but read COM first. It will help you understand LF better.

While I enjoyed the first novel, I wasn't too impressed with it. The Light Fantastic is a much better book and actually has a plot. When we last saw Rincewind and Twoflower, they had fallen off the edge of the Disc (and were being followed quickly by the luggage made of sapient pearwood). This is where The Light Fantastic picks up. Once again, we have the misadventures of Rincewind and Twoflower as they decide to return back to Ankh- Morpork (did I spell that correctly?). They meet up with Cohen the Barbarian (currently, my favorite character), an aging hero with a bad back and no teeth. And, oh yeah, the world is in danger from a comet (as far as they know) about to crash into the Disc and the only spell that can save the Disc is lodged in Rincewind's head.

The author takes a chronological amble through British (mostly English) history and the relevant issues driving the evolution of the coinage. The last chapter on the future of the pound vs the Euro stands up quite well today even though it was written in 2000. However, as the author constantly mentions the beauty or ugliness of numerous different coins throughout history the complete lack of illustrations is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful!","review":"Popular histories of everyday items such as the British monetary unit don't have to be this poorly done. The political and social history presented under the guise of a \\"biography\\" of the pound is riddled with errors. Apparently, the author was asleep during his history classes in school.This book's presentation of the economic and numismatic history of the pound is even more inaccurate. The author would have us believe that Britain has been a strictly insular phenomenon since the before the Romans and that trade & coinage influences only passed outward towards the continent.Popular histories of those small things we receive the past without much consideration can be both enjoyable reading and enlightening.

Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"good drive","review":"I picked this model over the premium edition because of the reviews about the software, which seem to be the only difference really (except for the capacity gauge lights on the premium edition, which is a nice feature). All I really wanted was software where I could pick certain folders and have it copy them to this external drive, letting me say what should happen if there are duplicate files. I downloaded SyncBack and will try it out shortly. As per the device, I haven't had any problems with it so far...it powers up right when I plug it into my computer and shuts down when I unplug it. Read, write, and delete speeds seem very reasonable to me. It took about 25 seconds to write 190MB worth of files (sorry, that's the only data point I captured).Overall, I'm happy with the purchase so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Became a brick after 6 months","review":"This drive is the reason I won't put money into WD drives again. It may have been an enclosure issue, but WD refused to send a new power supply for testing when my drive just wouldn't mount after 6 months. Otherwise it worked fine, and was easy to use. But at the time it was fairly expensive and yet the least expensive available at this capacity.

The online \\"help\\" was useless, and even the various tips and tricks from online reviews did not work.Even if I got the drive to work at this point, I'm still returning it.

This series is simply not up to the quality I expect from Western Digital.Both drives failed within a month of purchase and had to be replaced by Western Digital. Now one of the replacements is showing symptoms of failing as well. Replacing these drives might not have been so terrible if Western Digital's customer service had responded to inquiries in a timely manner (It took approximately 10 emails and a month of time before I could get them to reply) and had sent the correct power adapter with both of the replacement drives.Based on my previous experience, I might still consider Western Digital drives, but I definitely will not be purchasing from the MyBook line ever again.

We've checked WD's website for new drivers or patches. Nothing is available. Worse yet, Western Digital doesn't even reply when they were contacted.I know we won't buy any Western Digital product in the future. I suggest that you avoid buying this 500GB Ext. HD.

This is my third difficulty with a WD drive (two different models of their portable drives won't work on two of my labtop computers because the designers pushed the power requirements from the USB2 connections and they wouldn't spin up, which I find is a common problem). I'm avoiding WD drives in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's junk and WD support is a joke","review":"The power supply/USB interface module is junk. The drive failed and didn't say why. I took the actual drive out of the enclosure and it worked fine in a PC with a SATA controller and power supply, so you know it's the tinker-toy module in the external enclosure. I called WD to tell them about it and they told me I voided the warranty by opening the case. If it crashes and you want your data, take the disk out because it seems like the problems are caused by the interface, but they won't make it good. Even a junk company like WD can usually get a hard drive to work, but don't buy this toy. What WD doesn't realize is that some people actually value their data."},{"rating":"1","title":"remote access is very slow; access problems","review":"I purchased this drive so my family could share photos on a single drive that was accessible through the internet.

It took more than a week to receive help from WD and they were unable to solve the problem. They referred me to the software vendor - I was never able to reach them. For some reason, running Registry Mechanic fixed this problem.

Uses a program called Acronis to backup. It never worked, not even once. I bought it from the person who set up my computer right before he left on an extended trip to Korea so I couldn't return it. His advice to me was to transfer data manually (drag and drop) which seemed to work okay but was highly impractical and very slow.Then my computer stopped recognizing it so I can't even do that any more, much less retrieve what I put on there. Basically it was a total waste of time and money. It should not be that hard to make an external hard drive type product to store data in.

I figured if I got 2 of these I would have some redundancy in case one failed. Within 2 years or so, both of these drives did indeed fail. While I did not lose any super important files because I was paranoid and had all my financial records and pictures backed up in multiple places, I was stung both times when these things crashed, as you almost always have at least a few files that have not been backed up yet when the you-know-what hits the fan. Well, I expected more than 2 years of life from these things, so I am very disappointed. One started making strange noises that provided semi-ample notice that something was about to go wrong, while the other one was ostensibly working fine and was suddenly toast one day.

The Big Empty offers nothing worth bothering with. The storyline is completely lacking in cohesion or sense. There is nothing to explain the point of the blue suitcase, or why anyone would be willing to pay $27,000 to have it taken to California. Perhaps for that reason the acting was weak, the characters unbelievable, and the comedy suggested on the case the DVD came in was non-existent. The vague suggestion of something that at least one reviewer perceives as science fiction simply did not resonate with me. The best thing about the movie was the ending, and the worst thing about the ending was that it didn't come nearly soon enough. Sorry, but in my view, this one is a real bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Empty remains fairly empty","review":"I kept waiting for this to fulfill it's promising start and the potential of it's very good cast, but it didn't happen.

I will not site my own examples. But another film this is derivative of is 'Very Bad Things', a fantastic dark comedy. Jon Favreau is in that one as well doing a much better acting job. It helps he had better material to work with of course.

If you must try it (like if you are obsessed with Sean Bean or Adam Beach) try to get it at the library, as I did, and skip to the parts with your favorite actor.

The preview on my pay-per-view looked so intruiging I had to rent this silly flick. It turned out to be nothing but another failed attempt at a quirky character driven comedy that's plotted like snail's road trip and as pointless as it is...well,...empty. JON FAVERAU is usually watchable in anything, but here he and the rest of the cast is flat due to the bull's effort to make everyone as out-there kooky as possible. That's pretty much the gist of the flick- FAV is a bagman who goes west to run into all sorts of 'quirky' characters. The rest seems like ad-libbed filler, and not good filler either. I do not understand the motivation in any filmmaker to hire RACHEL LEIGH COOK, who is such a bad actress she makes a not so good movie like this a lot worse.

The pine boards were lightly sanded and unfinished, which was OK for me because I love staining wood. (I used pre-stain, then several coats of red mahogany, then polyurethane satin finish.) The parts went together reasonably well, but substituting drywall screws for wood screws is really cheapskate.Update: I've finished assembling the second unit. It had a few rather obvious splinters along some of the boards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice case for small home or workgroup server.","review":"Fairly well made.

The router base setup is less than ideal. A mounted bit should be at 90 degrees to the base but it's off by a degree or two. If you're trimming 1/4\\" to 3/8\\" off the side of a hardwood facing this is less than ideal. The bits pilot bearing runs hard against the lower material leaving a mark and the edge of the facing requires substantial sanding after your done. Checked out a few others in the store and they have the same problem. Called P&C and they claim it should be 90 degrees. The offset base heats up from the vinyl belt in the housing making the unit warm to hold for long runs.The unit itself feels well made but adjusting the depth is a bother with the base lock loose the base is free to canter a 1/16 - 1/8 so you're always adjusting and then tightening, adjusting then tightening trying to get it just right.Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Porter Cable Deluxe trimmer kit","review":"As usual the tool has a good feel to it. My granddaddy would say it is built hell for stout. My only complaint is I expected a little more in the way of examples of each part in use. The examples of how to set-up each attachment are clear, but how you use some attachments are left to the user to figure out. Also the bits that came with my trimmer are not the ones listed in the instructions. They are 1\\\\4 and 1\\\\8 inch bits but I am unsure if you need the bits listed in the instructions because a different grind on a bit makes a lot of difference where the cutting takes place. The two bases I did figure out (standard and offset) worked as expected out of the box. I am sure this is another tool I will use and pass on to my Son."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good trimmer","review":"I have a PC heavy duty router and it is great, so i ordered their laminate trimmer.

Its boring, painfully melodramatic, really, really corny and is so in love with its main character that the plot gets second billing.This author is cut out only to write trashy romance novels.

Her later books focus more on the human level and less on the high stakes and slapstick, though she always has both comedy and character-focus. Both are good reads.There are some amazing coinsidences which occur throughout this, but I eat it as part of the comedy.The novellas \\"The Mountains of Mourning\\", and the part of The Vor Game which was originally \\"Weatherman\\" are more serious and are good in a different way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I have enjoyed a few of Ralph Compton's trail series books.

This thing is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of fun!","review":"Our son loves this gym. We have used it to encourage head lifting, and to engage him with the different toys. He loves the elephant and the giraffe. The only negative is that the snap style buttons are hard to fasten, but I am sure they will loosen up with use. This gym also works well with lots of links so that you are able to incorporate any other toys you may already own. To those who have made complaints regarding the sound, it's a $50 toy not a Bose sound system. I feel that the musical selection is just fine, and the fact that the musical and light synchronization is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright, light, travels well and easy to clean","review":"My son really enjoyed playing with this toy (baby shower gift). The animals are enticing and colorful, the music and lights kept his attention early on and it is super easy to set up and put away. The mat is easy to wash and cleans up like a champ - packs flat for storage and travel (especially if you keep the plastic case it comes in - it even has a handy carry handle). I wish I had gotten it out sooner as he outgrew it far too fast (early sitter and walker - lost interest in laying in one place).

She absolutely loved it. Of course she was too young to really play with it when we first got it but she enjoyed looking around at all the bright colors and listening to the music. The legs of the animals dangle low so when she started trying to grab things, she could reach them easily.

She would honestly play with for at least a half of an hour, thats impressive for an infant. The other great thing about it is that the toys come off and hook to most car seats.

The Mozart music plays continuously for 10 minutes and the brightly colored and textured toys continue to keep him stimulated even now, at 11 months -- the hanging toys are removable, and make for great travel toys to keep your little one occupied. I found that as he grew through various stages, he discovered different parts of the mat such as the mirror, the fact that the dangling elephant vibrates when you pull it down, the lights in the flowers light up when the music is on, etc. I bought the kicking wind chimes as another hanging toy, and he had a ball with that as he started to move around more.

Don't think for a minute that this is too busy or that there is too much going on. He makes all sorts of happy grunting and gurgling sounds, so I know he is being entertained.

Well, this did the trick! She loves her gym and especially the hanging giraffe rattle (the feet are just perfect to shove in her mouth). This thing will keep her busy for about thirty minutes at a time and provides much needed time for mom to get some things done.

He can even grab them and hold on to them now. It usually keeps his interest for atleast 15 minutes. There are 2 reasons I didn't give it 5 stars. The childrens song setting is not continuous so you constantly have to restart it, however the classical music setting is continuous (but the song is a little annoying to me). The other thing that bothers me is even when you turn the switch to off if something (like our chihuahua) bumps it the music still plays (this has woke up my baby before)- not a big deal if you don't have a curious pet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gymini's are great for pre-crawlers","review":"For entertainment prior to crawling, the gymini is awesome.

The music it plays is soft and pleasing. Skye likes to look in the mirror and \\"talk\\" to herself. Actually, she \\"talks\\" to the toys too. I rotate them to keep her attention. Only recommendation would be to purchase the kick wind chime. She loves kicking and grabbing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gym Ever!","review":"This gym has it all-music, colors, attachments, things to play with on the mat!

The big mirror was not reflective at all with it's surface appearing like a permanently frosted mirror.2. Faulty sound/lights pad. The sound and lights did not function properly. One of the three flowers is not lighted at all and the music does not start sometimes.We are very disappointed with the defects since we have read fantastic reviews about it on Amazon and have been loyal fans of Tiny Love products.As my husband is already back in our home country, we are not able to do an exchange or return with Amazon.

I saw this gym, decided to buy it (and sell our other one). It is amazing the difference!I take off some of the toys, and our son plays on his belly or rolls around to pick up the toys I took off. He talks to himself in the mirror, loves watching the flowers when the music is on, and enjoys all of the little toys on and off of the gym. I love that it folds away easily.I would not buy any other gym. I didn't even think I wanted a gym - silly me! I would say this is the most indispensible toy we have. Our son is now 4 months old and will play by himself on the mat for up to 45 minutes. When I get down on the floor next to him, he loves to \\"talk\\" and fill me in on what he's been doing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My two girls have both loved this toy!","review":"I bought this toy with Christmas money for my oldest daughter when she was about 2 1/2 months old (she is now 3). We used it every day and even well into when she was stitting up and standing. She liked all the features, especially the monkey. When she was 21 months my second daughter was born and we pulled it out again... she renewed her interest in it and would play with her newborn sister by showing her the features of the toy. My second daughter also loved it too...when she was about 1 year old we put it away for future use with other children. This toy is very durable and has been spit up on and washed many times while remaining in excellent condition. My girls both loved the lights, mirror, crinkle sound in the toys and play mat and also the music. I can't say enough good things about this toy! It is now put away and awaiting usage from our future children...I'm sure they will love it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Mat!","review":"We received this for our second sons birth and he loves it! The mat is machine washable and has a lot of features. There is a mirror that is attached that helped encourage him to work on lifting his head. As he got older he liked the different textures on the mat (Zebra's mane, crinkly ear) and the toys. I didn't realize this at first but all of the toys do something different. The elephant vibrates, the giraffe rattles, the monkey stretches, the parrot spins around and they rings move round on the other toy. We even detached the toys and put them on the carseat if we had a lengthy ride or shopping to do. The music is okay, only has two settings so it seems a bit redundant after awhile and gets annoying but otherwise, this toy was a great gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect playtime","review":"My baby LOVES this toy. He loves to look up at the mirror and grab at the toys dangling down at him. He also loves to kick at the foot board and hear the music play. I chose to buy this mat beacause my baby is very big and I thought this mat looked much bigger than the other ones. with this mat he has plenty of room to scoot around on and he should not outgrow it for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Play Yard only 1 flaw.","review":"This is really a great play yard; the best I've seen. My son spends a great deal of his day in it...sometimes hitting the ducky and kicking the lion but other times with the arches down just kicking away. It is very versitle and protable and washable!!!!! The toys it comes with are a perfect variety and love that they are movable and removable. The mirror is good however the flaw is in the foot/hand pad. It may be that my son is not strong enough yet (he is 3 months 14lbs) but it takes a relly good hit from mommy to make it light up and the music is very low which is okay beacuse it is close to his ears and all but it is also very muffled and when in mozart mode it is just bad music I usually put on 'baby beethoven' in the background instead. But overall, compaibly, this is a great playard, and you do get your moneys worth with how much they are in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best play mat out there!","review":"We LOVE this mat! Well worth the $$$. We also have the Baby Einstein mat-cheap toys, small mirror and small mat. This mat is large with a great mirror (much bigger than the others) which my son loved even when he was smaller. He loved to lay back, look at and swat the toys-which can be adjusted and removed. Now that our son is rolling over he loves the crinkly elephant ears and the flowers. We often take toys with us on shopping trips. The mat washes easily and comes out just like new (wash on cold so the colors don't fade). I LOVE this mat and so does my son-he is now 5 1/2 mos and we have used it every day we have had it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!!!!!!","review":"I agree that this gym is a staple in a baby's repitoire of toys. It is interesting to watch my now four month old son's milestones appear under the gym's arches. When he first came home from the hospital, he would stare at the animals while exercising under the arches. Later, he started batting them. Today, the grabs and pull those critters and he is just starting to roll under the dome. The side mirror also has played an important role in his tummy time! This gym has given me much needed breaks, upwards to 45 minutes, while stimulating my son! Best yet, stores easily against a wall once it is snapped together, so it is easy to hide behind a sofa or other piece of furniture when needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"loads of fun!","review":"My little 4 month old grandaughter absolutely loves this! It entertains and stimulates her for long periods of time. A must for new parents..you won't regret this purchase for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great play gym","review":"I bought this playgym because it got great reviews and seemed really nice...It came really fast and no assembly hardly at all. I love that you can move the toys around or add more of your own. I also love that it plays music. My son didnt care too much for it at first but once he was able to start grabbing the toys he LOVED it...now he grabs the toys and rolls all around on the mat. I also take it outside in the grass and let him play on it. He loves it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Child Loves This","review":"I really love this play gym! The colors are wonderful, the mat is good quality, and my daughter loves it! The first time I put her under it, she was only 7 weeks old. She started talking to it and making noises she had never made before. She loves it! She is easily able to make the music play. I wish the lights on it were easier for her to see without having to do tummy time, but those are not her favorite aspect of the play gym anyhow. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it!","review":"I labored over which activity gym to purchase for my 9 week old son. I finally landed on this one as it had what seemed like the majority of the components most important to me. I received this today and my son LOVES it. He immediately started to swing his arms and kick his legs when placed underneath the toys hanging above. I love all the features that Tiny Love incorporated into this. I also LOVE how easy it was to setup and put away. I really wanted a gym that was easy to put away when not needed and this one fits the bill. As far as setup I pulled it out of the packaging, unsnapped two snaps and the gym literally sprung into place! After a long day with a 9 week old this is exactly what I needed, something that put itself together and was easy to clean up! I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Tiny Love activity gym!","review":"I purchased this item when my baby was only a few weeks old. He was fascinated by the giraffe and monkey, as well as the mirror. He is only 11 weeks old at this point, but his attention span has grown considerably compared to other babies (his age and a few weeks older) who have not been exposed regularly to a \\"gym\\". I don't know if it is the gym itself, the fact that babies develop at different speeds, or a combination thereof...but I love this product! It is easy to clean, you can move the danglies easily, and the mirror slides easily on the arches to vary it up a bit. I don't use the musical piece often...music is tinny and it used up our rechargeable battery quickly! I just wish it came with a tummy time pillow (hence only 4 stars)...I ended up buying another mat at Ross with the tummy time pillow, and I use it with the Tiny Love. Great product...all babies should experience this toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"Love this play mat. Would have given 5 stars, but the material is a bit slippery, so my little one has a tendency to slip a bit. However, he still manages to scoot around at only 7 weeks. Love the hanging items to play with... the giraffe has made its way onto his infant seat and he just stares in love. I really like the snap at the top that you can just undo and then make a quick diaper change. Also, I have had to work with him on some head/neck exercises and the snap has allowed me to quickly pull the hanging parts down when I can catch him in just the right mood to allow me to work with him for a few minutes. Also have thrown in the back of the SUV to take on trips to other houses. Light and easy. We had another brand of play mat, which was great for my daughter, but I'm very happy with the musical/light part of this item and would have liked something like this for her. Would recommend to a friend/give as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movement to Mozart","review":"I purchased this product for my twin grandsons. They love it! They enjoy kicking against and hitting the animals, are mystified when they make the horn honk, and are attentive to the music, especially the Mozart. They enjoy \\"face time\\" in the mirror. A great product recommended to me by another daughter, who also has it and whose little son also loves it. Also important is that it's easy to \\"assemble\\" and a breeze to take down and store!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what a fun gym!","review":"our munchkin, and our friends munchkins, all seem to have a blast in this gym. i love that it comes with a mirror (i just wish it could be removed to be played with and/or attached to crib), great sounding classical and nursery music (activated by switch or baby), lights (baby loves to stare at) and cute animals that we occassionally attach to the stroller and take along with us. so versitle, what a fun gym!"},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't come with all the listed attachments","review":"came with only the mirror and 2 hanging toys (giraffe and monkey) - that's itdefinitely disappointing and didn't match the description or images of the product"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the more tolerable baby toys","review":"We got this as a hand-me-down when our baby was born and didn't think to set it up until he was 3 weeks old. After trying to entertain him with rattles and other toys he had no interest in, we were surprised by how much he loves this one. The dangling animals all have different textures and attributes, so he likes to watch them dangle while he kicks the vibrating elephant and triggers the music pad. The music is easy to listen to-- not the screeching high-pitched stuff you get on a lot of toys, varied enough not to be too irritating, and low-volume. There are still elements of this mat our 8 week old has yet to discover, so it should last a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for tummy time and back play!","review":"We bought this gym for my son and it worked out very well. When he was very young he just looked at all the animals in awe, then began to bat them with his hands and kick them with his feet. The mirror is wonderful for encouraging tummy time. All in all I would definitely recommend this gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for entertainment!","review":"My twin daughters love this gym. They can either be on their backs and bat at the hanging animals or they can lay on their bellies and watch the lights blink in the flowers. The music is great and they both love it. I also like the fact that you can detach the hanging animals and move them around. I recommend this gym for all parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best baby toy yet","review":"My baby girl loves her play pad. Lots of play rings to pull on, mirror to get her to look up and strengthen her neck. Went from not rolling over much to rolling over constantly. Pad lights up with tunes and sounds. Easily collapses into a suit case. Worth every penny. If it matters, I'm a first time dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the baby","review":"My son has enjoyed this mat for the past couple of months. He enjoys kicking/grabbing & pulling the toys in the play mat. He is now ~5 months old and this is a little too small for him. It would have been nice if this were a little bit bigger & he could have used this longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Activity Gym","review":"This play gym is great. I got it for my daughter when she was 2 months old and I think she could have been enjoying it even sooner than that. She is now 4 months old and she still loves it. I move the toys around and put new toys on the arches from time to time so she doesn't get bored with the same thing. She loves the mirror and the parrot. We don't listen to the music too often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loves it..","review":"My 2 month old loves it..she can spend hours on this entertaining herself. The lights and music have become kind of old though - wish there were more options for the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun for our little one!","review":"My daughter loves this gym. She got interested in it when she was about 6 weeks old. She likes the monkey the best because his hand hangs down and she can put it in her mouth. (Luckily everything is washable!) She enjoys looking in the mirror and she has learned to roll over so that she can get to everything. It has a crinkly elephant ear, a giraffe tail to hold, and a squeaker hidden inside (which drives our doggie nuts!). The only thing that I am disappointed in is the music. It is very yucky to listen to. It is tinny and out of tune sometimes. It makes me sad to hear how bad it is, so we never turn it on. Our daughter has plenty of fun without it, though! I recommend this product to any parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best chance for a happy baby","review":"We always give this as a shower gift. With 6 children, we are beginning to know what works and what doesn't. The vibrant colors and lots of loops to hang baby's favorite toys from, this is a hit. This is great for when you absolutely must put the little one down for a few minutes! The mat washes well on cold in the machine and air dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby girl loves this","review":"It's easy to carry, easy to clean, and my daughter loves it. Each of the toys come off and are fun individually as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands the test of time","review":"We received ours as a gift in 2006 and it has been enjoyed by all three of our children through our current baby now 5 months old. It is not complicated, but the kids love it and it is a great place for them to play when my hands are full. I'm impressed that it has held up so well and been enjoyed so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I hadn't...","review":"I was totally set on purchasing this product before my son was born. It is so adorable and I could just picture him laying there and playing with the different things on the mat. Well, was I in for a surprise. My son could not have cared less about this thing. He much rather preferred laying on a blanket with a boppy pillow and placing some interesting toys in front of him. Oh well, live and learn - but a pricey one at that!I can say the only thing my son enjoyed (and still enjoys) about this thing is the little giraffe rattle that comes with it. He loves that thing. But jeez - what an expensive rattle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Investment","review":"I think this is a wonderful developmental activity mat. My daughter (3 months) old, absolutely loves it. She is not at the point yet where she is playing with everything on the mat, but that's the good part about it. She tries to reach for the animals that hang above her, (she loves the parrot). And each of the toys that hang have something special about them, like when your baby grabs the parrots feathers/tail, it sounds like you are crinkling up foil or something - it's really neat. It keeps her busy/attention for at least 30 minutes. I think as she gets a little bit older, it will keep her attention longer. And she will still be able to have more fun with the mat, because of all the colors, music, mirrors, and different textures for her to feel on the mat. It's definitely worth investing in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"feature-rich, but a little flimsy music box.","review":"I got it for my 2 mo old son, since i thought he was starting to get bored with the musical mobile on top of his crib. I guess he is still too young, but he didn't reach out to grab the hanging toys. He did, however, enjoy the classical music that plays for 10 long minutes. Now at 3 mo, he likes the mirror hanging at the corner of the gym, but still doesn't care much for the hanging stuff.About the only gripe i have is the flimsiness of the music box. After accidentally stepping on it, the music began to sound \\"funny\\" and \\"synthetic\\". After changing the batteries, however, the problem went away. By the way, the batteries don't last very long. I play only about 2 times (20 minutes) a day, and 3 AA batteries only lasted 1.5 week. also, when the batteries go low, the music again start to sound funny and slow.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a play mat she likes","review":"I received the Mommy & Me activity mat for my baby shower. My daughter never took to it though so we just set it aside (the toys are not interesting enough & too high in my opinion). She's four months now & I really needed something for her to entertain herself. After reading reviews of this one, I finally bought it. Let me just say it's worth every penny! I also purchased the wind chimes & attached them to the mat...she loves all the toys. It's easy for her to reach them, the mat makes lots of noises & sounds, and she loves to smile at herself in the mirror. It folds up very nicely too. I highly recommend this activity mat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Hannah Loves this....","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was only about a month old. She loved it from the start. She would lay there and look at the hanging toys and in the mirror as the music played. The music is great...not very loud and not annoying. She is now 3 months old and reaches for the toys and talks to herself in the mirror. I have not washed it yet...but the music and lights piece slides out without difficulty. This will keep her entertained for about 15 to 30 minutes. I think that this is the perfect infant toy. It also folds up for easy storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item smells of petrol","review":"The gym is really cute but the whole item (particularly the mat) smells of petrol. May be from the packaging, but then they should use different packaging. Items must be SAFE for babies! Description said that there are sample batteries in it, but there are not and the battery case is extremely hard to open--near impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crapped Out","review":"All of a sudden, after three months of fairly steady use, the music and lights just stopped working. We replaced the batteries twice, but soon realized that was not the problem. It's a shame because I would've gotten a cheaper mat which may have lasted longer, had it not been for the great reviews on this crapper. Our daughter is now 4.5 months old and is about to the point that she cares whether there are lights and music..."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY entertaining - even at 8 weeks!","review":"We bought this for our daughter when she was 8 weeks old. We picked this play mat over the others because of it's bright colors, but soon discovered other benefits. It's great that the animals are removeable. We attach her favorites to the bar over the carseat when travelling, We've added a few extra animals and the windchimes - which she loves!I though 8 weeks was kind of early, and at first she would just stare at herself in the mirror, but soon she began smiling and cooing at the colorful bars and bright animals. Now at 3 months, she bats at the hanging animals and kicks the wind chimes (sold separatley).It's been worth every penny since the moment we brought it home. The bright colors and fun sounds keep her enterainted for 20-30 minutes at a time. And, the soft pad is easy to wash. A GREAT PLAY MAT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music/Lights Didn't Last Long, But Still Nice","review":"I am currently using this for a second baby. It still looks great and has held up very nicely through a few washes. It is easy to fold up and tuck away. It's colorful and feels nice. However, the music/lights didn't last long, broke during use with first baby...so I just took the music panel out and have used it without that feature. Still a nice play gym, but taking off a star for the lights/music which could have been of better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I bought this for my 3 month old and he absolutely loves it. I did move the mirror to the top of where the bars cross, and he loves to look and laugh at himself. Super durable, as my dog likes to lie next to the baby, and easy to clean. Highly recommend this product, lots for baby to play with and look at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Great play mat!","review":"This is a great play mat!! I was on the search for a play mat that my daughter could actually reach and interact with the toys...after we were given one that she really couldn't even see the toys - let alone play with them. This mat is perfect. Lots of textures, colors, and things to play with on the hanging animals OR the floor mat. She is very entertained by it and it helps to keep her on a her tummy a bit longer :)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a range of ages","review":"This toy is good for a range of developmental ages which makes it a good thing to have around from birth up. My son has gone from looking to batting to grabbing to pulling to sitting up and playing on it. Unlike a lot of his toys, he didn't have to grow into it and he hasn't grown out of it yet. My only complaint is that the music in ours is rather off key even with new batteries, but a friend's mat sounds better, so test them before you buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Activity Mat","review":"This was the first toy that our daughter really got into.

One of the songs is B-I-N-G-O and they used the harmony instead of the melody... really? that had to happen?

The toys are great and they allow you to put your own toys up as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World's Best Baby Gym","review":"I received the super deluxe gymni as a gift and also received two other brands. I looked them all over and decided this was the most entertaining and well made of the three. My daughter is only two months and she's already delighted with it. She loves to look at the animals dangling and swat at them with her hands. She is mesmerized by the mirror. We haven't even gotten to the music and lights and I already feel it is well worth {the money}. It's sturdy and washable and I love the bright colors and jungle theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE this activity mat!!!!!","review":"I have 3 month old twins and they love playing on the mat. They both love to play with the hanging toys. My son love looking at the lights so the lights are encouraging him to try and roll over. My daughter can look at herself in the mirror for an extended period of time. And anything thing that can keep a 3 month olds attention is great. The mat is also great for their tummy time. One of the biggest advantages for us is both of the babies can play on the mat at once. This is a great buy I would recommend this mat to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite Perfect","review":"Our daughter loves the colors and motion of the objects in this play mat. At two months, she appears to try to bat at things (consistent repetitive actions towards the hanging toys).It is nearly perfect. If you're a music lover or a musician, you'll hate this product. The music is lousy and out of tune. We don't bother with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music and Lights ruined this product!!","review":"This is a FANTASTIC product WITHOUT the lights and sounds. We have a gymini deluxe with no lights, no sounds, and it is perfect for our 4 month old daughter. She loves it. Why add \\"video game\\" like qualitites to an excellent toy? Tiny Love has great toys, I am very disappointed to see them heading in the direction of Fisher Price, everything with lights, sounds, and Mozart. How are kids ever going to learn do to anything without lights and sounds if all of their toys from infancy up are mega stimulating?By the way, we will often play Classical Music for our daughter from the radio, which she does enjoy. This is much better for a child's developing mind than the same tinny, repetitive digitized Mozart sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"This toy is just wonderful, from the moment they are just newborns and on. My daughter is 5 mo's and is now enjoying the fact that she can reach the toys, but before she would lay there and just talk to the toys. the mirror is wonderful since she loves to look in mirrors *typical girl* :-) I go to school on line and can't always have her in the swing where I can't see her or her walker, so I lay the mat on the floor in the computer room and she just plays for at least and hour or so. Nevery gets bored.Erica"},{"rating":"1","title":"My baby hated this","review":"I am shocked to see that this play mat has such high reviews. I tried and tried with this thing and my son absolutely hated it. In fact, he rolled over for the very first time while being on it, because he was screaming in agony. The toys were cute, but he didn't really get into playing with them until he was older and I sent the mat itself to goodwill. We lived in a small space at the time and I didn't have enough space to leave it out all the time. It folded up fairly easily, but not that easy. Another negative aspect is that it is spot clean only, which is kind of gross for spit up. Overall, there are other toys out there that have a longer lifetime of use. However, sounds like a lot of babies do like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby did not like it","review":"The baby did not like this toy. The stuffed elephant and giraffe are the only things she liked about this toy. We used it for about 30 minutes and once the baby starts to move well the mat isn't big enough. I think this is better for children under 3 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt work!","review":"The main reason I purchased it was for the lights & music & neither of them work! Yes it said it was used & in great condition. But its not! The reasons I wanted it don't work! Its just a matt w/toys that hang. If I was told that they didn't work I would not have purchased it.

Be up front & honest so we as the buyer have all the information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends On What kind of a baby is getting the toy...","review":"My little brother was always bored, so we went to the store and we bought him this. He didn't even touch it! He was probally 10 monthes at the time. He is more of an adventure baby. It might be because he lives with a very big family and is not delighted by little joys of life. He just wasn't interested! (It depends on the baby..)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a blessing!","review":"This has been one of the best things we bought for my son. I thought it was expensive at first, but now that our son has loved it since he was 9 weeks old, I believe it was worth every penny.

It's been a great blessing to have for many months."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"I just love this play mat! My 4 month old son started using it at 2 months... at first, he was a little scared - but with a little help - he started to enjoy it.

It is great how you can change the links and animals and also pack it up on the go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this mat, based on the fact that I was looking for something to encourage my 5 month old son in his tummy time. I thought the musical buttons on the mat would be great cause and effect fun, but they are hard to press. Sometimes he can make them work if he hits them with his heel, but then he has to be on his back which is not the point for tummy time! If you are looking for a gym for your baby when s/he is on their back, then this is a fine one to get. It folds up and snaps for easy storage. Unfortunately, ours is stored more than it is used!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Entertainer for Baby","review":"I bought this 2 weeks ago for my daughter who is now 3 months old. At first, she didnt seem interested in the toys and would cry after 10 minutes. Now, she loves to bat and grab on to the toys above her. I added the baby wind chimes (her favorite toy) which she can swing or kick at and they make noise, and I added a mirror above her so she can see herself while on her back. She likes to look in the mirror while on her tummy also.She doesnt seem to care about the music, but the lights are cute. This toy buys me about an hour a day of entertainment, which is necessary b/c I work from home! Defintitely recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"This was a replacement for the same product where the blinking lights on the flowers quit working very shortly after it was received. Unfortunately the same thing happened with the replacement item almost immediately. Altough Amazon waas good about replacing the first item, I don't think it is worth my time to ask for a second replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of entertainment!","review":"I've been putting my son on this mat since he was a month old and the colours and sounds endlessly entertain him. He plays and gives his parents time to get things done around the house for half an hour at a time, and the mirror encourages him to push his head up during tummy time. It's easily washed, which is handy because I almost always have spit up on it. The music isn't too loud or too quiet, though there is no volume control, and the batteries don't last very long, but then again, my son insists on having the music on all the time when playing on it.Definitely recommended to any parent desperate for a little time to get things done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"Easy to clean. Folds up nicely. Hannah loved the mirror early on and discovered the toys later. Great item to put on your baby registry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have!","review":"Our daughter loved this play mat. Starting at around a month old, she paid attention to the giraffe and the monkey. As she got older her interest in the other features grew, and she really loved the kick-chimes you can buy as an accessory. The chimes are well worth the extra money -- babies LOVE to kick them (or grab and shake them) and they actually have a very nice, mellow sound. We also grew a bit tired of the music eventually, so we often went without it. The music controller is removable if you don't want to bother with it. Our daughter lost interest in this at around 6 months, when she could sit without assistance, and we put it away by the time she could pull to standing. We plan to roll it back out for the next kiddo, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, love it, love it!! A must!!","review":"This \\"gym\\" is incredible. I think that it's one of the best purchases we've made for our daughter. From the first time she laid in it, at 6 weeks old, she became so much more aware... You could literally see her developing physically & mentally. She started to reach for the toys, and turn toward the mirror immediately. It's kept her captivated for hours! She's five months old now and still loves it. It's easy to take everywhere, and I love that the toys can be unclipped & moved around or switched with other toys. I can't say enough about this gym. I recommend it to every mom I talk to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In your face!","review":"I received this item for my newborn daughter. At first I loved the idea of having hanging toys, mirror, music and lights all in one piece... however, the hanging animals hang so low that they almost hit her in the face and there is no way to shorten them. She is only 3 months old and seems to like the set, but what about when she is a little older (bigger)? I do love the big mirror though, she can see herself from almost anywhere on the blanket. There is a choice of Mozart or Nursery Rhymes Music but they only play for 1-2 minutes at a time and you need to keep resetting the music. Thankfully it is not too loud, just the right volume for babies and toddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, but room for improvement","review":"Pros: My 2-month old son loves this product... he is able to lay there and 'bat' at the toys dangling above. I can also move the hanging toys around, and even hang other toys that didn't come with the set.Cons: I only wish the set would fold up better. Yes, it folds in half.. but I wish it had the ability to fold another time, to make it only a quarter of its size. As a new parent, my living room is already cluttered with a swing, bouncer, etc., so I would appreciate this product 'one star' more if it folded up smaller. It would also be nice if some of the toys would light up when the baby makes contact with it, because the rattle inside the monkey is barely audible, and the 'crinkling' sound of the parrot wings and elephant ears are pointless when the baby has not mastered the skill of voluntary grasping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great colors! Music doesn't work right!","review":"My daughter loves the animals; they're really great! Each one has a different rattle/sound. The flowers are the only thing that light up on this model. I was curious where the lights were bc I never saw anything that said. The only thing wrong is the 2 music settings (which are supposed to play 2 different sets of songs) play only 1 song; and the same song on each setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so popular for my 3 month boy","review":"I have to admit that i purchased the mat after i read the great reviews, and I bought it with my $50 gift card. Basically I only spent $5 for the mat, so that I don't suffer too much economically. But I rather I haven't bought it simply because my son doesn't like it so much. It takes some space and I am in a dilemna to give away. But it is not a cheap toy. My three months old can spend 5 minutes on the mate before he cries. the mirror caught his attention sometimes. Afterwards i have to fold it and unfold it when use - not worth the energy.But I also heard good comments from my friends who have a baby daughter. So it really depend on individual kids. What i recommend is to let your baby try on it before you made the buying decision, or buy from where you could return the item easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"I had received this at my baby shower. She is now almost 4 months, the only thing she really likes is the blinking lights, but only for a few minutes. The mirror is a joke, she has alot more fun when I'm holding her looking in the bathroom mirror. Every baby is different on what they like to look at and play with. Now I think it's really cool, if I were her age, I'd love it, but oh well:o("},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains fiberglass, causes rash","review":"When my baby is on his back, he enjoys swatting at the toys... but when we do tummy time and his face comes in contact with the fabric, it causes a rash.

Regardless, I would highly recommend looking for a similar product that doesn't contact fiberglass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tummy Time Treasure","review":"When I bought this after daughter was born (3 wks) I thought it was a complete waste of $60, but I must say that this is no longer the case. My daughter LOVES this, and we were able to start her on tummy time at 4 wks. She hated doing it on a blanket but has a great time looking in the mirror and playing with the flaps on the padding. She is now 7 mos and we still use the gym for her tummy time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver","review":"I bought this when my daughter was a month old or so and she loved it from the beginning. With an older child, there were times when I needed to put her down and she loved this mat. For a while she just watched the toys and lights but soon batted at them and pulled them down. It was spit up and pooped on and washes great in the machine. It also folds up and goes back in the package easily and we took it with us on vacation. I could get dressed, get dinner ready or get down and play with her while she was on this mat. She is almost a year now and doesn't use it any longer, but it was worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the hanging toys, poor music part","review":"We bought this about 3 weeks ago and our baby loved it. He's almost 3 months old. He loves music, but the music part stopped working 2 weeks after be got it. We tried replacing the batteries twice with no success. We're now trying to get a replacement part for it. The hanging toys are still fun for him, but we would have liked the music to have worked more than a couple of weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great playmat, except \\"music\\" part","review":"This was one of the most useful first year items. Our daughter spent a lot of time on this mat, and liked different things over time. One thing that I liked about it was ability to hook different toys to the overhead arches, so it was pretty versatile. What didn't work is the whole lights and music thing. Anna could never find the right place to press to trigger lights and music by itself, so music never became a baby-led activity for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money!","review":"Let me tell you the Tiny Love Company is the best we had some major problems with the symphony in motion mobile and they replaced it for free so when I saw this gym and its cost which was clost to that of the other play mats I thought WHY not cause they will be a help if anything goes wrong. I was very happy with it. My daughter loves the crinkly elephant ears and the mirror and also likes to watch the things dangle and she will flip over and play with the mat its self or the light flowers. She is 6 months so hopefully she will stay amused with it;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GYM- MAYBE REMOVE ELEPHANT","review":"I BOUGHT THIS GYM FOR MY DAUGHTER AND AM HAPPY WITH IT.

A GREAT PRODUCT UNDER CLOSE SUPERVISION."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"My daughter is just about three months old and has really enjoyed playing on this mat so far. However, I am unhappy with the quality and plan on exchanging it for a different brand. The sound and lights feature stopped functioning a few weeks ago, after minimal use. I had planned on contacting Tiny Love to get a replacement insert, but in the meantime one of the arches snapped in two as I was folding the mat to put it away. It resulted in two very sharp pieces and seems like a safety hazard if it can break that easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monkey Tail is a Hazard","review":"Bought this item when my son was 2 months and we actually really love it. It's held up well in the wash, and we especially enjoy that the toys are so interchangeable. I don't have much to add beyond what the other reviews say other than to note that we found that the monkey toy's tail is a hazard. My son is 4 months now and can grab onto things. He would frequently grab the tail and tonight when he was sleeping I noticed it looked like he was holding onto the toy - only to realize the tail was wrapped around the base of his finger and was stuck! I quickly unwrapped it and it just left a red mark and made my son's finger puffy, but if it had been left on there for longer it could definitely have caused injury. So I suggest cutting the monkey tail off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable, a life-saver!","review":"My 7 month old has used this every day for almost 4 months, and he still finds it entertaining!Positives: Whether my baby is lying on his back or on his tummy, or sitting up beside the toys, there is something for him to do! I have especially loved how you can add other toys to the gym. I've attached Lamaze toys to it without any problem. It's also easy to move from room to room.Negatives: The music always sounds like the battery is about to die, and when the music is on the Nursery Rhymes setting, you don't have the choice to let the rhymes cycle for several minutes. The rattles in the hanging toys sound very weak. The legs on the monkey weren't very springy at all. The parrot doesn't sit upright on his perch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps Her Attention and Makes Her Giggle","review":"My little 4-month-old girl received this as an early Christmas gift and we knew from the moment we put her down on it that she loved it. She grabbed the little parrot, swatted at the monkey, crinkled whatever she could get her hands on and stared into the mirror.We love watching her play on the mat and she can spend a full hour playing around, amusing herself the entire time! She even enjoys tummy time on this. She hates tummy time on anything else. Anything that makes tummy bearable is an amazing treat for all involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and entertaining!","review":"Our son is now 4 and a half months, and he still likes this playmat. He likes to kick the pad and hear the music play, and there are lots of toys to bat around. The only small issue I have is that he really has to kick hard to start the music. When he was less than 2 months, he didn't kick hard enough to make the music play very much. It would also be nice to have two choices for volume. The sound is quite loud. Other than that, this is a great choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arch was defective","review":"I bought this and the arches were defective. The do not stand upright and lean almost to the floor. Unfortunately I did not save my receipt. Have since purchased the Baby Eienstein playmat."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I paid 60 bucks for this","review":"My kid was overwhelmed at first by all the hanging toys and fussed the first few times we put her under them. I stuck my head in there with her, and it does feel a bit claustrophobic because all the animals are all up in your business. I removed some of the lower-hanging creatures, and she seems to like it better.The strangest thing--the nursery rhyme music really creeps me out. It's off-key or flat or something, and it's grating and spooky, just like the Janet Leigh stabbing music from Psycho.The Mozart is a little better, yet the \\"10 contiuous minutes\\" of music is a just a loop of a 30-second snatch from Sonata for Piano in F. Anything repeated twenty times is irritating, even Mozart.You might think I'm just cracking wise, but I swear to you my daughter's favorite part of this toy is the on/off switch for the lights and music. That keeps her busy for minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I thought this prduct would be decent quality since I spent a fortune on it and extra Gymini toys to go with it. It faded terribly the first time I washed it. It also shrank ALOT and was hard to get back together. Also, the toys aren't that interesting to babies. I run my own inhome childcare, and all three babies weren't thrilled.The music is LOUD and terrible. It would turn on by itself even when it was turned off. I ended up taking the music and lights part out and throwing it away.Don't waste your money on a piece of junk. Invest in the new Fisher Price Linkadoos playmat. It is wonderful and the extra toys are reasonably priced and the kids LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars in terms of quality and activity, 1 star in terms of use.","review":"We went all out and bought the total playground and a lamaze mirror which I strapped to the arches, lots of extra toys and it's just been a bust! You just do not know if your baby will enjoy lying on the floor and looking up at things, our prefers to be sitting or upright. This toy has proved useless for us and I would highly recommend to people to wait until after birth to see what their little one likes before splashing out, either that or buy second hand where at least you can get your money back! In terms of quality this is one of the better mats I've seen, and if you can get your use out of it, great, by all means it will prove an excellent purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK WITH LINK-A-DOs AND OTHER RINGS","review":"Caveat emptor - this does not work with the standard size of baby toy rings - only the special ones that come with it.

They responded to my problem (lights and sound unit do not work at all) 8 months after my request for help, telling me that they would be happy to replace the part, as long as my purchase date wasn't over 6 months ago. That would have been great news two months ago, but is a waste now. The portable design is a good idea, and the graphics are good, but the lights and sounds are about 50% of why we wanted this, so it's basically just a fancy place mat without them. Waste of money, waste of time trying to contact this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh... wish I had bought a different one","review":"Although this playmat looks great on the internet, in actuality it leaves a lot to be desired. Yes, it has colorful toys that can easily be moved to various locations and the mat is nice to look at if they're on their tummy. However, the criss-cross bars over their head are at such a low angle that all of the toys pretty much hang directly over them and touch their face. My son, by a couple months old, had to keep his face to the side because he didn't like the toys touching him. When I saw other brands and saw how much higher their bars were - and therefore how much higher their toys hung - I realized the downside to this one. Wish I had seen some in person before registering for this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our bed was better","review":"I really hated this mat. I really tried to love it because we have so many other Tiny Love toys that my daughter loves (the princess mobile, and stroller attachment...). However, we she hated it and thus, hated tummy time. The music is REALLY annoying and I love kids stuff. It has this annoying monkey laughing that made me cringe and my daughter cry. The mirror is too heavy and doesn't sit well anywhere. The mat is ultra thin (though all are but this one just seems even thinner). The toys just hang and are uninteresting. I ended up just going on our bed with some toys to do tummy time. We just bought another mat and my daughter loves it. She looks at herself in the mirror--that actually is light and stays up and goes on her tummy and her back like she should! Honestly, I don't know why this one got good reviews and I'm an amazon-a-holic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Based on all the positive reviews, we bought that gym thinking that baby Tilly would love to spend some time on it while practicing some skills.

It is an expensive gadget which requires a lot of floor space. The bouncer and the saucer were better purchases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It! And so does our baby daughter!","review":"I bought this for our daughter when she was only about 6 weeks old and started laying her on her back underneath the hanging animals. She LOVES it! She is now almost 3 mos. old and is able to kick at the animals and bat at them with her hands. I have many pictures of her laying on her playmat with big smiles on her face! The music and the lights are nice. She particularly likes to look at herself in the mirror. What makes this mat very nice is that you can buy additional hanging toys for it and change things around so baby doesn't get bored. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"baby's favorite place to play - entertains for hours","review":"Length:: 1:29 MinsThis toy really entertains baby for hours and there are so many ways to play on it.

He started to enjoy it at around eight weeks. Now, he can play there for about an hour as I sit in the room with him folding laundry or cleaning up the nursery. Early on, they will want you to play on the mat with them.If you have been holding your baby non-stop, you'll love this playmat - a chance to put your baby down and he'll still be happy as a clam."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 3 best shower gifts we received","review":"My 5-month old daughter continues to delight in this play gym.

The lead character has a special talent for discerning whether someone is lying, and for predicting how they will act during a crisis. Most readers of suspense fiction would expect that this talent will be put to some use, and that thereby will hang the tale . . . . but that's not what happens here. It takes the whole book to get the talent described and shown in operation; and then the book ends. In the meantime we find out a considerable amount about the lead character's ex-wife, his father (a journalist who was on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War) his academic friends in England, and so on.But nothing HAPPENS.Don't read this expecting a thriller.

I was at a recent conference and had the thrill of meeting them and hearing them present their ideas and strategies to hundreds of teachers just like me, and it was standing room only. Ms. McDonald and Ms. Hershman are light years ahead of everyone else when it comes to practical strategies and resource material for the new teacher, and I recommend this book, which focuses on secondary classroom teaching and management but in a VERY practical way, to anyone and everyone in the profession.

My snake light came apart in one of the sockets about as soon as I got it. I glued it together and it has not failed since, but the other DeWalt light is much nicer for just regular flashlight use and is much more comfortable and balanced to hold or to set down and shine. The snake light is hard to get to stay where you want it, and it easly gets bomped or topples over.

Each CD contains 25 tracks of different movements from 6 to 8 artists, which don't follow any pleasing through line. If you are interested in learning just who composed which famous piece, or if you need to have on hand the top 100 classical pieces (according to whom? I don't know), then this may be right for you.

His ability to recreate the atmosphere down to the smells and sounds of combat are unsurpassed. I found his enthusiasm for war and his unquestioning attitude toward the carnage he described and experienced ( he was wounded numerous times) at times strangely dispassionate. This didn't reduce the value of his work as a combat memoir but I understand some of the criticism aimed at his work as a glorification of war. Junger clearly viewed war as a supreme test and validation of manhood. There is not a trace of anti-war sentiment or regret in his book.I didn't read this book as a political or philosophical reflection but rather as a remarkably detailed account of battle in the trenches of Flanders and France. It still has the power to shock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best WWI novel","review":"I found this book to be repetitive. The introduction mentions this. However, war is repetitive and monotonous, especially the trench warfare of World War I. In that respect, the book is spot on.This book reads like a war diary, but that does not make it any less horrific and spectacular. Because it is repetitive I would recommend spending a lot of time with this book. Put it down and take a break if you must. But give it your full attention. It deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the action, no political analysis","review":"Purely an in the trenches account of war. Great descriptions of artillery and the great loss of life during battles. No mention of politics, which is done on purpose and I think it works well without.

Also, he gets wounded alot and suffers great losses of his men, so if you like intense action..."},{"rating":"2","title":"J��nger and Remarque","review":"Ernst J��nger describes the carnage of World War I in a cold, frightened language and introduced himself with a big bang to German Literature.He died in 1998 103 years old. Everything he writes is real, has happened to him. Compare the remakable, controversial J��nger with \\"All Quiet On The Western Front\\" by Erich Maria Remarque, another \\"true book\\" about war. You'll find differences, but most of all you find similarities between these different authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to Total War","review":"I don't know of a more neutral and first handed account of what total war really is. This book is not the most compelling work in as much as the author's ability to paint an emotional picture of the war. This man was a soldier and a line-dog, but he is not a fiction writer, nor even a eloquent story teller. This story is enthralling but it is simultaneously boring. The story is the best first hand account of W.W. I combat, and it is a short enjoyable read. Highly recommended for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very good Narative of the Great War","review":"I picked up the book thinking it was about WWII, but I was not disappointed. I too, as another reviewer stated, liked the book \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\" better which is a WWII book. However I was totally impressed with Ernst Junger. What I liked best about this book was his 'never surrender - never say die' spirit. How a man could go through the living hell which he did and keep such a positive outlook is the most amazing aspect of the whole book. The ONLY drawback about the book is the lack of maps and dates. It's hard to follow where the action is and what year he is talking about. Also, I wish he had spoken a little bit about where he was when Germany surrended. If anyone knows of a website to learn more about Ernst Junger please let me know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best WWI book i've ever read!","review":"Ernst J��nger, estimated as one of the most famous german wrighters of the 20th century has in fact provided a masterpiece with this book. It shows in an excellent way the spirit of this time, when soldiers went off to war very enthusiastically and were soon cast back to a reality where death ruled. J��nger describes a new kind of warfare, bearing a lot of terror, extinction and mass destruction. In an often criticised cold and unpassioned style the author shows his ideas of real heroism by overcoming ones fear amidst the most horrid circumstances. J��nger always shows his enemies as people whom he was to kill because he was a soldier - like he stated himself he regarded them with fairness and respect and not with hatred. This book is worth to be read over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"READING IT ONCE IS NOT ENOUGH","review":"This is a book one should read to learn about life deeply without going through the obstacles.

I've been using it for 3mos and yesterday I was snapping the chest buckle together and a piece of plastic broke off. I called Evenflo to get a replacement buckle and they said there is no way of replacing it because the straps CAN NOT be removed from seat. So now I have what looks like a brand new car seat that is trash. We have 2 other car seats that are Britax that have withstood the test of time.

This is National Enquirer material, and not a serious non-fiction book on the Bush Family. Miss Kelly should have the gutts to name her sources and confirm the documents she references as \\"genuine\\", not fabricated material or sources. This is just a commercial vehicle with a very questionable timing release. The book belongs in the circular file.

The real brains behind George is mostly cunning Karl Rove who is not mentioned enough. I think Bush 41 was the better of the two but I voted for neither . Barbara never seemed to me some benign grandmotherly figure with her ever present pearls. I always found her sort of terrifying with a frightening glint in her eyes. I always liked Laura who was very intelligent & just kept a low profile in the White House. Smart of her!At least George never disgraced his family like Clinton did so give him credit for that. I think he would have been just as happy if he didn't get elected. I also like the fact that since out of office he refrains from presidential criticism.The right wing Christian evangelists would forgive a serial killer if he said he had found Jesus. They have really destroyed the Republican party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political, kind of boring","review":"I bought this because it was Kitty Kelly and I usually enjoy her work. However, for me, and this is an entirely personal opinion, it was pretty boring. It was very political. Now, I KNOW that's what the Bushes ARE, but reading about politics just isn't my cup of tea. I just thought it would be more gossipy, like say, The Royals by the same author, which I enjoyed. If you like political reading, I'm sure this book would be good judging from the other reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking, yet not luridly so...","review":"Kelley's book is not as lurid as it has been made out to be, yet nonetheless has some damaging allegations in it.

For a book that has over 700 pages of accusations, one would expect at least one named source that is a first hand witness. Yet, Kelley lists them as confidential. The rest of Kelley's named sources in the book are all based upon these confidential sources. I'm still undecided on who I am going to vote for this election even though I'm a registered Republican. This is based upon all the facts I have rather than unproven accusations. Therefore, to make this a better country, we need to use our minds to decipher what are facts and what are fantasies. This book really should be listed under fiction since it cannot prove a single accusation.

Bush's presidency, it's hard to get angry at Kelley. Her distortions will make her a lot of money and get her on the talk-show circuit; Bush's distortions have resulted in an unjust war, the proliferation of terrorism, and America's alienation from most of the world.So, whether you read the book or not, get rid of Bush on November 2, and then we can forget about him and the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editors Are Paid To Edit","review":"This is MAX a 350 page story + photos.

It's difficult to tell what is fact and what is bias, though many of the statements she makes here have been previously alleged by some credible journalists. Great writing this is not, but it is an interesting read given the subject matter. If it weren't January in California, I'd characterize this as a good beach book. I doubt I'd want to pay full price for this, though, given the price of books these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kitty in the Bush...","review":"This is a book everyone should read before the election in Nov. This book removes the image barriers maintained by the Bush Family and shows them for what they are with the glowing weaknesses of character and their disregard for the truth. It is unbelievable George W. was able to rise to the level of President of the United States.

They are, of course, doing everything in their considerable power to trash the author and eliminate this book - as they succesfully did with the much less inflammatory \\"Fortunate Son.\\" But they've so far failed to get this book censored, in spite of the use of their signature intimidation tactics. Anyone who has been watching the Bush crime family for years, and who has had the sense to ignore the propaganda from them and their media stenographers, knows that there are facts in this book. And it's important that these facts be more widely known, particularly given the proximity of the next election, because this clan has already done more damage to our country and world than any other mob ever. I'm grateful to the author for daring to speak the truth to ill-gotten power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater","review":"My advice is quite simple: Don't pre-judge this book on the basis of what you know or think you know about Kelley as an author.Is she biased in this book? You bet.Is the hard information--the stuff that is credited, sourced or otherwise easily verified--credible? Yes, because it is verified both in this book and in the original, reputable sources.What about the material that she doesn't source, credit or otherwise verify?Toss it out if you think it's tainted.

Well, her work is fashioned as biography, but it is really historical fiction, unsupported or substantiated by fact. She simply picks a target, pulls out the same old bag of tricks, and goes after them. And it is always the same thing. This book is not a work of scholarship and should not be regarded as in any way factual. Intead, check out Scweizer's The Bushes: Portrait of a Dynasty. This book would appeal to readers of romance novels or the National Inquirer, but it does not belong on the bookshelf of someone trying to study history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly done","review":"I have read my share of celebrity and public figure bios, including two previous by this author.

He also has a devine voice.I understand from the linear notes of his 'Broadway and Soul' album that he's taking more control (good for him) and from his arrangement of the closing song 'Sunday' that he did -- he should flex those muscles.Yes, he deserves five stars, six and seven, but that's for the next cd.

The album is produced fairly well, but the instrumentals are basic and lacking anything new or interesting. If you want soft, unobtrusive background music, you might like this CD.

They are also MUCH cheaper than their counterparts at Home Depot or Lowe's. I have a prime account; so I paid no shipping, and they arrived in a day and a half.Some reviewers mentioned heat related problems. My flashlight came with xenon bulbs originally and got pretty hot.

Compared with the other Jews of Islam, whose experience of persecution was generally milder than that of their European brethren, Yemenite Jewry often fell prey to religious fanaticism, suffering the most grievous oppression, humiliation and social disruption. As a result, particularly since the seventeenth century, Talmudic study fell out of favor, while mysticism gained popularity. In other works, I had read that Yemenite Jewish parenting was more punitive than that of many other Jewish communities, and that alcoholism was rife. After reading this fine but harrowing history, I think I understand why."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Requesr From Amazon","review":"I was looking for an out-of-print book and found sources through Amazon.The shop I chose sent the copy of \\"Portrait of a Dog\\" as ordered.

Besides the songs, much of the dialogue is sung.There are many changes from the book to suit the opera format. These changes are fine, and the songs are great. Kelsey Grammer is a bit more over-the-top than most Scrooges; annoying, in fact, having a couple of minor physical infirmities (squinty eyes and a stooped posture) that disappear along with his bad attitude.If you don't like opera, this version is not for you.

The 1970 version (called \\"Scrooge\\") is a masterpiece. And perhaps over time this may become one as well. It's a nicely done production with a great and fun cast.

This musical version came across like nails on the blackboard, I hope to never have to watch this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am a fan of A Christmas Carol and musicals, so I thought that I would enjoy this film. But i was wrong. The Music is terrible. I would expect more from the writers of the music for Disney classics like The Little Mermaid and Aladdin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow... who knew it could be so bad?","review":"Unwatchable. I think I've seen and enjoyed every version ever made and recorded and many of its variations--Finney, Fonzie, Hicks, Kermit the Frog, MaGoo, March, Murray, Owen, Scott, Sim, Stewart, Dr. Who, et. al. And this was unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"I'm a huge fan of this Dickens classic and have watched almost every version of it. I thought I'd like this one too, after all I loved the tv show Frasier, so why wouldn't I? Well, because this movie was AWFUL. I agree with the reviewer who said, \\"If you want a musical, watch the Albert Finney version.\\" Grammer's version will never grow on me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dickens of a mess.","review":"It is rather telling that on the Amazon UK site, unlike stateside, most reviewers gave this film short shrift, they found this version of 'The Christmas carol' pretty awful.The reasons given were fairly consistent and as follows; the songs are too numerous and very forgettable, the sets, which seem to cover a very small area, are unconvincing in that they bear very little resemblance to Victorian London, the whole demeanor of the proceedings are embarrasingly sugar sweet, and most unforgiveable of all - those british accents are dire, though it does look as if some Brits have been thrown in to even things out. I say all this as a Brit and a long time fan of Kelsey Grammer, as most of us are this side of the pond."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a Christmas Carol purist, you may not like this. BUT","review":"I really did. Although the story did not follow the Dickens version to the letter, the story was told in enough similarity that you picked it up. Jason Alexander as Marley was great, and Jane Krakowski was as beautiful as ever. This was well done, and if you are looking for a lighter version of A Christmas Carol, get this. My favorite serious version is still George C. Scott."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cast George Costanza as Marley's Ghost?","review":"I am a lifelong fan of various film versions of \\"A Christmas Carol\\", and in fact have had a few very flawed versions grow on me after repeated viewings, however this one was just plain horrific. I was shocked and surprised at how poorly executed it was - particularly considering the fantastic cast and the musical genius of Alan Menken involved. I've tried to watch a few times now and just can't get through it. The songs, the acting, and the sets and locations are terrible and not in any way true to the essence of Dickens' story. If you like musicals, the Albert Finney version is SO much better. This one is just a terrible disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you...","review":"This version of 'A Christmas Carol' will grow on you. I have to agree with one other reviewer, the music is the best part of this movie. As for Jason Alexander as Marley: he has one of the best musical numbers in the movie. \\"Link-by-Link\\" is absolutely delightful. I also agree with the thoughts on Kelsey Grammer, that he did a great job as Scrooge.When Christmas rolls around, our family loves to pull out these three DVDs: the Muppets 'A Christmas Carol', George C. Scott's 'A Christmas Carol', and now 'A Christmas Carol: The Musical'. It makes for a great time between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting version of the famous A Christmas Carol","review":"I like the muppet version better. Stunning stage and costumes. Amiable actors but some are not as accomplished as the others. Follows the original with some artistic license. Some of the music is enjoyable but the same musical theme runs through the whole show and gets sort of boring. I would recomend this to \\"A Christmas Carol\\" enthusiasts for the diferent slant it introduces. Bon apetit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Musical!","review":"The music truly is great... this will be my favorite version of the \\"Christmas Carol\\" for years to come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Scrooge","review":"Unfortunately the Amazon search said that this was A Christmas Carol with Patrick Stewart.

Chalk another up for the Hallmark Hall of Shame which botched Moby Dick and Don Quixote.There is seldom any dialogue which is not sung. Kelsey Grammer as usual overplays his part, being the perfect Christmas ham. Jason Alexander is absolutely wrong for the part of Marley's ghost.The direction is mediocre along with acting of the supporting cast members. I was hoping for better but a few minutes into this film I had to stop it, hoping I will forget it soon. My apprehensions about watching this movie a few years ago when it was shown on television have proved correct. It is simply overdone, like a number of musicals with good intents but disasterous results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah Humbug!","review":"Just horrible when placed beside any of its predecessors. I pride myself in owning all the various incarnations of A Christmas Carol, even the cartoon versions, but this ill-conceived, trite, uninspired, and dilute version will not be joining that esteemed group! The Albert Finney musical makes this look like a high school musical; those seeking a quality musical version should check it out instead.God help us, everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent First","review":"It starts of well and I really liked how creative the music and dancing worked together but after the Angle of Christmas past apeared in a suductive night shirt slithiering around his bed post and then the Skeletons and dead people which had the affect of a scary hollowen movie we shut if off and were very dissapointed we had not rented it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED","review":"AS I WROTE TO THE MERCHANT WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO SEE TO IT THAT I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT,I NEVER RECEIVED IT.IT HAS YET TO ARRIVE.WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?WHO SHOULD I SAY IT TO?I THINK I WILL PROBABLY CEASE USING AMAZON AND SWITCH TO DEALING DIRECTLY WITH A LIVE PERSON.EVEN IF IT MAY BE LESS CONVENIENT, AT LEAST I WILL WALK OUT WITH WHAT I WANT IN MY HAND.I WOULD APPRECIATE A RESPONSE FROM SOMEONE AT SOME POINT."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Version Of A Christmas Carol.","review":"I read the Christmas Carol book by Charles Dickens and I liked it and I have seen several movie adaptations that I liked but this version with Kelsey Grammer is without a doubt the worst version I have ever seen!

A real stinker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical \\"The Christmas Carole","review":"I seen this on TV and fell in love with it and couldn't wait til the next year to watch again.

Of course everyone knows the story of the Christmas Caol and this take was well written and well acted. I recommend it to everyone who loves music that touches the heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical 'Scrooge' Much Better!","review":"If this was the ONLY musical version of 'A Christmas Carol' I'd seen, I probably would have given it an 'ok' rating, but having seen the musical film \\"Scrooge\\" with Albert Finney, it is just SO much better than this made-for-tv movie, with better actors, better sets, costumes, etc. Most importantly the music and lyrics in 'Scrooge' are so much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show!!!","review":"I hadn't heard about this show until 2 weeks ago when I was asked to step in for a conductor who walked out on a stage version 3 days before opening night. I decided to get the DVD and just finished watching it. This is a great show with a solid cast. Alan Menken who has written the music for a plethora of wonderful shows (Beauty and the Beast, Little Shop of Horrors, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid. . .etc) delivers his usual full array of show stopping numbers, hauntingly beautiful melodies, and memorable songs. The lyrics are great, and the story is. . .well. . timeless. What more could you ask for. This is the perfect Christmas show and, I'm sure, will be shown as a tradition in our house for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs Up for 'A Christmas Carol'!!","review":"We thoroughly enjoyed this holiday classic and would highly recommend it to families who enjoy watching movies together. This musical version puts a new twist on an old story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Christmas Carol The Musical","review":"Tho it arrived in perfect shape and on time, it was the wrong version.

Seward. They represented my ancestor, John Van Zandt. Chase's argument is printed under another title. However, Chase's correspondence gives insight into his thoughts during this time and especially first-hand acccounts of my ancestor. It also includes letters by William H. Seward. This book also provides prescient accounts by numerous individuals reflecting the attitudes/opinions on the anti-slavery issue in American during the nineteenth century. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"an invaluable resource for anyone in the publishing industry","review":"Not only has this book saved me much time and money in research and legal fees, but the author makes the information accessible by offering myriad examples to back up his sage advice.

A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, concise and practical.","review":"As an editor with a small book publisher, I have found this volume invaluable.

Couldn't do without it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD to buy","review":"This is a great CD. The lyrics are great and the best are slmmain. I think this is going to be a big hit album. The best tracks on the LP are \\"LIFE'S REAL\\" by Last Emperors, \\"NATION IN NEED\\" by Last Emperors, \\"THUGED OUT GHETTO POET\\" by Last Emperors and \\"BUTTAS\\" by Ghetto Dawgs. I can not wait for the first single to play on the radio. My favorite group was Last Emperors. I love thier style of rap. I think they are going to be a great group in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"I too wish I had read the reviews.","review":"This was an impulse purchase going only by the notes on the back of the book. They are so misleading as to be laughable. It is written in a very confusing manner. I was over a third of the way in before I realized Toby and Ruben were the same person. I am not wasting my time finishing the book nor can I give it to anyone I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver its promise","review":"The idea of a book within a book, while not new, was intriguing to me; however, this version didn't deliver. The gaps between the stages of both sets of characters was annoying, and the daily detail of their lives was just tedious. Had to finish it for book club, but it was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly disappointing","review":"The cover of this book is surrounded by accolades praising the author's insightful and beautifully realized portrayal of female friendship. This book was poorly written and anything but beautifully realized. You never really get a sense of either of the two female lead characters and the book-within-the book that is supposed tie them together is so simplistic it is nothing but irritating. Save your money and buy a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"fail to see the charm","review":"This book reads like it was written by an earnest high schooler in the throes of a love affair with Virginia Woolf. Needless to say, that is not a compliment. It uses the cop-out technique of introducing character after character so as to avoid having to develop any. Even paying attention, I could barely tell who was who, and I didn't care. Plus, as other reviewers here have mentioned, it was unforgivably dull. But every so often I would stumble across a gem like, \\"She liked the innocence of his genitals, which moved slightly as he walked from his study to the kitchen for ice water or orange juice,\\" and be cheered. As an aspiring novelist myself, perhaps I don't have as far to go as I thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read","review":"We picked this for our book club this month and everyone hated it. Most everyone gave up on it prior to finishing and one person even asked for a refund from the bookstore.The characters were ridiculous in speech and manner and in the end I could care less about any of them. I kept reading hoping it would somehow get better but it only put me to sleep. The story is supposed to be about a friendship, but the two main characters didn't seem like close friends to me. The author left too many unanswered questions about events in their lives. I can't imagine how anyone enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I had expected much more from reading the outline and reviews... but ended up owning a boring and tedious book. The plot scatters and there is no real insight of the characters. Boring, boring, boring. I'm amazed I even finished it, but I just kept on hoping."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing and contrived novel wrapped around a novel","review":"I just couldn't get into this book at all. I recognize how carefully constructed this is, but I just don't see how the author expects people to follow these two completely different sets of characters as she jumps back and forth between the novel and the \\"Trolley Girl\\" novel within. It's tedious and unrewarding. I read about two thirds of this book and then I gave up. What happened to Mattison? She's trying much too hard to be literary or something like that. Her other fiction is so clear and easy to understand, but this one went right over my head. My discussion group was thinking of reading this but I am going to vote against it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book Borrower","review":"I wish that I, too, would have read the negative reviews, while plowing through this book. I would then have not thought that I was crazy trying to finish it for our book review group. Not one of our readers, including me, found this book to have any merit. It is not well written, and remains very disjointed until the end. The author jumps ahead those ten years, without any warning. When did she manage to squeeze in that bizarre creature from the past? I think I missed that when I blinked.We'll probably not need more than 10 minutes to discuss this book unless we're going to talk about the negative impact it has had on us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring","review":"I had to laugh when I read most of the other reviews. This was indeed one of the most boring books ever written. I couldn't find a single pleasant thing to say about either of the main characters and could not understand why they became friends. I couldn't understand why Ruben liked Deborah so much, or why they remained friends over the years. They both seemed selfish and dull. I could not finish it. Luckily, I borrowed it from the library; wish I'd read these customer reviews before I even bothered to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't even deserve one star","review":"This book is extremely dull. It was hard to \\"get into\\" and infact, I never did \\"get into\\" it. I like the concept that a friendship keeps returning to a book borrowed in the beginning, but the author could have done better. The book in the book is confusing and not very entertaining. If you feel that you MUST read this book, I would recommend checking it out from a library. Don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"well-done but not very exciting even though it tries","review":"Mattison is a careful writer and that is the problem. Nothing much happens in her books, and her male characters especially are sort of henpecked. This is her best novel, for sure, but it still doesn't have the oomph of, say, Ann Tyler. There is a literary-ness to the writing that is mostly successful, but it's a curious mix of flannel shirt and kitchen table chat which feels quite authentic and then complex dynamics between characters and plot maneuvers which feels forced, as if the author is trying to figure out how to give readers something more lively than is her instinct to do. The way these characters bored me reminds me of the way my neighbors bore me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This had to be one of the worst books I have read in a long time. It looked promising. Even half way thru it picked up a little, but when I read the last page, I turned it over looking for the end of the story. This book is choppy, disconnected and just flat poorly written. Main character is a whining woman who gets on your nerves and stays there. She never changes.Do NOT waste your time or money on this, there are too many other good books to read"},{"rating":"2","title":"My point of view","review":"Point of View by DB Boulevard is one of the hotter Euro club smash of 2002 along with Iio's Rapture. Featuring Moony's soaring vocal, the song hails back to the good old days of early 90's Euro dance music without sounding overly passe. In fact, it's rather refreshing and the Lange remix here turns the song into hell of a monster dancefloor smash. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a gift to yourself","review":"I bought this CD years ago simply because I was taken with the cover, and it included Christmas music. It has become one of my alltime favorites. The music is great as background for conversations by the fire, or it's wonderful to listen and really concentrate on the music. I was thrilled to find copies on Amazon, as I had tried for years to find some to give as gifts and hadn't had any luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to like this book, but...","review":"I really tried to like this book but just couldn't. The writing was just too high schoolish for me. I didn't particularly care for the folks involved. Too much of the modern world leaked in. It was an effort to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of the Same Old Song......","review":"We have what sounds like an intriging story. I won't bore you with all of the details as previous reviewers have covered most of it.I will get to the point with my dissatisfation.We have an intelligent young lady, that has been the head of her household for a while. All of a sudden a Prince comes along and she is incapable of making decisions for herself. All of a sudden she and her sisters need a father that abandoned them 15 years before.These same helpless women run a sucessful business, but are still incapable of making decisions concering their own safety.Wait...... I almost forgot that the Prince needed to drug and kidnap her (all for her own good of course). I guess kidnapping was an accepted practice during that period.I am tired of reading books where strong, capable women, become needy, helpless girls when they meet a man. It is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Get This Album","review":"I'm a fan of their first five albums but this album is awful.It's slow, annoying and very boring.Cans vocals are back to being they way they use to be, not as good as Chapter v, that's the best Cans has ever sounded.No effort put into this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going down hill FAST","review":"Nothing new on this CD.

I wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing. I got neither. The characters were neither likeable nor substantive. Except for the cop next door, I have no idea what they even look like or what, if anything, they care about besides dogs. The plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear. Maybe the series inmproves after this book. I'm not taking that chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Texas Music","review":"This is a great album by Cory. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because his previou album is definitley worth 5+. If you like this one, check out his self-title ablum. He has a great voice that is perfect for these Texas songs. I have seen him open up for Robert Earle Keen and he is readly to play ball in that league."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent recording to well done writing.","review":"The entire album is excellent. Starting with Texas Time Travelin'. Cory does an excellent rendition of the Del Reeves \\"Lookin' At the World..\\". My favorite is \\"Grandpa\\". Every song on the album is great. Cory is taking Austin by storm and with material as good as this, I believe he will be a big hit nationwide. His style is a little bit like Hank Williams. He also can write as heard in all of his original material. Take close notice of the Poem. It is very original. I can not wait to hear more from Cory Morrow. I am glad that I got a copy of this album early."},{"rating":"2","title":"icky renrut","review":"this is a good overview of the instrumental work done by Ike Turner (and his Kings of Rhythm). Most of it is good, hard driving R&B stuff. All of the songs were recorded between 1954-65. I particularly like the cuts \\"The New Breed (Part 2)\\", and \\"The Gulley\\", really gets you moving.......BTW, Icky Renrut is a pseudonym (or anagram, take your pick) for Ike Turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Father of Rock","review":"Let's face it, with the song Rocket 88, Ike Turner started a something that no-one could have predicted would be the giant genre it is today. That's right folks, Rock & Roll. This compilation of instrumental tracks showcases the talent that is Ike Turner (sans Tina). Listen to the skill with which he plays the guitar and piano and you can't help but notice where everyone from Elvis to Led Zepplin drew their inspiration.

The authors chosen for the book show they are interested in writing on the subjects. Although the subject matter of the stories was not always to my liking or tastes, it is a worthwhile book in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!","review":"The Godfather, Part II is an excellent example of cinematic perfection. This sequel hugely surpasses the original. The story is split in two, {1} Fable one of this split story is about young Vito Corleone, brillantly played by Robert DeNiro, as an immigrant living in New York City and how he rised to power. {2} Fable two is about how Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) who lives up to his father's expectations turning the family into a sleek,cold orgaization. All the preformaces are perfect, espicially Pacino who adds more intensity into his performace than he had in the original. Also, John Cazale who perfectly plays Fredo, Cazale steals every scene he's in! This film is a dark, brillant look at the world of the mafia. Absolutely Brillant. In my mind, probably the greatest film ever made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic masterpiece","review":"A really epic (in a good way!) continuation from the first film, showing the story of Marlon Brando's character's story juxtaposed with the continuing descent of Pacino's character into a world of increasing paranoia and violence.As with the first film, this one is superbly acted and directed, and is a truly great film that any lover of movies should see."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes!","review":"In this movie, we explore the origins of Vito Corleone. In the first film, he is already established as head of the Corleone family and one of the most powerful Mafia families in the country. Here we see where he came from, and how he started on his rise to become one of the most infamous Mafia lords. This movie is split between that account of Vito's youth and today (the late 50's/early 60's in the film) as his sons struggle to maintain his legacy without the guidance of their father. Michael wants to make the family legitimate, but this is a lot easier said than done, and Fredo... well... he's not the brightest crayon in the box, but he has his own ambitions which complicate his brother's goals. Overall a good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Sequels Ever","review":"I would have given this movie 4 1/2 stars but not quite 5. It is a great sequel but pales in comparison to the first film. The continuation in the Michael Corleone saga is good but drags in places, especially towards the end. The Hyman Roth story is nowhere near as fascinating as the Solatzo/Barzini etc. from the first. The flashbacks to the young Vito Corleone was excellent but did not cover the depth that the book had (when does a movie ever equal the book?).Great actors! Pacino and De Niro actually never meet in the film, however. Robert Duvall, Telia Shire, and Diane Keaton continue to shine. The actor that played Frido had a much bigger part than in the first film. Super directing (A lot of film instructors consider this film the ultimate in direction).This is a must see movie to anyone that has seen the first film, but you definately need to have seen the first film to fully enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare a sequel is the equal to the first","review":"I can't figure out which one I like more, Godfather 1 or 2.

If you got Live Era you would know that Guns n' Roses rock live, but this just puts them on another level.

When I saw it at the store- I thought this thing will never work, but after some encouragement from the sales person that these boots are in use and are the only ones I could get, I bought one. Once I started to put it on I regretted cutting my cracked one. The bolts slip through the holes, it is hard to clamp on and when it flexes it opens gaps.

No problem, just tighten them up.The clamp only wants to stay stable if the item you are clamping it too is quite thick. Otherwise, it tilts and turns and doesn't hold it steady. Then there is the issue of the flexible tubing holding the dryer up; it loses it's holding power. I now have a droopy flexy thing that doesn't hold the dryer aloft.In addition to that, it's really noisy and is just a bad design overall.Again, I really think this was a great idea.

The Dark explores the choices one makes in determining one's course in life. The hero of the novel struggles with the the Church's teachings and his lustful desires, which creates a very real tension. Reading the book will make you understand why it was widely banned for many years, and also appreciate McGahern's ability to capture pre-Celtic Tiger Ireland. Every time I read McGahern I feel as if Ireland has come alive before me. McGahern is a wonderful author and this book is vital to his body of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the light","review":"For those of us who love Ireland, John McGahern's second novel is not always an easy read. The Ireland he writes about - old Ireland - can be an ignorant and violent place, a rural backwater where sex is a dark and sinful thing. But do not be put off. This book is outstanding; a beautiful and powerful story of a country boy's struggle to grow out of the darkness of his childhood and into the light of happy adulthood. The Dark was banned in Ireland in the Sixties. Now McGahern is considered one of the country's greatest writers. If you haven't read him, you should. It can't be long before they start printing his face on tea-towels alongside Swift, Wilde, Joyce and Beckett."},{"rating":"2","title":"not every life has a happy ending","review":"Magnificent and truly dark. Yes, it is somewhat grim, but not every book and not every life has a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark & Disappointing","review":"I was looking forward to reading this based on the reviews but was quite disappointed. The books takes a lot for granted and makes jumps in the story that are not supported. If this represents John McGahern then I doubt I will be reading anything else from the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Adolescent Reflection","review":"A short, ugly, sad account of a young Irish boy's progress through adolescence. Written in the Irish idiom, its meanings are difficult to understand especially to one speaking American English. A long struggle of a read ending in disappointment. I am of Irish descent and had hoped to learn something of the Irish culture. Unfortunately with that endeavor in mind I purchased three of his novels, I hope \\"The Dark\\" is not an indication of the content of the other two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively story","review":"I wasn't expecting it to be that great but the novel turned out to be fairly entertaining and educational. It provides a lot of history of S.East asia (focusing on Singapore and Malaysia) and some info on the Navy, while at the same time entertaining the reader with a modern story of piracy. The only problem i had with the story is an even that happens to one of the main characters. Not to reveal too much, but she does something that totally contradicts her character and totally does not fit in with the rest of the story. Thankfully it does not ruin the story and I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Pirates-Of-The-Maylay-Penninsula Story","review":"An engaging and exciting, if uneven story, taking place on a hijacked cruise ship and a guided missle frigate in the South Pacific. This is the first novel I've read involving modern day piracy - a very real threat to cargo vessels today.Technical maritime detail is good, as are character and story development, although much time is spent developing the Executive Officer Robinson's back story without much payoff at the end. Perhaps Setlowe is setting-up the Robinson character for future novels. His Captain Stewart has legs - as does Maggi Chamberlain. Expect to see them again in the next edition. Good, quick Summer Navy-action read. I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"World History and Naval Tactics lesson in a suspense novel","review":"It think this is a great book. Setlowe covers US Naval tactics, south-east Asian history and culture, and modern politics. However, he is a little thin in his explanations sometimes leaving you feeling like you're missing all of the information.The characters are well done and the story, while confusing sometimes, keeps you constatntly turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Best","review":"Whenever I'm abroad I always pick up the IHT.

Well researched, with some great interviews with the poeple who were there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"This book discusses an area that is usually not seen and not heard - disability and sexuality. So often disabled people are assumed to be asexual. But this book helps to show that disabled people can have a diverse range of sexual experiences, just like non-disabled people.The book is easy to read and well written.Being a disabled person myself, I know how hard it can be to come to terms with your identity. This book can help a lot in that regard.I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it....","review":"I wish I would have listened to the other reviewer who gave this film a one star.

They gave us movies like Gia and Elena Undone and The Gymnist. Imagine my surprise when I popped this in and got just what the reviewer said; a dry porn with even worse acting. There were 2 attractive women, but no chemistry, no story, and really, really bad acting. The love scene in the hot tub reminded me of the pool scene in Showgirls, but worse. To quote the film, \\"My shoulders are so tight. I haven't ridden a bike in a long time.\\" Ok, how are your shoulders sore from that? Did you pedal with your arms?

Not enough or good nudity, no real sex scenes. I am not sure what is positive about this movie? I am not good at narrating movies but I can tell you that out of blue one woman shows up at the door steps of another female and announces she is the one her dad is renting, allowing to stay? her in the guest house.

There is even less continuity in this than the previous volume. This makes it very hard for me to care about any of the characters.Some of the \\"history\\" in this is made up, making it far less compelling than the other books in the series. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was because the chapter on Stalingrad was mostly interesting.I don't think that Anthony knows what the word \\"art\\" means. According to this book, the following are arts: seduction, arrogance, ploy, justice, politics, survival, irony, and destruction.

I'm surprised I kept with it as long as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read something else","review":"While I am a huge fan of Piers Anthony, I not only found this book very \\"put down-able\\" but offensive. Between the gratuitous sex on every page and the consumption of human body parts as aphrodesiacs, there was very little good story.

Her characters stay true to their roles and she makes alive the social life of the times, paying acknowledgement to the difficulties, but highlighting the strength of character of her folks. I come to her novels expecting to be absorbed in story and am never disappointed. I find in each title old friends and familiar places.

I don't know if you've ever tried to clean up that powder, but it's next to impossible to get it all. Needless to say, the cartridge did not work AT ALL!!!! We then had to box it up and return it.

They did a concert down in Cancun, and they had all of their CD's for sale, along with this one. Since I didn't have many pesos left at the time,I waited till I got back to the States to order it. Besides having a great song by Key West on here, it has some of the best \\"peel and burn\\" (as it says on the album) acts around on it. I had never heard of Larry Joe Taylor until I got this CD, and he is from right here in Texas! I also am glad that this has Brent Burns song \\"Vacation\\", and John Reno's \\"WEDO\\".

I had the single disc 1987 release but it got damaged so I was looking to replace it. When I checked the Amazon.com product description page on the 1993 double disc release it only listed the same songs from the single disc and nothing from Disc #2. So I thought that I would be getting the same songs as the original single disc plus another disc of music of the same genre that would be a surprise. WRONG! The ENTIRE songlists from the two releases is totally different. Quite deceptive. And I like the 1987 songs a whole lot better.

Cat is not quite the shrew indicated -- don't expect a remake of Shakespeare here. But she does use shrewishness as a defense against what she has come to expect of men, thanks to her brothers & father. Tayg's kindness and sincere compliments allow glimpses of the softer woman beneath the armour.One the plot starts moving, the pace is good, keeping the reader interested in the book.

So this begs the question , why do I only give them 2 stars. Thier front page news stories are brought out to slow to be of value if the story has time value.

From one year to the next the price went from $99 annually to $204 ($155 for the Journal and $49 for Barron's, and I never asked to receive the latter).An arbitrary >100 percent increase with no justification, no option to cancel and no corresponding increase in value provided (on the contrary) seems extraordinarily poorly thought out, especially in today's business climate.It give me great pause to think that these are the ethics of Murdoch and Newscorp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Customer Service","review":"I have been a subscriber of WSJ online since the beginning (over 10 years), and recently got an unexpected 20% increase in the annual renewal rate ($120) put on my AE card.

After reading here I find I am stuck with the renewal. I then went to cancel my CC which was not possible. This reminds me of the old AOL which made it impossible to cancel their service. I never received notice of the price increase, and now know they are deceiving their customers. WSJ is a great online newspaper, but it appears they are now being run by dishonest folks.

The panels used are of the cheapest plastic known to man, you would think for this price they would be double pane but nooooo.

So, if a language is such that the subject precedes the Object, and that both precede the verb, then that language will overwhelmingly be one which had postfixes, instead of prefixes. Greenberg himself settled for around 50 such Universals.

Then she links exuberance to mania, and describes (again famous) people who were manic (or manic-depressive).The last part of the book is rather depressing -- discussing famous people (or characters from famous fiction) who were bipolar.This is not a self-help book.

A non-stereo film camera like this sells for about $5. Everything in it is manual, including film rewind, the optics are made of cheap plastic, the pictures produced lack sharpness and clarity. The so-called viewer is made of paper, lenses ar made of some kind of cellophane-like plastic.It's unfortunate that camera manufacturers have neglected the field of stereo photography. Humans have both two ears and two eyes, don't they?

They suffered from bad venues, crappy acoustics, illness and inconsiderate audiences on this tour.

Ground Control didnt get in the spotlight or receive much attention due to market problems upon development. This game is definately more deserving than 95% of other games in its class(no lie).

In ground control you are given your units and given a task to complete. NO building, NO researching. Only combat. Of course as you go along you will earn bigger and better units, but the ones you start with are by no means flimsy. and I garauntee that the units you start with will be units you continue to use even at the end of the game. The little marine infantry units are actually WORTH SOMETHING...almost a first for RTS games. The graphics are fantastic (even without an expensive store-bought video card). And you can move the camera from a high altitude view for a better overall look....or you can get the camera literally 4 feet off the ground for \\"in the thick of it\\" viewing.

Well welcome to rts heaven! Ground control has stunning 3d graphics and a camera that can rotate around all of your units giving you maximum perspective of the game. Single player has an interesting story line, and the multiplayer is very well balanced. In the game, you may be two races: the Crayven Corperaton, and The Order of the New Dawn. The Crayven guys are a little bit more realistick and the New Dawn is like controlling a bunch of Star Wars units. A LOT of time was put into making this game. I mean A LOT.

Take my advice, buy The Sims, it is far better and full of no bugs. Maxis knows how to put a game together, Sierra does not! Don't let the graphics fool you, Ground Control has too many issues and does not allow for a clean game playing experience. Oh yeah and if you are really looking to buy it be warned, you can only control one side. There is no option to be the \\"bad guys.\\" Most RTS's allow this. So there it is.

It took fifty pages before Gergor Demarkian made an appearance--and in those pages one character after another was introduced. The narrative meadered without direction through most of the book. There were tons of social commentary and almost no plot. This novel may be more literary than mystery, but even so, it was very slow going. In fact, it ground to a halt for me many times.

Alexander Krull's voice is a grating contrast in some of the songs (if you aren't a fan of his style), but Viking's Word would not be as good without him. Most of the album is symphonic/operatic in nature, with Lyset standing alone as decidedly folk. On the downside, the music and lyrics of The Crossing seem awkward, as if the song is forced and just doesn't flow together. I gave this album 4 stars because I like 4 of the 5 distinct songs on it.

Every time I boot my computer, I need to go in and switch the buttons (default is set for left-handed user)Other than that, I love this mouse, and would recommend this mouse to any lefty, especially gamers.I did have difficulty finding this mouse as well, and I had to end up ordering it from Logitech.com, who being the manufacturer, takes their sweet time processing and shipping the order :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Became Erratic.","review":"Despite the fact that 14% of the reviews poo-pood the MX 610, I decided to take the risk and purchase one. It has an extremely nice feel and I thought that I was going enjoy using it and was glad I purchased it. Unfortunately, within 3 weeks of delivery, the mouse became erratic and inconsistent. It would skip 3 or 4 inches across the screen and was impossible to select a specified point or text. I returned the MX 610 immediately and Amazon immediately refunded the total purchase price. I wish that it had worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumping and skipping","review":"I really like the feel of this mouse in my hand. It is sad that there are so few ergonomic left handed mice available. This would be a great one, but.... It has fits where it stalls and then jumps across the page. It is so annoying that I no longer use this mouse. I have a USB port on my monitor that is within 12 inches of the mouse and still I have this problem. I've also tried switching to other ports on my computer, front and back. Something is interfering with the mouse, but I can't find it. I've read that other folks have this problem too, but there's no fix from Logitech. So, back to a 'universal' mouse that fits either hand. At least I can switch buttons and use it left handed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible mouse. Doesn't have range and skips a lot!!!","review":"I bought this mouse for my brother who is a lefty and a computer geek. This mouse doesn't work for short or longer (less than 5 ft) ranges without skipping all over the place. The form factor is ok, its on the big side, so I recommend you save your money and buy a mouse that works since it's not that comfortable to use either. Substandard product at a premium price"},{"rating":"1","title":"a life of its own","review":"Skipped badly. Very difficult to control curser. Tried all suggestions from help sites to no avail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Handed Mouse","review":"I had been looking for a left handed mouse for awhile, they seem to have stopped production of them. I was lucky to find this Logitech MX 610 left hand laser cordless mouse. It fits my hand like a glove, is perfect in use, moves easily and I am glad I found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great mouse, while it lasts","review":"When I first got this mouse as a gift a few years ago, it was great. I loved the shape, the button placement, the functionality, the cordlessness, etc. I also felt the battery life was good.But after about a year of use, I noticed that I started having trouble dragging items -- it seemed like the main mouse button was faulty in some way. I never damaged the hardware, and I'm not a hard clicker or anything. So I used my warranty and had a new one sent to me for free. Now about another year later, the same sort of thing is happening. This time, when I click once, it registers as a double-click. It's very annoying.Another thing: in the course of normal use, a sometimes the pointer movement lags. All of this, unfortunately, makes this mouse less than a precision device. I'm going to have to see if I can use the warranty again, but I'm probably better off just looking for a new mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"looking forward to a different mouse","review":"As with P.Sullivan's experience, my mouse had erratic movement problems. At first I was using a rear USB port and switched to a front one hoping this would help reception - it didn't. Upgraded to latest software and performance seemed to improve but still not acceptable. I noticed my cordless phone seemed to have dramatic bad effects on the mouse when phone was in use. This was not the case with my previous cordless Logitech mouse. I'm returning it to Amazon for a refund...dissappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am left handed and this fits, but I was not too impressed","review":"Well, it is a mouse for lefties....I don't use the huge software that has to be downloaded, becauseI don't need an email button on my mouse or a volume control.It has a lag time and uses CPU cycles.I run it on my second computer and it does the job ok.It is NO good for gaming!I thank Logitech for the design, but feel they could have offered more of their products for \\"we of the Left\\".I do use their excellent G3 gaming mouse for my main PC as it is ambidextrous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Left-Handed Cordless Laser Mouse","review":"I love this mouse. First-ever Left-handed mouse. I was sick of all the Microsoft right-handed mice that wrenched my wrist in the wrong direction.The non-handed straight mice were ok, but this one is much more comfortable. Problem is, my employer won't buy one for me!The wireless part: I need to have the USB receiver (transmitter?) somewhat nearby - if my cat sits between it and the mouse, it works erratically. So be sure to buy a USB extension if that is necessary (like at work where my 5 computers are all under the desk and the USB device is totally confused down there). (That is the reason for 4 stars vice 5)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless mouse","review":"Give me back my track mouse anytime. This mouse stalls and sticks so often that I'm ready to throw it against the wall. I use this mouse for my laptop, with the receiver plugged directly into the USB port on the right side of the laptop. Can there be that much interference between the right side of the laptop to the left where I use the mouse? At first use, the mouse felt great, like cradling your left thumb. Now that I've use it for almost 2 months, my thumb hurts. The part of the mouse where you put your thumb - it's recessed too much. It makes the thumb too close to the other fingers, creating a \\"squeezing\\" position. A more natural position would be for the thumb to spread out a little, like other non-MX610 mice. Very disappointing in terms of hardware (not ergonomic in my opinion) and software (for the sticking problems)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"How do you screw up a mouse? Ask Logitech. NOTE: This Bluetooth mouse requires direct line-of-sight to the USB dongle, and the dongle must be placed no more than 2.5 feet from the mouse...and that's with new batteries. After figuring that out, I spent the remainder of the first week of use trying to get their SetPoint software to work, which crashed with an exception about once a day. I ended up removing the SetPoint software, and the mouse works just as well without it as with it...which isn't very well. The mouse suffers a 1-2 second latency to begin tracking movement when dormant for more than a few seconds. Probably a power-saving feature, but it's very annoying. The only thing good about this mouse is ergonomics, but it isn't worth the hassle. It has me thinking about going back to a wired mouse. Summary: buggy operation, poor reception. Not good if you're a company specializing in computer mice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love from a Lefty","review":"I've always wondered why Microsoft mice are mostly right-handed when BillG is a lefty.I stumbled onto this Logitech mouse when Googling without even knowing that it existed, and I love it. I have to admit that I don't use the little side buttons on the right side much, and I also use the main buttons in standard configuration of left and right clicks (too many years of using standard mice...)But overall, I find this a very comfortable mouse. I wish it could be purchased in conjunction with a wireless keyboard using a common USB dongle, hence my rating of 4 rather than 5 stars.But overall, if you're a lefty, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mouse, But Limited Software","review":"It is probably the best mouse for left-hand users. There are a lot of extra useful buttons, such as Back and Forward for Internet Expolorer, the scroll wheel (excellent, very responsive), and the volume controls are also must-haves. However, I bought this product hoping that Logitech's included software would allow me to program any mouse button I want, but the software does not allow you to do that for the two main Mouse buttons (which is very crippling in my opinion)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Attempt...poor mouse","review":"I've been looking for a quality left handed mouse for a while. I've been using my Logitech Mx Laser w/ Bluetooth for a while. (that is a great mouse) I was very dissappointed with the MX610. For starters its not Bluetooth compatable like my keyboard other peripherals, so it takes up one of my 2 USB ports. Secondly, the thing skips seemingly loses it's signal and thats with transmitter 3 feet away!. I got so frustrated that i switched back to my old mouse. It did feel very good,(now i know how the righties felt all this time), but that doesn't really matter if it doesn't function properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great!!!","review":"I love this series!

I was bitterly disappointed. Not only is the style of Hamilton's writing irritating and medicore, it is horrible. I found all of Hamilton's characters annoying and fake, besides that she had way to many \\"main\\" characters.The storyline was awful and did not flow well. A complete and total waste of time. Read something else. ANYTHING else!! This is terrible.Thank you!~Atalanta"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I'd heard a lot of good things about the Anita Blake series so I thought I would give it a read. I was quite dissapointed with this book. I love to read and have just finished up reading a ton of different vampire series (Sookie Stackhouse, The Vampire Academy, Twighlight, Black Brother Dagger Hood, The Vampire Diaries, and the list goes on and on). Anyhow I was really hoping these books would be good but they just didn't do it for me. Now I have to try and search for some new series to read. Bottom line I don't recommend this book, however I enjoyed the books I've listed above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita Kicks Butt","review":"The Laughing Corpse is good in that second book sort of way, not nearly as good as the first, but good enough to keep you coming back for a third. This time around, Anita goes head to head with a voodoo priestess and the suspense is damn good. The best part of this book is the developing relationship between Anita and Jean-Claude. Vampires are not a big part of this book, which is more like a supernatural mystery than a horror novel, but that allows the author to build upon the relationship between these polar opposites. Laurell K. Hamilton has created a fantastic heroine in which one can become extremely invested. By the time you get to the end, you both surprised and clamoring for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Fun,Fun","review":"I am hooked. I love Anita Blake. The character is so much fun to follow along with. This series is just great fun. I read the first in the series and enjoyed the book. But this second entry I felt was much better.Hamilton keeps the twists and surprises coming. and she makes the unbelievable setting, believable.Anita Blake is sexy and tough, and her adventures are pure excitement. I love they way Hamilton writes. This is pure escapist fun. Hamilton transports you to another world, and once you start reading this series you will be hooked. I have already ordered the third in the series. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"no e-book?!","review":"Why is this the only book in the series that isn't an e-book?? Just finished Guilty Pleasures and was looking forward to reading this one right away but can't crack a book at work.. will take me weeks to finish this at home. *sigh*"},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd in a great series","review":"I didn't find this book racist as another reviewer did.I did find much of the book gun obsessed however. It's clearly something the author is interested in.In the second book of the series we are treated to the same fresh take on the supernatural that we got in \\"Guilty Pleasures\\".Anita Blake prefers to have those around her perceive her as the tough-as-nails excutioner of the undead. We are privy to her thoughts when those around her get a glimpse of the real Anita, and often as not, she isn't comfortable with that. But then again who is?This installment features an interesting take on her profession as an animator and gives us some idea of the ethics involved in raising the dead.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a huge waste of money!","review":"If you like a dull vocabulary, truncated sentences, uninteresting characters, and absolutely no action, this is the series for you! I am angry that I spent more than $20 for three of the worst written books I have every wasted good dollars to purchase. This author actually used \\"gleam\\", \\"gleaming\\", \\"gleamed\\" EIGHT times in four paragraphs. Obviously, a thesaurus and a better editor are called for to make this series even readable! Furthermore, the characters are shallow and undeveloped, completely uninteresting. Save your cash for an extra latte, you'll get more bang out of that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild and fun gorefest! Anita rules!","review":"Wow, this one was a wild ride! This is the second book in Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series and she really kicks things into high gear! This novel has everything you've come to expect from vampires and zombies to a voodoo high priestess. The action comes fast and furious, and the author does a great job of building her characters, particularly Anita and Jean-Claude. That's a relationship I'm sure we'll see more of in future volumes. One word of warning, there's a good deal of gore and graphic descriptions in this one. Those with a weak stomach may want to take caution. Any way, The Laughing Corpse gets 5 stars from me! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner.......","review":"I have to tell you..Im loving these Anita Blake books..definitely something different.

It's a great read.Too bad that the later books in the series do not live up to the flavor and quality set forth at the beginning of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"More good bloody fun","review":"So... what would you do for a million dollars? Anita \\"just says no\\" to human sacrifice, but not everyone has her scruples. This second book in the series carries on in the same vein as the first, continuing her slide toward what she considers \\"moral ambiguity\\" and we call \\"steamy love scenes\\". Plus the title is just plain cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zombies, Voodoo, & slaying!","review":"I love the Anita Blake series! I've read about 5 so far. Anita Blake is a vampire hunter and more! She's also a reanimator (she can raise the dead!), member of the St. Louis \\"spook squad\\" (licensed to slay!), weapons expert (the real and supernatural ones), and - in this book - a zombie slayer! This book is great. There's plenty of blood & guts, voodoo, slaying, and plot for any vampire fan. She's Buffy the Vampire Slayer but more violent and dark. I recommend this book to any vampire fan. The book is so tight you can almost read this one first. It will have you checking to make sure your windows are locked. What an AWESOME SERIES!LewisHenry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I enjoyed this book, I liked it better than the first book. It is a lot more gory than I expected and rather dark. In this book, a Zombie is killing entire families and it isn't pretty. Anita comes up against a Voodoo Queen, she asked Anita to join her in raising Zombies and when Anita declines, she sends a couple of zombies to kill Anita. The Master Vampire of the City keeps reminding Anita that she is his human servant, she has been marked by him twice, Anita doesn't want any part of him, but she does lust after him. This book is fast paced and I found it to be a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and fast paced!","review":"Do no read this book while eating. You will end up tossing your cookies if you do. Blood, gore, guts. This book is full of it. Loved it. Still had a problem with the \\"shrugging\\". Wish the character could come up with some other gesture. This one is starting to become annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guilty Pleasures","review":"This book wasn't what I thought it was going to be. This isn't author's fault. I thought I was getting a vampire romance fantansy and that is not what these books are about, apparently. They are violent, more like fantasy detective novels, and this Blake character is kind of hard core. I didn't like her and I think that's the idea. She's blunt, rude, weird, and very masculine. And I think she really doesn't like sex, let alone men, much. So if you're looking for a fun romance, buyer beware. However, if romance isn't your thing, and violence is, these books may be your cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK EXCEEDED MY QUOTA FOR GORE--","review":"I could have skipped this second in series as it was too drawn out, too gory, too dismal, and too boring to be enjoyed. Wow! What a weird combination. I don't mind the rough stuff in doses, but this was a solid book of it. It made me grumpy--there were no moments of relief and very little about the vampires, just your non average human-eating monsters (the one made up of various body parts was a bit too much.) I sighed with relief when I finished this book. I had not enjoyed it and was glad to see it end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough as Nails Vampire Slayer","review":"This book is a hundred times better then Guilty Pleasures. It had a good gripping story, Jean-Claude, and not a lot of corney cliches that the 1st book had.Anita sometimes gets a little irritating, you don't have to say your a 'tough as nails vampire slayer' twenty times, we got it. I also don't quite understand how bloody murder scenes make her puke but she can lop off a vampires head without a hint of an upset stomach ... vamps bleed too.Anita also had her good moments ... that and the story line kept me reading and I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"SECOND INSTALLMENT...TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!!!","review":"This is the second installment of the Anita Blake vampire series. What can I say...Laurell K. Hamilton has done it again. I recently fell in love with this series. I never want it to end. It really is too good. Anita Blake is all women. She has so many funny comeback lines, it's ridiculous. There is also Jean Claude, the Master of the City. Why aren't human men like him? Pretty soon you will meet Richard, the werewolf. Who will capture Anita's heart, Jean Claude or Richard. Go get this and the third installment...NOW!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four and a half stars","review":"_The Laughing Corpse_ is the second book in the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series. It takes place in an alternate reality where vampires are legal and being an animator(raising zombies) is just another job. Anita is an animator who is also a consultant for the preternatural investigation squad(a branch of the police force) in St. Louis. In this book she investigates some mysterious and gruesome murders that just might be connected to her particular line of work. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and boring","review":"I found this trite, boring and needlessly bloody. Im all for blood when its well placed and adds to the plot, but she just seems to kind of throw it around without imagination. Her other books (starting with \\"Kiss of Shadows\\") were SO much more imaginative, I was constantly surprised by the twists and intrigue of the unseely court and caught up in the new and interesting applications of magic. I was just seriously bored by this, maybe Im just not into the zombie thing. Anita Blake bores me too. Shes the typical tough, morally unimpugnable spitfire....blah blah blah.... totally uninteresting. Read Kiss of shadows if you want to see some imagination. Its a little different because its more of an erotic series but really fun to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Best, but....","review":"Though some say that Laurell K. Hamilton has mediocre writing skills and such, I don't believe that's necessarily true. Hamilton's writing is witty, and full of small idiosyncrasies that relate to the writing style and the character build of all Anita Blake and Co.The Laughing Corpse was good, though I haven't read Guilty Pleasures, The Lunatic Cafe, The Killing Dance, Obsidian Butterfly or Narcissus in Chains, my favorites are Burnt Offerings and Blue Moon.Hamilton mixes character, emotion, and realism in all of her books, definetly worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the later stages of motherhood.","review":"I was looking forward to reading about mothering adult children, but this is mostly about mothering children while they are still at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying book","review":"As I read, it sound like some friends that try to push their kids video tapes on your throat all the time, like those friends that can't stop detailing every little feat, picture, songs that their kids made. Realist, yes, but who cares listening to her kids stories, what cuteness came from their mouth, etc, etc. This was the most annoying book I ever read. I was going almost going to scream if I hear one more time what Maddie said, what Nick did, etc, I am not interested in listening to her journals. If I could get a refund, it will be the best. If you really want to go on and try this book, go get it in the library before wasting money to hear what her kids said, did yesterday, a year ago..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful voice without distractions","review":"This is an album of SINGING, not PRODUCTION.

This is top quality stainless flatware. It has excellent balance, very smooth finish and a nice heavy weigh that feels luxurious. I use these for everyday use and it really spoils you. After using this flatware you notice that every restaurant, dinner party or friend's house you go to has flatware that feels flimsy, lightweight and generally inferior. Oneida flatware is a level or two below these. Wait for the sales and buy as much as you will ever need and be sure to include the serving pieces. Don't wait too long because styles will not be manufactured forever. These will last a lifetime and after several years of dishwasher use it still looks great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong pattern sent :-(","review":"I was needing Waterford Ballet Ribbon Gold and this came up as a match.

The book is unusual in Arthurian canon because it presents Medraut (Mordred) as a decent, caring person rather than a villain. All he wants is to be loved and trusted, and when being a decent, caring person fails to earn him love and respect, he decides to hurt those who have refused to accept him. This book speaks to all the young people who are children of divorce, torn between parents, jealous of younger siblings, and needing to be accepted on their own terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Arthurian Cycle and Ancient Ethiopia","review":"This is the first book in Wein's Arthurian cycle. I have read later books by Wein; this novel is written by Medraut, as if he were entering his thoughts in a journal. I like Wein's narrative approach.

Maddie does not trust the FBI and refuses their offer of protection, but when someone shoots at her in her apartment complex, she catapults into McCabe's arms and agrees to be bait for the killer. A treacherous game of cat and mouse follows, placing both in peril, along with the added danger of their fatal attraction for one another.Although this plot has been done more than a few times, Karen Robards adds an extra zing all her own.

When the stupid yaking mutt of a dog (and I love dogs) is brought into the story things go downhill fast! This dog is as annoying as they come. The dog made me want to quit reading the book it was so stupid. It seems like she brought in this dog to fill up the pages.

Both peanuts and chocolate are extremely toxic to dogs. When she stopped to buy something for the dog to eat, she didn't bother with even a hamburger but went straight to the french fries.

There are 10 short mysteries that Encyclopedia Brown will solve while the answer to the mysteries are at the book.

The book is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Really Detective Stories","review":"Encyclopedia Brown is a 10-year-old genius who solves crimes both for other children (25 cents a case) and for his dad, the chief of police. Each \\"case\\" has a few pages of narrative, then the reader is invited to guess how Encyclopedia knew the answer. Typically Encyclopedia will have noted some inconsistency in a witness's story, leading him to conclude that the witness is in fact the perpetrator. As Mister Bigalow noted in his review, detective work does not actually work that way (although Mister Bigalow is perhaps putting a bit too much pressure on a simple children's book). The stories are actually tests of the reader's logic and factual knowledge. Unlike many grown-up mysteries (e.g., the Father Brown stories), the key information is almost always fairly given in the story, though few if any readers will rival Encyclopedia Brown's success rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Children, not adults","review":"I never read this as a child.

For an adult, we have much greater puzzles to solve than these."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninteresting","review":"I read this with a 3rd grade class, thinking they would love the series. Instead, they were instantly bored and had trouble paying attention. The stories have \\"clues\\" that are not mentioned. or require specific background knowledge most children to do have. For instance, one stories involves china. What child knows knows much about this? Perhaps they know they eat off china on special occasions, but that is it. China is going to pull in a young reader?

There is some very annoying audio interference, and my guess is that this print was taped off of television. The box also states that this is a widescreen edition, which it is not. TV movies from 1981 weren't filmed in widescreen; the only way it could be in wide screen were if the top and bottom of the picture were cut.

I had a small stack of comic books when I was a kid, many of them FF, that I read hundreds of times, but without ever really being able to follow a story arc because I didn't subscribe and lived in the middle of nowhere.

Collecting on DVD what would take years and thousands of dollars to collect in comic format is a boon to the reader, and that is who is truly benefitting from these collections. The only issue keeping this from being a five star collection is the annoying habit of representing material which is on a previously released DVD collection. The collected FF was released two years ago and now it has been re-released (including an additional year's worth of books) with the Silver Surfer in this collection. I understand this was timed for the release of the second FF movie but this release is unfair to those of us who purchased the original FF collection. In my opinion, the loyal Marvel fan would have been better served had the Silver Surfer been released in a compilation of cosmic titles (Captain Marvel, Nova, Quasar, etc.).

Also, it is recommended that you need to increase the volume on the ipod first before than using the volume knob on your car radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"DLO TransDock micro","review":"The Transdock Micro is a good choice to consider for FM transmitters. It transmits a strong, clear signal that doesn't dissapoint. Like all FM tansmitters, it succumbs to interference at some point but quickly recovers as you drive away from the source of interference or quickly retune the Micro to a new station. Users will also find that the Micro is also similar to other FM transmitters in that you have to turn your radio volume higher than you would for a regular radio station. To me, the Micro seems to fit REALLY tight into the cigarette lighters or auxillary power jacks in vehicles. You have to be careful to grab the collar on the Micro when you pull it out so as not to damage it. I used to carry an Ipod charger and transmitter with me on road trips but now my Micro does both. Overall, I am satisfied with my Micro and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality FM transmitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for iPhones","review":"Although the manufacturer says on their website that this transmitter plays iPhone music, mine didn't. I tried everything they suggest and more. Was able to have it working with a regular iPod, but it only charges my iPhone. Nothing else. The accessory recognition message didn't ever popup. It doesn't matter what I do and how many times I plug/unplug it.Plus, their support is terrible. It took a week to have my questions answered stupidly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struck out on the DLO TransDock Micro","review":"After reading several reviews, I thought I was making the right choice of picking the DLO TransDoc Micro for my daughter. She has a 2001 Dodge Stratus and wanted to play her new IPOD in it. Well, the reception was very poor--a lot of static.I thought it might just be the car, so I tried it in my wife's 2002 Saturn station wagon. That was no better. I did the next best thing: I returned it. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was hesitant...","review":"But this device performs as promised. Though not quite CD quality, it is darn close. I didn't think I would be able to find an empty radio station (I live in radio-saturated Long Island), but I was able to use one of the default presets. And it installed very easily. Definitely highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound and AWESOME company","review":"The only reason I couldn't give this product 5 stars is because it doesn't charge my iPod (3rd generation).. but the sound quality is awesome, it's SO easy to use and when I wrote to the company to ask about the fact that it wasn't charging my iPod.. I got a very fast and personal reply. They helped me determine which iPod I have, explained to me in detail why it didn't work and offered to send me a model that will work for my iPod after I ship mine back. They have outstanding customer service! And when I get the new poduct I will be sure to write a review for that one as well! If you have anything other than a 3rd generation iPod - this is a great thing to own.. and while I didn't get to try it out.. it says you can use it with any audio device with a standard output jack.. AND you can charge your cell phone if it's USB chargable! BONUS! :) I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY","review":"After reading the other reviews, I thought I was making a good purchase. I couldn't have been more wrong. This is easily the worst performing product I've bought in a long time. Constant static no matter what station I put it on, and every 3rd or 4th song it just stops mid-song. Needless to say, I took my car in to have an iPod jack installed this weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this - Breaks after warranty","review":"I bought this product in late September after asking the guy at Best Buy which transmitter works best in the city. So I believed him (bad idea), saw that the product had a warranty, and bought it. Unfortunately the warranty was only for 90 days, but for some reason it didn't stop me. Low and behold January comes around and it stops working. It won't respond when I put it in the 12 V... nothing. Oh well, it was excellent for the time it lasted (3 months). Good sound, no static or anything. But $80 is not equal to 3 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like the others","review":"I try buying one of these devices from some manufacturer every six months hoping the technology will improve and one will eventually work well. Does not matter if I spend a little or a lot I always end up with something that gives me some sound from the iPod mixed with the radio station on frequencies that have a radio station and nothing on frequencies that don't. I read other reviews and expected this to work - but not for me. Oh well, there is always next year in another six months..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor performance from day 1","review":"I went shopping to get a minijack to tape adapter (they cost $15 or so) and saw this item in the store for $64 and figured it would work just as well and keep my iPod charged at the same time. While the product is well designed, it just can't find a station that will allow me to use it without static or intermittently having songs interrupted by voices from the radio. I don't live in a big city, and even driving the 10 miles to work turned stations with only slight static into useless stations. I returned it 2 days later. If you want a reliable way to listen to your iPod in your car without having to adjust it frequently, this product is not the way to go. Listen to the other suggestions here and get a tape adapter or buy a newer car stereo with an auxiliary input jack on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but not perfect","review":"I really miss my old transmitter that would run on 87.9, the only airwave that seems to work flawlessly for iPod transmitters. Alas, this one tends to work pretty well on 88.1 most of the time, though I do occasionally have to change it up. The button configuration for presents doesn't seem intuitive and is a little annoying. I've taken to just changing the frequency manually every time, but at least it's only on rare occasions. Although it does seem overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound quality is great but hardware is not","review":"I have purchsed two of these. The first one I got from bestbuy cause the guy told me it was great. It did work great for about 3 months but then it started going in and out and then finally stopped. I thought I had a bad apple so I bought another one from wal-mart. After about 3 months it started doing the same thing. Well the warranty is only for 90 days so i'm out of luck. the 2nd one still works but it has a short it in so you never know when it might go out and how long it might stay out. As far as the qaulity of the sound, it was great when it worked so if DLO can ever get there quality of the hardware better then I would recomend this product otherwise you will spend a lot of money replacing it every 3 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so easy","review":"VERY tight fit into receptacle and won't fit at all in one of my vehicles. Took a bit to find a station though I don't live near a big city but apparently close enough! I like having the presets because of this. Direction booklet is clear but print is quite tiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with 3G Ipod","review":"disappointing as description says the opposite. Will broadcast first song then locks up and never charges my iPod. I'm outside of the return period and so outside of luck. Not sure if its Amazon's mistake or a defective product. DLO's website just says not compatible with 2G shuffle, so I'm assuming its defective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent FM transmitter","review":"I got this for a 2,400 mile road trip my family was taking and couldn't have been more pleased with the performance. The trip took me from Atlanta, GA to Burlington, VT and back. Passing through several major metropolitan areas, I never experienced any interference from other radio stations. I set the TransDock and my FM radio stations once, and never had to touch either of them again. This is by far the best FM transmitter I've ever used for an MP3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"fell apart after 6 months - no customer service.","review":"There are wires that run through a hinge from the display to the part that plugs into the lighter. Eventually this plastic hinge wore out. Then the stress of pulling the charger out of the socket broke a wire. I actually took it apart and resoldered the wire, but I believe the electronics were fried when the wire broke loose. I got no support from the manufacturer, who arrogantly said \\"you have to just buy another Transdock Micro.\\" Of course I did not follow their advice. I bought a \\"Monster\\" this time. Much more robust design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good iPod device","review":"After using DLO TransDock micro with my 30GB video iPod for the past month, I'm pretty satisfied with it. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the volume of the audio could be a little better. I have to double or triple the volume on my radio when I use it, compared to the normal, lower volume when I'm just listening to my radio/cd player alone.I like the long cord which allows me to move my iPod around while I'm using it, without being locked to a fixed docking station. Since my car charter is in an inconveniently low place, I wouldn't be able to dock it anywhere useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Deliever","review":"This product does not deliver.

After peeling away the accolades, one sees that the authors are apologists for the American way of life, but it is strange that they don't seem to come to grips with the fact that North America has long since peaked in natural gas. (Google Oil Crisis and check the gas.) Furthermore, transporting natural gas over large distances is extremely inefficient and sustains US dependency on foreign energy sources, contradicting the authors' stated objectives.If US security is the goal, then promoting a home-grown solution is the only sensible way forward. Solar and wind energy in mass production will be far more economical and require far less energy to deploy in comparison with fossil fuels and nuclear power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, snobby and useless","review":"I've never even read the book but I have a friend who takes this woman's class.

My only fear is that someone would hear this album first and get the impression that Beiderbecke's legacy was kitschy old-time music and not worth pursuing. I mean, this CD is about as soulful as a barber-shop quartet at Disneyworld and I guess that kind of cute nostalgic fluff has a place -- somewhere in the universe. But Bix Beiderbecke was one of the great musicians of the last century and his recordings have a beauty and intensity that makes them utterly contemporary -- they hit you where you live! To hear Martha Wainright's schoolmarmish rendition of the immortal \\"Singin' the Blues\\" -- well, it would make me angry if I didn't know that in a few years this silly, if well-meaning CD will be history -- while Beiderbecke's music will continue to seduce new generations of listeners (like me) forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cover!","review":"We have a camper on a lake and use our golf cart from April to October.

(inside at night) We kept finding him outside in the ashes of our outside fireplace and just new there was something he was lacking and seriously needed. We're not big fans of a lot of the vets who want to give drugs. We tried switching his food and everything under the sun. So, I purchased this off of Amazon. Within 6 weeks of being on this his skin rash cleared up COMPLETELY! Not only that, but he LOVES the taste of it, his fur is super shiny, he finally put some weight on and he is very content to stay indoors now and doesn't have the urge to be gone days at a time. Oh, and he hasn't been in the fireplace since. If you have an animal with skin issues, this could help.

I think the pineapple flakes are acidic and make it easier for tartar to buildup on her teeth. Also the flakes become mushy when you mix it with warm water, as per the instructions. So when she eats it, theres this green flakey mush stuck inbetween my dog's teeth that's hard to clean out.So I dont like this product.

No I was not a recent convert or riding their tails when they won, I started with the in the 80's (yes when they were not at their all time best). Anyway, the only thing about the book I was disappointed with is it did not have Gordie Howe's words (even though he wrote his own book, he could have something in it), Larionov, Federov, Vernon, and many others who did not contribute.

The author is a smug, self-important guy who thinks he is funny. As a recent transplant from Chicago to a northern suburb, I looked forward to this book and was so diappointed. The stories hardly have to do with living in the suburbs (deciding on a religion for you kids?!, fighting for a parking space at the gym?). Please.....

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like real life in the Chicago suburbs!","review":"I usually read, not write, reviews, on amazon.com., but this book was so bad I felt compelled to warn others: don't waste the time, or money on this book! The author comes across as a self-important boor, and his wife as a self-centered shrew. How the author could claim to love his wife, and write about her in a poor light, is beyond me.

As an avid reader of modern day fiction, I selected this book as a welcome change of pace. I was not disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad history and not very good writing","review":"I read - a lot - including a lot of historical fiction. I also read the genre known as alternate history.If Iggulden intended to write alternate history, he should have said so. His \\"history\\" is riddled with minor and major inaccuracies. And his afterward explanation is just as bad. He says in his afterward, for example, that he had Gaius Marius killed in the first struggle with Sulla rather than the second, because it made for better writing. In fact, Gaius Marius died in bed, not in any battle - with Sulla or anyone else.I found the writing to vary between very dull about ordinary life and brutal enjoyment of battle scenes, but generally not good writing. Much better writers of fiction about Roman history include Colleen McCullough (about Julius Caeser), Lindsay Davis, Steven Saylor, and John Maddox Roberts - their history is mostly accurate and their writing much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unadulterated garbage","review":"If it were possible to give this book a negative rating of 5, I would. It's badly written, the plot is laughable, the events described bear no relation to what we know of the period, and the characters are pure cardboard. This is not the story of Caius Julius Caesar - it's some demented anachronistic fantasy from the author's mind. The protagonist resembles the historical Caesar about as closely as a cockroach does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Historical","review":"After completing this work it appears obvious that the author was actually writing an alternate history scenario but lacked the confidence to market his effort without the necessity of positioning it in the guise of a historical novel.Unfortunately, the life of Julius Caesar whether related by anyone from Suetonius to Colleen McCullough is more interesting and complex in fact and fiction than anything that \\"Emperor\\" approaches.I would suggest that this poorly designed effort will be of more interest to Hollywood for the next lavishly produced, big budget, historically inaccurate feature than anyone seriously interested in gaining some insight into the life and times of one of history's greatest men."},{"rating":"1","title":"This author is no McCullough-- Disappointing","review":"After having spent months reading Colleen McCullough's engrossing series on Rome, and being a lifelong lover of all things Roman, I thought this book was a sure thing when I picked it up. Alas, it is a dud. Very little happens in its pages. It has moments of good storytelling, but it drags in such a way that I am convinced that the author was hired on by the publisher to stretch his novel idea into three or four books. The characterization is not bad, but the plot moves at a snail's pace and when I was done I felt like I had not gotten my money's worth. Not a good feeling. I didn't feel like I read the same book that was blurbed on the cover. If a person wants to read gripping novels of Rome, one has to turn no farther than Colleen McCullough. Iggulden uses the same characters, but they are two-dimensional, predictable, and sophomoric. A poor effort. Either go to the library and get it for free or don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Et tu, Iggulden?","review":"Honestly, I couldn't care less about the \\"historical accuracy\\" of this book. It's fiction. I bought it because I thought it might be a good fiction book, if I wanted a history book I would have bought one. But the writing is very amateurish, the only time the writing seems to come alive is when Iggulden is writing huge battle scenes. Other than that, it's very bland. Now I'm looking for a better historical fiction book about Rome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"had promise but disappointing","review":"As someone who loves books about ancient Rome, I was excited to read this book. The book starts out strongly with a description of Caesar's childhood, and while I liked the author's narrative ability, I couldn't get passed the historical inaccuracies. I had just finished reading October Horse and so knew a great deal about Caesar and this book just takes too many liberties with Caesar's childhood, Marius, the identity of Caesar's boyhood friend, and Sulla's march on Rome.I suggest the Masters of Rome series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"emperor I","review":"I bought all three of these books. I hope they get better but book one leaves a whole lot to be desired. I can deal with the fact it is not remotely historically accurate, but a little closer would have been nice. Its just really not a particularly well written book in general. Its kind of silly. If you like simple writing and simple characters, this probabaly is not bad, but I normally like a bit more challange to my reading. And Caesar could hardly be thought of as a simple man. Its more like an overly long children's book. It does not make the reader anxious to read on, it just kind of drags. Its not bad, its just not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad history and bad storytelling","review":"I love historical fiction -- particularly novels set in Ancient Rome -- but I was terribly disappointed by this book. Neither the \\"historical\\" nor the \\"fiction\\" parts are satisfying. The book is wildly inaccurate in its history, which serves as a constant irritation to readers with even a modicum of knowledge about the main characters and events. The fiction involves countless, repetitive battles -- large and small -- interspersed with the kind of unlikely coincidences found in straight-to-video potboilers.Skip this book and read instead the novels in Steven Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series, Lindsey Davis's Marcus Didius Falco series, John Maddox Roberts's SPQR series, or Colleen McCullough's series of novels set in the late Roman Republic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butchered history; so what?","review":"OK, so the author does play fast and loose with Roman history and 'poetic licence' is certainly stretched to great lengths in his delivery of this series of books. So what; how many readers are picking up this book for an authentic history of Ceaser's life & times. This is historical fiction.... hello! Understand this and I doubt you will find a better example of this genre.I venture to suggest that the majority of Iggulden's readers know exactly where he is coming from & will not be disappointed at all by this series.You want to read a more factual (but still highly entertaining history, we have Seutonius for that! You want historical fiction, look no further. This is well written, compelling characters, a great yarn and just a damn good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true accomplishment","review":"This book is a fantastic prelude to the best historic fiction series ive ever read. The lucid detail is amazing. The best part about this book is being introduced to Juilius's uncle Marius. I reccommend this book to anyone who is interested in history or just likes to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read but takes some liberties","review":"As others have noted, the novel is not historically accurate and indeed may even contain one sci fi/fantasy aspect. In some cases who cares, in others there will be a few challenges to resolve (Gaius is an only child so how will he be Octavian's maternal uncle?). In other cases there are a few pointless anachronisms (likely presence of distilled alcohol). Nonetheless the book keeps moving at a brisk pace. It also manages to avoid some of the historical fiction writerly flaws of too much exposition, by-the-numbers cuts between characters (<cough> Harry Turtledove <cough>), etc. If you like ancient world history, check it out. You can hardly fault the source material---we're still living with consequences of Julius Caesar's actions today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay","review":"What is wrong with you people can't you let any one elaborate at all can you?

Him being Caesar's boyhood friend made absolutely no sense whatsoever. I was going to suggest that my 15 year old read this as an historical novel but forget it. Even children's books on this subject matter reveal these gross errors in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"embarrassing","review":"I am usually entertained by any competant historical fiction of ancient Rome. This book is shot full of holes in the plotline and in the complete disregard of the known facts in its presentation of Rome and the characters who are purported to be its heroes. Iggulden should have changed the names and the places and presented his tale as fantasy. I put the book down forever after 150 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The greatest disappointement of my life","review":"One thing is to write a fictional work, another is to completely change the known history.This book should be in a alternate history listing. Since the death of Marius to the education of Caesar, the history of Rome itself, all is too wrong to be read by someone who has no knowledge of history and that may believ in these lies.I read only half of the book, the plot is weak, the author knows nothing, but I mean really nothing about history.Even children should not read it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Iggulden is a poor man's McCullough","review":"So you don't have the time or inclination to read Colleen mcCullough's books, well, never fear, Conn Iggulden is here. Although the author takes over 300 pages to mention Julius Caesar's name, it shouldn't take more then a few pages for someone with a rudimentary knowledge of history to figure out who the protagonist is.I'm not sure why people are gushing about how good this book is. I agree it is a fast read and the author does try to stay historically accurate, but this is not a Tale of Two Cities.If you want good writing, read McCullough. If you want a mindless, somewhat interesting read, pick up Iggulden's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes history extremely interesting","review":"this book was great and refreshing as igguldon depicts a clear picture of brutal Rome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"It may not be completely historically accurate - nut its till a great story - enough that I willbe purchasing all in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"complex but thin","review":"I found this novel to be a little thin in terms of characterization. The plot line was okay, and kept the story line moving, but overall the reader just isn't engaged with the story. There are enough characters, major and minor, to be of interest, but they were either cliche driven or simply two dimensional. I read through to the end, not because I cared about the characters, but because it was the first in a series and I wanted to see how the following novels were set up. I also felt the historic references to place, culture and events more cursory than interesting. It seemed that the research had been done, but only on the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Randolphin2","review":"I just could not finish this book! Maybe if I had not read the great series by Colleen McCullough first I could have gotten through it. The historical mayhem this author perpetrates on the Roman empire is mind boggling. This is not historical fiction, just pure fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fun read, but not historical fiction","review":"This should definitely be classified under alternative historical fiction--not regular historical fiction.It's a fun read, but there's very little history involved here. If you want to learn about the history of Rome's big players, this is a very poor choice. If you already know about the history of Rome and want to read a generally fictionalized alternative universe about its main players around the time of Caesar, then this may be fine for you.I realize that all novelists, even those of historical fiction, are free to embellish for the purposes of creating a good story, and that it's not a history book per se, but this went too far over the line for my expectations.I recommend the Colleen McCullough series on Rome as well as Robert Harris' novel of the same era, Imperium. I also liked the biography, Augustus, by Anthony Everitt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emperor: The Gates of Rome","review":"Unless you dont care about historical inaccuracies this is not worth the read. Although it was easy to read and maybe even entertaining it is so riddled with historical mistakes or liberies that I wouldn't reccomend that anyone with no knowledge of the time period read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close.","review":"While this was entertaining fiction it most certainly was in no context historical. Maybe it is the history major in me, but I could not he past how far off almost everything was: The timeline of events, character ages (which are significant), The Social War was not even mentioned. If you are looking for something to read over the weekend this will be great. If you want something to learn from and be entertained read McCoullough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like I was robbed","review":"It's my own fault for not reading any of these reader reviews first. Unfortunately I bought the entire Emperor series at once before opening this first book. By the time I hit Caesar as a teenager during Marius' third term as consul I knew I had garbage in my hands. Marius' third term was about 100BC, the same year Caesar was born. And Marius and Sulla each trying to force the other to march off to fight Mithridates is a complete reversal of the facts. I've never burned a book, but I might have a pile of them to burn now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible time-waster!","review":"I would have been willing to overlook the glaring historical inaccuracies in this book if the story had been engrossing and well written. But, life is too short to read something so trashy. As recommended by others, read the The First man in Rome series if you want historically accurate, well- written stories about interesting people."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted time","review":"I love reading of Rome, the Republic and the Empire. I dove into this book expecting a rehashing of the same story. I was wrong. Oh, so wrong. I am aghast at the historical inadequacies. This book is poison to those who want to read history, and poison to those who want to read adventure. Slow, stodgy, jumpy, and infantile. Iggulden is a lightweight, and should stick to romances. Once again, I have wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"no historical in this fiction","review":"When I heard that Bernard Cornwall gave this book a favirable revew I thought it might be a good historical fiction. How could I have known that Bernard Cornwall didn't read this book, he must not or else why would soil his name with this book. Outside of the names of the historical characters there was no historical accuracy in this book. This book should be labled as a fantasy not a historical novel. I have read many of the ancient sources and some of the modern ones, none of them resembled this in any way. For anyone who wants to read real historical novels on Ceaser read Colleen McCullough masters of Rome series instead of this tripe"},{"rating":"1","title":"an utter, inexcusable mess","review":"I'm a strong fan of historic fiction, but this book is the very antithesis of what historic fiction should be: it's not even sloppily researched, but simply not researched at all, making no attempt whatsoever to put the historical figures it uses as characters in anything like a reasonable or believable historical context. To cap it off, it's not wortwhile fiction even if you manage to totally ignore the historical counterparts of its characters -- no credible or interesting character development, no plot to hold any level of sustained interest, sloppy prose. I wish the stars-rating system allowed for negative numbers, because that's what this one would require."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written and historically inaccurate","review":"As an adult, I think this book was very badly written. The characters are stereotypical, and the story is not credible. This book reminds me of some of the bad fantasy books I used to read when I was younger (unlike excellent fantasy books like 'A Game of Thrones' which I can read today).If the book was well written, I could forgive it for being historically inaccurate. And it IS historically inaccurate. Iggulden seems to have taken some main events and names of famous historical personalities, and then created his own fictive world based on those events and names. The names of famous personalities are there. Their personalities and relatinships, however, are not. This fault of Iggulden's books seems all the more glaring today, when I can compare them to the excellent television series 'Rome'. This series shows that you CAN create a fascinating story while staying more true to historical facts than Iggulden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginning to a series!!!!","review":"I would recommend this novel to any person who enjoys reading historical fictions on ancient Rome. I have not been able to put this book down since I started reading it. Conn Iggulden is an awesome writer. I dont want to ruin the story for anyone interested in reading it, so I will just leave it at it being a story about two young men who changed the way Rome would have its politics in the future at a very changing time for Rome. The author is able to incorporate other major events and tie them in with the characters. One example is King Mithridates revolt over in Greece as well as Sulla, the first dictator in Rome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"I bought this book whilst waiting at an airport for 4 hours and was half way by the time I had to leave. I have read the second book as well. The roman theme some say is ovedone bit I still find it fascinating. I was motivated by this book to find a non-fiction book on the history of Rome and was impresssed with the close adaptation of real events, albeit with some poetic license. For those of you that enjoyed this one you may enjoy The Last Legion as well, although not quite as good as emperor. Both of these books have a sort of M. Night Shamayalan ending in which the penny drops which I really enjoy. A good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horray for Colleen McCullough!","review":"I totally agree with Mr McInerney's evaluation of 'Emperor : The Gates of Rome'. Mr Iggulden's sense of humour surely reaches a climax with the inclusion of a 'historical note'! He can't be serious. As an action story it may have its merits, but to pretend it follows the life of one of the ancient world's great figures is pure fantasy.I have a sinking feeling that this may be made into a movie! It does the memory of Julius Ceasar and all the other historical characters a diservice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction: Historical?","review":"As a history enthusiast, both of true historical text and historical fiction, I couldn't resist the subject matter of this novel. Unfortunately, it is wrought with a glaring list of historical innaccuracies. If the author researched any aspect of Roman history, he certainly didn't include the results in this novel. The idea presented within, of a young Gaius Julius Caesar, a patrician Roman, going to Rome with no concept of Roman law, government or its political system is implausible and ridiculous. If you enjoy a Huck Finn style story of two boys growing adventures then read this book and you might like it. If you are interested in historical fiction set in the Roman Republic/Empire, then read Colleen McCullough's \\"First Man in Rome\\" series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Read","review":"I found this book more irritating than anything else. First the history is grossly innacurate. After reading the Masters of Rome series, learning about the time of Marius and Caesar have become a hobby for me. I was delighted to find another book on this pet subject of mine, but right into the story I became derailed with young Caesar growing up on an estate, outside of Rome. Then it gets worse (Marius an uncle on his mother's side, in the walls of Rome and asking for a Triumph) Ungh! But I read on hoping that at least the story would be good, but I'm dissapointed in that too. Total let down, this book is supposedly the first in a series, usually something I read to the very last book, but not this time. Just too bad, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment with history","review":"I like to read historical fiction especially that covering the classical world. Therefore, I immediately picked up a copy of Emperor: The Gates of Rome. It is the story of the young Julius Caesar and Marcus, destined to be great Romans. While the story of two young Roman boys had some appeal, I was disappointed by the lack of historicity in both the details of Julius' life and background and in the depiction of Roman culture and society. As only two examples, in this book Marius is Julius' uncle through his mother Aurelia and a Roman magistrate walks through the Forum attended by a single lictor carrying the fasces with an ax and the magistrate is said to have instant power of life or death over Roman citizens. While historical facts are often modified in historical fiction for the sake of the story or for simplicity, rarely are they so fully overthrown. For a fictional story of the young Julius, Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series is much better done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Fiction .... Indeed","review":"I bought this book at the airport and had low expectations... the book was even worse. It is set in Roman times but the writer has a boy state 'Tubruk says I am growing like corn.'

I borrowed it from a friend a few years back and decided to read it again, so I bought through Amazon. The story is fun and paints a great picture of life in Rome. You follow two young boys through their journey into adulthood. The characters are great and each brings a very distinct persona to the story. I plan to continue reading the series.If you enjoy exciting books, action movies (especially Gladiator), or the Roman Empire time period, then you will probably like this book.

I tried playing music on my comp and the only way to make it sound close to decent is adjusting the sound using an EQ. The sound was just as bad when I tried watching a DVD. The sub made each characters voice sound like \\"burr burr burrr\\". Avoid buying these speakers. I will be returning mine as soon as possible. Invest in some better quality ones.

I use Bose Noise Canceling headphones and had to wrap tape around the cord in order to thicken it, so the Zalman mic would actually attach.2.

To compare I have been using a Sennheiser PC-161 headset since 2008 and since the Sennheiser was starting to fall apart, I decided to get the Zalman and pair it with my Grado SR80. While the mic is easy enough to clip on, my contacts on Skype told me that they couldn't hear a thing I said and that there was too much background noise despite the fact that I used the Zalman in a very quiet room.I tried keeping the mic at different distances but that didn't help much either and I ended up sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This mic does not work period, at least mine doesn't. It barely picks up any sound at all, I tried varying distances and tried changing the volume of my voice. I messed around with the mic boost and any other mic settings I can possible find in my computer. Basically to hear any sound picking up, I have to almost put the mic in my mouth and yell in it. It picks up voice barely and is full of static. My old mic works perfectly, so for the time being I'm holding up my broken headset with a still functioning mic attached to it. This product is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"really poor","review":"I picked this microphone up as I am going from Gaming Headsets to high-fi headsets that do not have microphones. I found this microphone to be very poor at picking up your voice unless you tape it near your mouth. I ended up looping it over my ear and having it hang to the left side of my mouth, but I am in the market for a acceptable microphone. Unfortunately there are no real good options for \\"clip on\\" or something that would work with headphones. It looks like a desktop microphone is the only microphone that will give me good quality performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic mic for the price/style","review":"I got this microphone because of all the good reviews it got. Some people say people can't hear them, etc. This is true until you turn up the mic volume and give it boost. You have to go into your Realtek HD settings for the microphone. Once in there, check all the noise, echo, directional suppression boxes. Then it will ask to calibrate and you have to read some sentences. Put the meter to about 40. Also in the settings there is a mic boost option. I used it all the way to the +30 decibals. Now, the mic works excellent and is a tolerable level and sounds very clear. Make sure you at least check echo suppression if you don't do the others, otherwise you will just hear static. But for the price this mic rocks. Beware the cord is double the length of a twin size bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"realized a little too late..","review":"PROS: Plug and play set up. Good sound quality for it's price.CONS: The notch you slide wires into for mic placement is a preset width, and too big for my headphone wires.

It's a mic, it works fairly well, not too quiet, not too loud. The cord is nice and long, but a bit thin, I can see it getting smashed or breaking if you're too rough with it, but it's acceptable for an item of this price. It paired nicely with my Audio Technica ATH-M50. I slid the cord inside the coiled part, and clipped the mic to the straight part for a '1 piece' setup.I'd rate it a 5, but the cord is just too thin for a perfect 5, so 4 it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but doesnt attach to my wires","review":"The clip is non adjustable so it does not attach to any of my headphone cables.

I cannot recommend it at all. It does set up and function as advertised, it's incredibly easy to use and comes with enough wire to rewire a full PA system, but it sounds like trash. It picks up sounds only about 4-6\\" from the aperture and is so fiercely directional that it's nearly useless. If this mic were used on a boom, as with a headset, it would be fine. But, attached to a cable on a headphone or a lapel, it is an exercise in frustration.Beyond the mic's insistence to be placed inside the speaker's mouth for optimal pickup, the sound quality is \\"poor\\" at best and \\"wholly unacceptable\\" at worst. I've tweaked every setting imaginable to get it to work acceptably but no dice.I would return it, but honestly, it's not worth the hassle for $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensitive?","review":"Not happy with this one. For starters the clip on it is a real pain; it attaches only to fatter cables and is poorly designed.My real problem though is that the sensitivity of the mic is absolutely horrid. I planned to use this mic as part of my main online gaming rig but the quality has me saving it as a fallback.I would have liked to use my Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones with this but have since ordered the Plantronics GameCom 777 headset. One set of wires makes me MUCH happier also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Mic","review":"As soon as i opened the box, i knew this was going to be a waste of my time.But i wanted to disprove my theory and i immediately tried these out.As i was testing them, i realized the only way i could be heard ingame and inskype,Aim,etc. was if i hold the microphone RIGHT NEXT to my mouth.

It is very light and mobile, unlike bulky microphones. Great for gaming or making calls via instant messaging clients. Sound quality is great!

I bought this mic with those headphones after going threw a few amount of \\"gaming headsets\\" you know the kind with built in mics and all. I had a few of those and they just kept breaking, so I thought time to buy some audio headphones but my problem was I needed a mic so I found this one on Amazon the reviews were decent so I bought it. Now it's 2011 2 years later and this mic is still kicking it like the day I bought it sounds good on skype and in games. Only problem with it is the cord is very thin but hasn't been a problem for me. So if you're like me and finally done with \\"gaming headphones\\" and want some real headphones and mic I can recommend this and I'll also recommend the HD-555."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading product","review":"if you thought you could convert your standard headphones into one with a mic simply attached, you were wrong. The clip doesn't fit the standard headphone or earbud cord thickeness. Instead, i had to duc-tape them so they'd attach.

The quality is easily 4/5 stars and the price is 5/5. So I'm voting it as a 5/5 product. You can't beat this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid mic with minor flaws","review":"This is a fairly unique design, latching on to an existing headphones to replicate a headset while giving you open headphone choices. Compared to a standing desk mic, it takes up a lot less space, and picks up far less background noise since it goes right next to your head.The sound quality is pretty good, although I wouldn't call it perfect and professional, it works fine for casual VOIP use.Unfortunately for me, my current headphone cable is pretty thin, so getting the mic to actually clip on is a bit of a challenge. This can make it a bit frustrating to use, but it would be a non-issue with a majority of headphones. The mic's cable is also way too long for typical use, make sure you keep the twist tie it comes with handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Audio","review":"We were trying to use this on a PC. Even with a mic boost in the audio control panel this unit has very low audio and is basically unusable for our purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"This thing is no a clip on mic. It attaches to your headphone's wire. This would be fine if the mic picked up any sound from more than 2 inches from your mouth when you talk directly into it. When i hold it at my mouth its actually quite nice. When I clip it onto my wire it BARELY picks up any sound at all. Unless you have some sort of configuration where this mic is pointing directly at you and is within a couple inches of your mouth then this thing is complete garbage. I am very disappointed with this mic. Very disappointed. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect microphone","review":"The microphone is just perfect beside the cord is a bit too long.

The problem is that it doesn't last. I've owned two of these microphones now, and both have died within about a month of use. Unless you're in the market for disposable microphones, it's probably worth paying a little more to find a mic that will last longer than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mic, gotta change the settings","review":"This is a great mic for the price, just know you will have to go into the settings and turn the gain way up if you want anyone to be able to hear you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mic","review":"I got a new pair of cans but sadly they didn't have a mic and found this. This mic comes with three little clips on the wire and a big one with the mic so your headphones and mic can kind of stick together. It doesn't seem like I can move them, but they're evenly placed so it's good enough. After I plugged them in, I did a Skype test call, a steam chat test, and a few others. At first, it sounded terrible but after adjusting some mic settings, they're perfect! Make sure to raise your sample rate and possibly add some microphone boost. After adjusting those settings, my voice sounded crystal clear. I have the mic placed about 6 inches on my headphone wire, i'd estimate about 8 inches away from my mouth. The mic is able to pick up my voice very clearly and I'm very satisfied.A little bonus is that I have my TV about 8 feet away and the mic doesn't pick up the sounds from the TV.Overall, this is an excellent mic and a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I bought these to clip on my new headphones, go look somewhere else, honestly it was a waste of $13. The \\"clip\\" is pathetic and doesn't clip on anywhere that you can be heard from, the inline clips won't fit over anything bigger than it's chord, and it's chord is frighteningly skinny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, poor design","review":"For home usage and other relatively quiet locations, this microphone is wonderful. It catches your voice perfectly; arguably better than some built in microphones.**One note of caution**The part that attaches to the cable is for thick cables, probably around 7mm or so. It fits well with large cables, but for those thin double cables (Like the one Bose uses), it will not fit. I resolved this by using the plastic housing that connects the place where the double cables seperate as the point of connection with the Zalman.Nevertheless, you don't really need it attached on the cable. I do just fine keeping it on the desk in front of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for PC users, not so great for Xbox 360.","review":"Works great when using with a computer. Voice clarity is excellent as long as you don't use it in a noisy environment.The primary reason I bought this was to hook it up to my Astro A40 Mix-Amp for when I'm playing Xbox 360, but as I found out, I needed to talk abnormally loud for other players to hear me clearly. I consider my voice to be average, so people with quiet voices definitely shouldn't buy this for if they plan on using it with an Xbox.I'm only going to take of 1 star for this because it performs extremely well when used with a PC or Mac, which I also use it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"I use this mic to play games with friends.

I was previously using a 50 dollar turtle beach headset, and had bought a decent pair of standalone headphones, so I needed a clip-on mic. This was the recommended one. The first words out of my ventrilo buddies mouths were \\"What the heck is wrong with your mic??\\" I played around with the settings in vent, and in windows for a good hour before giving up, and just plugged in the turtle beach headsets microphone. So many of the reviews on here give this thing such high praise, so maybe it was something with my settings, or that my mic. was bad.

Then it broke within a month. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Wanted a mic that I could clip onto my Q701's and stumbled upon the Zalman. My main use for it is Skype, and to a lesser extend, online games. While the mic does clip onto my headphone wire securely, that is about all it does well. The mic itself does not pic up sound very well, I felt like I was always having to yell into in. The sound quality is also pretty lackluster(fuzzy speech and lots of background noise). To top things off, after a about 2 months of light use the mic randomly became ultra sensitive and as was reverberating sound like a mofo, even with sensitivity set to the lowest. In light of this I threw it away. Some people say you get what you pay for however before this mic I used a 10$ desktop mic that lasted 3 years, while the Zalman only lasted through 2 months of use. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zalman Zm-Mic1 X2","review":"This review is being done after the second Zalman mic has died. I say died because the first one acquired a problem just after the mic to pc adapter causing no sound other than static during use. Now the second replacement for that mic has succumbed to the same fate, the mic jack has developed the same problem. I know what you're thinking, what about your setup? The microphone is plugged in the rear of my PC tower, and has nothing but gravity pulling on the cord. No trauma could have caused this issue due to the use of a cord manager.The sound quality prior to this inevitable problem was decent and served it's purpose quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality mic, would not recommend","review":"The plastic connector is meant for a certain wire gauge, no larger than what you would find on the generic headphones you receive with an iPod.This microphone is very cheap (thought this as a pro at first, not a con) and has proved extremely difficult to use. It never seems to want to pick up my voice no matter how sensitive I make it. I would not recommend this product to anyone wanting to communicate with another human as this seems impossible. YES I have tried (for several hours) to set up this microphone, including taking advice from the other reviews. I may have received a defective product but it's really not worth sending back for only 8 dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mic :)","review":"This mic is absolutely amazing. Before I used my turtle beaches headset for my PC, and many told me I was too loud over it or they could hear my game coming through my microphone.

It's worth it if you need a mic and want something that works. The settings are really low (sensitivity-wise) when you first get it, but that's nothing you can't change in windows microphone settings. They worked very well with my \\"light\\" Sony headphones, but they did't work well with my ATH-AD700's. I tried multiple times to clip it on, since my cable is thick, and I almost broke the mic clip. I ended up returning it and getting another mic to attach onto the side of my headphones. Overall, a great deal for a microphone. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely not \\"High Sensitivity\\"","review":"I bought these with ATH-AD700 headphones hoping to get a good microphone that will clip onto the wire. I clipped it onto the wire and tested it out to see how it sounded. To my surprise I couldn't hear it all. I figured maybe it was drivers or something in the Windows settings. It's honestly just not picking up my voice. So I figured I'd just try holding it up to my mouth with my hand and try it out. Putting it right up to my mouth made it sound like I was whispering from 10 meters away. I increased the microphone volume in WIndows and it STILL was barely picking up my voice, let alone enough to understand what I was saying. To me this mic is truly unusable. It deserves to be labelled as a \\"low sensitivity\\" microphone because of how bad it is at picking up my voice at a normal speaking volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"Purchased this mic as recommended from getting the KOSS SB40 headset, 1st day the 1st mic worked perfectly, the next day the mic did not work at all, yet the headset mic still worked, although the fishbowl sound was very much present. I requested a replacement. Amazon sent the replacement overnight! When I plugged in the second mic, it did not work at all! Returning for a refund!DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY WITH THIS MIC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Find something better","review":"Thing is like 20 feet long, and the clip is retarded. The pictures make it look sick, but it's not. It's hard to clip on, it's not even a clip. It's just a gap of plastic where you have to jam your headphone cord or whatever in between it. If your cord isn't thick enough, fold it and try again. It's a piece of s***t really is what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly low quality","review":"\\"Incredibly high quality\\" seems to be completely subjective. The sound quality is so low it's practically useless. If I hold it directly in front of my face I am mostly understandable, but while clipped onto the cord I am infuriatingly incomprehensible -- and I have modified all possible sound settings.I will be using my 15-year old, $5 desk mic instead of this. Extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought this for use with my Sennheiser headphones. Sensitivity is not \\"high\\" by any definition, the gain has to be maxed in Windows to pick up anything at a reasonable level. After doing this though, the quality is acceptable for the price. The problem I had was that the cord fell out of the earbuds, after a week a of light use. Totally broken unless I feel like splicing some wires back together. Junk, don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Mic","review":"I must say I should have made the move to a standalone mic sooner. I've always been disappointed with the mics on gaming headsets and especially cheap skype headsets. Bleh. But this is a perfect solution.The mic picks up voice well, no audible background noise even though I am in a slightly noisy environment. Cable is quite long. I love separating the mic and speaker systems, since now I can get some high-end headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great microphone for the price","review":"I bought this after reading reviews of previous customers. I have to say the reviews are spot on. This microphone does NOT have any kind of noise cancelling and will pick up every sound. It does have an extremely long cord, which I think is both good and bad. The next thing I want to note, is that the clip on it seems a little pointless. It doesn't have a hinge and therefore just the bending of the plastic holds it onto whatever other cord. My headset happens to have a very thin cord on it, and therefor I can't get it to hang on, not even if I double the cord around it. Keep this in mind when buying the mic. I just hold it in my hand while talking to others. I want to end on a good note though, the sound quality is excellent, and it far exceeded my expectations at such a low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy mic for laptops to use VoIP while traveling.","review":"I was looking for a very compact and light solution to allow me to use VoIP while traveling. I was happy with a headset with mic, but it was bulky to pack and keep in my laptop bag, so I wanted something that could complement earbuds.The Zalman mic has worked well, with no complaints about audio quality. I would recommend two enhancements: a shirt clip (instead of the current wire clips which assume a larger headphone cord than my earbuds have), and a mute switch.Otherwise, it packs very compactly and is a good value.BTW, you could use the laptop's built-in mic, but then it would be super annoying when you typed or otherwise touched the computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Used to talk to other gamers by clipping it onthe cord of HD555 headphones, nobody could hearme. I kept moving the cable to bring the micto my mouth.I now use a 25 year old boom micIdentical to the \\"Jensen Desktop Boom Mic\\"Amazon sales for $5.2 stars because I'm sure I can one daytape it to the end of a stick and itbe useful (seriously)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mic, cheap","review":"Not a professional quality mic, but great for skyping and in-game voice chat. I had less background noise complaints with this mic than previous ones.Shipping originally said two weeks, arrived in two days, so that was nice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done","review":"This mic is simple and basic, to say the least. It does an excellent job as picking up my voice, but granted you will have to tweak your soundcard settings. For most people using onboard audio (Realtek), be sure to put the Mic Boost to about 20%.As for the mic itself, I have it clipped to the cord of my Audio Technica ATH-AD700. The \\"clip\\" is not a clip...its just a wedge of plastic, so if the cord of your headphones is thin, you'll have to jimmy-rig it a bit to make it work.Lastly, buy some velcro cable ties if you plan on using this with headphones to make a headset. The cord is ridiculously long and will need to be coiled around the headphone cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for recording and voip","review":"i purchased this microphone in lieu of getting an actual gaming headset. works incredibly well, great pickups and clear sound, but finding a place to mount it can be difficult. usually tacking it onto my shirt works, but sometimes that isn't the most convenient. i've also used this in recording videos instead of the one in my camera already, and it is very good at picking up sounds. great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got broken first days","review":"I didnt like this item from the first day but I was too busy to deal with a return. The thing is it doesnt clip as I thought it would be. I thought it will stay on my collar easily but no, it kept falling off. I don't know if that is why it is faulty from very beginning or if it came faulty. It works for sometime fine then I realize people dont hear me anymore. Very frustrating. Be aware I guess that it is not very portable if you don't like to keep it in your hand and it breaks easily"},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"I would not call this a chair cushion....it is much too small..more like a minature pillow, for children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cushion??

Some parts I just didn't get, even after rereading the section 2 or 3 times. For example, there was some dialogue about Kay's last name towards the end of the book, but it made no sense and didn't seem to have anything to do with the plot.I was also frustrated because the investigators summarized the logistics of the murder at the end, but I just could not follow the logic. Furthermore, the explanation was not backed up by evidence, it was just Morse's rambling.I prefer a more organized and evidence-supported explanation of the crime. In mysteries I like, I found myself wanting to reread the entire story to spot the clues as they unfold, but not in this case. Sorry Mr. Dexter."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic CD","review":"I saw this band at the Bug Jar in Rochester, NY. They ROCKED. Playing as a 3 piece, they made a smallish sound system sound great.

I guess Pillsbury sold alot of muffins!The only gripes I have are that there is no bonus material (interviews, behind the scenes photos, booklet, etc.) and that, because they are in black & white, all four shows could have fit on one DVD.A must have for any Beatles fan![DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something only a Beatles fan would enjoy","review":"I purchased this set expressly for the segment featuring Gordon and Sheila MacRae's take-off on \\"The Garry Moore Show,\\" which I found to be silly and not nearly as good as I had read about in my research.

This is not the way the shows were meant to be seen, and certainly not the way I want to watch them. (This carries over to numerous genres, as well. I don't want a DVD of World Series highlights. I want the whole games!)Sofa/GoodTimes has maintained these four shows intact, including both the good and the bad acts....and even including the commercials!!! They should be congratulated for the former and applauded for the latter.The video varies in quality.

Firstly, the extras are just bogus. The excercises are isolated and you can slow them down which in my opinion is poorly done. Most importantly, the sound is for the most part distorted and there are several points where the sound actually cuts out. It seems to me as if this is the work of irresponsible, lazy technicians who transferred this to DVD who clearly were not listening to what they were doing.

However, strange as it may sound, I find Yannick Rieu's tenor saxophone slightly distracting...and I prefer Christian Vander's jazz trio (sans saxophone) to this augmented Quartet version.Still, you can never go wrong with Christian Vander, and I would never part with this CD.

Unfortunately, the beeping of the digital console is WAY TOO LOUD and requires WAY TOO MANY beeps to do anything. For example, to do 2 slices of toast, it requires more than 7 button beeps to do that (and that's without pre-heating so the toast won't be done right anyway). These beeps are much louder and \\"cheaper\\" sounding than my oven and microwave and my dog runs out of the house every time I tried using it.I contact DeLonghi Customer Support. The beeping cannot be turned off and the volume cannot be turned down. Also, the presets (e.g. 4 slices of toast at level 4) cannot be changed.I don't understand why DeLonghi does not improve the software in these devices. I'm sending mine back..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little toaster oven","review":"This toaster serves all our needs of toasting, warming and baking of small dish's.

We liked it at first (the beeping signaling your toast is done is very loud and annoying) but within a few uses, the \\"mode\\" writing on the toast button, came off. After another week, the display starting shorting out on a daily basis. I called DeLonghi's thinking I could exchange it since we got it a month ago. They were nice but said I would have to take it to a service center to get it fixed or ship it to one. I would have to wait for them to fix it (no charge other than potential shipping) and then be out of a toaster oven while they fixed it. It just didn't ring good customer service since it's practically brand new. I would recommend buying an oven from a company that at least has a decent exchange/warranty and won't fall apart after just a few uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"overly complicated and slow","review":"too complicated, requires 3 steps every time you want to make toast and always reverts to its presets which are too dark"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven cooking","review":"I was dissapointed in this DeLonghi product since most are decent performers.

After just a little more than a year the handle came loose on one side. Called DeLonghi and I am out of luck because it is out of warranty and no one will talk to me on how to get to the screw to tightened it back up, it is behind the glass. Hey for a $130.00 toaster oven it should be an easy fix not something that takes an expert to get to a screw to fix it, nor something a person should have to send it in to get fixed. Not happy with this purchase!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, especially considering it was for a college course","review":"The book was very entertaining. I'm sure that some out there who are hard and fast attached to the classic versions of Greek mythology would feel at odds with Renault's rendition of the classic Theseus tale, but this is a quality read and a very interesting look into what life in the bronze age may have been like. Renault incorporates many aspects of the Minoan/Mycenean culture that should allow even readers familiar with the historical documentation of the period to encounter new images and expanded cultural possibilities. I was very pleased with the read, and the delivery of the product was timely and as promised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative retelling","review":"A very imaginative retelling of the Theseus and the Minotaur myth.

By reading writers as wonderful as Ms. Renault!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful reworking of Greek mythology","review":"Renault has a marvelous way of combining modern sensibility with mythological wonder. She narrates with an empirical, 20th-century eye, but interprets from an ancient perspective. Her recreation of the Theseus' myth is very believable.Advice to younger readers: Learn the Bullfinch version of the story first, then read the book. Renault offers an excellent lesson on interpretation, but might be confusing otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A modernized \\"Cliff Notes\\" version of the ancient tale","review":"The author's work came up frequently by amazon.com's recommendation service, as historical fiction is my favorite entertainment-reading genre. But I must say that despite all of the positive reviews of this work, I was quite disappointed. I only managed to finish it the second time I picked-up the book. Now that I have, I was left with a sense of being letdown. I got no sense of the Achaian, Minyan, or Cretan cultures, nor did I feel anything for any of the characters. I almost felt as though I was reading a modernized \\"Cliff Notes\\" version of the ancient tale. While the modernization of the story of Theseus seemed quite plausible, this was the only real innovation of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was very difficult to get through.","review":"While I have not read Mary Renaults other books, I heard nothing but great reviews for this one. I struggled through the first three books, waiting for the point when I would get absorbed in the book and not want to put it down. Instead, when I reached Crete, I found myself confused and not willing to read more. Spurred on by other people's forceful recommendations, I read Crete and found it a little more entertaining . However, if you want to read the myth of Theseus, I recommend skipping this book, and reading the shorter version included in the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book was VERY hard to follow!","review":"this book was very confusing for me,i had to do a report on it and i was so lost. ....thanx!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought NEW PAPERBACK novel, and received an OLD USED HARDCOVER novel!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Dear International Books Return Department,I just wanted to let you know how disappointed I am in this company.

I bought a new paper back, and I receive a hardcover used old book with markings in them. I have been waiting for this book for about a week and I was very disappointed. Anyone who sees this book knows its old and I am not to take advantage of. Please put this book in the old section and not new, as anyone can tell that this book is very old with the aged brown pages with underlines in them, so it means someone has used it. Very insulted!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow, Too Dull, Too Boring","review":"The King Must Die; Greek Mythology's Theseusis transformed into a 300 page bore by Mary Renault. I am a fairy smart 9th grader who reads at a very advanced level. However, no matter how hard I tried, I could not understand anything this book talked about. It would drag on about how he is so-and-so's kid for pages, and then introduce new characters no one has ever heard of, throw in a battle or two, and boom--one page later, it talks about being so-and-so's son again. If you want my advice, read this book if you have to for school(like me) or if you are very bright, able to remember all of the characters, like greek mythology, and have a few months to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book was horrible","review":"This book was the boring account of a great myth.

If you are going to read it...Dont."},{"rating":"1","title":"another one bites the dust","review":"One after another the great myths fall to a writer who tries to melodramatize, and tune them up. In this story the great tale of Theseus is butchered. I really can not see how such a great story can be shreded to nonsense. Honestly, LEAVE ALL THE CLASSICS ALONE. You will NEVER be able to make them any beter than they already are. With that said now I will move onto the actual book. Bad writing PERIOD. The writing is a stab at being origional, but it is way too choppy. And at some times this book actually became boring. As the book went on, the boerdom streaks became more common. WOW, HOW DOES ONE MAKE A GREAT TALE BORING,.....MAGIC.By the way, if you disagree with me, then you are wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Set me on fire","review":"This book was assigned to me in English class as a college Freshman. One of the best books I have ever read, and I've read it more than once. Not only is it a classic in English Literature, but the story itself is inspiring and touches the soul.

That is why I was intrigued by this book. Lion Brand Yarns has expanded their lines in recent years to include nearly every kind of furry, fuzzy, and bulky concoction one could ever think of. While I think these designs can be funky and fun, the book offers very little in terms of classic styles that will last the test of time.Many other scarf/accessory books have come out in the past few months--offering prettier and more classic styles. Check some of these out before jumping in and purchasing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book....","review":"I have recently started knitting and this was my 2nd knitting book purchase. Lion Brand yarn has won me over and I did not even notice this was a book by them... The nice thing about this book is that it provides patterns for the very beginner to the very advanced; I like this because it is a book I will be able to refer back to when I become 'advanced'! The pictures are great and they give you a good idea on how the pattern will turn out. The patterns included in the book do not seem too hard to follow either. I have already finished one out of the book and I am eager to start more.Another great thing about this book, is how they will provide the same pattern for individuals who knit and crochet. This is great because many knitters like to learn how to crochet, and visa versa, so it is a book that will be on someone's shelf for awhile-- and mine will be one of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More towards knitting","review":"I bought this book but I did not really read carefully, this book has knitting, and more knit than crochet and the crocheted scarve are nothing worth looking at, yarn they use not as nice as the knit.

His hard rockin' vocals and guitar meld awesomely with the chanting.

There's plenty of variety in the songs to keep you comin' back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There Done That","review":"Combine Enigma, Dead Can Dance, and a cheap NIN knockoff and you have a VAST piece of junk. The monk chant usages is passe as are all the songs on this album. 10 years ago this would have been inovative, but today it just marks the end of a generation of industrial/electronic music, with poor music and equally unoriginal lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another 1 song and done CD","review":"I really like the opening track \\"Here\\". The rest of the CD is terrible! It was disappointing to find out that the rest of the CD isn't good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard It Done Before","review":"First and foremost the production on this CD is fantastic, right up their with NIN's The Fragile. But like The Fragile, the music/songs do not go anywhere. It seems as though Jon Crosby is holding himself back lyrically and musically; too bad really because he appears to have tremendous talent that is unfocused. The vocals are derivative/reminiscent of Jim Morrison/Bono and the samples are the same ones heard on records by Enigma(I'm Dying)/The God Machine(Touched). The music and rhythms heard on this album are the same ones WE have all heard before.The cello on \\"Flames\\" is the only redeeming musical statement on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sampling????","review":"I found out about this musician (VAST) from the soundtrack of \\"Step Into Liquid\\". I instantly recognized the vocals on the song \\"Touched\\" as those of Le Mystere de Voix Bulgares. The song being sampled is \\"Polegnala E Pschenitza\\". The CD is also named Le Mystere de Voix Bulgares. The entire collection is really beautiful. I saw them live in Brooklyn in '94 and was deeply moved by it.I don't think that VAST's sampling of Le Mystere's vocals generates an entirely original song even given it's \\"rock\\" context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and haunting","review":"There's no way to put the sound of this into any genre.

That NEVER happens to me. When I took it home and played it, I was blown away. The sheer power of emotion on this album is overwhelming. I listened to it over and over, literally every day for months. Very rarely do I come across an album this magnetic. VAST seamlessly melds elements of electronic-edged rock (�� la Stabbing Westward) with obscure and interesting samples that conjure images of Moby's Play (an Eastern European women's choir, a prison chain gang, and who can forget the monks?). It's hard to pick a favorite from this fabulous record. The CD is best heard from start to finish, and then over and over again until you're wailing along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music At Its Finest!","review":"This CD has an excellent style of music which I have found to be liked by many people. Friends that I have introduced to this band have loved every song on this CD as well as their CD \\"Music For People\\". The style of the music is unlike any I have heard before, appealing to age groups from teenagers to adaults. The vocals and the band mix perfectly to give and eerie feeling in one song but then the next track can give you and total opposite.

From his initial demo to this major release, his music has always had raw emotion that rang with honesty and depth, strengthed by talent, creativity, and an incredible voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first, the best","review":"To those just taking interest in the band VAST, IMHO this is Jon Crosby's best album, though Music for people is not bad at all. The album titled \\"Vast\\" is by New Clear Sky. so do not be confused if it comes up in the same search. The third album from VAST is on the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensory Overload","review":"This is absolutely one of the best albums ever; Jon Crosby puts out an amazing first effort here in Visual Auditory Sensory Theater. The overall feel of this record is melancholic lyrics wrapped up in beautiful music; the string arrangements combined with NIN-ish musings and Crosby's gorgeous voice make for an extremely different record. The song \\"I'm Dying\\" displays an impressive gregorian monk chorus that fit the faith-questioning lyrics. \\"Dirty Hole\\" is also an interesting track; the slow pace at the beginning picks up and culminates when Crosby shouts, \\"How many men have died in your dirty hole?\\". Another amazing song is \\"Touched\\", a song that just defines so many relationships; it starts out brillantly with just an acoustic guitar and his voice. Overall this album is one of the most interesting records i have ever heard and it is the cd that made me a long-time VAST fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Brilliance","review":"I was shocked the first time I listen to this album.

It's also a good size. However, after washing it with warm water just a few times, the coating on it has started to peel - which I think is a hazard for small children. The brush also cracked - I don't know if that's also from washing (like other reviewers have said) or because my toddler has thrown it on the floor a couple of times.

The only downside is the quality. When I received it, I washed the bristles in luke warm water and mild soap and dried it, bristle side down, overnight. The next day, I found the wood warped and cracked in two places. I had to return it and didn't bother to exchange it because I figured they would all do that. I read in another person's review that this had happened to theirs too but figured that it was just that particular brush or that they didn't follow the washing instructions properly, but it's actually the brush itself.

The brush and comb set looks lovely and I was happy when I received it. The instructions on the label say to wash the brush and comb before using. So I followed these instructions very carefully, as I had read other reviews which stated that cracks appeared in the wood after washing them. Sadly, as others had reported, the brush got two huge cracks and the material covering the wood is peeling off. I definitely won't be using this on a newborn and can't recommend this product. I sent it back to Amazon; should have paid more attention to others' reviews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked after following instructions before we got to use it!","review":"I have never been so disappointed in a product or in the customer service I received from amazon.

Finally I think she has enough hair to brush! I followed the package instructions, which said to wash with warm soapy water before initial use, and the brush warped, flaked, and cracked in half!I reported the issue to amazon and they refused to do anything because the return period had expired.Buyer beware!

I enjoy putting myself into the mindset of past times, it gives life to cultural history, plus the scratchy hollowness and distortion of old records creates a pleasing gothic effect. Together with old religious recordings ones for children are my favorite and I've wished for a CD just like this one for a long time. There's nothing I would change about this CD. The selection is excellent. The mood it creates is so effective that I first heard it on Halloween when someone used it to create atmosphere for trick-o-treaters!

He takes a little bit from the West and a little bit from the East and just sprinkles liberally. The resulting concoction is offered as an advanced manual of the Great Work. The first virtue of the path is discrimination. The serious seeker must learn to recognize what will be of benefit and what will not. I must say that I found this book to be rather ordinary.

The author has a limited understanding of spiritual alchemy of which he bases the entire book on the Hebrew Kabalah. True spiritual alchemy is Egyptian in origin.

The difference between this and other alchemical literature is that the 'Tower of Alchemy' reveals rather than conceals the meaning of the subject. Particularly useful is the comparison to Eastern techniques, revealing a similar system which is used there. Rational and informative.

I was not familiar with this book, but a friend asked me about it. If you carefully read all these reviews, you see most of the reviewers who give their names excoriate the book as pretentious, worthless, or worse, but strangely, a number of anonymous reviews by \\"A reader\\" praise it as indispensible, the best book ever written, etc. It is so painfully obvious that those reviews are shills (look at how closely some of them are dated) that even though I haven't read this book, I'm about 90% sure the other reviewers are probably right.

There is a long segment on Thailand tacked on the beginning for some reason and the narration is flat. The dvd cuts abruptly from location to location.The only reason we still have this DVD is that my 3-year old, who was adopted from Vietnam, requests it periodically.

The production value is minimal and poor. Ms. Bassey's performance is unimpressive. She seems tired and bored, no patter with the audience, just cranking out the next song.

The selection of cuts is excellent. This CD has its own atmosphere since the first minute you put it on. Dark, but not depressing. Slow, but not boring. It will keep your mind busy, but not too much.

It's definitely a chill album and if you've heard \\"close the door,\\" their full length album, you know the territory they're delving into.

If it's so effective, then let's have the scientific evidence that shows its efficacy. Most books written by psychologists are written on the basis of the result of years of scientific research that use accepted research methods. This book is written on the \\"promise\\" of studies that might be done \\"someday\\" and nothing but excuses for why there are yet to be any proper studies. Sorry, but I don't have time or money to waste on \\"promises\\" as there are many, many promises that never come to fruition. At this point, this promise isn't science. It's snake oil.

Whether you are new to the concept of energy medicine, or an advanced practitioner, I am sure you will find much valuable information in this book.

Instead, I suggest the older out-of-print \\"Schaum's Outline of Finite Mathematics\\" published in 1994 by the same author. That book covers a more appropriate set of mathematical topics geared towards the student of finance. Also, there are not the numerous errors in that older outline that seem to plague this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for review only","review":"In my opinion this book should be use for review only, and not for learning Finite math.

Mostly they look like a record, with series of lines between the information. Burning the same information on another disc type doesn't produce this & the disc is playable.If the price goes well under 18.00/100 than it may be worth throwing 1/4 of them into a landfill (sarcastic).

This has got to be the WORST LucasArts game out there, besides the fact that they all are really horrible. The game has no real objective, besides get the bounty on an alien, while shooting five hundred others that look exactly alike. The gameplay is like a broken record.1st, you scan an alien.2nd you capture him dead or alive.3rd repeat the process for 18 levels, while being blasted by dozens of other aliens that don't die until they have about fifty red hot laser beams in them.I really fooled myself buying this without renting it first...I wasted --- dollars on a game that isn't worth two.

Do not buy this game, unless you like to be driven to the nearest padded room in a white coat..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Game!","review":"Despite what others have said, I believe that this is one of the best Star Wars games ever created. First of all, who wouldn't want to have a jetpack and suit of armor covered in cool gadgets. I love the gameplay. It's pretty classic shoot-em-up, Star Wars style. The only downsides are the animation, while still excellent, is not on par with other games, such as Rouge Leader. Also, the levels are very long with no way to save in the midst of playing. Otherwise, I love this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Graphics and Gameplay","review":"This game is utterly terrible. They could have made this game so much more better. Instead of actually getting credits to buy possibly different items, your credits are turned into secret pictures which is terrible. Every bounty you get will reveal a different concept art piece, so basicly it ruins the bounty part of the game with an also bad storyline and plot. I would stick to either Metroid Prime or RE and RE0, which are much better combat games. This game also had bad camera angles so unless you are some person who likes to look at pictures and a comic book don't buy this game. There is 0 replay value too which adds to this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is The Real Review!","review":"This Games Blows because it's so logical.

I'm Jango, the Fett!","review":"I'll keep this short, Bounty Hunter was a really great game for it's time. Compared to games now, the graphics are nothing to write home about and the storyline could've used some touching up, but in the grand scheme of things, this game is still a lot of fun to play. I originally owned it for PS2 until someone stole the console from me. I ordered the Gamecube version and it arrived ahead of schedule and in good condition. Overall, it's a fun concept to run around tying people up with your wrist cable and dragging them around. The game play does get a bit repetitive, but if you enjoy Star Wars as much as I do, then you're so immersed in what you're doing that it doesn't bother me too much. I gave it 4 stars simply because it's an older game and because of the slight repetitious nature of the game itself. Final Rating: B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun","review":"Star wars bounty hunter is really fun. There is noting better then scaning a bounty, flying at him with a jetpack, and then deciding weather you want him dead or alive? The game has trully spectacular cut scenes provided by ilm (industrial light and magic)The music is classic john williams, and the sound effects are pretty great. I just love fighting 5, 10, or 15 guys at once and killing them all. By the way there is many diffrent ways to take care of your foes. Including toxic darts(1 hit k.o)a flamethrower and duel blasters. This game is really fun you have to be dumb to hate this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jango Fett does it again!","review":"This is the best game I have ever played! Why?

So if you have the money........BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"Looking at the promotions and reviews of the game, I decided to purchase it and unfortunately it was a huge dissapointment.

The films plot evolves around an undercover FBI agent (Segal -- of course!) who gets busted with a stolen car (just a cover) with his criminal friend (Ja Rule). Their sent to the pen and soon after the pen is taking over by a group of 'terrorist?' who want some money they are owed. Not much plot, too much action, no good actors and little (if any) direction.

His last outing in \\"Exit Wounds\\" was a welcome comeback to the action genre, however \\"Half Past Dead\\" doesn't even come close. From the first disjointed scenes of the movie you wonder what could have been going through the directors head on this one. Fantasy films are great, but to believe that a group of hardened convicts would help an exposed undercover FBI agent save a judge is beyond fantasy. Even though Seagal is one of the highest Aikido black belts in the US he doesn't show it here, the fight scenes are weak and poorly shot. Save your time and money and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Good Action Flick","review":"This a really good movie and is intense and is action packed.

The action seqeunces in the film are okay, I think there could have been more martial arts fights and Ja Rule is good as alwayas. Morris Chestnut makes a good bad guy (he hasn't played one since The Inkwell) and Kurput is good in his small role.

As a matter of fact, it *is* that crappy late night cable movie I came upon!My real question, though, is this: who the heck is this Jeff Shannon who writes so many editor reviews for Amazon? He writes fluff reviews for even the most abominable flicks -- take his blurb here for this piece of garbage: 'Half Past Dead isn't half bad'. Huh?! Name *one* movie that's more incompetently made from top to bottom, more ineptly directed and acted, and more insulting to its supposed audience.

I am very careful with my sunglasses to avoid damage. After approx. 2 months of use one of the arms snapped. I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement pair under warranty. Things were mostly OK after that -- the screw in one of the hinges worked itself loose causing the arm to fall off (easy to fix though I shouldn't have to), and part of the frame chipped somehow. Then shortly after the warranty expired the arm snapped again. Perhaps I just had bad luck, but I won't buy Fossil brand sunglasses again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a pair of sunglasses.","review":"They're sun glasses. No frills, no thrills.

My bookshelves are already overflowing with astrology books - many of them unread. But I was captured by her premise. \\"If you have been practicing for a year and don't feel comfortable reading an actual horoscope, then this is the book you need!\\" I still get the stunned deer look when confronting a chart for the first time. I start trying to dig through remembrances of past cookbooks I have read. Donna's anti-cookbook approach teaches you how to reason astrologically so you can deduce the delineations yourself. It is not a primer. You need to have the basics firmly in hand that you learned in the cookbooks. What she does is show you how to cut through the clutter, find and read the essential themes in the chart. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who has studied astrology for a while and is ready to consolidate their book learning into more easy, flowing interpretations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best How-To Book on Reading Charts","review":"I've been reading charts since the 1960s and still found much to savor in this book.

Cunningham takes us back to the basics in a way that brings new richness to every chart you will read.Thanks Donna!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be knowledgable about subject first!","review":"I gave this book two stars only because it is obviously crammed with lots of information about the topic.

Even the terminology is beyond me. I was looking for something that explained from a starting point on how to create and read charts. This is like taking a person with no experience or exposure to medicine who is interested in becoming a doctor and throwing them into the OR doing neurosurgery!

They do not stick together and when my son sits, it would slide out of place - leading to \\"it's broken mommy\\" and not wanting to go. I ended up buying Velcro to attach the two parts, but it doesn't last long. The pee gets in there - it get's disgusting and needs to be taken apart and scrubbed several times a day - - too much work, if you ask me! Try for an all-in-one potty or one that has a solid top."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great potty, even for older toddlers","review":"I bought this potty over others because other parents said it was a little bigger. My toddler is a little bigger, but not ready for the big potty yet. This fits him perfect. The seat is soft, so he is comfortable, even over those longer potty attempts. I do agree with some others, that the shield is a bit of a pain, but if you are still going with your toddler at potty time, you can easily make sure it's where it needs to be. I wouldn't want to try without it, unless your little boy knows to make sure his \\"item\\" is pointed down. Other than that, this potty is great. It's a little bigger than some, and works great. I highly recommend it, my tot took to it right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one fit the boy!","review":"Our 2.5 year son is currently undergoing Bathroom Boot Camp and we'd bought one of these several months ago in anticipation of this milestone event. We're happy to say that he is progressing just fine!But because we needed a spare one (to keep at my sister's who watches him 2 days a week) we purchased another brand at our local Toys r Us. However, when he sat down to do his business, it was immediately apparent that the other brand was way too small (BTW our son is average in height). He did not feel comfortable at all and I was worried he was going to start squirting all over the place, so we quickly moved him onto the 'big people\\" toilet. I returned it and ordered this GRACO model from Amazon.We've never used the step-stool feature (besides, he already has one which he uses as a book prop while he's sitting on this) so I can't comment on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a boy, this may not be the right seat...","review":"I'm going to have to buy a new potty seat for my little boy.

I'll be looking for a seat that has the shield molded into it, not a removable one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so comfortable","review":"My daughter is 2 years and 4 months old.

Now, however, the lid frequently pops off its hinges when he uses it as a stepstool, and the plastic cover on the soft seat has come apart all the way around at the seam, exposing the foam. I'm glad to see from another review that we can order another seat from Graco, but am still disappointed that this did not hold up to regular use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made","review":"This works best as a step stool. As a potty chair it hasn't worked well with my daughter. The cushioned seat keeps coming off the chair whenever she makes the slightest movement (and we all know how much toddlers like to squirm) which has sometimes allowed the mess to get on the floor as well as my daughter. Also, it gets dirty in all the extra nooks (like under the cushion) which requires a lot more work to keep it clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Potty but Watch the Guard!","review":"I like this potty chair because the opening is much bigger than others we tried, and now that my son is a little older, he can use the very comfortable ring on the regular toilet. However, the guard comes off very easily and that is very annoying. We also use it as a stepstool and I did notice the lid does snap off, but its easy enough to fix. Overall, I'd recommend it but the guard is sort of a pain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurts my bum!","review":"I bought this about a year ago and still no peeing in the potty. My boy just turned three and he is saying that it hurts his bottom. He seems eager enough to try and has the same complaint every time so I think the problem is that the seat is too large for his bum. Not having seen them together the hole on this one seems alot larger than on the Fisherprice one. So maybe not good for little bums. If only they could test them out at the store - not naked or anything just for size."},{"rating":"2","title":"great potty chair for the price","review":"I have 1 1/2 yr. old twins and 3 bathrooms so I bought this to use for both.I use a cushioned seat on the regular toilet for my son since the deflector on this one seemed to not stay in position, it would fall over towards my son which would make him want to play with it. So we took it off and used the entire toilet on the floor for my daughter. she seems to like it and she is happy pottying in it. Its small enough for her to sit down on her own comfortably. Easy to empty and rinse out between uses. when she's bigger we will use the soft seat top on the big toilet. It is supposed to be a step stool too, using the lid as the stool but I think it is kinda light plastic and wont use it for the kids to stand on when they get bigger, does not seem like it will hold up to weight without cracking the lid? As a toilet itself and for the ease and of use I would give it 5 stars, just gave it 4 because of the step stool part ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This chair is great. Our daughter is only 20 months but is interested in the potty and has been having success once in a while. I love the fact that the bowl is bigger - it looks more like a real potty.

Sure, the transliteration system is old, there are errors here and there, but the vast amount of information is too valuable to pass by. Other \\"dictionaries\\" and \\"glossaries\\" are so small as to be useless for serious work. In the case of the excellent Faulkner dictionary, it's never been typeset and struggling to read handwritten manuscript pages will quickly give you a headache.

A girl he has seen one time, Karla Demery, likes his looks and contacts an Attorney to see if he will help him. The Attorney agrees and has a new trial set up when Bowen tries another break out. The big villian is Frank Renda who is in charge of the prison. He and his side kick will shoot you for nothing and call it an attempted excape.

It is not overbearing but subtle and gentle. I love the smell of shea butter and vanilla/cinnamon type scents, this fits right in. I have to say my mother thought it was rather strong, but not to me. I like the spray on. The consistency of the spray is kind of like a pump hair spray except not sticky at all. Just watery and smooth almost like liquid powder, but less powdery. It rubs in really well and easily. I bought this when I was pregnant and couldn't reach everywhere (feet/legs/back) this was a life saver! I still had to rub it in, but it rubs in much easier than most other lotions and does not leave stickiness behind, and really moisturizes the skin. I just used my towel or rubbed my foot on my leg haha. You can also put it on wet or dry. I say this because one product I was looking at said you have to use it while you are still wet, not the case with this lotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST PHONE EVER!!!!","review":"This is the best phone there is out there on the market :)I love this phone. You can do so many cool things. Don't ever have to worry about downloading ringtones because you're MP3 songs automaticall can convert as ringtone as well. I love this phone. You can change the ringtone into a video when someone is calling as well. It is the best phone out there. The signal, volume, and battery are all great. It comes with a charger and head phone for radio. Oh, the radio is great and reception works out great as well. THe only thing I have to say is that the keys on the numbers are verhy thin ( i have small fingers) and they feel very thin to me. Other than that,the speaker on the phone is great as well..

It rewinds fast and hard and at the end, the sound it makes is pretty scary. It snapped the third tape we rewound. Pulled the tape out of the spool. We decided that since we were not rewinding precious tapes, we would try it some more and it has been OK. I still look at each tape though to make sure it is not broken. Full speed to the end and then whack!!!!! As I said, scary. Oh yes, the headlights come on the car during rewind if you amused by that sort of thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"really cool","review":"I love this rewinder...I get more comments on it.

We're sure they won't be around much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IMPRESSED","review":"I bought two at the same time. The first one rewound one tape, then wouldn't work again.

And what's with the GW and the artist? Can they not decide what these girls look like? Cinnamon now has coal-black hair? Most of the girls' characters are pretty blah, with the exception of Cinnamon. There's the gratuitous near-rape scene, and an almost-incest scene (the GW usually finds a way to make sure the participants aren't blood-related). It did keep me reading until the end, and then it was just...over. All in all, another disappointing effort. When will I learn?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the GW ever get better?!?!?!","review":"Ok. The whole shooting stars miniseries has been the worst one yet. And I thought it couldn't get worse than the Orphans. This book was so shallow and predictable. The characters were flat and immature. I thought that there would be more romance but Honey only sees her boyfriend once.This story had so much potential but when I found out who the person upstairs really was and what had happened to her I couldn't beleive what cheap material they were using! I can't beleive the family allowed this to be printed. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad...","review":"I hated this book. I miss the old V.C. Andrews books, sure the pattern was getting old, but at least they were interesting. This series isn't even up to the usual miniseries standard, much less the regular standard. All of the characters were boring and the ending was fake and unreal when usually at the end of the last book of a series is so sweet and/or sad that it makes me cry. Avoid this at all cost!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Andrews family has some sense...","review":"Look at it like this: The V.C. Andrews Trust has some sense. You know how normal books are printed in hardcover first before in softcover? Well, these books are just printed in soft cover. Hardcover books can cost quite a bit in comparison to softcovers. Think of the money we'd waste if they went the normal route! So we aren't wasting all that much money, although I could use my seven or four dollars on better things than the awful books that were spawned starting with the Wildflower series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the classic V. C. Andrews style?","review":"I'm beginning to wonder if the ghost writers ever read the books V. C. Andrews actually wrote herself. These new novels pale in comparision.

For real fans, its barely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"All in one","review":"Great book. Our favorites are the first two stories.

Sorry I can't give you a review. I hope they didn't charge me for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is happening here?","review":"Ok I have been getting more and more discouraged with everything that the ghost writers have been putting out. I didn't like the beginning of the book. It picked up more around page 100 and got a little better.They changed everyone but Honey (who in my opinion needed to be changed the most). Pretty much, they go to the school, big secrets, getting taken advantage of because the girl is naive.

I was dead wrong. After a few days, it worked like a charm and continued to work. Unfortunately for me, all medication stops working after 3 weeks of constant use due to laxative dependence. This product is taste free and it mixes well in any product. I enjoy it with some orange juice, hot tea or V-8. It's pretty expensive, but when you've been constipated all your life, paying that price to poop is so well worth it. If you have the same problem as me, where things just stop working, mix it up a bit do two weeks of MiraLax and two weeks of Metamucial or Benifiber or Fibercon pills. keep switching and keep those intestines confused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab it","review":"I read some of the reviews and nearly didn't grab this one but I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it. There are songs on this DVD that remind of great times in the 80's and he clearly hasn't been sitting on his hand's creatively either because the newer Christopher Cross songs are good too.There's an acoustic set in the middle that drags a bit but this is only a minor criticism. I think if you were listening to the radio a lot in the 80's or in radio playing them like me you'll love this. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"muy bueno","review":"Cross es uno de mis artistas favoritos...........el dvd me gusta mucho , en especial cuando aparece Michael McDonald..........su musica romantica me transporta a la mejor epoca de los 70 y 80"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have all of CC's CD's and their sound quality is excellent, I even use CC's Saling song to demo detail in High-End equipment but the sound of this DVD is extremely un-detailed and poor. Christopher deserves a better, much better sound engineer. It is a real disappointment. ! !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very excited when I saw this DVD in the store. Only one copy left, so I bought it instead of another title I wanted. The production quality is not good. The 2-channel audio track is horrible. Video quality is alright, but the camera work is also subpar. I could overlook these annoyances if it was a great performance. However, it seemed that Cross was struggling through the songs, occasionally off key, and having alot of difficulty with transitions. For me, the transitions were what made his studio work unbelievable in the early 80's. I couldn't even get through the entire concert in one sitting. For the die hard Cross fan, this DVD may be an appropriate purchase. However, for others, there are other concert DVDs that would be more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep listening to the CD","review":"I'm a big Christopher Cross fan and was hopeful to find this recent live concert to take advantage of the full sound that DVD can bring.I was greatly dissapointed at the quality of the audio -- no seperation of instruments; no where near CD quality sound; poor 5.1 audio.His performance left something to be desired too -- the camara angles where dull; his commentary in between songs was un-interesting and full of low self-esteem for what he refered to as his \\"five minutes of fame\\" career.I guess I had hoped for something more along the lines of the quality found on the Kenny Loggins or James Taylor DVDs (both of which I would highly recommend) -- especially since this was performed within the last three years.I got the impression that this DVD concert was released to promote his web site that he gave out (at least 4 different times throughout the concert) and to play some tunes off his poorest selling CDs to try and get more sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW COULD YOU?","review":"BRAVO! A musical sensation for all the senses. I think Scott Weiland triumphed with this albulm. I was shocked when I saw some of the negative reviews from the obviously musically challenged people out there. If you are a music fan you have to appreciate the genuis at work with tracks off of 12 Bar Blues. The heart and soul of this album, to me was completely satisfing if not breath-taking. For the people who aren't sure about buying this album,don't give it a second thought. Any STP fan will know that there is no lack of talent when it comes to Scott Weiland and he will not dissapoint you with this album! ENJOY"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good escape from the norm","review":"Some people say this cd ...(stinks) because it isn't stp, thats the point, Scott made this cd by myself and if you listen to it, it is one of the most perfect cd's ever put together, the songs flow great, and it is a total 180 from the normal rock everyone is used to when they hear Scott Weiland. I wish he would make another solo cd, because Scott does what he wants and doesn't care about anyone else on his solo cd's and therefore making some great songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not STP, but much better than Talk Show","review":"This CD is much more underrated than you think. Scott is the brains behind STP and it certainly shows on this CD. Its very experimental, but generally very enjoyable to hear. I can't understand why some people trashed it. It was recorded during a hard period in his life and I think for him it may have been somewhat cathartic. Obviously, STP is better, but as a solo effort, this was very commendable. This guy is greatly haunted and talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I love this period of STP. The other guys went and did a project called \\"Talk Show.\\" I remember when the DeLeo's came to my town promoting that disc and were booed for a few seconds. In addition, \\"Talk Show\\" was listed by Maxim magazine as \\"one of the worst ever.\\" Once again, my tastes do not agree with the mainstream. \\"Talk Show\\" was a great, great disc and this one from Mr. Weiland was fantastic as well. Both \\"12 Bar\\" and \\"Talk Show\\" are favorites of my varied 1000 disc CD collection. My only gripe about \\"12 Bar Blues\\" is that it did not include a song that was included on the promotional only version, a great song called \\"Nosey Divey.\\" Go to other sources to find that one, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experimental pop?","review":"I'm not sure what to call it. Most people either lovedor hated this cd. It just happened to grow on me over theyears...If you enjoyed STP's 3rd cd and like Bowie(the 70'sstuff), THe Beatles, maybe even a little Pet Sounds from TheBeach Boys- with niche for electronica and experimentation-well you've come to the right place. Obviously- if you arelooking for Core-era STP well... you'll hate it. 12 Bar Blues is like the better part of 60's acid/fuzz rock mixed with electronica/pop. I also like the fact that Scott Weiland is playing alot of the instrumentation on here. But definetly his best instrument is his own voice. I think the thing that makes this cd a gem is the treatment of vocal harmonies which claim once in for all that this isn't some Eddie Vedder clone.(Which I thought was totally unfair to begin with.) Fave Tracks: \\"Desperation #5\\", \\"About Nothing\\", \\"The Date\\", and \\"Jimmy Was A stimulator\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really, really like this cd.","review":"I don't know how to classify 12 Bar Blues. It's just.. different. My wife and the majority of my friends either don't care for it or are indifferent. I can't really tell you why I like this cd so much. It's got a combination of ingredients that leave a satisfied taste in my brain. If I were to spend the rest of my life on a deserted island this is one of the cd's I'd bring along. Thank you Scott."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why this album got so little attention is beyond me..","review":"Back when that album came out the Stone Temple Pilots (Weiland's vehicle) were not in their best of times. They'd just released their -probaly- worst album, Weiland himself was hampered by his well known drug problems, and a release of a solo album from his part didnt exactly seem like the best idea he could come up with.I think the bias generated by all these factors contributed to this album being widely ignored. Which in turn happens to be quite a pity as \\"12 Bar Blues\\" turned out to be a great effort by the STP's singer. And a surprisingly different musical direction as well.Weiland didnt opt for the straight rock approach like it was assumed he would've, but instead he delivered an LP heavy on electronics, effects, and otherworldy atmoshpere (for his glam rock standards).If you happen to have not heard this do yourself a favor and be pleasantly surprised. Especially if you're a STP fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"what i this?","review":"The only good riffs on this album are the ones that are stolen. And as for the awful drum tracks, sounding as if they've been created on an old Casio, I can do without them. I've heard that some of these tunes were written while Weiland was still in rehab. If so, they seem to reflect his poor physical and mental states quite adequately."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"I have just wasted 59 minutes and 19 seconds of my life. Thisis time that I can never get back. I have no idea what Scott Weilandis trying to do here. I am sitting here in a haze trying to take in what I just had to endure. I am not sure what type of audience that this music would appeal to, in fact I find it quite frightening just trying to imagine it. Now I didn't expect an STP disc, but I certainly couldn't imagine the horror that is 12 Bar Blues. Please read this and hear my warning, check out this CD before you buy it and waste any money or more importantly time in your precious life..."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying trash","review":"i bought this cd a year ago and listened to it once and never listened to it again until now. it's hard to believe that the guy that wrote all those great STP songs could come up with something like this. 12 bar blues is filled with terrible lyrics, over orchastrated songs, and it's just plain weird. once you listen to this album you'll never want to listen to it again. don't buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please make a new STP record","review":"Stone Temple Pilots has always been one of my favorite bands, so when this cd came out I decided to buy it. Big mistake. It's literally one of the worst cds I have ever heard. The one resonably decent song on it is #10, but that's about it. Don't waste your money, just wait till the group gets back together again and puts out a good cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't make the grade","review":"I generally like everything Scott does and I really tried hard to like this record, but it just didn't inspire me very much. The Barbarella song was a bit of a high point, but overrall this record would be what resulted if a tornado went through a junkyard. Sure something great could come from the chaos, but after all the sound and the fury this alblum kind of falls flat"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scott's Awesome!","review":"Just received this cd and I love it! Scott is so creative--Such an awesome talent whether he is working with STP (their last album was amazing!) , his former band Velvet Revolver, or his solo work. His last solo project \\"Happy in Galoshes\\" is so incredible. And his Christmas cd was the only holiday music I listened to this past season and it made my Christmas. Every Scott Weiland fan should have \\"12 Bar Blues\\" in their collection. So glad Amazon made this available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Really Don't Know What To Say...","review":"This album is weird. I think Scott Weiland created his own style of music.

This is a quality album that is far superior to his 2nd and in my opinion rivals his first. There are several true gems that any Marc Cohn fan will fall in love with (Saints Preserve Us, Olana, Providence). He does not rely on his earlier piano style as much as I would have liked, but no true music fan should be without this CD in their collection.

My hat's off to this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"One strange CD","review":"Like many others here, I find Marc's voice to sound very strange on the majority of theses songs. It's hin and lacks his trademark timbre. Most don't even sound like him. Also, the album is way overproduced and lacks the raw, live sound of the first two CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly disappointing","review":"While waiting for my amazon.com delivery of this cd, I went back and listened to Marc Cohn's other two cd's in anticipation. The final track on Marc Cohn (the first album), True Companion, brought very real tears to my eyes and I couldn't wait to hear his new stuff. This album which has just finished on my stereo was over-produced, uninspiring, and uninteresting. What made me like Cohn in the first place was his unapologetic rough style. This studio album brings with it all the negatives of the recording industry. All the idiosyncracies that make a musician great are lacking and they are replaced with the air-brushed equivalent of soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing","review":"The 4th song and the last song are very healing for me.

Only few songs can remind you the good old days of marc cohn : the tracks 2, 6 and 11.conclusion: get it only if you are addicted to marc cohn's music and you look for everything from him. if you don't know his music get the others... is that clear ???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty weak compared to his first CD...","review":"Most of the material on this CD, his third, is not really inspiring or very original.Healing Hands is a pretty good track.But compared to his first CD titled simply 'Marc Cohn', which was EXCELLENT, this is just not as good.And his second CD, don't bother.It's the usual story - an artist spends 20 years creating their first hit CD and then they're under pressure to produce the subsequent CDs in a year or two. It's a tough business.Cohn reminds me of Bruce Hornsby (in style) who had 2 good initial albums but has weakened since then."},{"rating":"1","title":"An uninspired effort entirely devoid of soul","review":"Perhaps my high hopes are partly to blame, but I was tremendously dissapointed by this lacklustre album."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT AS GREAT AS HIS 1st ALBUM...BUT STILL GREAT!!","review":"What do you do when your first album can be called your greatest hits? Hey reviewers...stop faulting Marc Cohn for begginer's luck!!! This album shows the amazing range of style that Cohn is capable of both in singing and songwriting. Maybe it's just too much for some listeners...If you think that a singer/songwriter has to stick to one type of music, then this album's not for you.

I am still looking. Bettis' performance while very good is wasted in this cheesy film student style movie. Shooting in digital gives the director lattitude but also allows for sloppy filming. The hype of being shot in one take is clearly wrong as there are at least two points where the film is cut. The story line is not new and the 'twist' ending is very predictable from the middle of the story. The filming looks like a bad soap opera and the writing isn't much better. Following characters walking down halls and sidewalks for long periods of time is not interesting and it was clear that the actors were struggling with it. While the plot device is not new it is always nice to see Angela Bettis doing anything. Her talents are so wasted here and I don't know why she signed on to this poor film experiment. The only circle I will complete is going back for my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Normally a fan, but.......","review":"I love Lyn Denison's books, but to me this one was just a retelling of Gold Fever with a little twist.

The book has a UK/Land rover slant but all the topics covered are relevant with whatever platform you plan to operate from, and whether it is for recreational or military purposes. This is the companion piece to Toms other book which I also highly recommend, \\"Off-Roader Driving\\". Both books are long out of print but can be had through used book deals. This book has wealth of information conveyed in this text, so much so that I used this book to plan military long-range mobility patrols and used it as reference in developing the U.S. Army Special Forces Mobility Operations Field Manual.

Reappearing to give Dido an old, possibly valuable necklace Ashe is then found dead, having appointed Dido executor of his (surprisingly substantial) estate.Dido doubts the official verdict of natural causes and her suspicions are soon buttressed by the stonewalling involvement of intelligence services - and the wartime memories of her father who once knew the man.Dido is a resourceful heroine who encounters more danger than she bargained for but remains undaunted.

They both are living on an island with their mother, She Wins The Race, and their father, Speaks To Birds. I enjoyed Morning Girl because the author, Michale Dorris, made the characters believable. For example, the main character, Morning Girl, complains about her bother. Also, Morning Girl's mother understands how she's feeling. I also enjoyed the use of descriptive language. Morning Girl uses descriptive language in most of her sentences like, \\"in our house my brother was the footprints.\\" I think the grade level for Morning Girl is fourth grade and up because of the descriptive language.

All you need to know is that they took \\"creative license\\" and now our twins are not interested in the same woman. Instead the hero is interested in an unattached woman... This ruins at least half the point of the story about being honorable even when it means foregoing something you cherish. The point of these stories is to instill honorable characteristics in the young, to me anyway. Without the honor of Rassendyll it's quite impossible.

Unfortunately, this book is published by a pseudo-Christian organization that is classified by several different sources as a cult. While some of the discussions about the Bible are accurate, this book espouses several doctrines that do not follow what the Bible teaches. For example, the writer says on page 176 \\"Because the word 'satan' just means an adversary, a good person, even God Himself, can be termed a 'satan'.\\" That definitely goes against Biblical scriptures. Thus, I would NEVER recommend this book due to the misleading discussions and false doctrines contained within.

They represent the entire spectrum from the haves to the have-nots; from the criminal to the not quite so criminal; from the promiscuous to the prim and proper.This being South America we have the macho men, booze, sexy ladies and, of course, guns. All are liberally interspersed throughout the book. Most of all we are shown the humor of this place and time.We get to know the people and actually care for some of them.

But, I will read more Amado."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another masterpiece by the late Jorge Amado!!!","review":"Gabriela, Clove and CinnamonGabriela Clove and Cinnamon is a more than delicious and delightful novel that takes place in the Brazilian town of Ilheus in the mid 1920's. The plot centers on the romance between Nacib, the Arab, and the graceful Gabriela, a mullato beauty that is willing to work for next to nothing as she is running away from famine. This takes time and place when and where the cacao prosperity is changing every aspect of the political and social lives at Ilheus. I chose this book since I had already read Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands, also by Jorge Amado, and absolutely loved it. By no chance was I disappointed. This is just another masterpiece by the late Jorge Amado that I just could not put down until I finished and, besides, made me laugh and feel great all throughout the book. I won't give away the plot, but I am telling you, it is one of the finest novels by a Latin-American author that I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Sky Country","review":"Janet Dailey did a great job writing a fun book about Oklahoma.

Unity can be reached through several different paths, e.g., seeking knowledge or devotion - so, pick one that you're naturally good at.3. Peel away interactions from your life that you realize are untrustworthy.4. Cells in your body die and new ones are created regularly. The body of baby, kid, adult and old man are different although they refer to the same person. The body that is left after death is different from the person.5. Avoid dwelling on the past or worrying about the future - become more aware of the now.Several of the concepts were beyond my understanding; there are others that can be easily and usefully applied"},{"rating":"2","title":"impressive and insightful","review":"I found the book to be a really insightful and a thoughtful account written in easy language with good analogues and anecdotes.

I had to re-read several portions simply because he asserted scientific evidence and then tried to connect it to what he thinks and it just missed some important steps.Also, a little frenetic for him.

It pulls no punches, telling the whole story of how he sees spirit and the path to enlightenment. In the past Dr. Chopra has used a lot of pop metaphors to get his message across and has been lumped with motivational writers like Wayne Dyer and Tony Robbins, but in The Book of Secrets he is all spiritual, and for me that is really exciting. If you want to learn about everything from good and evil to life after death and the five illusions that create unreality, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One-World","review":"Chopra has several great insights in this book. If you use his \\"unitary-world\\" approach, you accept whatever happens as what you need at the time: less conflict, strife, and alienation. Also, he has an intriguing notion about the on-switch and the off-switch of the universe: when it is in \\"off,\\" one can reimagine the world to be the way you want it to be, and achieve much with little effort: sort of like using leverage in the physical plane. Much here that will improve your life.

There is a great sadness in me though when I read something so pervasive and pernicious as the idea that \\"love from the opposite sex\\" without the other side of the coin! This type of phrasing is unfortunate and inappropriate because it does not cover what is truly meant.(romantic love or love from another) would be better.Bad writing,bad editing. If it IS what was meant then it is SO limiting and caters to subtle homophobia,which in some ways is more damaging than outright bashing. The 21st century is now.

But do NOT follow him blindly. Think about where he is coming from, who is writing and what is the purpose. Mostly to sell books, give lectures, appear on TV I would guess.

When friends ask for recommendations of spiritual books, this is at the top of my list.All that is surprising, as I generally dislike New Age writing. I find it tends to be smug, preachy, and assertive rather than persuasive. But this book is highly persuasive and highly engaging. Chopra offers compelling frameworks for thinking about issues, but puts full responsibility on the reader; he offers suggestions for integrating his insights into one's life, but avoids the nagging To Do lists that mar the works of people like Dyer.Of course it won't speak to everyone.

I was assigned to read it in college and now that I'm working for a large corporation, it amazes me how many times a week this book comes up in conversation. After reading this story, you feel like you have an intense understanding of the inner-workings of manufacturing, even if you've never set foot in a plant. I was very impressed with the content of the book and even more amazed by how well the author conveyed his opinions and strategies. Absolutly a fabulous novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall book!!","review":"Sure, this book is targeted to managers in production, but the insights are equally applicable to consultants, bankers, or anyone else who deals with processes in their business routine.I found this book highly entertaining. I was pulled into the problems facing the title character, and enjoyed the process of working through the answers.If you like novels which impart a great deal of wisdom, this is a perfect book. It is not dry like many of its counterparts in the business section. Regardless of how applicable you find it to your business, you will not regret the time spent in these pages.My only complaint is the ending. It seems the author was rushed by the publisher to come to a hasty conclusion. I feel like I just finished part one of a two part book. Where is the smooth ending?

Novel with real life problem solutions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The GOAL","review":"I had to read this Book for my Operation Management class at UNCC.I think this book was wonderful, since I enjoyed every page of. I believe that Eli Tolerate demonstrates his genius both as a thinker and as a teacher with \\"The Goal\\". As in any other well-written novel, The Goal examines issues in dispute which create conflicts. The operational concepts that he presents are revolutionary in their practicality and common-sense approach. This book is presented with a storyteller's passion for detail, while still driving the key learning points of the theory. This makes sticking with it to the end much easier, which is important, as several key concepts are not revealed until the final pages. Every organization can benefit from the concepts presented in \\"The Goal\\". Eli Goldratt has written a novel in which he provides an analysis of those concepts as applied in a fictional company. He has a cast of characters, a plot, and a context. He relies heavily on dialogue to advance the narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative....Entertaining","review":"The Goal was very entertaining, which suprised me when I knew it was going to discuss management principles and techniques. Throughout the book, Alex was improving his managerial skills along with trying to save his marriage-which was very interesting. The characters were faced with many issues that were revelant to real life situations in work and in their personal life. I felt that the Theory of Constraints could have been written more clearly to those managers trying to improve their productivity. The book gave a clear list on what to do when faced with a constraint, but did not provide a procedure on what to do-only gave examples. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain more knowledge on management or how to apply managing concepts to their company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commonsense approach to shopfloor problems","review":"It's interesting to note that someone had commented that this book is for fifth graders - well if CEO's have had the common-sense required at fifth grade a lot manufactuirng industries would have a goal and be productive.

Goldratt presented an easy reading and grassroots approach void of boardroom jargon and public language. Can't wait for the sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A reminder to use common sense","review":"The book was a required reading in business school for us. The central concept is that bottlenecks (and near bottlenecks) determine the throughput of the manufacturing process. It also shows how accounting can blur the picture of what is going on at a manufacturing plant. The book's story-telling style was a nice relief when other required readings are often dry and impersonal. Sometimes the story slows down and drags a bit too much for my taste, but overall, due to the importance of the message in it, I recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book...plus","review":"This is a great book. But, I would also recommend \\"Strategic Organizational Change\\" by Beitler. Both books together are a great combination for managers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This is a great book to understand TOC.

Goldratt's use of Socratic reasoning is a great way to approach problems that we face in everyday-life (something that we usually do not take the time to do with our busy lives). The book is very easy to read and a informative. However, the book is too simplified for the real world; after all, it is just a fiction so readers must caution themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only useful in manufacturing? Certainly not!","review":"Common sense, easy to read, but most of all in this book about manufacturing the author describes situations that can be identified in every process, not just in manufacturing. The scenarios he comes up with are certainly worth a few good thoughts as well. Therefor as a project manager in the business of software development I recommend this book. The only minus - which in my opinion cost this book its fifth star - is the finish. I had the feeling that the author had finished his message and did not know how to finish the book. I was hoping for more excellent and sensible stuff though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be more business novels like this","review":"I think there should be more business novels that wrap a fictional story around management techniques and facts to teach the next generation of business managers. I hope this book inspires others to write a story. This book I think should definitely be required reading for anyone interested in a manufacturing job and it can easily be applied to the service industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perscriptive","review":"\\"The Goal\\" has been a standard for years. It's one of the few business books which is \\"perscriptive\\" in that it gives the reader a good knowledge of \\"how\\" to implement the point of the book.

That being said, this one can be topped, but its OK as the first stab anybody has taken into written a day by day story of the boys. Most of the research is taken from studio logs, but apparently not many could be found for the early (and best) Beach boys albums. While the book is some 350 pages, less that 1/4 is devoted to the years prior to 1966, and the rest of the book for the years 1966-1974. If you want a detail analysis of the early beach boys, you may need to look somewhere else. But for the Brother Years, this is very good. The book is not pricey and includes many photos. A revised edition would be great in a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitive?","review":"I picked up this book and started to read the first substantive page, Page 10. The very first paragraph states: \\"Hawthorne is situated in rural southeastern Alachia County very close to the boundary of Putnam County.\\" Of course Hawthorne, California is, and always has been, located in the western part of Los Angeles County, near the Los Angeles International Airport.

So, definitive ? Not by a long chalk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and lacking new information","review":"Its a boring document that provides little insight into the band.

I have loads of plantings and loads of summertime mosquitoes, enough to discourage outdoor relaxation. The Bonide lays down a good fog and it does discourage mosquitoes but does not eliminate them. It would probably work better on a less green back yard and during a less wet summer. My only complaint is the need for constant pumping to keep the fog coming. I wish the press of the trigger would keep the fog coming until released. However, I can live through that. I am using the shorter propane container against recommendation and it seems to work fine. I am emptying the concentrate container after each use as strongly recommended. Since this is my first season, I'll have to wait a while to see if it remains reliable. All things considered, I would buy the Bonide 420 again."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made but fixable","review":"This product did not work right out of the box. It heated up fine but no fog. I checked the things the manual said to check with no luck. The pump didn't seem to be pulling any insecticide up into the tube. Seeing it looked pretty simple, I unscrewed the brass fitting at the end of the tube that pulls the insecticide into the burner. Inside is a small ball bearing that acts as a ball valve, and a spring. I suspect the spring was either misaligned or the brass fitting was screwed in too tightly to allow the valve to function properly. I replaced the components, screwed the brass fitting back on, and the pump now functioned fine. I still have the fogger, but only because I can't find an inexpensive alternative that performs any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"fogger","review":"Love this product.

I have not had any problem after nearly a year other than once the the small ball at the bottom of the pump got stuck. A little tap and it was fine.As far as the product itself it is great, easy to use and more importantly it does a great job.

I remember watching the program when I was younger, but back then I hadn't yet started reading Bradbury's novels. I can honestly say that Ray Bradbury is my favorite contemporary author.

I would not recommend this particular rendition."},{"rating":"2","title":"God was on our side. Corpus Christi, Tx","review":"Excellent dvd. Tells the story from both sides. With interviews of the actual soldiers that fought in the war. The Old Breed. That was The Greatest Generation indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Historical Interest","review":"This video is very good for those interested in WW2 history and the analyst on how this battle was conducted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great definitive account!","review":"Most WW2 documentaries simply rehash some of the more prominent points of a particular event. Then again, it's hard to cover any battle account in depth in a matter of the standard 30 to 60 minutes as most documentaries go.This account clocks in at almost 3 hours but you would never know it. It covers the Guadalcanal campaign quite thoroughly, yet moves along at a pace that doesn't leave you wondering when it will end, as some documentaries are prone to.This is quite simply one of the best documentaries of any WW2 military battle and will leave you feeling that you have gotten the most for your money. I would highly recommend it to both WW2 buffs or novice wanting to understand this important campaign."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Neighborhood Brought to Life","review":"Hyde Park is one of the unique neighborhoods of our nation--it's where nuclear fission first happened, and where Mel Torme went to high school. Max Grinnell brings the history of this neighborhood to life with hundreds of well-chosen pictures, captioned with verve, and a few short essays on the development of the neighborhood. It would make a great Christmas gift for Hyde Park oldtimers, newcomers, and anyone interested in urban development in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This was a great time for British music, and if you are of a certain age, you will enjoy this. If you like Dizzee Rascal and girls aloud, I probably wouldn't bother with it. However, if you have GOOD taste in British music, then this is for you. A little slow at times, but it captures the mood of the era well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make your own film","review":"I hate people who complain that films don't have enough of some element, some band who they want to see. There are enough Oasis, Blur and Pulp videos out there to catch up on. There is John Harris' Britpop book. Britpop WAS a media invention. It is a tired subject. But it did happen. It is essential to talk about the Blur vs. Oasis thing at some point. I feel that this film succeeded at some point. There are another hour of interviews with the bands as a bonus. If you don't like this film, make your own. It will probably suck. It will probably have a thousand close shots of Jarvis Cocker. That is just fandom. That is monomania. That is not narrative filmmaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"For what it's worth","review":"Nicely packaged documentary not only about Brit pop, but 90's Britian period. The main focus is on Oasis & Blur, with some Jarivs/Pulp (but not nearly enough). Live Forever runs a little over an hour and also touches on politics, fashion, and art of the time. I had nearly forgotten about that horribly cheesey Vanity Fair cover with Liam and Patsy, but there it was--along with a flood of memories of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty of a Half Pint!","review":"I bought mine several years ago, and its done beautifully for me.

With volume turned down to half, the voice was maybe carried about 30 yards which basically means, I could have yelled over people to that distance. If turning up the volume over the half mark, we got serious feedback and distortion. The two sirens were not associated with the volume and were way too loud even for outdoors. Yes, it gets your attention but to the point of it being a noise nuisance. I do not recommend this megaphone and if I had another opportunity, I would have paid the little extra for the 25 watt.Pros: got the product on time and product was packaged very very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this pice of junk","review":"Bought one had it for 9 months or so, unexpectedly it died, called customer service, awfull experience, almost a nightmare.

Stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece o' junk","review":"Had it for just over a year. We have had significant issues with it most of that time. Now, the battery life is about 5 minutes.

The system worked great for a while then suddenly the base unit quit working. Since I'm out of US and thought it would be too hard to go through customer service I purchased another of the very same system. Now after 4 months of use the very same problem has occurred. On my own I isolated the problem to the power supply since the base works using another similar power supply, at least I can still use the phone.I have yet to use the customer service but overall very unreliable system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vonage phone bad","review":"Bought my first Vonage phone 12 months ago. 6 months later it didn't have any power. Because the warranty was out of date, I bought a new one. 5 months later the second modem went dead. Again, I was unable to get the modem to power up. Do not buy this phone. Try to find another option."},{"rating":"1","title":"6 months life expectancy","review":"Purchased and installed about 6 months ago. Stationed overseas so Vonage keeps us sane. The service has been great but the phone died. After troubleshooting with Vonage over the landline phone, they determined the power supply was bad (the plug that goes into the wall). They said they would replace it. 1 month later, no plug. Called and they said they didn't show it was ever mailed. Said they would mail (again). After another month, no show. Took plug to electrician friend, said plug was fine. We took the box apart and the circuit cards were corroded with a white powder which he said was an indicator it got wet or was in a very humid environment for some time. Probably sat in warehouse months before shipping out to us. Ordered Linksys Phone Adapter which uses regular house phone and been gravy ever since. Should have known better, and linksys was cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible phone, unreliable","review":"Bought this phone when I signed up for Vonage less than a year ago. In 9 months, this phone has died twice unexpectedly. The first time it died, I could not receive calls or dial out. Trying to replace it through Vonage customer service was a joke. After at least 6 hours of hold times, and repeatedly explaining the problem they finally sent me a new one. I was without my phone for a whole month (completely unacceptable for running a business) and had to pay the shipping for the replacement phone. Thanks Vonage! Just four months later, the second phone has now completely died. Once again, Vonage customer service has proved to be no help. I took matters into my own hands and bought a Vonage/Linksys router with a regular phone. Everything works fine now so far. Fingers crossed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major issues with this phone","review":"I bought this phone originally through vonage and within 3 months it didn't work. No dial tone. Just got all static and quit working within a few day. After many hours on the phone with vonage troubleshooting (what a joke), they sent me a new one. Needless to say 4 months later i have the same exact problem, but this time it was a \\"power addapter problem\\". and this time it wouldn't light up. So once again tried vonages customer service.They are sending me a new one since it is still under warranty. But i just went ahead and ordered a whole new system from Staples and fingers crossed this works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone since 2004","review":"I have used this phone system since I got vonage in 2004. I have had the power supply burn out once in 2008, of course after 4 years of constant use I was not surprised that it had burned out. Vonage sent me a whole new system to replace my current one free of charge. However, you can easily pick up an adapter a radio shack, wal-mart if you do not want to be without a phone.I see alot of complaints about the power supplies burning out, however this is usally due to the fact that they are designed to burn out if you get a power surge, there is a fuse inside to protect the system. The key is to have it on good surge protector, as with any power suppy.The phone has all of the features I need and more, caller ID, call waiting, internal calls, speaker phone, phone book. The only feature it does not have is Speed dial. While not made anymore, you can still get reburbished handsets, and bases online. New batterys, and power supplys are also still available."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRASH!!!!","review":"You get what you pay for, thought I was saving money but still getting a compatible phone for my Vonage system.. it was compatible it just didn't work..Phones would not charge and base would not boot up. several calls later with Vonage I found out these are discontinued old models.. don't waste you money or time. I did it for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor reliability","review":"I had a power supply go bad but you can't just get a power supply, you have to buy the whole system or a handset and charger (if you can find one). Now all we get is static, I'm switching to the router so I can use a real phone. It's a little disappointing because I like Vtech. Biggest issue with me is you can't get any help from Vtech because it's a Vonage product and Vonage acts like they have no idea what to do about it. I would not buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic book","review":"This is a cute story, but what I like best is the way my 4 month old daughter \\"tells\\" the story with me.

Unlike Phillips, all photographs have been shot in situ.

Its been a good friend during math tests. I can' attest to how difficult it is to navigate compared to some of the newer models, but its not hard to figure out. Also it will convert decimals to fractions, though it takes more than just pressing one button. I'm not sure about the tables, though I seem to remember doing something with that in High School.

Avoid this travesty.","review":"I loved almost every one of the original vintage patterns in this book but hated all of the updated versions. In their attempt to update the patterns for modern tastes, they stripped them of every facet of character, interest, fit and attractiveness. I would eagerly buy a book of the original patterns but each of the updated patterns featured here is hideous. They have ruined them. It almost made me cry and it did make me despair over the human race. The way they have altered the patterns is truly a sacrilege, taking every single attractive feature and removing it, replacing it with something ugly. It had to be deliberate and it crossed my mind that it could be some sort of bad joke. But, no, their taste is really that bad. To add insult to injury, they suggest using tacky synthetic yarns for the projects. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got my order!!!","review":"I think I would love the book, but the seller never sent it to me. I tried to contact the seller several times, and got no response.

Being a writer, I've found that this book has saved me a lot of grief. If I need to be educated about the kinds of rocks that can be found in caves, all I have to do is look up caves and it gives me the name and description of as many cave related things as they could possibly think of. It saves me from having to do a mountain of research on a subject that I touch on for only a few pages. It also has some slang that is not usually seen in the dictionary, such as what \\"BTW\\" means in those IM messages. Fast, easy, and since I'm a bookworm, fun as well. It can't get much better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for children","review":"I have been given grief over my low rating of this item. However I would have liked to know before I bought this book for my child that it had an entire section on sexual deviance and graphic descriptions.

It is a remarkable and poignant story of how individuals in a society keep living as the world around slowly spins into insanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Martin Goldsmith manages to combine multiple story lines - the story of his parents, his own discoveries of his family's history, the rise and fall of the Judische Kulturbunde - into a gripping and compelling story. Scenes are detailed with attention and compassion, and the imagery would easily translate onto the screen. I had some confusion in the beginning with keeping the different German roles straight, but the romance and growth of Martin's parents Gunther and Rosemarie anchor the story and provide a focal point for the narrative. The balance between the joys of performing the world's finest music and the terror of living in the world's most brutal state, between the struggle to maintain dignity in the face of that tyranny and the personal emotions revealed by delving into one's past, and the transitions between the author's present and the not-too-distant past also serve to create a story in the truest sense of the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different Holocaust story","review":"MG's story of his family during the early Nazi era is an unusual glimpse into the lives of German Jews during the period from 1933-1941. He writes about the Kulturbund, an organization created by the Nazis to (1) rid Germany of Jewish influence in the arts and (2) provide propaganda coverage of the maltreatment of Jews by the Third Reich.In my opinion the book is generally well written and seems to be the result of careful research. My one complaint is that MG frequently quotes conversations which I doubt have been recorded in any way. I don't like that in historical writing, but in this case I was willing to overlook it, because of my interest in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"The Inextinguishable Symphony is a moving as well as educational account of what life was like for Jews in Nazi Germany. It explores this topic in a new and interesting way through the eyes of two Jewish musicians struggling to keep art and culture alive amidst the oppression and cruelty of the Nazi regime. Martin Goldsmith does a masterful job of presenting the poignant story of his parents' relationship within the historical context. He uses their life story as a springboard to explore the life of the entire Jewish community of Berlin under Nazi rule. It is a well-written and incredibly moving book, one that I would recommend highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I started Martin Goldsmith's \\"The Inextiguishable Symphony\\" a few days ago and have had to force myself to put it down. It is a masterful combination of a good story told well. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in history or music.This has the potential to become a classic. I can see it being used, for instance, in high school English classes. I also think it would make a beautiful movie.Kudos to Martin Goldsmith for a superb book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Heroes!","review":"While the book was intriguing and often moving, I don't understand why the author seems to feel his parents were somehow heroic. Gratefully, they survived. That, in and of itself, is not heroic, however. I found it very disturbing that while his parents managed to escape to America, with great help from benevolent benefactors, it appears that neither his mother nor his father did anything to try and rescue their parents or siblings who were still trapped by the Nazi's in Germany or France. Moreover, the author's parents evidently wrote infrequently to family members in Nazi controlled Europe once they got to the United States even when the exchange of mail was still possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Funky Stuff!","review":"James Carter, once again, proves himself to be the most entertaining of jazz's new hotshots.

Thank you James, for making a lively recording that makes you want to get up and move. Surrounding himself with great musicians and spicing things up with just enough of that \\"out\\" style, this CD is a rocking blast of fresh air. I'm a big fan as a result. I hope the rest of the jazz illiterati listens and takes some notes on how the music can be entertaining and not simply an intellectual pursuit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much addoo about nothing","review":"I cannot share the enthusiasm about this CD. Nobody will doubt James Carter's qualities as a saxophonist. However, this does not make this CD a satisfying musical experience.

They're nice, but the mouse also works fine without those features if you don't want to use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mouse ever","review":"This is my favorite mouse ever because of the way it fits my hand (size 8.5 glove), the ease of use of the progammable buttons and the ease in using the provided software to program the buttons.I bought several of these and apparently they have found their way to the USA from China through Mexico.One of the best things about this mouse is that it is available in a left handed version which is unique (not the same as this one so search around for it if you're a southpaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"I bought this mouse for work a little less than a year ago, and it has been outstanding. Great fit for the hand, nice additional buttons - the volume control is handy, and I love a mouse wheel that doesn't rotate freely.However, it now appears to randomly double-click when i simply left click one time. At first it wasn't happening too often but after a few weeks, it happens about 80% of the time. Nothing feels physically wrong with the mouse, but it just decides to double-click instead. It shouldn't be hard to imagine just how completely mind numbing this can turn out to be when trying to navigate a computer. I disabled all Logitech software and it still happens, so it seems likely the hardware has worn out somewhere. If it had lasted a couple years at least, I'd consider it again, but definitely not until they can take care of this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mouse","review":"Love this mouse.

But here are the problems:1) The email and im buttons only work with a few software products. I use Thunderbird and the email button doesn't work.2) I've had the mouse for 4 months and am already on my third set of batteries! This mouse does not save you battery power.3) It's become very 'figity' lately - jumping around on the screen sometimes and very sensitive to double clicks.4) The SetPoint software from Logitech is buggy. Each time I start my PC it tells me that I need to reinstall SetPoint (which I have no to no avail)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent precission!!!!! nice design and lots of buttons","review":"Since I bought this mouse my computer experience has changed. I feel more comfortable with this mouse than the microsoft wireless explorer. The MX has volume control, e-mail and IM button. I haven't used the \\"notice lights\\" but I am very happy and satisfied with it. The accuracy is astonishing. It really follows your hand. It has better accuracy than the explorer. The explorer requieres a big communication/antena base. The MX uses just a USB connector. I got a USB extension cable though to keep it close to the area where the mouse is and reduce potential interference. The design is somewhat similar to the explorer, but my hand feels more comfortable on this. It turns on and off by itself. It uses two AA batteries every 2 or 3 months. With this mouse I don't miss the explorer!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice","review":"I'm very pleased with my choice of the Logitech MX 610 Cordless Laser Mouse.

It eats batteries though. In the beginning, the batteries lasted just over 2 months. Now they only last about a month.For the first 6 months, I could use on any surface without any problems. Over time, the mouse movement started to get jerkey. After about 6 months, the jerkiness renders the mouse pretty much useless.If you like to swap batteries and only keep mice around for about 5 months, then this is the mouse for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally junk","review":"Mouse falls asleep too often. When I suddenly move the mouse, it comes awake, but the pointer laggs really badly for couple of seconds. Never seen such thing like this. I have MS notebook wireless mouse, logitech cordless optical mouse, logitech vx revolution, MS wireless desktop mouse 1000. The mx610 is the only mouse that laggs so badly, and seem to have heave interferance with other 2.4 GHz devices such as bluetooth and 802.11g wireless lan. It's really hard to use.

Laser reads movement accurately. Scrolls nicely, clicks accurately. Shuts itself off when not in use so battery life is excellent (on the order of months). Wakes up by just moving the mouse a bit. I'm not a \\"power user\\" of mouse buttons and have no interest in the email button and other custom buttons and disabled them. But for me, this mouse performs the key functions of a mouse very very well on all fronts without the cord and without constant battery changes -- which is just what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to try this mouse!","review":"I love this mouse!

Affordable alternative to the Bluetooth mouse and an ergonomic design. I have tendonitis in my thumb and I recommend this mouse to anyone with problems with their thumb/hand that seem to be aggravated when using a regular mouse. The cordless & ergonomic design of this mouse makes a world of difference to my hand. Also the accessory buttons are a nice added feature and easy to use. Also nice is the fact that it has a power button on the bottom which lets you turn off the mouse when not in use and save your batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erratic mouse movement, bad software and...","review":"... very bad battery life. I just own this mouse for a month and I have just thrown it into my drawer for its life. Logitech software often crash my computer no matter how many times I have reinstalled and clean my registry. The mouse movement is not smooth and this happen quite often. I need to unplug the IR USB and re-plug into another USB port of my computer. Then it will start working fine. It just wasting my time and annoying. It also have so many useless buttons when you can't get logitech software to work on your computer.Another weakness is the battery life which only last about a month with a brand new Duracell. Unless you have rechargeable batteries lying around your house, if not, I suggest to get a charger and a set of batt. Good Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Everyday Mouse","review":"I've had this mouse for about a month and it has been great. It replaced my war torn MX 700 (which was awesome). The cordless aspect with integrated power button works very well. How novel! A wireless device with an off switch! (there in lies the reason why i switched from the mx700) Didn't bother installing the Logitech software (didnt need it and i find it doesnt work properly w/ certain games and firefox). Overall this mouse is great and really easy to use, and this way i wont have to worry about charging batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad!","review":"This is about my SIXTH Logitech mouse now over these many years. I even had this same model a few months ago, but I let my kid talk me out of it.Silly me. THAT one was a DREAM compared to this piece of junk.I have had this since, oh, maybe April, & the problems are just getting worse every day.This mouse skips all over the page, constantly makes me wait to use the cursor again, plus it eats batteries like there's no tomorrow.FRUSTRATING describes this mouse to a tee!I cannot believe how horrible this mouse is! I'd like to throw it out of the window, but that would be adding insult to injury.I'm going to the Logitech pages next, but I'm not hopeful. Then I'll look on the blogs.I hope to find a solution....Probably won't.I did my research before I bought this, but the previous one worked so well, I never thought I'd have any problems with this one. HAH!!No more Logitech mice here."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Cheap USB Receiver - broke","review":"After less than 1 year of use, the small USB Mini-Receiver broke and now the mouse is ruined. I will have to order a replacement and I'm sure with shipping it won't be cheap. Battery life was good because of the \\"smart\\" technology, but no matter how 'smart' the thing is, I still need a working receiver! And the quality of that little piece is horrible, it always wobbled.. and now it is non-functioning. Logitech made a good mouse, but paired it with an unreasonably cheap Mini-USB Receiver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erratic","review":"Bought a cordless notebook laser mouse by another manufacturer which worked thought a regular size cordless laser mouse would be even better. Wrong, like the other Logitech cordless mice I have had it tracks erratically, and can not be used near other cordless products. Do not plug receiving unit in the back of a PC because it will not track at all (only a maximum of three feet.) Do not waste your money on a cordless mouse from Logitech especially if used for games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage with pretty LED's","review":"If you're a gamer or a graphic designer, look elsewhere. The power saving function of the mouse makes it shut off until it feels motion. So if you're not using the mouse for just a little bit, it powers down and waits for movement.It's a very ergonomic mouse, with responsive buttons and nice LED indicators, but if it can't let you move around the screen when you need it to it's not much more than a (bad) paperweight. Move along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I was hoping for","review":"I am very happy with this mouse and would recommend it to everyone. It looks good, but more importantly, it feels good. Button placement, weight, smoothness, everything was done well. Coming from wired mice, the lack of a wire is very freeing. I am also especially happy with how small the USB radio receiver is. I am using this mouse on a laptop and love how inobtrusive it is.What's strange is I bought the S 530 desktop set for Mac at the same time. The mouse in that set looks nearly identical (except for color). However, it has a different weight and simply doesn't feel quite as comfortable to use. It only fits the hand the same but once you move it, it lacks the same comfort and ease of use as this mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Mouse but Email/IM Buttons Do NOT Work","review":"It is a nice mouse all around. But the core feature it advertises does NOT work. I use outlook 2003, the button actually flashs when outlook finishes send/receive, however, it flashs even I have no new email. For the IM, I tried MSN 7.5 and Windows Messenger, none of them ever work.No support / help show you how to configure it. Seems no one make IM work in the Logitech web forum. My 2 stars rating might be a bit low because it is a nice laser cordless mouse. However, it cannot deliver what it promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a better wireless mouse","review":"I got this mouse as a gift about 4 months ago; I find it to be very uncomfortable because I'm left handed and I have small hands.I've developed carpal tunnel syndrome my left hand because of it.

I'm going to give it to my right handed son and find another mouse that will be comfortable for my hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute waste of $50","review":"This is possibly the worst mouse I have ever seen in my entire life. I just bought this mouse today and the mouse pointer precision is horrible!

I've had it for over 2 months and have yet to change batteries. The mouse is comfortable to use for an extended period of time. I especially like the volume controls. The IM and Email buttons are basically worthless, but I wouldn't use them anyway so this is minor to me.

Coulter's is loyal to the boys' club that created her. The bottom line is that her books are making money and serving their political purpose.Coulter has become a part of a National trend that promotes anger and insults in public (like the late Wally George).

I put this book and Ann in the same catagory as Ann Landers, only Landers actually has something important to say.I have to wonder how much the GOP is paying her to spew this crap. Armstrong got $250k, she had better be making a lot more than that to sacrifice any sort of credibility she ever had. If you liked this book, buy Unfit for Command.If you want a real journalist and a well written book try Exception to the Rulers by Amy Goodman - 1401301312. Now there is some one with some jounralistic integrity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coulter Charisma!","review":"Ann Coulter is a sassy lady with the intelligence to go with it. She has provided wise analysis of the political scene along with sharp wit to tease the liberal and entertain the conservative. It is a great self-help book for those seeking a change from the left side and a welcome refresher to those of the right persuasion.Although the book pulls from Coulter's weekly columns which the reader may or may not have read previously, the book covers a spread of topics that will surely find your nerve button. She doesn't hold back on the people she views with contempt. It's fun to read... laughter and heightened blood pressure all on the same page.I do feel the Elian Gonzalez \\"section\\" was overdone. Too much for the simple subject it is. However, the book is strong in its message and worthy of the Bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone can write a book these days...","review":"It doesn't matter if you ignore the facts and instead just rant and rave.

Beyond a nice set of legs, the author is lacking of any redeaming qualities so she must resort to shock statements which actually lack in shock because her political commentary and jabs at liberals are little more than recycled jokes and predictable cheap shots. Im convinced that if Ms Coulter had an original idea, it would die of lonliness. This was really a very lame read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled Talking Points","review":"Anyone hoping to find something new in this book will be sorely disappointed. If you read Ann Coulter's column, then you have already read this book. This material is old in another aspect as well. Ms. Coulter has a bad habit of repeatedly attacking straw men; straw men created by herself. Things are rarely as simple as partisans like Coulter make them out to be. I don't think the \\"liberals\\" that she writes about even exist in significant numbers, so why waste so much hand-wringing over them? I mean, who really takes Ted Kennedy seriously anymore? It doesn't take a sharp wit to call him a drunk. Most career politicians end up as parodies of themselves toward the end of their careers. Insular members of the commentator crowd, like Coulter, make the mistake of assuming that these characters represent the average members of society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going Soft","review":"Ann Coulter is going soft. In this book she pulls some of her punches. I wish she would go at it a little harder like she did in Treason. That was a wild book. This book is a big let down after reading that one. If you didn't read any other books by Ann yet, go for Treason first. This one is at the bottom of the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even more rediculous right wing propaganda.......","review":"I like to consider myself a left-leaning centrist and read this book only because of the enormous amount of press Ann Coulter has received over these last few years. Her views of the world are too simplistic and never really makes a valid argument while making herself look like a raving lunatic. She is an embarrassment not only to the political right (of which I am admittedly not a member of), but truly a disgrace to American values and liberals everywhere alike. If you like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Hannity and Colmes you will certainly will like this fear-inducing, hate-spewing work of trash.

She is still is. Still nasty, still evil, still gross. If it were not for the GOP book clubs this book would not be high up on the Amazon list, as it is. The GOP tells members to buy these books even if they are crap, so it looks like a good read, and it might recruit some poor soul into their web of deception. I read the book half way through, then i got a rush of diarrhea, and could take it no more. I wish i could get my money back. You still make people sick Ann, the GOP is glad to have you.

All of her columns are available at her web site and I have already read them so there was nothing new in this book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the Normal Trash","review":"You will only enjoy this book if you are radically right-wing.

She has even less regard for facts than she does for people with liberal thinking.By the way, Jesus was a liberal."},{"rating":"1","title":"What makes her so angry?","review":"Presumably Ann's virulent assaults in this book on a non-existent enemy are motivated at least in part by a desire for publicity and money. One wonders what else fuels her politics; probably a deeply rooted anger and emotional frustration. Like an unfortunate individual with incurable halitosis, her attacks on her target follow a well-worn pathway, which no doubt makes sense to right-wingers who never associate with anyone unlike themselves.

It is not about truth or lies, it is simply about a woman who is either so full of herself or her \\"witticisms\\" that she employs neither a filter nor any scrutiny of her informaton. Ann Coulter is absolutely (regardless of how well-written or entertaining her prose may be) the single most odious, repugnant, and unchristian squawk-box on either side of the political spectrum. My advice is for everyone to stop enabling her by refusing to purchase anything from which she may profit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A women of many tactics","review":"Sometimes she raves and sometimes she rants, the really interesting parts are when she tries to do both at the same time.This book is better then \\"Treason\\" because it stays away from a topic that Ann knows nothing about (the history of the Cold War) and stays more towards current events.And that's fine everyone is entitled to an a point of view the problem with Ann's arguments in all of her books are threefold1. I'm right and you're wrong2. I don't have to listen to you3. I don't even have to acknowledge that you exist (look at the title)So what it all boils down to are examples that are as idiotic as the premise.

It's better to support companies like Georgia Pacific that plans on dumping 160 million gallons of toxic waste a day into the St, Johns river than have the scorn of a hot blond like you (NOT).

And awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vomitous","review":"As with all her previous books, this one is full of vomit, lies, and distortions. Don't you just love her dominatrix vest on the cover?

I have to admit, I love political humor. But this book was completely worthless dreck. All of the assertions and arguements she makes lose both their credibility and their humor since it is clear she has done absolutely not an ounce of research for this book. She makes radical claims about everyone from Bill Clinton to Al Franken that aren't supported by a shred of evidence. At least Al Franken's books are impeccably researched. She wrote this book just to be inflammatory. I think this country has enough division right now without people like Ann Coulter trying to make things worse for the sole purpose of pulling people further apart. Her hate mongering is really kind of frightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Republicans Beware","review":"I am a Republican but i believe in fair and balanced discussion, unlike FOX, unlike Coulter, unlike many news agencies both liberal and conservative.

Coulter, like Rush Limbaugh, is proudly smug. She flaunts her contempt for anyone who doesn't subscribe to the right-wing, neoconservative partyline. She is an embarrassment to any traditionalist conservative.People such as Coulter, Hannity and Limbaugh do not neccessarily write books to inform. Instead they much rather preach to the converted, entertaining and reaffirming the same old thing for their fans and followers who suffer through life with siege mentalities.Anyone who finds anything insightful or worthy in this woman's books cannot criticize a Bill Maher or George Carlin without looking like a partisan hypocrite. Coulter is just as vulgar and hateful as those two can be. In fact she's worse. They're funny and are essentially good-hearted. She's neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slap or a hug?","review":"I don't know if I want to hug her or slap her.

But of course you won't learn that here."},{"rating":"1","title":"This actually sells???","review":"Ann Coulter thinks she is far more clever than reality shows. The truth is that every single country has their quacks and loonies, yet only in America are these people actually taken seriously. She spews forth garbage like this and poor saps buy it and make her a fortune. I honestly can't believe how many suckers there are in the world, but I guess I learn something new every day.This book is only funny in a sad sense. Ann Coulter represents the worst that humanity has to offer all rolled into one neat package! Maybe instead of buying this book you people could have an outburst of intellectual curiosity and buy something classic; maybe a Hemingway, Faulkner, Melville or Dickens novel. But hey, who am I kidding right?I leave you with a quote by Wilhelm von Leeb, a German general: \\"A businessman whose wares are good does not need to boost them in the loudest tones of a market crier.\\"Try to figure out how it applies to Ann Coulter."},{"rating":"1","title":"The nutcase is at it again","review":"More ignorant ravings from the conservative whacko that tried to defend McCarthy's witch-hunt, said that we needed to kill the leaders of non-Christian faiths and force them to convert to Christianity, and said her only regret about Tim McVeigh was that he didn't assassinate the people at the New York Times. Coulter has been proven time and time again to be a liar on par with Rush Limbaugh. Her \\"books\\" are always rife with lies and ad-hominem attacks, all the while complaining that those evil liberals do it. It frightens me that the people that think she's saying anything politically relevant are allowed to vote. Try taking your blinders off and watch Coulter when someone with facts confronts her. She falls to pieces and is unable to factually defend her ignorant statements, and instead resorts to attacking the person that dared question her - which is the typical Republican reaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Talk to a Liberal...","review":"Talking to a liberal can be entertaining and fun! Just follow these three simple steps and you'll do just fine:1. Use logic and verifiable facts.2. Refrain from invoking The Bible as the final authority on reality.3. Share *your own* political conclusions, not those of AM radio talking heads. (Please note: If you do not have your own political opinions, perhaps it really is best not to speak to a liberal. 'Ditto-heads,' marked by their lack of independent thinking, are easily recognized, and no liberal wants to hear the rants of a political parrot.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"rants from a mad woman.. she needs a true man","review":"I honestly don't believe that a rational human being can believe a fraction of the madness she espouses.

You know- the first joke is hilarious, the second is funny, third gives a chuckle, the fourth you wish could be as funny as the first. However with this book you get to the fifth joke, and your feeling is \\"this lady is truly and deeply mean\\".

We need to take off our filters for a moment and walk in someone else's shoes. We keep going into the conversation taking the most extreme position knowing we will lose some ground, but if we talked about what we really cared about and what was really important then we would find that we have more in common than not. At that point it would make the decision process a lot easier. I think that it is about time that we as a country grow up and stop with the name calling. I give Ann's book 2 stars because of the title revolving around discussion and because she then uses it as a vehicle to drive a stake between us. I believe that her real goal is a dividing the enemy to make manipulation easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Republican's with nothing better to do","review":"Yet another washed out example of how Republicans waste their time attacking liberals instead of doing something for our government.

What gives?NOTE i've skimmed two of her books, because I'm so soft headed that I actually think I can learn from my opponents. I give her two stars for chutzpah. (Somebody explain to her what chutzpah is.)In constrast, read the amazon.com reviews of Frank Rich's \\"The Greatest Story ever Sold,\\" which seems to make the usual liberal attempt to be fair and somewhat respectful of his opponents.

Ann Coulter is a bomb thrower who makes her living making outrageous and intentionally provocative statements to fire up an audience of know-nothings and ditto-heads. Unfortunately, this is a very large constituency in America as demonstrated by the popularity of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and the current occupant of the White House.Regardless, the tide is turning, and Americans who bought the right-wing's lies are starting to see the inevitable results in war, economic decline, and lost credibility. Expect Ann Coulter and the rest of the right's propagandists and apologists to get even louder and more shrill as their cause, along with their president, sinks into history's junk pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly what is expected of a smart writer","review":"A true dissapointment that this book is only a rehash of every attack on liberal dogma ever said; it brings nothing new to the table and is not really an informative book, but only Ann Coulter's way of taking advantage of the country's political climate. She hardly instructs how to debate isues with liberals instead just goes on a rampage that is sure to widen the breach between americans in a time where we should all stand together. Her book will sell because it is incendiary and adequate for its intent (make fast money before the election and it's hype are over), however it is a kind of propaganda literature that strives to divide not reconcile. In summary, it actually says nothing about how to rationally discuss ideas with other people (in this case liberals) it only seems to attack people for their views.

Have you noticed how most conservative talkies tend to freak-out when they get into a hot debate about reality?

I listened to this book on cd, and it is hilarious. Coulter doesn't hold back when it comes to lambasting liberals, and her sarcasm comes through clearly in her voice. I think reading the book would lessen its impact unless you're very familiar with Coulter's style and personality. However, while the book will have you laughing out loud, inside you'll be cringing at the absolute accuracy of her comments. Yes, she's witty and sarcastic, but she's also right. Wonderful book; excellent as an audio cd. Either way you \\"read\\" it, it will be an education."},{"rating":"1","title":"People actually pay money for her books?","review":"Coulter states that the way to make a liberal happy is to attack the United States. Again, Ms. Coulter fails to see the distinction between the government and the United States. But, like many on the far, far, far, far right she has no trouble whatsoever with that concept whenever a Democrat occupies the White House. Only when a Republican does. How she and other on the far, far, far, far right can do this I have no idea. I myself would be self aware of that level of hypocrisy. The United States is great by people who have made it better, not by people who have loved the status quo. People like MLKjr, Cady Stanton and of the founders Paine and Madison. Indeed if Ms. Coulter was a just older I am sure she would have been one on the far, far,far right who called King unamerican and a traitor. Strange how people that the far right once hated they now call their own. Maybe one day the far right will embrace Michael Moore. Who knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, pointed, and backed up by facts, just like I like it.","review":"Ann Coulter doesn't pull punches. She doesn't care how you feel about what she thinks. I bought this book figuring I'd disagree with a lot of it, since she's so anti-liberal she must let her beliefs cloud her sense of judgement. Much to my surprise, I found that she really has her stuff together, she knows her facts, and she has the ability to cut through the cloud of junk that obscures many issues and makes it crystal clear. I found her columns on the Elian Gonzales fiasco the most informative thing I have read in years. And she backed it up with her knowledge of the law and the facts of the case. Wow.Even if you don't agree with her politics, her writing style is great and it's fun read. She could use a better editor, though, some of the technical aspects of her writing are too conversational in structure and hard to read at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore fest","review":"I wish I could give an in-depth review about this book, but is so poorly written that I kept falling a sleep while I was trying to read it.

But what is of real intrigue here is Coulter's giant, mue-tant, radioactive prominentia laryngea, which appears to grow exponentially from book to book.

Be very afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End of Civil Society","review":"Ann Coulter properly points out that civil discussion in this country has been reduced to liberals spitting out slogans in a loud enough voice to drown any opponent out. Turn on any of the alleged news channels to verify this for yourself. Logic, facts, rational discourse are all submerged in ranting and chanting. Ms. Coulter has been on the receiving end of this first hand.To me, the situations she describes are similar to the lack of discourse in the late 60s. \\"Make love, not war\\" was never a rational argument or a basis for intelligent discussion. Neither is \\"F'ing Bush and his f'ing oil buddies are in this war for profit.\\"We need more rational voices, like Ann Coulter's excellent presentation in this book. Read it for yourself with an open mind and see if she doesn't have valid points.p.s. It's also a lot of fun if you have any sense of humor at all. I used to think the Republicans lacked a sense of humor but now it is the rabid Left that shows no appreciation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good the Bad and the Liberals","review":"This is the first Ann Coulter book I have read and am looking forward to getting another one.

I am certain that any semi-intelligent person reading this book will learn some eye opening facts.Ann Coulter tells it how it is which will anger you if you are liberal.

Buckley, Jr. However, quick wit and a sharp tongue, albeit in an attractive feminine package, do not political wisdom make. Just as Ann has written \\"How to Talk to a Liberal\\", another American has made a film, which might be sub-titled \\"How to Talk About a Conservative (President)\\". I am speaking of Michael Moore's film \\"Fahrenheit 9/11.\\" Both of these political diatribes seem to be based upon doctrinaire ideologies which care little about the truth, only about partisan perceptions of reality. It is not clear to me how democracy can survive without some spirit of civility and compromise, which seems to be lacking in both of these ideologues."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a truly sad, bitter old spinster","review":"Not surprising that Coulter has never married or even had a partner. Who'd want to marry a psycho like her anyway? Coulter will never know what its like to have a loving spouse or raise a family, which makes her obscene comments about the 9/11 widows and their families all the more ludicrous.

Following their road is a one way ticket down the slippery slope toward an American version of fascism. Just look at the cover! Coulter already has her Puss 'n' Boots outfit on for her duty at the faith-based reeducation/concentration camp! I agree with what comedian/actor Richard Belzer has said about Crazy Coulter: She's just a fascist party doll. I think bile has seeped into her cranial cavity and impeded the thinking process.

It's all about twisting and distorting facts to support their viewpoints and resorting to mud slinging and insults in the place of calm intellectual debate. Probably because they are all hysterical (and not capable of being calm) and have little intellect or logic to back up their side of things.BTW - to 'Liz' below who called this book a 'novel'.

After the first chapter, I had to find out where she went to school because I expected that she might not have been as well educated as her credentials contend.

Ann Coulter is a Conservative genius. She pokes holes in the liberal agenda like no one else. She is intelligent, and makes very good arguements. The only reason this book got 4 stars instead of 5 is because the last chapter was a bit dull. This is some of her earlier writing, and therefore was not the best. She should have put this chapter closer to the beginning, so it wouldn't be the last thing the reader remembers.Other than the last chapter, this book is filled with great humor, while still being informative and making her arguements.

I suppose people who are fans of Coulter think such sentiments are okay as long as the infidels are being converted to follow Jesus and the free market.Coulter has zero credibility among reasonable and intelligent people. Since most of her fans are drooling troglodytes, I'll make my point clear. What you can conclude from this statement is this: if you like Ann Coulter, you are a cryptofascist toady who is neither reasonable nor intelligent.Amazon provides no selection for Zero stars.

I drank a gallon of Senekot and waited for the magic to begin.40 minutes later, I had finally lined up a fantastic date with Ann in my restroom.

It's one thing to have your values but quite another to think of people different from you as mindless idiots who live to destroy what you care for, as Ms. Coulter so breathlessly insists. I suspect that the reason why conservatism is losing power fast, as a previous reviewer wrote, is because they are stereotyped by many as arrogant self-righteous Christians who refuse to accept new ideas no matter how logically sound they are.

It has the fundamental flaw of suggesting that a purely conservative doctrine is the way to save/build a nation.

Buy Gertz's book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgy, but truthful","review":"This is a compilation of Coulter's columns where she defends her views and points out the mistakes or outright omissions of other newspapers. As usual, Coulter is abrasive which I find distracting but like Savage, this is her style. There are many times she says what many conservatives are thinking and then some. Either way, she exposes the liberal media for the biased and hypocritical lot they are while showing us that not all liberals, especially with the last name Kennedy, are annoyingly narrow-minded. It is a shame John Jr died so tragically and early, who knows what kind of world we would have with him still here in charge of George..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Ann Coulter is so into herself that she never even stop to analyze what she was saying. She completely skips over points in history that are significant in her accounts of what happened. In some reviews they calim that \\"her anger makes her dead on\\".....B.S. Her anger proves that the only way to get her point across is to be in your face. Any sane person can figure out that anger only means defense, that leads to cause. If your right, why be defensive. When I know that I am right I don't argue or get angry because I know! This book is well written. I don't deny her passion and intelligence, but she needs to let get off her opinion and grasp reallity. In social reallity one opinion means no more than another. Balancing truth vs opinion is hard to do but she is a smart lady and she should figure it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is retarded","review":"Overly conservative to the point of lunacy, her only option to sell a book is to put her full body picture on the cover and hope that someone who forgot their glasses picks it up that day and thinks she's hot.

Rather than fostering a full and respectful dicussion of the issues and the free exchange of ideas in this democracy, Coulter instead actively encourages the throwing of rhetorical tomatoes at \\"the enemy\\". When insult replaces civil argument, we all suffer. And when people with differing political ideas are persecuted and targeted as the enemy, democracy itself breaks down. From what I have seen thus far, Coulter's few well-reasoned arguments are dramatically overshadowed by her vitriol. Save your money - you'll likely hear the few interesting soundbytes worth reading during the talk show promotional tour she is on."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANN COULTER is indeed RIGHT!!","review":"This is a great book with many of her columns included.

Her commentary covers the war on terrorism, the 2004 presidential election, the state of the Democratic Party, Max Cleland, Bill Clinton, and Freedom of speech is just some of her topics.I finished this in one day. Ms. Coulter is a brilliant writer that is intelligent, witty, and sarcastic. Combine that with her logical and candid manner and you can see why this very articulate woman is on the bestseller list. A very easy read. This book is entertaining and thought-provoking.Media attacks her all the time that is why I had to get one of her books. After hearing her I am amazed at irresponsible criticisms that have been falsely leveled at this woman. She backs all she says with facts.

Google this garbage - don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She's a divider, not a uniter","review":"The title of the book summarizes what is wrong with it. Ideologues like Coulter are dividing Americans against each other so that they are shouting at each other in anger, rather than engaging in rational discussions of the issues. This has a very bad effect on American society and leads to gridlock and a failure to solve the country's problems.I'm strongly on the liberal side on most (but not all) issues, but I enjoy talking with people who disagree with me, as long as the converstation is kept on a polite, rational basis and does not deteriorate to shouting. I think if one only talks to people who agree with you, one doesn't ever really learn anything. Speaking to people who disagree with you and challenge your preconceptions is a valuable learning experience. But for this to work, one has to really LISTEN to what the other side is saying.If I were to write a book on this issue, I would entitle it \\"How to Talk to a Conservative, Because you Really Should.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Things have changed","review":"I have always trusted Star Baton, however, it's been so long since I've bought one.

In any case, you don't pay attention to Photoshop which is what you bought this book for.Besides that, the text does not provide really useful details. details. For example, the section about color management hardly scratches the surface of this topic and is next to useless.Instead of this book I highly recommend the \\"Real World\\" series by Bruce Fraser et al. and the (admittedly advanced) books of Katrin Eismann.But do yourself a favour and avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photoshop CS2 Book","review":"Easy to read and follow.

Just before the serious reader gives up on the book, it finally gets us to Adobe Bridge and the beginnings of information with substance. Though the book is filled with useful practical information, it is so bloated with banter-like filler that it makes for tedious reading. Like so many other of these types of how-to computer books, the some 450 pages could easily be condensed to half the size. But the publisher needs have justification to charge $40 for the book, hence the filler.

The book fails to explain the concepts of key areas like layers, and just gives the sequence of keystrokes to get something done (it is very hard in Photoshop, to extrapolate from sequence of keystrokes to understanding \\"complex\\" functionality). For some simple things is fine, but to empower you to further explore Photoshop is not enough.

Just one example would be to have an explanation of all the different \\"Modes\\" with-in the \\"Brush tool\\" I.e. normal, dissolve, darken, multiply, etc. What does each do, and when is the appropriate time to use each?

Kelby's knowledge of Photoshop may be unparalleled, but I'm not going to be able to take advantage of it because his style drives me insane.

It is also a gripping tale of a lost soul who, throughout many spinning ordeals, succeeds in finding inner peace. Her journey is a gossipy, bold, sometimes touching sometimes funny, inspiring roller coaster ride that will be enjoyed by many.

This is a fabulous book, in my opinion. It's an easy read, devoid of the lyrical meanderings that otherwise might exist had this been penned by someone else, a more accomplished writer, for example. And because it's an autobiography that tells it like it is, it is riveting. I found myself rooting for Janice to make it through her various personal crises all through the book.

Also, Dickinson thinks that every man in a room, or in a bar, is looking at her with \\"lust\\" and total desire.Dickenson is beautiful, but her book makes her seem to be a trailblazer for other models she refers to as \\"mutts\\". I won't be finishing this book with any delusions that hard work and persistance don't pay off, but \\"No Lifeguard on Duty\\" reads too much like fiction than fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave This Book Where It Is At","review":"I picked up this book thinking that it was going to be a tell-all book filled with celebrity gossip. This book is more about Janice's life in the modeling world. If you are interested in modeling, then you might enjoy this book, otherwise the many modeling world details will bore you. She comes from a horrible family life. As for Janice herself, in the book she portrays herself as someone who sleeps around for no good reason, not love, not money, just useless loose sexual relations. She does dish limited info on her few affairs with well known celebs, but she doesn't give any real juicy details. She seems rather self-important and by no means would I ever consider her the world's first supermodel. Naomi, Cindy, Elle, and Tyra, are supermodels. Janice is someone that wrote a book to be remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and Entertaining","review":"This is a cute book.

Not the first supermodel and certainly not the most interesting. I believe it was the mighty Lauren Hutton and Karen Graham who hold the title of the first and greatest. Even Twiggy and Jean \\"the Shrimp\\" Shrimpton, Veruska- so many others who left their mark on the history of the business. As a fashion editor for twenty five years now, I can guarantee that Ms. Dickenson was far from \\"super\\"- more like \\"super not dependable\\". This book was fun if you are into fiction but if you really want the truth, I suggest reading \\"Model\\" by Michael Gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the world's first trashy model-but NO WAY super!","review":"This book is a super waste of time and money. Some intelligent reviewers have already said it all. The reviewer \\"globetrotter\\" on August 29, 2002 wrote the best review of all. There's not much I can add to it except that I have seen Ms. Dickinson on several talk shows prior to her book and after its publication. She comes across as low class, abrasive, and disrespectful, and does nothing to deserve our sympathy. It was sickening how many times (in her book) she claims to have coined the word \\"supermodel\\" and claims to have been the world's first! Don't waste your money on this one. It deserves zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story ruined by language","review":"\\"No Lifeguard On Duty\\" is a remarkable memoir written in four-letter words, or more accurately one four-letter word.

Instead of recycling the book, as I do with most books, I trashed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I Rate it \\"No Stars\\"?","review":"I decided to read up on this Ms. Dickinson after catching her on a episode of \\"America's Next Top Supermodel\\" where she is a judge. I found her to be somewhat abrasive and now I know why. She should not be allowed to advise anyone on anythng. Her life as a sex addict and alcoholic as well as her unwillingness to accept people as they are is annoying not only on TV, but in her book. She comes across extremely shallow and is likely one of the reasons that young girls purge themselves given the fact that Ms. Dickinson constantly refers to the average woman as \\"huge\\". My advice to anyone seeking the advice of a mentor in a supermodel should stay clear away from this one. She likely spends much of her past earnings on a psychiatrist couch crying about her new and many wrinkles."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Accidental Book","review":"After reading the first 15 pages of the book, I was appalled at the numerous amounts of 4-letter words she used. A few 4-letter words are okay to make a point. But Janice couldn't write a book without using every other word as a 4-letter word starting with F and S. I am no saint, but there was too much profanity and not enough of her life as a model. She also put down other models, and called them \\"mutts\\", claiming she was the worlds first supermodel. I grew up with Janice and Gia and a few others, and I can tell you she was not the first supermodel. This book was written only to promote her upcoming TV show that airs in June of 2006. Janice needs to clean up most of her potty mouth and admit she has an inferiority complex that is in dire need of mending."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can you say","review":"So much vulnerability in this story...you get a great insight as to how Janice grew up, why she is as independent and tough as she is.

I never heard of her before she wrote this sad excuse of a book. She just rants and rants on about her problems and it doesn't seem to amaze her that modeling was the ONLY choice for her.

That's pretty much all you need to know. This movie was a favor for a friend.It is massively misguided in all ways. We've got a one-note main character (that note is \\"angry depression\\"), we've got a lot of rants against \\"the man\\" that aren't funny or perceptive or even weird, and we've got the main character's redemption thanks to Magic Negroes (yeah, it relies on that trope, so, yikes) who appear in his life to share their African wisdom.That said...

It is always refreshing to read of Hassel's experiences during the war, it reminds us that the German soldiers of the war were also men much like us and not the stereotypical Nazi of our mass media."},{"rating":"2","title":"mayhem","review":"I first read Hassel's books when I was a schoolboy in the early 1970s. It was very absorbing stuff for youngsters who had been raised on stories about good, clean heroes winning the Battle of Britain and El Alamein. Its realistic portrayal of war from the perspective of those supposedly soulless Nazi monsters helped develop a healthy scepticism about heroic depictions of the Allies. However, in time the books become a bit repetitive and nihilistic. I am sure that most German soldiers were not as cynical as Hassel's group. In the end most of them fought with despairing heroism to defend their country and families rather than out of National Socialist idealism. The series of books are entertaining in some ways but they can be a bit depressing with all the slaughter and mayhem after a while. I suppose they still appeal as they have been republished after a number of years out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound values","review":"I recently watched this and was very disappointed. I really love the music of Blackmore's Night. I have almost all of their CDs. But, having stated all of that, I just could not tolerate the poor sound production values. All of the vocals were distant and muddy. It sounded like the mikes were placed about 50 feet back in the audience. If I hadn't been familiar with these songs, I would had no idea of the lirics. There is no reason not to take the audio from the mixing board. This would have resulted in much better sound values. In all, I was not pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"What can be added to the other reviews. Outstanding performance, quality and value for money.

My first problem was with the bad writing, but I've stuck with poorly written books if they had a good plot. Next up was a one-dimensional (and annoying) protagonist. Thank goodness the protagonist was sexy or the author would have had to actually plot ways for her to get information instead of just promising dates in exchange for information. Luckily she was able to rely on her never fail sex appeal in pretty much every situation. Finally, when the author first referred to a character as \\"The Oriental\\" and next called him \\"The Asian\\", I was done. This wasn't a character's voice, it was the author's. Seriously? Today?

The explanation for this \\"theory\\" takes up most of this book and it doesn't take an M.D. or a D.C. to figure that out. Basically, this part of the book is filler. What is said in the rest of the book would fill a pamphlet. But hey, the guy wanted to write a book about his chiropractic specialty, the Atlas vertebrae and the Atlas orthogonal procedure. There may be something to it. But I found the whole book to be simply a lead-in to the business solicitation that takes up most of the last part of the book. It explains how an out-of-town patient can fly in and recieve intensive treatment over the course of a few days, and of course, glowing testimonials. This is an advertisement masquerading as a book. Proceed at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advertisement for his clinic","review":"This book is an advertisement for his clinic. The information is basic, and for chronic headache sufferers will be nothing new (exercise, sleep, breathe, and have a good attitude). The last chapter is dedicated to The Atlas, the top vertebrae in your spine, which he suspects is the culprit for chronic headache sufferers. It also invites you to fly to his clinic for treatment (which is necessary because his theory apparently isn't mainstream at this point either, which means most likely a doctor in your area cannot help).Unless you are actually interested in getting treatment at his clinic and want to know what exactly he does, I wouldn't bother buying this book if you're looking for information on headaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashed","review":"VHS tape arrived in a bubble pack envelope and the plastic case containing the tape was broken. inside thecase thetape had large chunks broken from it. there were no pieces in the envelope so I concludeed it was shipped in that condition.

For instance, the verb \\"estar\\" is used in place of the verb \\"hacer\\" to convey the weather (e.g. \\"esta frio\\" instead of \\"hace frio\\"). That ended my faith right then and there as I do not want to sound like a dumb American when traveling. The editors should be ashamed that the linguistic background of the author is so lacking that he'd make this error and who knows how many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy music, but not practical for a serious learner","review":"The music and format make the tape tolerable. When the woman repeats the phrase in Spanish, however, the music covers up her clear pronunciation, making it hard to hear and learn.

This album is a jazzy and soulful style of urban-pop. His music is reflection of the craftsmanship of musicians of yesteryear who caressed lush ballads and sensuous mid-tempo songs like they were rare,precious stones. He played everything himself on the tracks he produces. He carries the same respect for the art form as his predecessor by setting the stage for his funkladen production to serve as the pathway for lyrics of love and respect to walk hand in hand in the hood. He produced 7 songs and wrote nearly all of the songs. Donell Jones' combines the qualities of Soul/R&B legends-talent,emotion,love & respect for music - with the hip flavor of the 90s'. This album should have been promoted more. Remember,this was 1996."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOR LOVERS ONLY:","review":"If you truly love Donell Jones and what he is about, then this is THE cd for YOU.

I listen to this cd so much, not recently though only because it got damaged, but I definitely will be replacing it soon. Words of advice: buy it, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This CD is all that, no doubt. R&B at its best. Donell Jones has produced a CD that you can listen to at any point of your day, and come away feeling great. There are 15 tracks on this CD, all of them are hittin'. My only question is: When will the follow up CD be released? I really enjoy this CD. Whether I'm at work, home, or rollin' in the streets. This is also a perfect CD for a man and a woman to sit and listen to, or get in a car and just drive. On most CDs, the title track is its signature cut. \\"My Heart\\" is the title track on this CD. It's nice, however, with this CD, you experience tracks like that throughout the entire CD. Simply OUTSTANDING!

Other highlights include, \\"What About You\\", \\"Everlasting Love\\", \\"Come on Back Home\\", \\"Just Come\\" and \\"On That Day\\" (w/Lauryn Hill in the background).Let me not forget, \\"The Wind\\"...a beautiful song I've heard somewhere before, I think by a country singer.

I'm always enticed by something that might be better. Simply put, I've run marathons (slowly) and barely noticed the things sitting there. They stay put, they don't hurt, the sound is as good as I need for running, and I can hear traffic as is approaches from behind easily. Yes, they're cheap, but Radio Shack sells simple earbud covers which work to replace the plastic ring. At $19.95 you can buy a couple of these for the price of many poorer working earbuds. I don't use these for other purposes, if you want \\"High Fidelity\\" when you're sitting still, get a better pair of loose fitting earbuds. P.S.

The headphones I received were poorly finished; an edge of the rubber seal on the ear piece scratched the inside of my ear. It did not help that they kept shifting in my ear as I moved my head around.3. I felt tons of cord bounce on my collar and on the back of my neck.Try it before you make your decision.

The dial which controls the heat is marked from 1 to 10 rather than the temperature that setting will produce. During the years that I used my now dysfunctional wok I gathered a number of excellent recipes, all of which include the recommended temperature setting. Now I must play guessing games which tend to cause cooking to be a strain rather than a pleasure.

For cooking for two to four people, the Aroma AEW-306 is the perfect size, and in the few uses so far it appears to work just fine. The only negative is that its electrical power controller is graduated with numbers from cold to hot, rather than with degrees, so one has to learn what number to set if order to approximate the required cooking temperature. Not a big problem, but still a bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"The first two or three times I used this Wok, I loved it. Now that I've had it a few months, I don't recommend buying it.Pros: Large, feels sturdy, Looks cool, easy to clean.Cons:Washing it ONLY with a soft, nylon sponge, the non-stick coating is flaking a LOT- this is not just disappointing but unsanitary as it flakes off into the food.The temperature dial doesn't change the temperature- it heats up hot for a shorter period of time when on low than on high. So you get your wok too hot for a short time then too cold for a short time.The lid has a dial to adjust how much moisture it lets out. It doesn't work.Summary- if I could return it at this point, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great after a year","review":"I love it. We have had it for about 1 year. We connect it outside during the summer so cooking doesn't heat up the house. It heats fast, retains food moisture, and food taste great. It is a bit heavy and a bit bulky to clean but if you wash right away you can easily rinse it out and clean with a sponge. Nevertheless, it is awesome be be able to cook without having to worry about fire or having to stand there and stare at the food until it is ready. I bought it because I like to let my food cook without me having it to watch it too closely and this wok is perfect for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"A perfect jazz album.

I checked this out from the library and didn't know what I was getting. The album opens up with a horrific version of Spring from the Four Seasons by Vivaldi, complete with what at least sounds like a cheesy drum machine track laid down over it. I think I managed to listen to about 15 seconds before I had to shut it off. So to be fair, I've probably only listened to a grand total of about 2 minutes from this album.

If this album was released in 1987 it would have been a huge money maker for S.Plunkett. Unfortunately the sound of the 80's has been hard to find any more through all the current so called rock thats out there. Steve's never lost his ear for that quality sound.

It was so long and nothing really happened at all.The hero Nils was supposed to be a fierce viking from the past, but I thought he was quite tame and dull. The heroine Linnea was quite annoying because she was so wishy washy and could not make up her mind what she wanted. She was attracted to Nils, but she didn't like his arrogance (I didn't think he was arrogant) and she kept her maybe or maybe not betrothed Lord Tuthill waiting in the wings with his proposal of marriage throughout the whole story.I read about 75 percent of the story and I skimmed the rest because I couldn't take it anymore.

Well, it didn't work for the games that I just listed. They all just froze while it was loading. And NFSMW was my favorite game. So thats a bummer for me. Other people probaly have the same problem with their games. Thats why I now want to get a codebreaker. I think it's the best choice since they're aren't that much bad reviews. But this is still pretty good since it works for some games. I still like how they put in exclusive codes but wish it worked better.

The code list never loads after installing the newest update. If you delete the update, the list loads fine, but you don't have any of the newer PS2 games.I've pretty much given up at this point (I just tried the new memory card this morning). The only option left is to re-download the system update and delete it every time I want to play a game that isn't in the list or input the codes manually, which I'd prefer not to do, but I may have to in order to get this thing up and running again.

And I love how unabashedly sexy she sounds on \\"Raspberry Swirl\\" and \\"She's Your Cocaine.\\" \\"Spark\\" and \\"Cruel\\" are equally excellent.

I recommend it to lovers of all types of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another pleasing album","review":"Even though I am completley biased about anything she does because I absolutely love her, I still reccomend this album because \\"Spark\\" and \\"Raspberry Swirl\\" are alone worth buying this album. Maybe you guys out there would disagree but for the ladies I say go get it girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My First and Most-Played Tori album","review":"If you are not familiar with Tori, this is an excellent starter album. Her first with a band, the music has a rocking, dark sound. A couple of the songs are about Tori's miscarriages (including my absolute favourite, \\"Spark\\") and \\"Pandora's Aquarium\\" is about one of her best friends who was raped by her father. If you like songs with heavy, intellectual meaning, you will enjoy Tori's wonderfully poetic lyrics.Great Tracks include but are not limited to:SparkRaspberry SwirlShe's Your CocainePlayboy MommyAll of her albums are excellent as well. I reccomend each and every one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Classic","review":"The complexity of the relationship between an artist and her work is difficult to describe but this album captures the true essence of that relationship. Every piece is a deep woven landscape filled with beautiful images, colors, aromas and sounds. It is a masterpiece to listen to and ponder. A must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are You Sure Where My Spark Is......","review":"I have all of Tori's CDs except for \\"Y Kant Tori Read\\". I love her voice with her piano, but this CD was a nice change. Some songs had a lot of other instruments in it, but others were based solely around the piano. I may love the music either way, but Tori's voice will always be the same..beautiful. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy, was I surprised.","review":"I was amazed by Tori Amos from the start. Lying in bed, sick as a dog, I heard for the first time \\"Silent All These Years.\\" I kept thinking, \\"Is this new Kate Bush?\\" Of course it was not and I was excited to have \\"discovered\\" a wonderful new talent. I enjoyed \\"Little Earthquakes\\" very much. I found \\"Under the Pink\\" less engaging, though the sound was more full and the CD contained many wonderful songs. Still, I'd lost interest and never bought her next CD. I was not, however, at all reluctant to purchase \\"The Choirgirl Hotel\\" on the strength of the first single. I thought it was simply incredible. I know, it sounds silly, but I don't even remember what that first song was. I do, however, know that I love the entire 'Choirgirl' CD. I'm no critic..heck, I like LOTS of music, but as an owner of nearly 1000 CDs, I can easily place Tori's latest in the top ten."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite a departure..","review":"This album is certainly very different than anything else Tori has done. There is so much versatility here, something perhaps to appeal to everyone. Translation (heh): i can't imagine someone not liking AT LEAST one song on this album, unless they just simply despise Tori's voice. Unlike the other albums, this one doesn't seem to have a flow but rather the songs are very individual.My favorite song is probably \\"She's Your Cocaine\\" because of the sheer funk of it. I'm no dancer, but this song makes me get UP. hahaha.go buy this. but not as your first tori album. i would recommend little earthquakes for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to listen to...","review":"Thank god this kind of music is sticking around: Kate Bush, BoJest, Natalie Merchant, and of course the one and only Tori. I feel this album was extremely moving, melodiuos, haunting vocals as usual, and the overall beauty sticks with you for hours after you've heard it. Great Job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tori Amos blends ecclecticism and lyrical ingenuity.","review":"Tori Amos' newest release blends her timeless vocal ability and unique approach to lyrics in a masterful accumulation of her talent. The songs are refreshingly new and respresentative of her successful ability to change her \\"sound\\". Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME doesn't say enough","review":"I love this one!!!! THe band is great, the music is great and as always Tori rocks!!! This CD is great to sing along to, great to dance to and so much fun. I have never heard a CD like this before. It sounds like Tori is having so much fun singing these songs and performing with a band again. Everyone, even if they have never owned a Tori CD before should have this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent album from Tori Amos","review":"When I first heard \\"Spark\\" on the radio, I was a bit dissapointed and thought Tori had finally lapsed into mannerism so much I couldn't listen to her any more (\\"she's addicted to nicotine patches...\\"???). But i finally caved in, bought the album, and am happy to say it is as succesfull and accomplished as her other three triumphs. She retains the wonderful strangeness of \\"Pele,\\" but stakes out new sonic territory with the live band sound. It makes for very affecting listening, and her howling on this record gets me in the gut every time. A great album from a great artist"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ALBUM ROX!","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS I HAVE EVER TAKEN THE TIME TO BUY.TORI AMOS HAS THE MOST DIFFERENT STYLE STYLE OF THEM ALL.MY FAVORITE SONG WAS HOTEL.5 STARS ALL THE WAY! TA-TA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Tori's career is a sad story. After a stunning debut album (\\"Little Earthquakes\\") and an impressive follow up (\\"Under The Pink\\") she has slowly sunk into self-pardoy with her last album (\\"Boys For Pele\\") and this one.Here, Tori does little to dispel her growing image of a man hating whiner, so caught up in her self absorbstion in the name of \\"art\\" to have anything compelling to say. Sure, there are a few pretty melodies here, but nothing that comes even remotely close to breaking any new ground for her.Let's face it. Until she proves otherwise, Tori will simply be an artist who has run out of musical ideas with a following that borders on the fanatical.It is sad, given the fact that Tori has shown she is capable of great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly executed!","review":"Tori, whose music was once fresh and innovative, has unfortunately lapsed into the formulaic and unimaginative. By replacing emotion-laden piano chords with the cold and distant sounds of electronica, Tori has managed to alienate her older fans who initially formed the bulk of her support. Ultimately, however, Tori will continue moving in the revenue-producing path she has started on; after all, it's much easier (and inexpensive) to loop together beats on a drum machine, than it is to compose a piece of real, heart-felt music..."},{"rating":"2","title":"queue the choir...","review":"I found this album a great way to get back into the swing of listening to Tori. It had been years since I'd bought one of her albums, and so I decided to pick up the action here, where I'd left off. I enjoyed many of the tracks, though the album is an experience to be had in totality, as with her other albums. I expect I'll be picking up another Tori album in the coming year."},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning","review":"tori amos does it again, with, \\"from the choirgirl hotel.\\" it's bizarre and often frightening rock soundscapes give you an even further look into the female psyche. great tracks like, \\"northern lad,\\" and, \\"black dove,\\" reminiscent of older tori, while others like, \\"spark,\\" \\"she's your cocaine,\\" \\"playboy mommy,\\" and, \\"iieee,\\" give you something completely new. \\"from the choirgirl hotel,\\" is definitely an essential album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kewlies","review":"Wow. I head this album right after Little Earthquakes (instead of listening to the others, I know, bad me) and that was my reaction. \\"Wow.\\" Tori does love to make each album unique and original, and I applaud her for that. This is a definite twist from the Tori I heard in Little Earthquakes.My favorite songs on this album were \\"Cruel,\\" \\"Jackie's Strength,\\" \\"iieee,\\" \\"She's Your Cocaine,\\" and \\"Pandora's Aquarium,\\" but all the others were awesome too. I don't think there's a single Tori song I do not like. And if you don't like Tori, my suggestion would be to back off and stop depressing real Tori fans who don't want to see you bashing her moosik. Salut."},{"rating":"2","title":"A kathedral of sound.","review":"I love all the recordings of Tori, but this one just peeks above the others. This record sounds dark, and haunting. The songs are one for one very strong, and this is THE recording I treasure most. I knew Tori Amos was a good songwriter, but Playboy Mommy will convince everyone. Why? Buy and listen....Favourite songs: Spark, Hotel, Raspberry Swirl, Liquid Diamonds, Playboy Mommy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Very Original Tori Amos","review":"This is one of those CDs that I have owned for years, but still pull out time and time again to listen to. My favorite songs are the hit \\"Spark\\" and the psychedelic \\"Raspberry Swirl\\". Tori Amos is at her best on this CD. Listen to \\"iieee\\", the transition from soft to hard rock is very unique. The song \\"Shes Your Cocaine\\" reminds me of David Bowie in a way. Its a very unique CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tori is a lyrical Genius!","review":"I think that this is the best CD Tori has ever made. I may be biased, since Im a very sexual person, but Lyrics like \\"If you want me to, boy, I could lie to you, you dont need one of these to let me inside of you\\" tells it like it is. She doesnt just make the album about sex, she makes it about the repercusions of the deeds you do (Playboy Mommie), and what drives you to these ends (Shes Your Cocaine). Over all a lyrical masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"From The Choir Girl Hotel","review":"This is the first album that I bought of Tori Amos. And now I'm hooked. In my opinion I think she's the best female vocalist out there. Her music style is completly original and it's both fun and haunting. Tori Amos is also a lyrical genius, no doubt AND she's probbaly the most underrated! For me, this album started it all. I bought \\"Boys for Pele\\", \\"Little Earthquakes\\", and \\"To Venus and Back\\" and of course I was blown away. Give the attention that this true woman deserves and buy this album for the creativity, the originality, and the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Like Her Senusal World Album Better!","review":"I like the songs The Fog and Love and Anger best but, the newest album From the Choirgirl Hotel is really not too bad. This album sounds well produced. I didnt enjoy this as much as The Red Shoes either..and of course no song on this new Cd is as good as Running Up that Hill. But, all in all it was pretty good Kate Bush. My only question is why does the name on the album say Tori Amos? And when did Kate dye her hair red? Kate used to be a lot prettier too before this newest Cd. What in the world happened to her? Does anyone actually get the point I am trying to make? Is anyone of Toris fans sober enough to understand that Tori Amos is a Kate Bush rip off artist?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly yummy creation from tori and the girls.","review":"i wasn't too keen on the whole plugged thought until i heard the cd. tori always seems to be in just the right place at the right time. cruel and northern lad are devastatingly beautiful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, I like being able to dance to it!","review":"I remember seeing the \\"Silent All These Years\\" for the first time on VH-1 and sitting there, mesmerized by this totally different music. \\"Choirgirl Hotel\\" doesn't have quite that impact, but it's still exciting to see Tori go off in a new direction - leaner lyrics and tightly-focused orchestration - after \\"Boys For Pele\\" which was frequently weird just for wierdness' sake. Four stars instead of five because it didn't knock me on my butt the way \\"Little Earthquakes\\" did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tori's Treasure","review":"This album is proof of Tori Amos' ability to show her many facets. From the Choirgirl Hotel explores more instruments than her previous albums and is wider in its appeal. The songs are no less haunting and effective than in the past, they just affect the listener from a different angle. They in turn punish and pet the listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"This album is definately the best I own. \\"Spark\\", \\"Black Dove (January)\\" and \\"Raspberry Swirl\\" will absolutely knock you over. \\"Jackie's Strength\\" and \\"Playboy Mommy\\" will make you cry. \\"Pandora's Aquarium\\" will make you think. The rest of the songs... well... absolutely exceptional. Tori did great with this album just as she did with all of the others. She has the extremely rare talent of being able to tap into your emotions and heal you in the process. She is a beautiful woman, musician, human. Keep writing, Tori."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tori's best to date!","review":"This is a stunning album from one of the best singer-songwriters out there. Melodic, haunting, lyrically magnificent, this is the best work Tori has done to date, in my opinion. After a disappointing previous album, this is a spectacular follow-up. Brava Tori! I can't wait for your upcoming album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional Journey","review":"I have never bought a better CD. Never listened to a CD which made me cry, laugh, wonder, shock, cringe, and every hidden feeling I have not allowed myself to feel in a while. Its an emotional journey. Tori's lyrics and music has so much depth that I find anything that we write will never do it justice. In short, I recommend this CD to anyone who craves a fresh approach to music and wants to remember what its like to feel all these complex emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE'S BETTER W/OUT THE BAND","review":"I have been a Tori Follower for years so I exprcted this to be just as good as her previous Albums, Boy was I disapointed!! The added band and techno crap took away from what Tori is really all about. She is sooo much better with out the extra noise drownding her out. I hope for her sake she returns solo. She's a beutiful artist and This album did not do her justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Beauty.","review":"This CD is just as wonderful as all of Tori's others. She adds her own lyrical beauty and genius to every song. This woman is such an amazingly talented, beautiful, gentle, genius artist. I would recommend this CD to anyone and everyone. Everyone should own this masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Depressing","review":"In this albulm her lyrics and voice were depressing. The songs where terrible. Don't get this. If you are buying this CD just for the song \\"Spark\\", then get the CD Single of that song. Spark is the only okay song, this song still is a little depressing. I had to get rid of it buy selling it twice as less then I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The devil's advocate, your honour...","review":"Yes, among all these reviews rating the CD as 5 stars I feel much like playing the role of the devil's advocate here.Anyway, the fact is that after listening to other work by Tori, From the Choirgirl Hotel is a deception. Don't expect the same piano & voice stuff as in Little Earthquakes, like I did or you'll end up throwing this CD out through the window, like I almost did, if it wasn't for this one great song (which saves the CD)... and that is Spark. Ok, so Tori is still, in this CD, powerful with the lyrics and all that, but the melody isn't half as good as in Little Earthquakes, which is definetely a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than Her Previous Effort, But...","review":"Upon first listen, this album intrigued me. First of all, much more effort had gone into its writing and recording than Tori's 1996 effort, the starkly solitary, rambling, badly-sung \\"Boys For Pele.\\" Most of the songs had at least one pleasing melodic idea. However, with each listen I grew more disenchanted with the work. With the exception of \\"Spark\\" and \\"Jackie's Strength,\\" not one of the songs improved with age. After I got over the initial, superficial appeal of the Arabic glint of \\"i i i i e e\\", for instance, I found that it was compositionally lacking. She had an idea but failed to capitalize on its potential, opting instead for noisy samples, sloppy and shoddy guitar work and oppressive bass. It's really a pity Amos abandoned her true calling, the so-called \\"mock symphonic\\" arrangements which gave such subtle power to her 1991 debut which remains her best and most lasting creative work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Tori","review":"Where do you for a snappy, thoughtless song? Popular culture, top 40. What do you listen to when you want to think and be touched as a human being? TORI. She addresses the chasm of pain that some people feel in life, weaving amazing musical talent and haunting lyrics. This CD is another side of her; she has a right to explore like any other artist. Choirgirl expands the mind to new bounds in music and experience, if the listener is willing to be led."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious, over-hyped","review":"Another pretentious CD from Tori with the usual over the top heavy breathing. I could not get past her irritating way of phrasing her songs. I guess she is the critics' current \\"flavor of the season\\". Everybody just gets suckered in by critics who think she is so great. Listen closely and realize how contrived are the emotions she puts into her songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album made me Like Tori even less than BfP did","review":"The Boys for pele album was bearable with only one song screwed up by this band and drum & beat crap (professional widow). But this album is a disaster. Just a little harmony here, politically correct lyric there and you have a new song. I didn't like her first album with band and neither her last album. Screw the bands. And don't give me that crap about that she is exploring new areas or something, she has ended up just as she started. Making just bearable music with a band with a sporadic nice melody. Really I don't see this album as an improvement whatsoever, stick to the piano and give up the bands Tori, please for gods sake :). GaRDy"},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Tori album","review":"I have been a fan of Tori Amos since \\"Little Earthquakes\\", and I purchase every new CD within days of its release. \\"Choirgirl Hotel\\" is without question my least favorite Tori Amos CD. I hate the CD so much it is the only CD from her that I will not play any more. I have not listened to this CD in 10 years. When my playlist plays a song from this CD I do not hesitate to skip the song. I am shocked that so many people gave this CD a positive review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly moving; immensely unforgettable.","review":"My favorite Tori Amos album to date finds Tori experimenting for the first time with a band. On all her previous efforts, Amos recorded herself and the piano or harpsicord first, and add other musicians' instrumentations later. The album continues to show the songstress challenging herself and her listeners, penning intense songs largely centered around a miscarriage that she suffered; though not all of the songs touch on the subject. The album is completely unforgettable, and these songs will stay with you, even long after you turn the stereo off. Highlights include \\"Spark,\\" \\"Raspberry Swirl,\\" \\"Northern Lad,\\" and \\"Playboy Mommy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Please get rid of that band!","review":"A few months ago I listened to this CD at the store, and for the first time ever - I walked away terribly dissapointed in a Tori Amos CD. Three weeks ago I picked up a single that does have Spark on it - and it has grown on me some (that's why two stars, not one). But still I like Tori's music *so* much better when it's just her and a piano. I really hope that that Tori isn't gone for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear......","review":"....was the reaction of my fellow tori fan and I as we listened to this album. Not enough sweet piano and beautiful melodies, and a song which begins, \\"let's go!\\" is always a bad sign, especially for an accomplished artiste like Tori Amos. Bring back Little Earthquakes and quirky Bee-Sides any day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"real let down..","review":"This is the worse Tori Amos Cd that I\`ve known of so far. It was a real let down and it seems as if tori forced this cd out, the lyrics are not tori like, and she plays hardly any piano on this, and when she does it\`s over done with drum sounds and other annoying sounds, but if you\`re a die hard tori fan you may enjoy it, but I didn\`t."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Earthqaukes is not her best. Get over it!","review":"This is good - it is probably equal with \\"Little Earthqaukes.\\" \\"Under the Pink\\" is her best! No contest there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not gonna make me a fan...","review":"Well, this album was weird. I expected a less whiny version of tori, and what did i get? a still whiny tori who discovered techno!The cd is pretty boring except for the song Iieee, i see she's been listening to bjork, ALOT.Doesnt the opening to playboy mommy sound just like bjork's \\"The Anchor Song\\"?Anyway, yes, shes still with that damn piano, and that mumbling of lyrics that shes known for. My point: IF you hate tori, this album wont change your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaccid and forced","review":"Oh, the thrill is gone, it's REALLY gone. For those of us who had our worlds absolutely rocked by Little Earthquakes and were simply perplexed and bored by the subsequent albums, this album just confirms that Ms. Amos no longer aims to communicate just to confuse. No one buys the 'faerie-world' nonsense lyrics anymore, they only serve to reiterate the forced and flaccid feel of the melodies. Where does the listener fit into the scheme of things when the writing is so entirely cryptic and nonsensical? Her evasiveness and odd imagery worked to her advantage when the melodies told the stories (a la Earthquakes), but they simply further render the ever-developing self-caricature that she has become when placed alongside drab techno lite and snoozeworthy lounge music. Somebody find her push-up bra and give her some Aqua Net... Y Kant Tori Read was 10-fold more genuine and inspired than this poor specimen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Although this is not Tori's usual style, it is a wonderful album- I have thoruoghly enjoyed it, and I think that anyone who has enjoyed Little Earthquakes or Boys for Pele will enjoy this. Tori, as always, is amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It must be so hard for you, Tori.","review":"I'm so sorry that you are surrounded by horrible men that sign you to a major label, enable you to make millions of dollars, create the political freedom that allows you to be a spoiled brat in public, create the technology that is necessary for you to record in the first place. How do you deal with such blatant oppression?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not without its flaws","review":"Ok, why am I writing this review? Because this was my first Tori Amos CD. Second, this is probably for new Toriphiles.This was also the album which changed my presumptions about electronic music. The vocals on Liquid Diamonds and Cruel are haunting, but on the whole I think Spark and Liquid Diamonds are the only flawless songs. If she toned down the dramatics on Northern Lad maybe I would have liked the song better. It seemed to me she was trying to do an aria on a rock album--tacky. Similar for Hotel--one of those songs I can never get into. Imagine the combination of bombastic electronic sounds with a howling soprano and mystifying lyrics. Anyway, my favourites on this record are Spark, Cruel, Black Dove, Liquid Diamonds, She's Your Coccaine and Pandora's Aquarium.Much as I respect Tori Amos deeply, I can't help telling the truth. As you can see, I'm not one of those TORI THE GODDESS RULES! fans. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE PLEASE SAVE ME FROM THIS CRAP!","review":"I just do not get it??? Do you really call this music? Just because a woman can act outrageous and screech a lot, while writhing in orgasmic like states, does not make her an \\"artist\\". Tori Amos has to be one of the most overrated musicians I have ever ever ever heard. Right now anything sells, as long as you are politically correct and \\"feel\\" someone's friggin pain. Get over yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent Tori album","review":"Tori Amos is sure one talented woman! She's been releasing great albums all along her career combining her amazing voice with piano and subtle yet very emotional songwriting. This album is no exception! This time she adds some more interesting elements such as electronic sounds to enrich some of her songs. No matter what she does though the effect is simply amazing. While not as good as her earlier albums \\"From the Choirgirl Hotel\\" is a very nice addition to your Tori Amos catalogue and a very good album to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is everyone so quick to compare to Little Earthquakes?","review":"This cd isn't Little Earthquakes.I don't know why so many fans keep expecting Tori Amos to come out with that album again every time she releases something new.It is brilliant,however,even if not from beginning to end,as her first cd was,it shines in different ways,and I think her maturity as a songwriter is more evident on this release than any other so far.When I listen to songs like \\"Jackie's Strength\\" and \\"Black Dove\\",I get more out of them each time-more depth and emotion.She's surprising powerful(and almost kind of predatory!)on \\"She's your cocaine\\" and haunting while still being catchy singing songs like \\"Spark\\".I will always love Little Earthquakes,but I love to see her grow and write music differently.She's never stopped changing-except that she's still consistently brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori Amos, again, casts herself in the role of victim","review":"In Rolling Stone last month she said that she knew she was anchovies...if she were potato chips she'd be more popular, but she can't help being anchovies. Well, this stinks! I liked \\"Boys for Pele\\" much better than this confused and conflicted group of tunes. She sang about triumph and pride! She was alone and calling the shots! Call the shots, girls! I am a Tori fan, but she piles up her life experiences in a way that is no longer ingratiating to the listener; I feel intruded upon, and I feel stressed when I hear this music. She need to work some of this out on her own...She has begun to view her life simply as material for her next record, which cannot be healthy. She needs to get back to the piano, and stop \\"the engineers\\" from ruining her next album. Tori needs to stop being a victim if she is ever going to make a good record again...(I give it two stars; 1 for the cover art, and 1 because I have been a fan of her past work...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Daily Dose of Blasphemy","review":"Consider this review your daily dosage of blasphemy. I know... Tori Amos is a minor diety. I know... she deserves to be immortalized. That said, this album is in no way the reason for that... it has some good songs... Spark is beautiful. Jackie's Strength rocks too. But... Raspberry Swirl? Cruel? WHY? WHY?In short, the album is overdone. The starkness and emotion running through her earlier albums are missing here, as the full band and electronic arrangements forcibly drown out the piano, which has always been her forte.It's not that the songs aren't emotional. At their best, they're still moving Tori songs. But the rest of the time... She's Your Cocaine? I mean... where's the image? Where's the brilliance? Where's the poetry Tori has mastered?On the whole, get Little Earthquakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel This CD","review":"From the Choirgirl Hotel is Tori's most raw and carnal work yet. This is particularly noticable in the faster songs with stronger beats (i.e., Cruel, Raspberry Swirl, She's Your Cocaine, Iieee), but there's an undercurrent of that sensuality in the slower songs too. And this CD is VERY good. Yes, it's drastically different from the Tori of Little Earthquakes, and many Tori fans won't like the change. But it's progression for her as an artist, and the added instruments and variation in style really work on this CD. From the Choirgirl Hotel is to Little Earthquakes what REM's Monster is to Green. Tori's new sound may not be immediately well-received when you first hear FtCH, but if you just listen to it for what it is, you will find yourself proclaiming it a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"music for suburban teenage girls who think they're oppressed","review":"You have to check your brain at the door to believe the nonsense that Tori has spewed out on her last two or three albums. \\"Choirgirl\\" is about as mature as \\"Showgirls\\", with a similar appeal to sexual idoicy and masochism. No thinking person could possibly digest her stupifying rantings on religion and culture without getting a serious case of constipation. If you've already bought this album, my hope for you is that you can flush this stuff into the sewer as soon as possible. Another case of a once-talented artist who started believing her own hype. That's always my cue to find the Exit sign. Talula, Tori."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori may be the girl with the piano, but now she's more.","review":"Being a Tori Fan since her first solo album \\"Little Earthquakes\\" I have collected her albums and singles since what seems the beginning of time. When \\"The Choirgirl Hotel\\" was relesed, I heard parts and I was confused. Was this the girl with her piano anymore? No. She's more than that now. Sure, it still has that Tori touch, but it doesn't seem to have the feeling in it anymore. Is this Y Kant Tori Read all over again? I will have to admit, I did listen to it for a while. They almost sound like her remix extras on her singles. Sure, they're a novelty, but after a while, you get sick of it. That is how I view this album. You listen to it, and then it will be like the rest of those CD's sitting on your rack. You can say you have it, but it will more than likely just collect dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars is too much","review":"i am not sure what it is but after BFP i think tori is cranking out the same old same old. her style has NOT chnaged at all and this album just added to the mix of mediocrity. her best work remains her 1st album LITTLE EARTHQUAKES. everything after that is ok but her magic is gone and the quality get worse with each album. if you want some vintage tori see also the CRUCIFY EP"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"She certainly looks like Jewel, but her music is much less original. Tori Amos can't sing from the heart, and her music is moving away from its original much loved style.I don't recommend this CD at all, the listening is unpleasant and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!!","review":"After a slightly disappointing \\"Boys for Pele\\" album, I have to admit I was a bit weary about buying \\"Choirgirl\\" at first. I can't believe I ever thought that. What an AMAZING album!! Although a bit 'heavier' than others, the tunes and lyrics simply meld together so beautifully, showcasing Tori's talents to the fullest. A magnificent opening to the album with \\"Spark\\" and \\"Cruel,\\" and what follows is simply majestic and almost haunting (listen carefully to the words of \\"i i e e e\\"). While some tracks, particularly \\"Jackie's Strength,\\" appear to be aiming for a more pop appeal, overall this is an album I just can't see being left out of any music collection. The best of the year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"introspectively, one of her better ones","review":"although I saw in this album the same lyrical qualities that made Tori one of my most favorite artists, I did at first have a problem with the technical aspects, after seeing her perform many of the songs live, I can better see how well the songs work onstage. Still, I was hoping for another gut wrenching vocalization of Tori's soul, as was seen in some of her earlier work, but I got a happpier Tori, a Tori more comfortable with her surroundings, and I suppose I will have to be happy with that, not like I can wish trouble on her so she'll continue to write music that speaks ethereally to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She is definetly the best in what she is doing","review":"My english is not perfect so I apolagize for mistakes, but I MUST write this. Tori's music has been always a important part in my life. Her life-style, her character influenced me in a way that you can't imagine. Something I must mention is, that Tori's music always improves. I liked LE when I first listened it. I liked UTP after the second or third try. And by BFP it took much longer. But after each album I said:\\" That is it. She came now to the end. There is nothing more she could possibly create.\\". Choirgirl was so exticing and new, it made wonder if she get some divine inspriation. You must listen it to understand what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Die-Hard Tori Fan","review":"I think this is probably her best album so far. Aside from Little Earthquakes, this is the only other album that really shows what she can do. I of course, love all of her albums (and was fortunate to see her twice in concert..and I must say, she is quite a performer), but I listen to From the Choirgirl Hotel the most out of the 4 Tori Amos CD's I own. This is definitely worth listening to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big change for Tori","review":"Each Tori Amos album has it's own unique style and character, and this one is extremely outstanding. Just when you think Tori has reached her peak, she thrills you with a new edge. This album actually made me want to move my feet with it's great electronic edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kane & Abel","review":"First, I'll preface this review in stating that I'm reviewing the abridged audio version of this book. I avoid abridged versions of any book, but this one was given me by a friend to read.As the story unfolded in the beginning it was quite interesting. After awhile though the story line became quite predictable. Consistancy was lacking in the leading characters. Their personalities and responses were modified to fit, what seemed to be, a greatly contrived and simplistic story line. After getting two-thirds through the book my interest was no longer in what happened to the characters, but whether my theories on what will happen was correct.Most people seemed to really like the book and again I can only relate to the heavily abridged CD version. I suspect that so much was chopped out of the story that the summary of events not told gave too many clues to future events. Stay away from abridgements because even if a story is good, they will most often disappoint!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of tripe!","review":"Lord Archer can't write for toffee. Anyone who considers this inane doggeral to be literature of note is clearly an imbecile. I've seen more insightful prose on the back of a bus ticket. It's nothing but poorly written, cliched tosh of the worst order."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SORRY TALE OF A CONFUSED AUTHOR: PLOT MISMATCH","review":"I have just finished reading kane&abel, i must confess that the author brings out delight in treating of the affluent class, as well as the final closing of the climax, the discovery of the real patorn of abel rosenoski was in my view flawed, It raises only question is that, if there was so much hatered and jealosy why the hell the willium kane would have to help the abel fisrthandedly and the hate him till his end. A very poor and dissopointing end to how ever a brilliantley told story. If the author had taken interest in developing of climax the story would be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Book Review","review":"As an avid devotee of audio books and a fan of Jeffrey Archer, I was really looking forward to this audio book.It was VERY disappointing. All I can think of to explain this is that it was only available as an abridged audio book, and the abridgement sucked the very soul and life out of this book.At best, it was a story stripped to the bare bones, with none of Archer's typical wit and style. It was told mostly by narration instead of creating scenes for the reader to experience the story. It had almost no dialogue, and what little there was was incredibly contrived and awkward. At least in this version, the characters were so one-dimensional and the plot was laid open so that you could guess the way the story would unfold almost from the very begining.If you are going to read this book and have any hope for enjoying it PLEASE do NOT get the abridged audio book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kane & Abel Review","review":"Excellent. Good character development and interesting from the beginning to the end. Would highly recommend for sheer entertainment and also a bit of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the theme?","review":"I purchased this book based on the review by a journalist who I admire and was disappointed after forcing myself to finish reading it. I told myself not to read another book by the same author and downgraded my admiration for that journalist who recommended this author.First I cannot identify the theme of the novel. It is boring to be just 'told\\" a whole bunch of easily predicted incidents without evoking any deeper feelings on the way. There is no deep character development whatsoever. I feel like watching \\"soap opera\\" most of the time. The ending climax is too easy to predict and I lost interest half way through the book.Second the style of writing is blunt which is not my taste for literature.However I did found Abel's early life adventure able to hold my interest and I gained some knowledge of Poland's history during WW1."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner","review":"The story revolves around two men who are born on the same day in two different parts of the world . . . but destiny makes them each other's worst enemies. One born in poverty stricken Poland the other the son of a Bostonian millionaire. The epic story revolves around the struggle of both men to make it to the top on their own terms. The number of times these two men's paths cross, unbeknownst to them, are amazing. The characters are richly drawn. It is a real page turner and you will not want to put it down. The saving grace of finding this book \\"late\\"is that the sequel, \`Prodigal Daughter', as almost as good as the first! Alas the re-tooling of \`Shall We Tell the President?' as book three in the series did not fair as well. Like many of Archers books it is well worth reading again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kane & Abel","review":"The book was not at all what I expected ... once I started, I couldn't put it down. Every time I thought I knew where it was going, it turned a corner and had me spellbound! I would recommend it to anyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book was absolutely awesome. It had romance, suspense, a bit of horror (concentration camp images), and revenge. I really liked the way that Jeffery Archer put this one together, It is going down as one of my all time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeffrey Archers most popular book","review":"Kane and Abel is a fantastic book. He creates a story of two powerful men, one with a life of privelage and one who had to scrap his way to the top. The characters are well written and the story is masterfully woven together. I haven't read all of Archers books but this one was the best yet that I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply - best work of fiction I've ever read","review":"Archer demonstrates an amazing ability to interweave the lives of two people in a very natural and riveting manner. All I can say is ---READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent. Flawless.","review":"This is the BEST book ever written. I've read it dozens of times. DO NOT MISS THIS FABULOUS BOOK. IT'S A MUST-READ FOR ALL HUMANS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thriller","review":"It's a very modern story with a spark, what makes you want to read it as fast as possible and never stop. The great coincidence that occured at the end of the novel is not a thing that happens to every one so frequently, but it's real. Maybe that's whay this novel is such a thriller. Another thing about this novel is that anything that happened in the story was easily predictable. I could foresee almost all events. The question is, however, does it mean that this book is too easy or does it prove Archer to be very thoughtful and taking the side of the reader. A novel that should rather be read!!! K.M."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling novel with so many twists and turns","review":"This book reveals the upmost excitemen, as you wonder what the outcome may be.

The characters, you love them, you hate them. The highs, the lows, totally unbelievable. You would not believe one book could have so much power. Archer puts us right there in the novel, and you wish you could jump in the book and sort out the characters for the best. After multiple readings you wish some bits of the book would change, namely the sad parts. No other book has come close to being this much of a masterpiece, although a Matter of Honour, is as close as any book will get to being this type of masterpiece. Don't hesitate and buy this book now. Money you will not regret. I only wish I had the dedication of the characters in the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"...In years to come this will be a classic","review":"Kane and Able is Jeffery Archers best work. Written over two decades ago it has certainly stood the test of time. The charaters are developed in each section with meticulous attention to detail and style. This is a must read for those who love intrigue, mystery, mayhem and the internal and external struggles that faces mankind through it's race for survival. Excellent work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definition of good entertainment","review":"is this book.Thoroughly enjoyed this bitter rivalry, sort of like a modern twist on \\"Romeo & Juliet\\".You can nitpick that the events are unrealistic/unbelievable or factually incorrect but that stuff doesn't bother me as I'll read books like Harry Potter.Finally I have to give a mention to the excellent ending which a thick-head like me never saw the twist coming.Just read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I had read Kane and Abel many years ago and decided to reread it this year. It was as wonderful as it was so many years ago. You are captured between Kane and Abel and can't wait to see how the two come together in life as their lives continue. Jeffrey Archer is a tremendous writer who grabs your attention from the first page."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.How Archer enter twines the paths of the two main characters is just amazing.It was a real page turner.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed it","review":"Really enjoyed this, cannot wait to read the sequels.Have only just got into Jeffrey At'rcher books and cannot out therm down."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites","review":"The main reason I am writing this is to warn you against reading Matt Hetling's review because he gives away the whole secret/climax of the book. I can't believe it got past Amazon. Don't reviewers know not to give away the ending and secrets? Sometimes I'm afraid to read reviews for that very reason.I won't give a description of the book since so many others have, but I will say it's one of my all time favorites. I thought it was outstanding.Pam"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I found the novel very well written. It's a real page-turner!Of course it's not a very profound story but it keeps you interested until the very last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FIRST BOOK IN AGES I'D CLASS AS A NOVEL.........","review":".......rather than a good book. The book is about 2 men born on the same day, one a penniless polish immgrant (which very does not give him justice) and the other the son of a banker. I couldnt understand why the book was called Kane & Abel as for the first 200 pages Abel is called Wladek. They first met when Abel went to see Kane about the fact that his boss had committed suicide because of the banker. Abel dislikes the man from that moment on is intent on distoying him. you must read on to find out if he'll succeed. you'll LIVE through 60 years of 2 lives in the space of a few days. thank g-d theres a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cain and Abel","review":"Kane and Abel is Jeffrey Archer's best. It is the story of two men, born on the same day in 1906, on opposite sides of the world, who battle enemies of all kinds, including each other to come out on top of the financial world. This novel has some of the most gripping images you will ever read. If you like fierce, cutthroat economics, and an enthralling storyline, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless epic spanning decades","review":"A brilliant piece of work. Like a fellow reviewer, I too was just 15 when I first read \\"Kane and Abel\\". Archer's easy style and clear, concise story telling make all his works enjoyable to read, but this had an edge to it quite like nothing I have ever seen again. A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FANTASTIC BOOK !","review":"This was an excellent book that keeps you reeading. I couldn't put it down for days. I have read thousands of books at 14 and this is by far one of the best.

It'll grab you and hold you long after you've finished it. A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so impressive","review":"Several of my coworkers read this book recently, so I thought why not, I'll read it too. I have to say that I was very unimpressed. My biggest problem is that I found the story line way too predictable. It was very obvious that certain things were going to happen and that the author was setting the stage. It has a few small surprises, but overall, not very impressive. Maybe my hopes were too high. Nevertheless, I don't intend to read any other novels by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"There was a movie on this book I beleive in 1985. Can anybody tell me how and where I can get it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable Always","review":"Overall the book is interesting. Yet I felt that the story hardly had any surprises. I could more or less always predict the chain of events that would form the story line. This is the only book I have read by this author and this is supposed to be one of his great works. I wonder how amateur his other plots might be."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest book I have ever read","review":"I picked up this book one day during a break in a class.

I got an abridged book by mistake","review":"The worst thing I can say about this audio book is that it wasn't long enough. I mistakenly bought an abridged book. The storyline, characters, and plot development were such that I would have loved to read the entire thing. What there was of it, though, I really enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"What a great read. What I loved most was that the book is definitely a stand alone, unlike some others in series, where you feel that there are no proper endings. This book is properly ended, but I do still feel like reading the next one to see how the family saga continues. I got a little bit bored at times, but overall a very enjoyable read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book many years ago","review":"All I can say is it is one of the best books I have ever read.

Instead I found a book too literate for the tabloid reader, not insightful enough for the demonically possessed.The book mentions names whose relevance sometimes puzzled me; and summarizes books and movie themes, as if high school freshmen were the author's primary target. It discusses the seduction of the demon, mostly through other writers' observations. Why is it that we get a better sense of Henry Miller's \\"dictation\\" than Eric Jong's \\"seduction\\"? And while she could have genuinely and thoroughly discussed her affair with the former Mr. Martha Stewart to give us a deeper understanding of its effect on her writing, she fails to go beyond the surface.The touch of love may turn a man into a poet, but this zipless seduction will barely teach you the alphabet."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stars - Who Cares?","review":"I agree with Mrs. Norman Main's review and really couldn't have stated it better. Narcissistic drivel. Ms. Jong is just not as interesting as she thinks she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"I read this book thinking it would be a good personal account of the authors life. I got nothing. She had an affair with Martha Stewarts husband - big deal. That was the only major thing she told us about. Perhaps this book was not meant to be a tell all memoir like most I read. Considering how outspoken Erica Jong usually is, I am dissapointed she held back after finally writing about herself. It was a very quick read, in fact I read it at jury duty one day, but if I had to tell anyone what the high points were, I would have to say none."},{"rating":"1","title":"no stars","review":"Narcissistic account of \\"the darlingness of me.\\" Ms. Piggy is Mother Theresa compared with this ego-driven, celebrity-centered puddle of prose.

If all you are looking for is a quick reference for cigar brands and the sizes they are available in, then buy this book.However, if you are looking for discriptions of taste, or recomendations, then you will need to go elsewhere. A sentence or two of description is about all you can hope to find here. The majority of these run along the lines of \\"Cigar A is good, well made, cigar manufactured in Country B.\\"As I mentioned above, if you're looking for a list of cigars there's no better source.

I could relate to a lot of things that go on in those characters'lives. They're in their late twenties and there's a lot of things about life that they just don't know, they have a lot of questions, issues and dillemas.They're gathered in this house they's been going to for the past 9 years, and the movie is about their weekend there, they all talk and think about what they want, and it shows them evolving.

While dealing with various personal decisions, six friends try to figure out exactly how one grows up without growing old. The setting, a house in the verdant and upscale NYC suburbs, is made to look positively Edenic--surely, a conscious choice on the part of the filmmakers, though not one that beats us over the head.Lest \\"Origin of the Species\\" sound fraught with heaviosity (to borrow a term coined by Woody Allen), all this is presented with a remarkably light touch, a cast of engaging characters, and plenty of humor. Since making the film, several of the actors have gone on to greater success, and their performances here show why."},{"rating":"2","title":"On The hook","review":"Sometimes an 80's artists really has a hard time staying ground in the U.S. Nevertheless, it has happened with Jody Watley.

The song was released from her no longer issued record, Flower. There are so many mixes here on this C.D. single, but the original track is the only version of the song that remains hot. It is just a shame that Jody Watley hasn't made anything this bold for awhile.
