A note before the beginning of the play notes that this adaptation was first presented in Manchester in 2003.The title character of Yerma is a rural wife who is frustrated because she has not yet given birth to a child. The play follows her conflict with her husband and interactions with other characters. \\"Yerma\\" certainly raises some important issues: marriage, gender roles, motherhood, trust, and honor. And there is some wonderfully poetic language. But overall I found this play dull and uninteresting; moreover, the characters never really engaged me.

His voice is distracting at time and seems to clash with the instrumentation (well, in my opinion anyways). The anti-war lyrics seemed juvenile as well as the overall late '60s hippy-ish message. One characteristic about prog rock I've always liked was that themes center around science, fantasy, science fiction, and etheral subjects, not this political bull. It's really anoying on this CD.

The Waring couldn't blend pesto or whip up alioli successfully. I wanted a mini processor that would allow me to add ingredients at it chopped. This KitchenAid does just that. The first night I got it, I made some alioli (garlic mayonnaise) to go with dinner - it was a snap! The only drawback is the bowl seems a bit flimsy and I worry with all the removing and securing of the lid, the plastic may break. But I am very happy so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake","review":"Don't use liquids in this product, because it will go all over your counter! For the price it shouldn't leak.

After average use or less the chopper no longer chops!! The blades do not turn if there is anything denser than water in the bowl. When I contacted the company I was basically told that it was more expensive to fix it than buy a new one, so they offered a new one at a reduced price (not reduced enough IMHO). I was really disappointed that KitchenAid would sell an appliance that they do not believe is worth fixing!!

It was my very first food processor, and I hate it.The processor is very loud. It produces a high-pitched squeal that from the next room (or apartment) sounds like a woman screaming. When I first started using it, my neighbors got kind of cold toward my husband. Apparently, they thought the food processor was me screaming. I stopped using it when they were home.The processor is also hard to clean.

The safety switch issue is impossible to overcome. It was a poor design, and it's time they take this one off the market and redesign the switch so that it works for more than a few times.

The product worked great. next time I used it worked great. next time product failed. I figured out what the problem was. It has to many safety features and all are made of plastic.

My wife was using it a lot blending food for the baby, making soups and purees. Then she placed it in the cabinet for a few months. Just the other day she took it out and it just wouldn't turn on anymore. I thought maybe it's because it wasn't used for a while. I am a Design Engineer and I took a good look at what could be the problem. The cover latch mechanism does not make contact with the small side button. The plastic twist and turn cover mechanism wears out over time. It's very surprising to us because it wasn't even used lately.In order for it to work you would have to use some sharp object like a knife and poke the button. But it's pointless because even though the blades will turn on but the cover is off and as result - you can't blend no food.

I know the KitchenAid brand has an excellent reputation, and I liked the fact that it was a 3 cup processor so that it won't take up a lot of room on my counter.I am so happy with my processor ! It literally cut my preparation time of side dishes down to half. It's small and light weight, but it really gets the job done, and quickly. Make sure you follow the directions and ensure that all the parts are in place and locked, or it won't run, which is a great safety feature. The little spatula that comes with it is perfect to reach into the cup to scrape out the bowl. I love to cook, and I will be using this appliance alot in the future.

I don't know what, but the rest of the unit is history."},{"rating":"2","title":"So close...","review":"I love almost everything about this chopper. It's reasonably priced, a nice size, and it does a good job with the chopping (my first experiment, chicken salad, was a success). It's easy to clean, the cord stores in the base, there's a slot in the top to add ingredients while mixing, and the little paddle is handy for scraping out the food from the bowl (it's a tight fit for one of those regular size rubber kitchen paddles). Another good feature: the chop button won't function unless the lid is locked in place.The one thing I don't love: the noise. I expected some noise with a chopper, of course, but this thing is so loud and *shrill* that it's almost embarrassing to use. It sounds sort of like a dentist's drill, times ten.So, we have four stars for this product. It does its job, it just makes a lot of noise doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I ordered this product after my Little Oskar by Sunbeam finally bit the dust after about 15 years of constant use and I had trouble finding another. I ordered it based on other customer ratings and reviews. Am I ever disappointed . I ordered this chopper in November and the first one broke. (The shaft came up out of the machine with the chopping blade after trying to chop up a small amount of cheddar cheese!) I contacted Kitchen AId and they sent out a replacement unit free of charge and I sent the broken one back. This was in the first week of January. Now it is first of Feb. and I am preparing to send the second one back for the same problem. The shaft became stuck after chopping a SMALL amount of Monterey Jack cheese and came up with the blade unit again. I am pretty fed up. I also felt the unit was a pain to use in turning and locking on the chopping bowl , getting it on and off. This is definitely NOT the glowing little chopper that the reviews I read implied."},{"rating":"1","title":"One function chopper","review":"I was very diappointed with this chopper. It has one on (pulse) button. You have no controls. I chopped onions which resulted in huge chunks up top and pureed onions on the bottom. I guess you can open and stir every few second but that defeats the convenience aspect of a chopper. It also does not hold a true 3 cups. The chopper is too small for use with a family of 3. It would be finely for chopping garlic, small amounts of herbs or such but not veggies.It was not useful for making chunky salsa where even chopping is ideal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be nice if it ran...","review":"Just disposed a brand new unit to my gaarbage can after using 3 times in 3 months. Locking mechanism will not drop in far enough to unlock unit so it will start. Not worth the hassle or the cost(shipping) to send back to Kitchen Aid. I thought the safety mechanism was suspect when I bought it bacause it is all plastic. Runs great when you stick a ball point pin into the safety switch. But then you can't get the cannister on when doing this. That's $10/use as I paid $30 at Target on sale. My knife and cutting board are working great though. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Functionality","review":"I bought this on the basis of the other reviews & because it's little (I thought it would be easier to manage than my larger Cuissinart).

The power moves are great, but you don't have to do them until you are ready. Her cues are easy to follow, and she does not get on my nerves like some video instructors do.I wish I had that spring-board step though, now that looks like fun! I only have the original stepper, which though is fine with me as it allows me to take the level of step down until I am ready for a harder workout.You can't beat step workouts really for adapting with you. You can easily start really easy and build up, e.g.you can have a low step and do no power jumps, and even minimise your arm movements until you are fitter and feel ready to start adding another step, then power moves etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME! You WILL get results from this one","review":"This tape is very challenging without being overly choreographed. The power moves multiply the sweat factor exponentially and work your legs much more than a typical step workout would. The steps are really easy to learn with great arm and leg movements. Once I mastered the heart-pumping exercises I added 1lb. weights and have noticed more definition in my legs, butt and arms. A must if you want to max out your step workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great workout!","review":"I'm a total klutz when it comes to exercise videos, but Kathy Smith is my favorite instructor. She doesn't do fancy steps that take multiple viewings to \\"catch on\\" to, she doesn't do anything unsafe, and always gives low and higher impact exercise options.This step workout still makes me sweat and my heart beat fast enough for a good aerobic workout, even after working out six times a week for months. The music is innocuous enough that it's not annoying, even though I do the workout about twice a week (I rotate four workout videos). Kathy has a few annoying whoops, but not enough to irritate me. I like that she has you take your pulse twice during the workout, to make sure you're working at your target heartrate. The workout is about 45 minutes long without the cooldown (I confess that I skip it and just walk around for a few minutes instead)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow","review":"After using (and loving)the Gin Miller step videos, I found this video to be difficult to follow and it was a waste of my money. Kathy Smith seems to assume that the user already knows the steps and her cueing is too late. She needs to demonstrate the more complex steps and do more repetitions with fewer step changes. I found the camera work to be poor also. At times I was trying to watch what the legs were doing only to have the camera focused on the upper body only. At other times the camera gave long side views when front views were necessary to follow the steps. I've tried the video a few times and each time gave up in frustration and got out my Gin Miller tapes. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the job, but it's far to boring to be called \\"power\\"","review":"This tape definitely provides a good workout, but it lacks any kind of excitement.

I would not recommend this tape for anyone who's been stepping for more than a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"After my membership at a health facility expired last summer I looked for tapes which I could do at home to 'mimic' the intensity of the aerobic classes I went to. I really enjoyed step aerobics and also liked Kathy Smith; so I was happy to find this tape. Over a year later this is still my favorite step workout!! I sweat like crazy when I do this workout and it's super fun. Her 90 minute step workout is also very good. :)There are 3 segments that are about 12 minutes in length (beginner, intermediate, advanced). I usually do the whole tape which is about 50 minutes long. It is comparable to a workout you would get at the gym. There's a lot of variety in the moves which keeps it interesting. Kathy's cueing is unsurpassed! Great workout, and usually can be found at a great price too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready to sweat!","review":"Kathy Smith is, by far, one of my favorite instructors. This video is one of her best. She gives excellent cues, and her combinations do not fail to keep me interested for the duration of the workout.This video, in particular, is my favorite. When I am up for a great workout I pop \\"Power Step Workout\\" in my VCR. All three sections keep my heart rate up, and the combinations are challenging, but very easy to learn if you are a beginner. I especially like that there is the option for really increasing your workout's effectiveness with the high intensity moves.I have been stepping for years-in classes and at home-and think that this is one of the best tapes out there. I would highly recommend this to anyone, and everyone, who wants to get an excellent workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kathy Smith's Power Step Workout","review":"While I find Kathy's cuing and instruction to be pretty good, I find this tape monotonous. The music hardly varies on the three aerobic workouts. The setting in a warehouse with everyone in black, is just dark! !You will sweat;the first two numbers are fairly easy to follow, the third gets more difficult with turns which are not easy to accomplish when trying to watch a video. Not a tape I look forward to doing very often!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Uninspiring Video","review":"I bought this video because of all of the rave reviews here. Boy did I learn my lesson.

It deals with responsibility,and getting along with siblings as big brother rabbit must take care of little sister rabbit while the parents are out picking carrots.Big brother rabbit must convince sister to eat her dinner, figure out how to diaper a squirming little rabbit and even outwit a pack of foxes.One panel does deal with death; when the pair happens upon a dead mouse, but this could be a starting point for a dialog with children about what death is.I liked that it showed that young kids can have a level of responsibility. It also gives children a way to put themselves in their parent's shoes by watching how brither rabbit must make decisions for he and his sister.The drawings are delightful and are great for kids who can't read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sci-fi film is no \\"Killers from Space\\"!","review":"W. Lee Wilder, brother of Billy Wilder, directed this exciting tale of people sitting around and talking while an invisible space alien flees all who come into his invisible path. Unfortunately, this 1953 clunker is not as beautifully campy and tacky as Wilder's \\"Killers from Space\\" or \\"Snow Creature,\\" though it does feature some hilarious film-noir method acting in the person of a needlessly abusive cop who simply won't take anyone's word for anything. When the lead characters aren't sitting around discussing the obvious, they are running around outside and shouting the obvious. Perhaps this is some primal reaction to the unseen."},{"rating":"2","title":"whynot","review":"sure buy this movie. it's entertaining. the special effects and costuming are way below today's standards, but it could be remade tomorrow with the right stars and writers and (in my opinion) sell movie tickets because the story line is genuine--an alien arrives and needs our help to survive. the suspense is in seeing if there's going to be a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard release","review":"Specifically regarding the DVD released by Alpha Video. The source print was poor and the DVD picture quality ranges from substandard to fair but the entire film has a soft image. Some segments are very soft with much surface noise.

I just bought the latest TurboTax and Quicken 2002, with the great rebate. The most important feature to me is being able to enter transactions from a different computer. I care nothing about being able to download from my bank, etc. From the description, I thought Quicken Basic would allow me to do this. I installed the program, imported everything from Money and after about 2 hours of searching every help page, I find that this feature is not available on the Basic package.

What a cliche, outdated notion.It doesn't take a CPA to do some quick calculations to figure out that if you invested that extra payment amount each month rather than pay down your mortgage, you would be light years ahead.This book may have other good advice, but if this is the caliber of advice this book has to offer, I won't waste my time looking for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Promotion","review":"Too much like an infomercial.

A 10% raise or a raise of any kind is not possible in many cases in municipal, government, or union jobs: Raise hikes are cost-of-living and/or predetermined.I did like the \\"Starbucks factor\\".

Of course a school like this one, designed to remake children who are on the borderline of polite society, is itself borderline and extreme. But even without corporal punishment, all the rest, from bells, to control, to authority, to shaming students -- it can all be found, as they say, even in the best of schools.

This is not a novel to rush through in a few hours; instead, take your time to put the book aside for a moment and think about what is being said while reading it.

It will permanently change your view of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely on my top ten list","review":"This is truly one of the most haunting books I've ever read.

I opted for an upgraded pattern since I was afraid more pieces of the Vista set might rust. The only reason I'm rating this as a 2 instead of a 1 is because I was able to get a new set.

Good action but the submarine interiors look more like a space ship (Anyone whos ever been on a submarine knows that there aren't a whole lot of winding corridors or open spaces) On the whole this one is pretty good but, of course, it is no Das Boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it !!","review":"Good Songs to Sleep!

The graphics r the same as GH2s and the store is not worth being on there. The game only took me an hour and a half to beat on hard and then there was nothing to do with it.

I find that in most cases the music doesn't match the note-target thingys. No, I'm not talking about the abundant music-sync issues, I'm talking about the music not matching the targets you have to hit - so much so that for me, the game is totally not enjoyable. I know the songs in the game, intimately, and it's really off. Red Octane probably knows this and didn't really want to advertise this disgrace tot he product line.Overall very un-enjoyable way to spend a few hours (not to mention $). It's a shame. Perhaps Red Octane should produce a 'Folk Song Hero' or maybe a 'Disco Hero', it couldn't be any worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Play for Guitar Hero players","review":"This game is really an expansion pack of Guitar Hero 2. Has some good metal songs: Bang your Head, Round and Round, Balls to the Walls, 18 and life, Seventeen, etc. But, too many of the songs are obsecure (for the 80's) songs. Why did they choose a Scorpions ballad and Radar Love by White Lion?Were the developers of this game born in the late 80's. They definetely should have included Cinderella, Motley Crue, Tears for Fears, Depeche Mode, and Guns N Roses.Also, I still dont know why the couldnt license more of the original songs. I doubt WHITE LION, Ratt, and the Scorpions are so wealthy they would have turned down free money.Still, it is a must own game for all Guitar Hero Players.

It only had a portion of the characters from Guitar Hero II, no unlockable songs, and only one unlockable character. The lack of unlockable songs is a huge dissappointment, as it leaves you paying the same price of Guitar Hero II (game only) but only having half the content. Also, with only one character to unlock and no songs, there is no motivation to strive to get the five stars on every song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the 80's I remember.","review":"There are definitely more definitive 80's tracks than what is on Guitar Hero 80's, trust me. The audio seems wierd and it's difficult to hear the singers. Venues are not new, just re-used. They had so much material to work with, yet, give us so little for 49.99. I don't see how they can sum up the 80's in 30 songs in the first place. It seems they are taking the fans for granted on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short-lived Guitar Hero Fun","review":"Let's keep it brief. I don't think the producers need to make this game any differently. The classic concept is well-maintained; guitar hero: encore or any following sequels do not need to change the layout of the game. However, for those who \\"Want to Rock\\", this game will be a disappointment.One huge problem. VERY short songlist + NO bonus tracks = poor game execution. The game series will always be fun, but it's ridiculously short-lived in this paticular installment. Words of advice?...Save your money. Wait for Guitar Hero III (out now). If you have to play GH: Encore, rent it or go to a friend's house who already has it- you could probably knock out one difficulty mode easily in a night.Then again, if you're a diehard gamer who needs to complete the collection, I empathize with you- by all means, purchase it.

I'm glad I did.This game is nothing but GH2 with 80's window dressing. I mean, the opening sequence is EXACTLY THE SAME, only the characters are now sporting 80's styles. As soon as I saw that, I got a bad feeling, and it only got worse from there. Everything--and I do mean EVERYTHING--is right out of GH2. I couldn't even make it through the first round before quitting in digust. This is nothing but pure laziness on the creators' part, just a desperate attempt to milk some more money out of this franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only for hardcore Guitar Hero players.","review":"Graphics: 4/5 Slightly improved, but for the most part, look the same.

Still looks a lot like Guitar Hero II.Sound: 4/5 The sound varies in this game. The covers go from pretty bad to decently good. Many of the songs are good ones, but not fun ones to play on Guitar Hero.Control: 4/5 The game feels just like any other Guitar Hero game. On expert the game plays very well like always.Fun: 4/5 Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks The 80's is, to me, a dissapointment. Only about 1/3 of the songs are fun to play, another third are okay to play occasionally, and the last third are absolute terrible to play.

In the first two versions of Guitar Hero the production quality on the songs made you feel like you were playing with the real band at a big venue. With the new version, it sounds like your playing in someone's basement through a bad amp with a lead singer who has a cold. The other problem with the new version is the guitar work itself. With the previous versions the notes on the screen matched the song, in this new version there are many times where there seemed to be no connection between the music and the notes you were playing. This felt like Red Octane was in a hurry to get something out, grabbed some songs that would be cheap to license and then hired a second rate group to help them record the covers on bad equipment. I'm seriously considering sending my copy back to Red Octane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Buy","review":"Being a big fan of the game, and being born in the 80s, I was looking to this game.

It is nothing more than a rehash of Guitar Hero 2 with only 30 songs. Guitar Hero 2 boasted over 60 for the same price. The game delivers on only one front - it features the same gameplay as Guitar Hero 2, complete with the excellent co-op mode and very helpful Practice Mode. The intro animation, the unlockable instruments, all of the backgrounds, and a fair amount of the art was lifted shamelessly from Guitar Hero 2.I would recommend this game only to people who love 80s music.

Just......Interesting","review":"This was an okay novel, but I suspect I am missing a lot, not being particularly attuned to symbolism or Catholic eschatology. So, I had to read it as just a crime story although the introduction to the book by J.M. Coetzee did shed some necessary light on the book's theme. I found the book interesting for its view of life in the English beach town of Brighton and for some of the characters. Also, it goes without saying, Greene is a master wordsmith. But I also found parts of the book somewhat contrived, particularly Ida's obsession with catching Pinkie to avenge the murder of a corrupt newspaperman she met briefly at the book's opening. But, maybe what I think is contrived is the ethereal stuff I mention at the beginning of this review. This is only the second work of Greene's I've read and I still have his more major books ahead of me. Some say this was not his best. I hope that's the case. It's a good story, but not a page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant characters and atmosphere, effortlessly told","review":"There are lots of books today about groups of people just-past being teenagers but struggling to be or not to be adults. There are also stories about how people, when they're in gangs (or clubs or cults) do things when they're together, that they wouldn't dream of doing on their own. Maybe its just 'peer group pressure' but in Brighton Rock its subtle, and it feels original. I wonder how many books have modelled themselves on this one-I can think of a couple of movies that definitely have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Appalling Strangeness","review":"Perhaps the most problematic of all of Greene's 'Catholic' novels, Brighton Rock explores the problem of evil and the question of faith, under the guise of gangster-action. Brighton Rock is problematic in its inability to portray the power of faith, or even the power of love. Greene's central character, Pinkie, has more faith than an average believer, 'Credo in unum Satanum', he says; yet his faith, faith in a God, faith in a Hell, has no power to save hin from utter destruction. In this novel, as in many of his others, particularly End of the Affair, Greene again struggles with the dualistic problem of body and spirit, treading the fine line between manicheaism and a simple dualism. A powerful and gripping piece of fiction, despite its theological problematic nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man! Greene must have been obsessed with writing books!","review":"This is a fine book from Greene. His characters are really impressive. It's amazing to read Greenes' books, they are quite diverse.

Are the characters realistic? is pinkie pure evil? Ida pure good? or is the answer more ambigious? can there be pure evil if its good for pinkie?really, this book is one you wont be able to relate with.

Nothing propelled me to keep turning the pages, and the Catholic symbolism in the book was ridiculously incessant, and only something a fanatical converted Catholic like Greene could have included to such a degree. Pinkie holds a wire flower and pierces his palm with it. Well, that is obviously symbolic of the nails through Jesus' hands...but for what purpose to the story, or to that scene that has nothing religious or metaphyscial in it? And while Greene is capable of great writing, I didn't find any of it in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a study in evil","review":"Admittedly, this is the first of Graham Greene's novels that I have had the pleasure to read. That being said, I was thoroughly entraced by Greene's exposition of the banality of evil and the differences between absolute morality and religion. The story of an extrodinarily young (17) criminal of pre-war England gives the reader chills with its insightful and plausible view into the mind of an innocent (experiencially speaking)yet extrodinarily brutal and amoral individual and the havoc reaked in the name of self-preservation and utter selfishness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim Robbins Narrates \\"The Great Gatsby\\" Brilliantly","review":"Tim Robbins does a first rate job narrating \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" I am not much of fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald, but for me Gatsby is by far Fitzgerald's best book. Tim Robbins makes this a powerful story.I have two minor criticisms. First, the chapter designations are left out of the narration. Since my son and I were reading this book as a school assignment, we needed to know what chapter we were listening to. Second, the tracks on the CD were too long, generally 10 - 18 minutes. Tracks every 3 - 4 minutes are far more useful. But these are minor complaints, and I loved the book and the way it is read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor audio rendition","review":"I have listened to only a few tracks of this book-on-CD, and maybe I should wait for a while before posting a review, but here is what I can already say. First, while Scott Fitzgerald is clearly a great writer, he writes about characters who are so far from who I am and I care about that I wonder if I will ever really like his novels. I have read \\"This side of paradise\\" before listening to this one, and found it equally uninteresting. Almost everyone seems to be an obnoxious and spoiled character. There is way too much aristocracy, money and privilege, and I find all characters rather fake. BUT, what is worse about this CD is... Tim Robbins. He reads mostly with an annoyingly low, dreamy voice, playing all women with a terrible fake-feminine voice which really seems to come from a drag queen. I will never understand why so many men have to read women's voices as if words were spoken by a drag queen. Overall, this is a pretty bad audio book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most banal narration ever...","review":"Even George Bush can fake a better southern accent! Lest ye be fooled by the acclaimations that Robbins has been awarded for his acting/directing: A narrator he is not. Makes me wonder if he had ever read the book before embarking on this job. The main character/voice of the book is read so fast that details are lost, and every voice in the book has about as much personality as a chirping prairie dog. I couldn't even sit through the whole thing it was so tedious. To think that an audio book would be more tedious than actually reading a book. Stick to movies Mr. Robbins and hopefully you will never ruin another American classic!

I've read the other reviews and agree with the comments about Tim Robbins. The biggest problem we had was that his volume would trail off at the end of just about every sentence. I was constantly turning the volume up and down so we could hear the words but not get blasted out. Luckily I have a volume control on my steering wheel so I didn't have to reach over to the radio every minuet.

Each character other than the narrator, Nick Carraway, is a caricature as might be performed by a high school drama class or perhaps John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd Chevy Chase and Gilda Radner in a spoof of the novel.

I don't know if I would have bought it if it weren't free. It sat on my night stand for quite awhile. I must confess that I am a Disney nerd. I love all things Disney, especially the parks. I've been to WDW and the Florida parks many times but had not gone to Disneyland. One day I picked up the book and started reading it. The beginning was interesting, about his boyhood and family and how he started in the cartoon and then animation business, but at one point it started to drag. My eyes glazed over with the minute details of each business transaction and employee. I kept reading it and I am glad I did, at the end of the book with Walt's death I felt like we had lost him all over again. It inspired me to finally go to DL.

Gabler's portrayal of Walt Disney is so cluttered with minutiae - the backgrounds of various animators, for example, unnecessarily are discussed in excrutiating detail - that it takes more than five hundred pages to get the reader from Disney's birth to the development of Disneyland a mere fifty years later. From that point onward, Gabler races through history, giving short shrift - slightly more than one hundred pages - to Disney's later accomplishments. The author's discussion of the making of \\"Snow White\\" is longer than the film itself, while works like \\"Mary Poppins\\" rate barely a mention. A whopping one hundred eighty pages are devoted to notes and acknowledgements, confirming Gabler was diligent in gathering his facts. Too bad he wasn't more judicious - and entertaining - in getting them into print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This book is TERRIBLE!!! I love reading, I have my whole life, and I can finish an 800 page book in no more than a week but I ordered this book 4 months ago and I'm not even half way through. The writing is terrible, the chapter construction is terrible, and there's just too much Junk & Fluff in it. There are too many things that are in there that get off the topic of Walt Disney. I am a Disney fanatic, all aspects of the Disney empire, and already own several biographies on Walt, and this is by far the worst.

That's when animators led by Disney drew Mickey Mouse. In this hefty, thoroughly researched profile, historian Neal Gabler draws a deeply detailed picture of Disney and his business, from his work animating silent-movie shorts in a Kansas City garage through his years of international fame - and troubled finances. Gabler persuasively argues that although Disney classics, such as Snow White and Pinocchio, may be considered relics today, they were revolutionary works of art in their time. This biography's biggest drawback is its intimidating length, but it rewards readers who persevere. We recommend this history to anyone seeking to understand popular culture, and the competing demands of making art and making money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and Entertaining Biography","review":"\\"Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination\\" is a well-researched, yet very readable biography of a man who is not only an American icon, but in my opinion ranks among geniuses such as Thomas Edison, Mark Twain, and others. Neal Gabler made use of the exhaustive Disney family archives and other primary sources to piece together a picture of Walt Disney, not only as a pioneering figure in entertainment, but as a man who was able to follow his dream, while taking care of his family and business as well. Especially poignant and interesting is Walt's relationship with his brother Roy, without whose business acumen and support Walt would have never been able to achieve the making of the \\"magic.\\" I recommend this book to anyone who would like to know Walt Disney better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ...

I am not speaking of a fleeting reference or inspiration here, folks, but of verbatim copying. Orchestration, rhythm, dynamics, tempo...all identical. I am, of course, specifically referring to Bates copying the piece from Titus entitled \\"Victorious Titus\\" to compile \\"Returns a King.\\"How Tyler Bates managed to get away with such blatant theft and continue to score subsequent films is truly baffling. Many criticize other composers of copying constantly (Hans Zimmer's Gladiator from Gustav Holst's Mars, John Williams' Jaws from Antonin Dvorak's From the New World, etc.), but Tyler Bates has set a new standard for thievery in the modern age of film scores."},{"rating":"1","title":"This score is disgraceful.","review":"I know it's been written here before, but this soundtrack is a total ripoff of other scores. I mentioned this in a comment above, but if you need one solid piece of proof, listen to Returns a King from this score and then listen to Victorius Titus from Goldenthal's score for Titus. It's pretty much note for note, instrument for instrument... well, you get the point. I am actually quite fond of composers mimicking other composers such as Powell's score for X3 borrowing some of Elfman's trademark techniques, but the score for 300 is outright theft.

It was also noticeable that Dr Brooks apparently believes the claims in the original and advances scarcely-disguised notions of Africanist superiority, which would be rightly termed racialism as it had been with Budge's British Imperial conceits.

The story however takes a more contemplative and darker turn the second half; I won't say what happens because it would give away too much.

Walter B. Emery, who passed away in 1971, was a leading Egyptologist for almost 50yrs and one of the principle excavators of the Archaic Necropolis at Sakkara. Though written in the 1950's, this is a good thing as Emery is unencumbered by the institutional dogma that plagues modern Egyptology today and as a result this book is one of the few unbiased sources regarding the clear Mesopotamian influence on Archaic Egyptian culture. Emery offers little in the way of theory, and as any good archeologist should, often lets what was found in the ground speak for itself. While it is tempting to ignore older works, this is the perfect example of specifically why not to. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eraser Clay?!?

You have to remember that no ONE knows Dylan like himself. Don't believe what every nickle and dime punk, that comes along and tries to make a name for himself by offering us some doped up information on (propably) the greatest musician that was ever born. The only thing the director does here is throw more chaos into the already chaotic world of information on Bob Dylan. Leave me alone, is all he wanted. But the press hounded him, trying to make him something he didn't want to be. Like the Pharisees and the Sadducees did to Jesus in his days. I've been listening to Dylan since the beginning. He has penned some of the greatest lyrics that have ever been written. And there are many who tried to make them say something it didn't. To them I say, \\"Just listen to the words and the music, SHUT UP and listen\\". Awesome! One star for songs by the original artist, Bob Dylan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly unwatchable","review":"As a big Dylan fan, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. But I couldn't even force myself to sit through the entire thing. This is an experiment that falls flat on its face. Having a whole slew of different actors playing Dylan just doesn't work in a film. Maybe this device would have a better chance of working in a theater production. The only performance worth seeing here is Cate Blanchett's turn as the \\"Don't Look Back\\"-era Dylan. It's pretty amazing. I wish that I could say the same for the other \\"Dylan\\" performances. Unfortunately, this film is so unwatchable that I can't even recommend it for diehard Dylan fans.

Worse, she smashes her strengths as an actor (robust, sincere presence and a great voice) in attempting to. At film's end, nothing about Bob Dylan is there. Every single performance shrieks for attention in an embarrassing way (with the possible exception of Christian Bale, who at least captures the humility of Dylan the born-again preacher).At least the soundtrack is first rate.Not even slightly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Half there","review":"I recieved the item quickly, but it was only half there.

Save your money and at least rent it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intentions misunderstood","review":"This is not a documentary or an insider's take on the life of Bob Dylan. Instead, it is a movie based on Dylan's personalities, the characters in his songs, the legends, the myths, the lies about Dylan, some truths perhaps, and rarely gets into the history or Dylan's impact on pop culture and rock adn roll. This is simply a beautiful art film in many ways. If you want a documentary on Dylan, this is not it. Instead, this is simply a mostly fictional cross section between what the media has made of Dylan, what the fans think of Dylan and how Haynes sees Dylan. The soundtrack to this movie, covers of Dylan's songs both popular and obscure, is really wonderful. Cate Blanchett is amazing in this film. When I first saw her, I said oh yes, that's her...but a few seconds later I totally forgot it was Blanchett playing Dylan. She was very convincing as Dylan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inaccurate product description","review":"I'm Not There was my favorite movie of the year.

Director Todd Haynes goes out on a limb with some artsy manouvers: firstly, a whole series of actors depict different sides of Dylan's personality, secondly a lot of the biographical information is skewed or simply made-up, and thirdly the film consists of a number of vignettes based on actual performances and interviews rather than telling a story. Sadly the film is a failure. The multiple actors are off-putting, the fictional elements are confusing, and without any narrative thrust the whole thing soon becomes very boring. The liberal use of Bob Dylan's music is the only thing that redeems it. Better to watch Scorsese's documentary \\"No Direction Home\\" if you want to get closer to Dylan."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more!","review":"There was a time in the sixties when I used to gobble down anything they trew at me, even sitar music, just as long as it was cool, NO MORE!

If you're in the mood for a movie that is great to look at, filled with some good (and some bad) covers, and has some great acting (thankfully Christian Bale doesn't speak too much).Basically, this is a movie that's not for everyone. And it doesn't make you stupid if you don't enjoy it. But I will say this -- you don't need to know much about Dylan to like it.

Maybe the biggest disappointment of 2007. The film is self-indulgent, my interest in Dylan is genuine and has been. I am not a fanatic mind you and I have little care about what the great man was like, let alone it being described my six very infuriating characters and acts. While watching the film, I was confused, there was nothing interesting. While fans of the film might argue, you have to be open to the whole new way of directing a film, I must admit this film left me in a bad mood and feeling rather indolent. The best thing about this film is the fact that it ends. And one more thing I might add, I actually hold it against the great man (Bob Dylan) for allowing them to make something like this.

If you want to know Dylan, just listen to his records. No need to watch this film. Listen to his albums from early years and then the later ones as he evolves. Or read a bio of him. After seeing Don't Look Back and the Scorsese film, this movie is decidedly unnecessary. As useful as a remake of Psycho.Probably because I lived through those Dylan years from Newport and remember when he plugged in and how upset I was, that scene rang true. I recovered and became a fan.To learn about Dylan, read Baez's A Voice to Sing With and get her look at the real Dylan. He is/was pretentious or maybe the press made him pretentious. Doesn't matter. His music is what counts and skip the film and put on his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Was There?","review":"I have long admired Bob Dylan. He is a part of our culture. They'll be selling his music long after this film is only available at yard sales, sharing boxes with lava lamps. This film is a confusing waste of fine actors. They should have used the production costs to feed the hungry.True, some of the pieces of this puzzle are better than others. But when you put it all together, it's obvious that Dylan's creative genius had nothing to do with it. I'll give it a star because you have to give it a star.

I fast forwarded through much of the film, maybe I was not being fair to the film makers but that may be because I was there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redeemed by the soundtrack","review":"Innovative approach to the life of an often mystifying person, but the final result is, for all but the most ardent Dylan fans, overly long and not really as interesting as the premise made it out to be.For those of us who like Dylan's music even if we are not so intensely followers of his whole life story, the best thing about the film is the soundtrack. Lots of great Dylan songs, original or covered. I rented this at Family Video for a dollar, so it was like a cheap music download; glad I didn't invest any more in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan freak","review":"I am and have been a Dylan fan for many years and this was an excellent movie!!

It is one I can watch over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"In my opinion this CD was awful. All songs on this CD were written by Dylan but performed by various artists giving their own renditions, which were hardly recognizable Dylan songs. The only song on the CD actually sung by Dylan is \\"I'm Not There\\" which does not even sound like Dylan. The only song on this CD that I really like is Goin to Acapulco by Jim James and Calexio. If you are looking for the classic Dylan/Sound music that some of us grew up with, this CD is not what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"This movie sucks!

I was confused about this movie from the start. So many of the actors are Bob Dylan - who is not Bob Dylan, but has 16 different names. Is this movie in black and white or is it in color? Does this person try to send a message, or is the screenplay some sort of mumbo-jumbo? Or, do we pretend that we get it - yes Bob Dylan is the great one: he trascends race, gender, country origin (he is American and citizen of the world - or ahem, some sort of Jewish wonderer) - his message is universal, his poetry and music understood by people from all walks of life. Well if that is the message, than I did not need to see this movie. I already knew that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"A complete waste of time. I watched this once and Im selling to my local used record shop. (Hopefully they'll give me at least $2.00) I bought it for $6.99 at Best Buy. Wonder why they dropped the price from 19.99 to 6.99? I dearly love Bob Dylan's catalog and can't believe he approved this mess. Pawning this off to Dylan's fan base is disgusting, I will be very wary of any future related Bob purchases I work too hard for the money. He's lost it completely this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but not for everyone","review":"This movie is as great as all the 5-star reviews say, BUT only for a select group of viewers who can accept film as a non-linear, surreal medium of expression and invention. DO NOT expect this movie to be a staight forward documentary. DO NOT expect to learn factual information about Bob Dylan. DO NOT expect a linear story of any kind. DO NOT see this movie if you want to understand everything in every scene, if you need every thing to make sense, if you need a basic good vs bad plot and a happy ending.DO SEE this movie if you'd like to see a talented filmmaker breaking new ground and shaping stories, legends and songs into a dreamlike cinematic mosaic unlike anything that's been done before!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellednt album!","review":"This album is simply awesome.

The only time I have had any difficulty at all is when somebody has already tried to remove the tick with tweezers and left only part of the tick remaining. Even then, I have been able to remove the tick with a couple of tries. With a whole tick, the Ticked-Off Tick Remover works very well, every time. I keep one with my dog grooming stuff and one in my human first aid kit, and have some spares. I gave one as a gift to a friend this year, because the ticks were really bad around here this spring.

It's sort of sad, but very pretty, and the lyrics are interesting to listen to. And, the best was saved for last--Bachelorette is my new favorite b-side. It is perfect, and I'm actually rather annoyed that it didn't get onto the album, From the Choirgirl Hotel. It would have fit perfectly with the rest of the songs.

First the bean bag itself could present a risk as it keeps the child from being able to clear his head. Secondly, one of the reasons babies are at risk of SIDS while on their bellies is because they sleep more soundly.

I believe a good share of the world would do well to read it.Why?Because it teaches the person how to think clearly, and to think fairly. It teaches what a logical argument is and what a non- sequitur is. It teaches what a fair argument is and what an ad- hominem argument is.Bernard Huppe was a great Chaucer scholar but he was also a great humanist, a man of broad culture and understanding.I see that he is listed as the sole author of this work. If I am not mistaken, and I may be , I thought that he had a co- author Jack Kamensky, who was a teacher of Philosophy.

I really wondered how the book was written; my impression was that it was a rather old dictionary spruced up with a pretty cover, new typeface and the hasty addition of some regionalisms.

I am the Lyn Marker that is mentioned in this almost true crime novel. While many of Mr. Fenley's statements about my Uncle Dick's early years are factual, he is highly swayed by the Good family in the majority of this work. His relationship with Marcia Good's first husband at the Dayton Daily News makes for highly prejudicial reading. He did not, however, misrepresent any of the information that I offered to him. It was not mentioned in his book however that my uncle was finally convicted in Arkansas the same year that Bill Clinton was bidding for the presidency. The GUILTY verdicts in his case had been overturned by the Arkansas Supreme Court twice, but overturning it the third time would have reflected badly on the Governor's bid for Democratic nomination.

I am usually somewhat picky about albums I purchase, but I bought this one almost as soon as I heard it. Deas Vail may have a piano driven sound similar to Mae and other groups, but it is uniquely their own, guided by the soaring vocals of lead singer Wes Blaylock. This kid has some amazing vocal chops. All the instrumentation is tight and well done, especially the piano work of Laura Beth Hudson, which is heavily featured on the album.

I\`ve tried ajusting the coils but this model has no ajustments for FM only AM the AM has bleed too so if you try to pick up distant stations at night you may hear the strong station next to it. For example I live in Atlanta GA so the strongest AM signal is 750 WSB so if I try to tune into 780 WBBM at night I get 750 bleeding through I have had other Panasonic boomboxes that don\`t have this trouble with AM.

The controls really are quite confusing. Why can't there be one set of common controls that work for both tape and CD?2. When playing an MP3 CD, one cannot use the fast-forward function. One can skip a whole track, but one cannot search to the middle of the track. I checked the manual, and it even says that one can't use the fast-forward function with an MP3 CD. Amazing! (The fast-forward function does work with ordinary CDs).3. When one turns off the unit, it forgets where it was playing.

I doubt we will use the tape, but the ability to play mp3's makes the machine priceless. After looking, listening, and playing with around 100 radios or boomboxes, I can assuredly say that the sound on this unit is easily comparable! The logic of the controls is not too tough and if the kid loses the remote... shame on her :)Bottom line, if you are looking for something that has decent sound, good construction, and most importantly - plays other formats on cdr's... this has got to be the most affordable quality option out there.

The problem with the film is that the screenplay seems to not focus enough on the redemption of the main character. The main character Luke, was a gunfighter who used to ride with a gang and he eventually left after a massacre they committed. The film instead focus almost entirely on the villains and their murders of the families who refused to leave their land because of the railroad, this was wicked distracting and made me extremely uncomfortable. When the main character Luke, played by Casper Van Dein, came onto the screen, it seemed to me that all of his scenes were small and they disappeared quickly.

It is a joy to read, and appears to have been a joy to write, for this youthful, vibrant, charismatic novel flows effortlessly through cities, affairs, and misadventures. Colorful characters abound -- early on there's an uproariously matter-of-fact description of our hero's casual fling with the wife of an American power broker. The mythological superstructure of the book -- glorious youth flirting with power, wisdom, and love -- is light enough for Vidal's characters to prance and amuse. It's a nice departure from his oh-so-serious historical novels and a welcome, balletic hop into Vidal's fantasies. He wrote this novel around 1950 -- when peace and prosperity were just re-emerging after wartime.

Quite explicit in its sexual content - especially for the time - it is at once a satiric yet very funny piece: Vidal has great fun deflating the pretensions of the so-called 'smart set' of Europeans (as well as Americans) who infested the cities at that time, attempting to dictate the manners of the time yet simultaneously driven by the desire to remain famous for being famous. Yet Vidal does not overlook the shortcomings of his hero; despite his desire for travel, he is seduced by this world, both literally and physically.

Following up their modest success, THE WAY I MATE, THE SPIRIT OF THE HAWK is a fascinating departure for the group. With an instantly catchy beat and an Indian-styled influence, this track is an exercise in talented subtely. I loved THE WAY I MATE, and I may just like THE SPIRIT OF THE HAWK a little bit more. It is beautiful, and perfectly crafted to capture the true essence of the European pop market."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare but Excellent Early Source for Model A Restorations","review":"I purchased this book at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn over ten years ago--and am cursing my luck because I can't find it anywhere. The book was written, I believe, shortly after production of the Model A ended. It therefore recommends the use of very simple tools, something that many restorers on a budget would find welcome today. Also, because this book wasn't created by FoMoCo, it offers some homespun knowledge that can't be found in any official Ford factory bulletins. Even better, it covers some aftermarket parts available at the time. The book is charmingly illustrated with period prints, often showing novel approaches to tackling problems, but sometimes lacking in clear detail. Overall, this is a great resource. Where else can you find step-by-step instructions for removing a Model A body from its frame, or performing a simple alignment, or servicing of the suspension. Now where the heck did I put that book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"bliss encoded","review":"i love this record. love. that's a big word. if you like harmonies that saturate your soul and melodies that you cannot forget (you will humming them forever) then just buy this. the instrumentation, the lyrics, the phrasing are brilliant. belle & sebastian fans know this already. let's update the ones who don't. this is modern-retro 60's pop, scottish pub, drinking-song alternative folk-rock that smart college kids dig and their 'simon & garfunkel' parents will dig, too.if this is your first Belle & Sebastian record, trust me, you will buy more after this.the snappiest numbers: \\"if she wants me\\", \\"i'm a cuckoo\\", & \\"wrapped up in books\\". but they're all golden, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"my ears did bleed!","review":"what went wrong? is this a cover band? regretfully it seems that belle and sebastian have drained the well dry... if you want only fond memories of this band, don't buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment.","review":"I'm a huge Belle & Sebastian fan, and I plotzed when I saw that they had a new album. But...this album sucks. It is nowhere near their other stuff...which is odd, because they seemed to be making consistantly good albums. I would even say this album approaches an imitation of thier older stuff, which is stupid because they wrote it. It just seems pretentious, and not well thought out, and just plain bad. I don't recommend this album...but I do endorse all of their other products with a big flaming passion. So that's that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let-Down","review":"I am a big fan and was eager to hear the new album.

They enrich their previous acoustic sound with more variety of rhythm, melodic richness and detail production with orchestral arrangements that extol their witty lyrics and natural talent for melody.The traces of 60's music are evident in this album. Beatles, Zombies, Kinks, Left Banke or Burt Bacharach sound in songs such as \\"Lord Anthony\\", \\"You don't send me\\" or \\"Asleep on a sunbeam\\", gems found in this wonderful album for people without prejudices and people who like timeless melodies and songs that generate heterogeneous feelings in the perceptive listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't get any better","review":"I think this CD is perfection. In fact, it is firmly at the top on my best of 2003 list. It has both peppy, sinfully catchy tunes and also the more traditionally mellow, thoughtful B&S fare. I don't understand why people think this is such a departure from their previous work. I think this is just another wonderful addition.

If you like sunny days, if you like and ice cream and the girl next door (but you were not able to talk, but in your dreams you were walking hand to hand), this is your Belle and Sebastian's album.Not overproduced, because it's an \\"outrospective\\" album; not silly, because it take much more intelligence to make a album of happiness than one of misery. Murdoch has mastered both sides of the mask: the smiling and the suffering. A pop masterpiece that could be your first aproach to a band called Belle and Sebastian (but take in count that there's another band of the same name who has signed three beautiful albums named \\"Tigermilk\\", \\"If you're feeling sinister\\" and \\"The Boy with te Arab Strap\\").Enjoy!

TOLKIEN BOOKS THAT WERE RECENTLY MADE INTO MOVIES (DUH!). READ THE LINER NOTES OF THIS ALBUM AND SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY ABOUT THE FOUR TOWERS.

I have followed them since the onset of Tigermilk, good album, then to sinister, great album, then to their pinnacle The Boy with the Arab Strap, pure excellence. It has been all downhill since. I have no idea what direction they've been trying to go in. I have no idea who they are now.

Here's why:1. The lyrics are corny. In past albums, they were able to take a moment or a situation and turn it into an endless ode (think Summer Wasting or Seeing Other People), or they'd tell a great story. In this album, almost every song is just another first-person song describing something that the singer feels, or something they went through.2. The music really is not compelling. I don't even mean the production of it, but just the basic song structures. They don't have that same enchanting magic they once have (String Bean Jean, Sing Jonathan David, need I say more?). The songs are very.. boring.That's basically it. I've ranked Belle and Sebastian in the top 2 for several years now, and was so excited to get this album. When I listened to it the first time, I almost cried because of how awful it is.If you're looking for a B&S album to buy, go for ANY of their older ones. They are all great."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate this album","review":"I like Belle and Sebastian, and I bought this record used for $3.95. I listened to it three times, the first time, I thought, oh no. The second time, I thought, what is this? The last time, I almost threw the CD out the window of my car. Right now, it's on the passenger seat, out of its little crystal package. An orange thing there, next to me when I drive. I haven't thrown it away, I haven't even put it into its container. It's like I don't want to touch it. Maybe when I get back in my car, it will be gone.It's atrocious. Did I spell that correctly? Who cares. On the other hand, I'm listening to a lot of Harry Nilsson lately, and I like that very much.Peace out, as they say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album!!!","review":"First off let me say, I am a longtime B&S fan. I like pretty much everything they've done, although I think If you're feeling Sinister has always stood out as their best work. After listening to the new album about a dozen times, I am happy to say it is right up there with IYFS in terms of quality. I cannot believe some of the negative reviews of this album! I have a feeling a lot of those were knee-jerk reactions and that after more listenings those people like this new album now. This is an album that works best as a whole, it should be listened to straight through. It really makes me feel good when it's on. While it is a bit lighter and brighter, it still has all the wit and overall moodiness that makes B&S who they are. I love it. I absolutely love this album. The production is great, the songwriting is some of the best they've done. Give it a fair chance and I think fans of good music will appreciate this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Novel!","review":"I really enjoyed reading Jan Christensen's novel - I read it sometime ago and never got around to posting a review for this wonderful book.

It comes as no surprise that the centerpiece of the disc is the outstanding DFA remix, clocking in at just over nine minutes, with its catchy-as-hell pulsating beat and seizure-enducing disco freakouts. The Luomo remix follows suit with mind-bending soundscapes, yet cries for the dancefloor. The ZZ Pot remix crafts a perfect blend of noise and psychadelia, delivering an equally impressive skronk-fest that makes SY's \\"Diamond Sea\\" sound tame.This one could be on repeat for a while.

I am very rarely critical of the books I read, but then again I also rarely read such garbage. And the worst part is, the creator of the show is the author. That came as a huge surprise seeing as how the characters took nearly the entire book to truly become the ones we know and love on the show.

It was very helpful in its description of the pain and commitment required to journey into the spiritual world. This is one of many books you could read while exploring Native American healing and rituals. I think, if you wish to get a more developed insight of this world it requires reading this book as well as others since there is a wide swath of beliefs and approaches among tribes and locations.Having said all this, you might be amazed at the similarities, the commonly held concepts among disparate peoples and their obvious connections to beliefs held by groups who openly consider indigenous religions \\"pagan.\\"Hawk Woman Dancing with the Moon's book has an occasional touch of the histrionic but other than that is enjoyable and informative and gives a poignant portrait of skills that will hopefully survive our gimmicky and pharmeceutical world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on Native Medicine Woman and Healing.","review":"While this book is essentially designed for women I believe it is equally useful for men. Tela shares her life experiences learning the old ways as an Medicine Woman in the modern world, she shares her struggles and her many blessings showing how difficult the path of a medicine person actually is. This book is a good companion to those written by her X-husband Bobby Lake Thom, aka \\"Medicine Grizzly Bear. This is a must read for anybody studying the Native American Medicine path."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borinnnnnnnnnng","review":"Being in Burlesque was fascinating. There were always new adventures, new friends and the glamor. This book, as well as being filled with errors, trivializes this wonderful venue. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sober history of an intoxicating subject","review":"Shteir's thorough research is fleshed-out by her concise writing and moderate tone. This is a scholarly but entertaining review of how show-business from the early 19th century to the present has explored its outer limits, and how the clientele have responded. It will take its place in due course with contemporary accounts of gladiatorial contests, bear-baiting and the bullring: those times and places where entertainment as either the living spectacle, or the distant retrospective confronts us with just what sort of people we are, that we get our jollys in such a medium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book, Poorly Written and Boring, too!","review":"For any interested in the art of striptease, please don't waste your time with this book. It is trite and heady and there are many better books out there on the subject such as \\"Striptease: From Gaslight to Spotlight.\\" It also appears many reviewers of this book appear to agree. They also express what I felt: that this author has a loose grip on relaying accurate facts and history.I suspect the author wishes secretly to be a stripper rather than a university theatre professor who gets terrible online reviews from her students. The author doesn't say much about what interested her about this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with errors","review":"This was probably the worse book I have ever had the misfortune to examine. Did the author check anything she wrote in the book, or did she just blindly copy her \\"National Enquirer\\" type sources?

There are other excellent reference books available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable achievement","review":"The only convincing Jolson biography. It's astonishing how much the author found, so long after his subject's death. Jolson the public wonder and private sociopath (loosely speaking) are each given their due. The author doubts neither aspect. He has interviewed people who knew J. well (Irving Caesar, Jessel, etc.)and he has found vivid contemporary accounts. He writes well: concisely, judiciously. The work of a real biographer, not a journalist perpetrating a show-biz bio. He has done the research and digested it.

Just when deep-seated problems force a marriage off the road, a random, external force intrudes, bringing with it a life and death element, and putting those other familiar issues in perspective. But is it already too late for Antoine and Helene? Both the leads tackle their demanding roles with gusto, so we feel fully invested in the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Road Kill","review":"If I wanted to watch 2 hours of road ahead of a car then I'd get out and drive somewhere nice instead..A particularly tedious effort.. by the time any \\"drama\\" occured I was too hypnotized by the road to pay any attention. There is also an awful american style (and thus telegraphed) horror moment thrown in to truly condemn the film. Having a huge collection of world movies I am not easily bored! but this managed it!Sometimes when it looks as though nothing is really happening in a movie it really is because nothing is happening! Just because its French does not excuse it... Such a mundane thing as a bad marriage is unable to conjure up any tension in this manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"THINK 1980S CINEMAX","review":"Yes, it's been decades since FOR YOUR EYES ONLY and Bunuel, and Carole Bouquet has no butt, but it's still nice to see her in this movie, even if it is for just a little while.The star of this movie is a George Castanza type who really knows how to down some beers (not wine), and the bars in this French movie are kinda sleazy, not quaint. Despite some classical music in the background, this movie comes off like some 1980s direct to Cinemax movie, and that's not a bad thing.This movie is more like THE HITCHER or SOMETHING WILD than any Hitchcock or Chabrol, though of course name dropping those two directors is better advertising. The scenes of drunk driving on a 2-lane road at night are scary/moody enough, there's the cliche of radio music interupted by news of a prison escape, and the cliched evil hitchhiker.No great thrills, but it's mostly fun, with a long episode akin to a trippy BARFLY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, dumb, loud cowbilly cacophonies","review":"A good, silly raunchabilly outing, with a slinky roots-R&B edge, kinda like Tony Joe White backed by the Cramps.

The dialog is terrible. The acting is stiff and awkward. And Leelee is a terrible actress and it is compounded by how unbelieveably naive and stupid her character is. Or maybe Leelee is a brilliant actress and does an amazing job portraying a really stupid character? My guess is not. She was just as stiff and awkward in Al Pacino's bomb of a movie 88 minutes.

While I don't necessarily expect everyone to find it as clever and well crafted as I do, I'm amazed to read that there are people who didn't even enjoy it.

Simple, Sloth and Presumption are out of correct order in that The Dangerous Journey has them before the Interpreters House and before the burden is off Christian's back. John Bunyan's classic has these three characters placed after the Cross. It is important to stay true to the text because it is a Classic. This makes me wonder if the reviewers before me, have ever read the original. Such is the times in which we live. PS: The Video makes the same error."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerous Journey","review":"I bought this to read to my 5 year old.

I bought this little dictionary because I sometimes can't think of the word I need or because I can't remember how its written. So the plusses are that it's portable and has the written arabic script next to the words. I was very surprised, however, and disappointed, to find that many very simple words were not even included. Imra'a, for example (woman) was not listed on the Arabic side. Walad (boy) was not listed at all. Some of the translations were not as I learned them, so I am hesitant to look up new words for fear that I will memorize them incorrectly. I did want something light, but I wanted it light in weight, not content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated PG-13 At Least...","review":"We purchased this book for our son for Christmas on a recommendation from someone else. However, the cover art is definitely not family-friendly, and a quick glance at the text revealed language that would be offensive to nearly any Christian.

Ortega y Gasset argues a larger, archetypal predicament, that the supposed elites are plagued with the same lowest common denominator, mass or canned thought as everyone else is. Ortega y Gasset is writing with a slightly larger scope than Lasch and I would propose that Lasch misreads Ortega y Gasset himself and fails in his analysis. Purported 'Elites' are not an agreed upon monolith, and ostensibly those advancing the thought of Leo Strauss or, antipodally, Louis Althusser can be construed as elites. Therefore, one must respond with the criticism to Lasch of which elites are railroading democracy. I find this a simplistic indictment and far less invigorating than his excellent \\"The Culture of Narcissism\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pillory well-off wage-earners, ignore the TRUE wealthy elite","review":"A grumpy common-sense look at some very difficult social problems. The elites mentioned in the title are a smug, self-satisfied group of middle-class professionals turning their backs on their social responsibilities. But the book completely ignores the multitude of anti-social practices, regulations, laws and policies that benefit the wealthiest fraction of society (the REAL elite in America). These are the people voting the stock (and influencing the politicians) that could resist or reverse the alarming trends discussed here...but far better and easier to attack the new money for its inherited problems than to question the real power base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Richard Bach instead","review":"Ping is intended to be a parable about 'realizing your true nature and never-ending potential.' An effective parable has literary merit, and is driven by metaphor.

I know heat rises but if you stick this in front of you sitting down your feel will be as cold as if you didn't have it.I would not buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fused the socket and cut off power for a few times.","review":"It fused a few sockets and left a burn mark behind.

I bought this heater and was greatly surprised. One review said it tilts, thats because they assembled it wrong it has slots that need to line up. Very easy to put together. The apatment is about 600 square feet. The heat was immediate and within a few hours the WHOLE apartment was a very comfortable 70 degrees and couldn't be more quiet, as a fan has to make some sound. I would recommend to anyone. Very comfortable heat and low cost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You would get more Heat from a Candle!","review":"I ordered this thing after seeing the good reviews on Amazon. The heater does everthing well except: heat. That's right. It's all digital, oscillates, has automatic shutoff when it reaches a certain temperature, etc. So I suppose very little money was left to actually create a decent heating element when all the bells and whistles were figured in.Honestly, one could get as much heat if they had a windproof candle and a fan. I had this on one night last week when it was in the forties outside, with the heater on in my house, and the heat would not move about 70.Also, if you look at the October Consumer Reports on space heaters, Lakso did very poorly--Honeywell, Kenwood, Soleus, Vornado and a few others all did better.If you are looking for bells and whistles this may be your heater. If you are looking for a heater that actually heats look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good heater for a moderate space","review":"Contrary to other posts, this heater heats quickly and does not smell. It does not make much more noise than an oscillating fan. It heats our den quickly. On the negative side, the internal thermostat is inaccurate and typically overstates the temperature in our room. As such, setting the thermostat is trial and error since you must raise the desired temperature to consider the thermostat error. Also, instructions for the heater are bare bones and unintuitive. Given the price of home heating oil (more expensive than gasoline), I planned to use the heater to warm my bedroom before going to bed. However, the instructions caution users to keep the heater more than 3 feet from any flammable material. Since my bedroom is carpeted, I am reluctant to use it there despite the tower below the heating element. While I think that a fire is unlikely (as long as I don't leave it running and fall asleep), I am reluctant to tempt fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"Pros:Kicks out heat instantlyThe pivot function works well to make heating evenPerfect for a small areaThe remote makes it a breeze to use in the bedroomThe timer makes you never worry you'll leave it on too long and waste energy or other problemsCons:Unit is pretty wobbly to the touch and should not be used in a room children or animals like to run around in, in my opinion.Overall, I'm fairly happy. It does exactly what you'd want in a small area which is heat. The only thing lacking is any kind of truly low energy option; 900w is as low is at goes.

This is perfect for the price. If you are cuddled up on the couch you can use the remote for all functions. Being on a pedestal is a great because it is the same height when you are on the couch.

I unpluggeed it and put it to the side until i needed to use it. 2 days later we got a cold front and so i plugged it in and set it to 75. the heat was working for about 20 minutes. then i changed the setting from high fan to low fan and the heat stopped working. i tried EVERYTHING. i unplugged it and left it for 20 minutes to see if it needed to re-set. no luck. the only thing that worked was the fan, and it was blowing cold air. i am returning this and buying the honeywell motion sensor heater. my friends just purchased it for their apartment and seemed to have good luck with theirs.

Most of them I would give either 4 or 5 stars. However, the \\"Prehistory\\" book is far worse than any of them, both in terms of content and style. In fact, I think it is so bad that I was compelled to write my very first Amazon review to warn others about it. The writing is rambling, vacuous and repetitive. There is very little prehistory covered, or any other history for that matter. You'll probably learn more about David Beckham's soccer skills than, say, what happened to the Neanderthals (they went extinct). However, if you enjoy the pseudo-intellectual cross-cultural, deconstructionist academese babble, this book just might be the one to keep you up late at night. Otherwise, stay away as far as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"I've had mostly good experiences with books from this OUP series.

It has a concise instructor, good modifications, and a very lengthy step program (over 40 minute of step). The choreography is fun and interesting, but be careful, this is advanced.I workout to different aerobic DVD's and step happens to be my favorite (at home) because I can get a good workout and keep my heartrate up. I would consider myself an intermediate stepper based on the amount of time I step each week (over 2 hours) and the length of time (more that 3 years).I found this difficult, but, I appreciate a DVD that is a challenge. It gives me something to work toward and a feeling of accomplishment when I complete it correctly.You will like this one if, like me, you like a challenge and to step for over 1/2 hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Non-Fiction","review":"In the first volume, Frame beautifully describes her New Zealand childhood. Her descriptions of her family, their day-to-day lives, and their economic and personal hardships, stay with the reader long after reading Volume I.In Volume II she describes her college years and subsequent mental mis-diagnosis, which led to several years of institutionalization. Rather than leaving the reader depressed, somehow she brings one into the experience but leaves us wondering at her resilience and ability to continue writing.Volume III contains her account of her growing acceptance as a writer and her association with other well-known New Zealand writers. This is a must for anyone interested in: a brilliant picture of an artist; New Zealand life; good non-fiction writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great literary autobiography","review":"I read this book about a month ago and was very impressed. Brilliant for fans of New Zealand Literature as it beautifully evokes the New Zealand landscape and atmosphere. Despite the poetic language, it's a real page turner. I particularly enjoyed volume three, in which Frame moves to an area of London that I know very well. I had a great time picking out familiar road names!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frame saves herself and achieves, in spite of all!","review":"I came to this book by way of the movie \\"An Angel at My Table\\" [which was fairly true to the book]. I had never heard of Janet Frame, and was so intrigued by the film that I knew I had to read her autobiography. The book introduces you to her impoverished life in New Zealand [she was born in 1924], and includes about two dozen pages of photos of Janet's family [it was wonderful putting the real faces to the ones we were introduced to in the movie]. From the epilepsy of her brother, the drownings of her two sisters, her own mental breakdown in college [which was erroneously diagnosed as schizophrenia], you understand how all of her traumas and perceptions are incorporated later into her writing career. She overcomes daunting events and social alienation to become a novelist, poet, and short-story author.I have continued to read more of her writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Autobiography","review":"I do not know of any author who can retain so much authencity in his writing and yet produce such beautiful and imaginative prose, other than Janet Frame.Her excellent autobiography is definitely worth a reading and offers an insight to her other works which are, at times, more experimental and harder to grasp. I have seen the film adaptation but this book has even more to offer: the heartfelt descriptions of the family members, some beautifully written passages which could hardly be translated into film, the 24 pages of delightful photos of Frame and her family...etc.Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine!","review":"You should look at the reviews for this Panasonic DMR-E55 unit with the black outer finish on Amazon for many more reviews of this silver version.

I have a feeling I'll be returning it often till the warranty expires and then I'll throw it out.For what it's worth it worked well until its demise."},{"rating":"2","title":"One often overlooked feature","review":"Several reviews discuss the reduction in quality in going from a 2 hour recording to a four hour recording. One very cool feature on this machine is Flexible Recording, where it will set the recording time and quality to exactly the time you need.So if you need to record a movie that's 2 hours and 10 minutes, insead of using the 4 hour setting and having the large reduction in quality just to fit in the extra 10 minutes, use Flexible Record mode, set it for 2 hrs 10 mins, and get almost the same quality as the 2 hour mode.This feature makes a huge difference in the recording quality of the many movies that run just over 2 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consumer review of Panasonic DMRE55S Pro Sc DVD RecPlay Silv","review":"I bought this system just to copy all my old VCR tapes onto DVD Media.

Well, get used to it! This book has some good ideas and helpful hints and I won't say it's not worth reading. However, Syd must have been paid by the word, because he says the same thing 3 or 4 ways in the same sentence. Occasionally he does this in a way that clarifies what he said the first time, but usually it seems like he's trying to show off how many synonyms he knows.I've never read any of his screenplays, so I'm not sure what kind of screen writer he is, but as a book writer he makes it feel like an effort to get through the many words and to the actual substance.

But the downer, for me anyway, is the continual return to \\"present day life\\" of the main character, his negativity, and grim outlook on life.Not enough optimism in this book for me, nor enough deep sorrow to provide a moving experience.

Here are my impressions:PROS:- Does an OK job for the person with no sharpening skills whatsoever.CONS:- You have to get the timing just right when drawing knives through the unit, otherwise the grind is uneven.- If you accidentally allow the point of the knife to dip down upon withdrawing, it will excessively grind the tip.- The rubber feet do not do an adequate job of stabilizing the unit. It will creep when it is in use. I had to place mine on a piece of latex drawer liner.- Finally, and this is what I dislike most of all - it leaves longitudinal scratches along the length of the knife. The scratches are not deep but they ARE noticeable.My advice - Get a sharpening stone and learn to use it or if you don't feel comfortable with establishing sharpening angles, get a Lansky or Gatco sharpener. Stay away from this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does exactly what it is supposed to do","review":"This device DOES sharpen knives like a professional sharpener would. It takes a little practice to sharpen knives using this machine. Yes, a little practice, but NOT a lot of practice. I suggest using cheap knives to practice with until you are comfortable enough to sharpen your good knives. I was not disappointed in this item and highly recommend it. Knives come our razor sharp.

I think they caused more damage than good. We use Wusthof knives and although there is a lifetime replacement warranty, I would prefer to not have to use this warranty. Regardless, the sharpener performed amazingly. The edges are crisp and scarily sharp. There have already been a few times when I have underestimated the sharpness and almost caused personal harm to myself, but as long as you do it right, there should be no problems.The sharpener is extremely easy to use and took about 3 minutes to read the directions and figure out which slots to pass the blades through for the desired effect.I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have a great, clean, and polished finish without investing in sharpening services ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for hunting type knives","review":"Works okay for pocket knives and most kitchen knives.

It can only handle knives with a thin blade that has flat sides to it. Thicker blades or any blade that's not a full flat grind will not sit properly in the guides. Save your self the trouble of having to return this product and buy the KnifeMaster Pro Sharpening System. Not only can you do ANY knife, but you can also sharpen anything that needs sharpening like chisels, lawn mower blades and so on.

Now.. nothing beats a good stone, but I have to admit i was impressed..It left a nice edge (shaved my arm) and didn't seem to grind the heck out of the blade.

This sharpener works wonderfully. The triple angle edge looks rough, but is actually quite sharp. I use the finest grit frequently on my knives, every 2nd or 3rd use. I cannot say how this would work on low quality knives, I use it on Henckels, Wusthof and F Dick.If you're a professional, you may not like the edge profile. I have a fine grit water wheel that I use in the woodshop to sharpen woodworking tools, and it leaves a mirror finish, which looks nicer than the edge you get with the Chef's Choice.

The knives do not get near as sharp as using the ceramic, but it saves me a lot of time.

After one year, both of mine actually made my knives duller, and I use top of the line Henckels knives. If you buy one of these, you'd better save your receipt because you'll need it. They have a three year warranty, but you'll need your receipt or it will cost you $45 plus shipping to refurbish one. You'll still pay shipping even with a receipt.

It seems they almost totally took out the rockabilly influence (with the acception of a couple songs) and their passion seems to have left the band as well. I'm not one of those people who hate bands that want to make a better living with their music, but it seems they tried to make this album more radio friendly in the sense that they're trying to hint to their audience that they want to sell out.

However the plastic in the tank cap deteriorated and the cap fell apart. They do not stock this part even though there are numerous customers on internet looking for it.

I was suckered into it because I liked the features and the way the product looks. Unfortunately the product designers did not consider usability -- they designed the (allegedly germicidal) near-ultraviolet LED light to be close to the steam outlet, so that when you run the unit in a dark room, bright circles of blue light appear on the ceiling. And guess which frequencies of light signal our sleeping brain to wake up? That's right -- blue light. Stupid.It took 4 encounters with Bionaire customer service to ascertain that it is not possible for customers to disable this light.Plus, the unit stopped working after about 10 uses.

My Insignia lasted until late last year and then stopped playing any DVDs. I put it aside for a while and since I have 4 other DVD players, I let it sit. I tried it again in April, and amazingly it played for 2 months and then I started hearing whirring and grinding noises. I think that this is just a cheaply made unit that LG wouldn't even put it's name on. I have several other LG DVD players, one which has lasted over 5 years and another which is still playing very well for more than 3 years. I also have a 47\\" LG LCD which is working well.

All we get is a bear chasing people and, if we're lucky, throwing them a few feet through the air. If you're a rabid gore fan like me, you'll be bored to tears.

By the time the film ended and we realized no one was going to live, I was in hysterics and my dad was disgusted that we spent 80 minutes watching this messed up film.True, the plot might have gone somewhere had they hired actors based on (Le gasp) acting instead of their looks, Four kids, teens rather, kill a baby bear on a trip and ~BAM~ momma bear is out for revenge. I honestly wouldn't waste my money buying this, but that isn't to say it isn't worth watching for laughs. It might be a fun film to rent so you can mock it with friends.

I mean c'mon! Are bears that smart to know the person that kills their bear cub and exact that much revenge The acting was very subpar and there were no bear maulings, just a bunch of throwing at trees and roofs. This was like a cable access movie, only it was made by the ScyFy (formerly SciFi) Network along with some Canadian film company.

The cast is impressive and Graham Kosakoski is exceptional. There isn't a lot of plot going on here, but there are many beautiful shots from Decoteau and some cool attack scenes. The grizzly bear is pretty cool as well. The DVD is packaged in an attractive embossed slipcase.

There was no character development, so the viewer never really develops any attachment to the four human characters. Four young folk, three men and a woman, drive to the middle of nowhere and accidentally run over a bear cub at the beginning of the film. The rest of the movie is all about these four individuals getting killed by the cub's mother one by one (well, the last two are killed together). The bear is never shown at the same time with the actors. When attacking her victims, the bear is shown waving her paw and red blots appear on the screen. In the end, everyone is dead except the bear. It would be a tragedy if the filming was such that it could be believable.

In this sequel to Executive Actions, readers meet many of the characters from the first book, in addition to several newbies. The author develops his recurring characters nicely. The lives of Scott Roarke, his girlfriend, Katie Kessler, New York Times reporter Michael O'Connell, and the current administration intersect in a way that keeps the reader riveted. Despite the numerous typographical errors and lengthy, unnecessary detail, she wants to keep turning the pages to see if Roarke gets his assassin and saves the day.Though the events in this one are a bit far-fetched, they are believable enough that the reader isn't disappointed. With a kicker surprise ending that will leave the reader eager for the next book in the series, fans of this genre will enjoy Executive Treason by Gary Grossman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and Too Much Detail","review":"First off, I agree with KeesLover's review. As seems to be the trend amongst many authors these days, the book leans heavily to the left fringe. Conservatives are bashed and made out to be gun-toting rednecks that want to take over the government. Quite humorous to say the least that an author can be so shallow minded.Secondly, the book is too detailed on information that is not necessary for the story. That is why the author placed a list of characters and their respective roles at the beginning of the book. If you have to list the characters and their roles at the beginning of the book to keep the reader aware of all that is happening, then perhaps the book isn't worth the read when many authors can tell a similar story without the minute details and character roles.I don't recommend the book. Took a long time to tell a rather predictable and short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"A cheap mindless book to while away several hours of air travel. The author constantly repeats key elements of the story - almost as if he were trying to fill pages. The addition of a cheesy romantic story-line rendered this story almost intolerable.

This is the worst edited book I've ever read -- with many words concatenated together without a space between them, which makes reading very difficult. I'm very surprised how this could've happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exciting Story but Poor Digital Editing","review":"The story was excting and just the kind of political adventure that I enjoy. The story line was interesting, but perhaps a bit far-fetched. I agree with another reviewer that the attack on the conservative media went overboard and caused me to \\"fast forward\\" through much of the dribble. Too much for its role in the story. My greatest dissappointment was the run-on of words which often slowed my reading and reduced my enjoyment of the book. Have never seen so many words run together....Not sure this was a problem in the printed edition, but my kindle edition was full of this and other editing problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Exciting Thriller from Gary Grossman","review":"After racing through Grossman's first book, Executive Actions, I tried to take my time and savor this book, to no avail.

Inasmuch as it's sometimes difficult to discern her work as mystery or romance, the blend is pleasing and effective. As the reader, I found myself trying to guess not only \\"whodunit\\" but also the conclusion to the numerous forays into new relationships pursued by the characters. I was particularly fond of Fowler's decision to form a romantic link for Grandma Dove, a woman in her 70s, because it challenges the reader to accept that romance is not dead after a certain age. Among the humorous (and often balanced) male-bashing and details of the disciplines of photography and cattle castration were poignant reflections on the complexities of family and marital relationships as well as on the roles of women and the aging. The overall result (all murder and motives aside) was an amusing and sweet story."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I hoped for","review":"I thought it was a decent mystery.That aside, there are two types of novels I read: those I could recommend to my grandmother, and those I cannot.

The trucker's mouth on Benni Harper just wouldn't sit well with anyone else I know who enjoys quilting. Besides that, this book barely touches on quilting. For all that it affects the plot, she could be wrestling alligators. Disappointing, considering all Ms. Fowler's books have quilt pattern titles.If you are looking for a book that incorporates the spirit of quilting with a good story, I would recommend any of Jennifer Chiaverini's novels, or Alice's Tulips or The Persian Pickle Club, both by Sandra Dallas."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had this CD before and enjoyed it so much that when it wore out I got another copy.","review":"If finding out if Waltz is for you here is a good way to find out at a reasonable price for the value.Lawrence Nash Groupe has made a relaxing arrangement yet it is a collection of music from some of the worlds finest composers.You won't know who the various artists are granted but they do a fine job of performing.This has been around for a while so there's no download of this, too bad.

Standout new songs include Where Do You Start, More Love, Close Enough For Love. Great arrangements of Moonlight In Vermont, Unforgettable, Walkin My Baby Back Home. Great instrumental work in the Freshmen tradition. A must have for Freshmen fans. I play it almost every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Gilbert is a very bright and able writer. I had read the reviews for \\"The Normals\\" and liked the premise very much - overeducated New Yorker, up to his eyeballs in debt, decides to get out of town and participate in a risky drug study.The problem is Gilbert feels compelled to describe everything in copious detail. This gets so bad that it slows down the story. Some of his observations are dead-on and I laughed hard. However, most of the time I felt he was trying too hard.The ending was terrible and I skimmed the last 40 pages.I hear good things about \\"Remote Feed\\" and will try that next. Gilbert needs to relax and just let the story flow a bit more. Hopefully the next novel he writes will be his \\"The Russian Debutante's Handbook\\" or \\"Motherless Brooklyn.\\" He certainly has the talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indulgent","review":"I loved Gilbert's \\"Remote Feed\\" and was eager to read this novel, but by pg. 140 I simply couldn't continue. The wise-guy prose, the elaborate language describing nothing, the John Irving \\"Hotel New Hampshire\\" madness forced on the proceedings and the most bland, ridiculous characters imaginable -- it's all absurd, silly, unbelievable.Great novels are about truth. This novel is an empty farce. I see a young and promising author turned vainglorious. While acknowledging that Martin Amis has made this pose a career, I wish Gilbert would try for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a requirement!","review":"The book is good but was a requirement for speech class but I don't believe I would run out and buy the book unless I really needed it for class or other reasons.

The owners of this series have decided to release season one and season three despite the fact that the most critically acclaimed part of the series was season two. They could have made so much money.The first season was good but not spectacular. The Celebrity Mole seasons were not very good at all. So, these particular DVDs are an awful way to introduce one to the series. By refusing to release the most popular season (season two), they've missed a great opportunity. Considering it was such a brief series they could have even packaged all four seasons in one product. But instead they just have encourage millions of potential buyers to look for alternatives like poor quality VHS copies (and maybe even torrents). So, if anyone has a copy of season two they want to sell, I'd like to know; neither ABC nor Eagle Vision want my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"real advice for real women","review":"I found Cabot's style and advice to be very practical and unpatronizing.

Still, it's a tolerable listen.Recorded in 1976 during the \\"Interview\\" tour, the set list includes \\"Proclamation\\", \\"On Reflection\\", \\"Interview\\", \\"The Runaway/Experience\\", \\"So Sincere\\", \\"Excerpts from Octopus\\", as well as the rarely heard \\"Give It Back\\" and \\"Timing\\" (with a very long violin solo), while \\"Free Hand\\" closes the disc.These CDs are for the true, unconditional fan. If you don't have any of these 3 discs, start with this one: if you can't tolerate the recording quality of the tapes used, don't bother with the other 2.

They are, in my opinion, the best out of all of those bands. This recording, while many of the performances are good, sounds like it was recorded from a \\"boom box\\" (remember those?). I bought this CD for the \\"Interview\\" tracks for this was my favorite GG album (along side \\"Free Hand\\" & \\"The Power & the Glory\\"). I really liked the performance of \\"Timing\\" until it got to the violin solo which, in addition to becoming monotonous after 5 minutes was also kind of annoying. (no offense Ray) After this solo, they don't go back into the song - by this time I'm actually kind of pissed! The thing is \\"Timing\\" is such a killer groove, very funky (killer bass line!) & rocks solid all at the same time - so try & understand!

The section entitled \\"Unreadability and Unwriting\\" is insulting on so many levels. Lovecraft is condemned for his stylistic addiction to adjectives (no mention is made of Howard and Smith who were also guilty of the sin of 'adjectivitis'). Pound and Hemingway certainly crushed Faulkner in the battle of adjectives and Timo is swift to pick up the standard of those dead paragons. He would do well, however, to read Tolkien's advice on 'recovery' as it deals with fantasy before Lambasting Lovecraft's child-like use of modifiers. Sigh . . . enough of this ranting . . .

The problem with reading classic literature like Swiss Family Robinson and Heidi is that the language is often archaic for the Twilight set.If you are buying used videos that have been re-shrink-wrapped, but sure the vendor has rewound the VHS. It is embarrassing to have something look brand new only to discover that it wasn't rewound. Just advice to sellers.\\"Curly Top,\\" too, is the \\"Animal Crackers in My Soup\\" movie which I had totally forgotten but which my daughter knew some of the words.

Especially if using a subwoofer is not an option or in the budget. I replaced my factory 6x9 speakers with these blaupunkt velocities and they have a nice low base sound and are crisp as could be. The clearity of all ranges improved with these speakers and the base especially improved when I flipped the negative and possitive polarity on only one of the two 6x9 speakers on my back car shelf (a trick I was shown to do on back shelf applications so as to eliminate sound wave cancelation). Once I had the one speaker's poloarity pluged in opposite to the other, it sounded equal to having a small 8\\" sub in the trunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had never really heard her before until this cd","review":"I listen to Latino 96.3 in LA on occasion, and heard a lot of talk about Ivy Queen, so when I saw this cd, and liked the interesting cover, I bought it.

She has a tough sound, and she has definite rhythm, and the songs have a tropical feel, and the steel drums add a lot. Great music, think exotica meets rap!

I suspect this might be a reason why this game has been discounted for so long.Battle Ball brings back memories of the Games Workshop title \\"Blood Bowl\\" which combined a football-type game with creature combat. This is a similar, simplified game, with a compact set of rules and easy gameplay. My seven-year-old son had no difficulty with the concepts and mechanics of the game, and we have played several times. Tactics are simple, but engaging.

When I did a net search on the side effects of too much progesterone I found many people with my same experience. This book is very one sided, and he does not talk much about the negative aspect of using the cream.Please consult with a physician before starting this stuff on your own, or at least be aware of the possible side effects so that you can stop the cream as soon as you see them.

She uses no tone variation. The narrator's voice is staccato. She writes like this.And so on....All writers know that you need to mix up your writing with a blend of compound and simple sentences to keep things fluid. But every sentence is about 5 words long, and I was totally put off by that. I skipped ahead to the middle and end of the book, just to test it out and see if perhaps only the introduction was written in this style, but it pervades the entire novel.Oh well.

Kull is not infatuated with women like Conan is so often thus making him less of a romantic hero and more of a raw hero and leader of men. I can't say that this is good or bad, but it makes him different enough from Conan that it works for me.A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Term Investment","review":"I bought the original \\"King Kull\\" for 75 cents in 1967. That version has become so fragile that I leapt at the chance to get a Trade Paperback edition so that I can read it without worrying about having the book crumble. The same holds true for all of my Robert E. Howard books so having them all available in more durable (if more expensive) format is great now that I am retired and have the time to re-read them again and again.Howard always spoke of how the characters seemed to be dictating their stories to him until they were replaced by the next character and Kull is no different. A literary and chronological precursor to Conan, the formula is very similar. A barbarian with strengths and weaknesses rising to rule the foremost kingdom of his time despite human and inhuman enemies. Astute Howard fans will note the similarities between several stories (By This Axe I Rule v. The Phoenix in the Sword.Ka nama kaa lajerama"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soon to be a major motion picture!!!","review":"Hollywood coulnd not resist a story this good for very long. All of the elements that made Conan great come into play in this group of tales about a usurper King who rules with wisdom and a resolve of iron.

Howard's Conan series then you will truly enjoy this book. It is written in they same style as the Conan novels. A story of a barbarian king trying to maintain his hold on a decadent kingdom filled with enemies whose only wish is to overthrow him.An added feature to this book is the excellent artwork that fills it's interior.

The bio on the back really doesn't offer any credentials for the author other than making it sound like he made some money speculating at the top of the market. I'd be interested in how he is doing now? Finally, the book is way overpriced. The content of the book would comprise two chapters in a regular-sized book -- this book is the size of a Reader's Digest with huge print. I don't know who the other reviewers are, but get the feeling they must be the author's friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Pack Receiving Blankets in Pink Assortment","review":"Very nice assortment of receiving blankets. Perfect gift for new Parents or Grandparent of a baby girl. They are very soft upon purchase and became even softer when laundered.

Babies can never have too many blankets or diapers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality","review":"These Gerber receiving blankets are soft, generously sized, and well-made.

These blankets still look good and have held up well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came out of the dryer extremely wrinkled.","review":"Overall, I am more than pleased with the quality of this line. However, the sheet that came with the set came out of the dryer looking like it had been balled up in the back of a closet for years. It's well constructed and didn't fall apart or anything. But, it was extremely wrinkled. Not just a few creases, it was awful looking. I don't want to iron the sheets everytime I wash them. I bought some of the Carter's Chambray crib sheets as extras instead of these. Those match the set beautifullly and have washed up very well. Plus, they're cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"A friend suggested that I check out this Anime and it is now one of my favorites. This series really was too short. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great MP3 Download, not worh the price for a hard copy.","review":"EPs are great to download as Amazon MP3 downloads since they don't warrant buying the hard copy for only four songs. You're also not paying for the redundant song Superheroes that also appears on Rocket Ride. If you're a fan of Edguy's more recent material, I highly recommend this download. Blessing in Disguise and The Spirit (a cover of Magnum) are the show stealers and should have been on full length albums. Edguy made The Spirit their own like Joe Cocker made \\"I Get By With A Little Help\\" his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Better than Expected","review":"I was a little worried about this before it came out because I wasn't impressed with their last effort \\"Hellfire Club\\". I mean it had it's moments but as an album as a whole I didn't care for. Nowhere near \\"Theater of Salvation\\" and/ or Vain Glory Opera and Mandrake. But in my opinion I figure all bands are entitled to at least one bad album so I decided to pick this up when it came out and I'm glad I did. I liked it alot from the 1st time I heard it, the title track \\"Superheroes\\" was stuck in my head all night as well as \\"Spooks in the Attic\\" and \\"Judas at the Opera\\". Too all you Edguy fans like me that was worried about where this band was going after the Hellfire release worry not this is definately worth picking up. Now I hope their 2006 album \\"Rocket Ride\\" will be this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my kids!","review":"I have one of these drawer units in each of my kids' bedroom closets as part of their new Closetmaid closets. They are fantastic because the kids can put whatever they want in the baskets, shut the closet doors, and it's hidden. If they have a drawer that has smaller items that might fall through the openings in the mesh, we just put a piece of cardboard in the bottom of the basket. The only thing that disappointed me was that there were no drawer stops that came with it. You have to buy them separately. In my opinion, that is something that should have come with it. Otherwise, great, sturdy, useful item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"producer opera trash","review":"I agree fully with the first reviewer (from Minneapolis). Why these pervert producers who arbitrarily and capriciously ignore the composer's libretto is something I never hope to fully understand.What's worse is that I actually met an operagoer after a Wagner performance who actually LIKED this idiocy.I believe in my heart of hearts that these trashers actually hate opera and Wagner in particular, and this is how they 'get even'. I remember reading just that after Seattle joined the party one fateful year and trashed a 'Ring' cycle - they admitted the producer said he 'hated Wagner'.I hope I have made myself perfectly clear. This production and most if not all other modern ones are abortions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"At first I loved these sacks for my 4 month twins, however after last nights experience my comment for all parents is beware and be careful.

Excellent story line and realistic explanations for everything. Reading \\"Harvest\\" is like taking a journey into Bayside Hospital! Truly amazing book. I was looking for a book to read, and took this one of the shelf in the bookstore without knowing how good it is! I'm glad I found this book! I have already read it 3 times! It is Excellent!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant Drama","review":"I haven't read a lot of Tess Gerritson's books because many are from a series, but this one was awesome. I was on the edge of my chair, trying to figure out who did it. I definitely recommend if you like a great medical mystery or drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget About Those Other Medical Mystery Writers","review":"Pick up this entertaining, suspenseful novel by Tess Gerritsen M.D. Dr. Abby DiMatteo is a surgical resident who gets curious about some strange happenings at her hospital. Her curiosity plunges her career into a downward spiral that seems to have no bottom. Once again we have a female protagonist who is not a wimpy, ankle-spraining female in need of a strong man (Thank God).Although the reader quickly becomes aware of where the story is going, the gripping narrative never lets one relax. TG is one physician novelist who believes in really adding some medicine to her books. Some readers may be turned off by her frequent injections of technical terms, but to me it just made the story more real. In this regard she reminds me of Kathy Reichs, the forensic pathologist who wrote the novel Deja Dead.. only Harvest is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Brother!","review":"This book convinced me that anyone can be a successful novelist. The plot twists are so obvious you could read this book by skipping every other page and still figure the whole thing out. About as challenging a mystery as the OJ Simpson trial. The sad thing about this book is how hysterical the protagonist gets. I mean talk about reinforcing female stereotypes. She's just a poor helpless doctor that shows all this compassion, yet comes undone under all this pressure, boo-hoo! So the book is predictable, but it was kind of an interesting story, especially since it's not a bad rip-off from the book \\"Coma.\\" Ok, people can make money from selling organs. Now do something interesting with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Language","review":"I wish books had language ratings like movies. This book has language that is horrid. Beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW !!!!!","review":"This book has it all! It's tense, exciting! Who is killing those patients Iam only half through this book and can't wait to see whodunit!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvest - grim reaper thriller","review":"This is the first novel by Tess Gerritsen that I've read. It was so enjoyable that I've ordered two more from amazon.com. It is obvious that Gerritsen has a medical background judging by the fascinating details in the story. The story is original, gripping, and fast-moving with a woman as the heroine. The author skillfully combines exploited children from the former Soviet bloc, international trade in body parts, politics in a hospital, ambitious doctors, and the exhausting lifestyle of residents in a smooth reading medical thriller. I would recommend this novel to anyone, especially aspiring doctors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great medical thriller!","review":"I couldn't put this book down once I started reading it! I don't always read medical thrillers, but this one had me turning the page up until the wee hours of the morning. I read this book in about 2 sittings! Gerritsen did a wonderful job with making you relate to the characters. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book...give it 10 Stars","review":"Tess Gerritsen was a totally unknown to me but I will be looking for her next book for sure. This is one of those pleasant surprises whereby you suddenly discover a new writer to watch for. Tess does superb on suspense, murder, romance, and having you relate to the environment that she portrays in this \\"medical suspense\\" about heart transplants. It gives you a whole new understanding of what someone goes through to build a successful career in the medical profession. You will not be able to put this one down until you have read the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking and worthwhile reading!","review":"This interesting book deals with the timely topic of organ harvest and donation. It compels the reader to consider the consequential ethical/moral implications of this rather new medical specialty. The author's writing style is rather simple, but the end of the book is a thrilling, action-packed adventure! The story will not only leave the reader wondering about the almost indistinguishable line between life and death, but also whether the control of life and death is slowly passing from deity to human."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding medical shocker","review":"Harvest is a outstanding medical shocker about a young doctor who stumbles upon a deadly organ selling ring operating in her hospital. This novel boasts a sinister premise and backs it up with plot twists, suspense that leads to a unforgettable ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for fans of the medical-suspense genre","review":"Tess Gerritsen challenges Robin Cook with this addition to the medical-suspense genre. A fast-paced thriller which doesn't fail to provide details on medical procedures, it also manages to include a taste of international racketeering in the \\"business\\" of medicine. Gerritsen also has a nice touch for realism--the heroine doesn't always win as easily as Robin Cook's protagonists seem to win. This is a book you'll find hard to put down--I finished reading it in one session"},{"rating":"2","title":"Medical Thriller \\"Transplants\\" the Reader","review":"In order to add excitement to my middle aged life, I depend on sexy crime dramas and and novels to raise my pulse. Tess Gerritsen manged to do just that as she took me through the pages of almost perfect crime in this medical thriller.Coincidentally I worked for almost ten years as part of transplant teams in a major transplant center. I can honestly say that the author worked very hard not to abuse artistic license. I found myself back in the world of high tech medicine. While moving between those pages, I became the female heroine trying to escape her potential fate.Novels can educate but they can also provide a release -a temporary trip through a more exciting life. I enjoyed love, lust, fear and success, all in one literary journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three and Half-Stars if possible....","review":"This is the first Tess Gerritsen novel that I have completed and it was very entertaining. The characters didn't have the depth of a John Grisham, Michael Crichton or Scott Turow thriller, but the action did keep me on the edge of my seat and their were some unexpected twists and turns. Those were a pleasant surprise considering that you could easily connect some of the other plot lines pretty early on without any real suspense. I won't rush to read another Gerritsen right away, my guess is that she uses this formula in each book. If you are looking for pure entertainment and action in a medical setting this is a good book to read. It may also start some fun conversations with your friends about our system of distributing available organs to those in need. Happy reading...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kill that Octopus!","review":"Tuesday, March 08, 2005 / 4 of 5 / Kill that Octopus!Continuing my march through classic 50's sci-fi, I hadn't actually seen this one all the way through before. Squinty eyed Kenneth Tobey plays the captain of a new \`atomic' sub which is latched onto by a hungry mutant octopus. Calling in the scientists to help we get to view an awkward love triangle between the gal, her scientist cohort and Tobey. Probably the most functional and sensible female Dr. of these stories, she stands up to the macho and gives as good as she gets, even commanding the room of a bunch of good old military boys. The story moves along as one has come to expect w/ the monster showing bits and pieces as it crushes various items in its path to its eventual destination for the showdown, in this case the Golden Gate Bridge. When it does come ashore (you know, octopi like that sort of thing, ugh) it's a very impressive Harryhausen creation. Plucky performances and effects put this one a bit above average."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unusual Georgette Heyer!","review":"For avid Georgette Heyer fans, The Foundling will be an interesting and satisfying departure from the romance novels. The Foundling focuses on the Duke of Sale and his adventures as he goes \\"undercover\\" as a regular man. Gilly is a sympathetic and interesting leading character trying to overcome years of being overprotected. Gilly encounters all sorts of personalities while trying to end his cousin's entanglement, fortunately, Gilly reacts to the unexpected with kindness, a gentle manner and considerable common sense. The Foundling is witty, unexpected, and great fun.Publisher: Sourcebooks Casablanca (September 2009), 448 pages.Review copy provided by the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Heyer's novel.","review":"Even though Heyer's writing style and wit are present un this book, I could not help being disapointed. This one is really not as funny as her other less romancy books like The Unknown Ajax, or The Talisman rings. To borrow from her, I'd say that I was in whoops over these two books, and only mildy amused by The Foundling."},{"rating":"2","title":"best Heyer novel I've read","review":"I've read Georgette Heyer novels since 1972, just finished this one, and I consider it my favorite. Wonderful characters and interesting plot, with some deeper life lessons about coddling and independence.

I originally commented to alert readers to a problem with the shipping surcharges on this item that appeared in early 9/2009, but the wonderful people at Sourcebooks (thanks, Heidi!) got Amazon to fix this. All GH fans owe a big debt of gratitude to Sourcebooks, as publisher, for bringing this and other GH titles back into print."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight to read.","review":"When I get a cold, and have to stay home from work, nothing blunts the misery quite so well as a regency romance from Heyer.

I take away one star because in the faster movements (\\"toe-tapping Bach\\") the violin gets buried in the piano accompaniment, played on a Steinway grand (eight-foot?) with the lid fully open. It would have been better for proper balance to have the lid partally open, as it usually is for accompanying, or closed.I suggest starting with the accompanying one-hour documentary, \\"Bach and me.\\" In it Zimmermann discusses, among other things, some of the more important movements and then plays them, in full."},{"rating":"2","title":"great details, interesting story!","review":"I liked this book..

As a serious metalhead, and as a guy who worships metal like a god, I never encountered songs this fast. Sure there are other songs by other bands that sometimes have tempos this fast, but these guys do it this fast in every song (none of them are short either). Sure the lyrics are cheesy, but that really isn't the point here.

Dragonforce!Dragonforce's \\"Valley of the Damned\\" will have those of you who love \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (JRR Tolkien) as well as fast, powerful, epic metal, in a trance.You will listen to this album and sometime next year you will finally turn it off. It's just that good.So anyone searching for a real piece of EPICNESS should be shot if they didn't check out Dragonforce's \\"Valley of the Damned\\", as well as Rhapsody (notably their album \\"Tales from the Emerald Sword Saga\\").Dragonforce's other album \\"Sonic Firestorm\\" keeps with the epic sound, but incorporates much more speed and technical ability, so if you enjoy speed metal, go for that instead.Or... GET BOTH! And fly, you fools!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a new genre of metal","review":"Valley of the damned led the emergence of power metal in the metal scene in Europe and North America.

It is certainly not as diverse as their three other albums ahead, but it has a nice level of originality that can only be found on this album.

DragonForce plays faster than anybody else out there, and it gives them their own distinct style.\\"Valley of the Damned\\" is up there in quality with any of their subsequent releases - there are a handful of great songs on here. Lyrics tend to be in the upbeat, fantasy-themed (although not as egregiously fantasy-themed as most power metal bands), battle and overcoming evil veins.Nobody plays power metal as fast as DragonForce.

You just cannot try to write about music in these terms - certainly most musicians would never do so. The main character was such a whinge, mean, selfish - the relationship with her father never properly explained, Northern Ireland dragged in without any real depth or discussion of it. In particular, he never really explored her use of Lambegs (ostensibly a protestant instrument, but actually used by both sides once) by her (a catholic). The end of the book could have been from a Hollywood Meryl Streep movie. The long, free-form structure of the book didn't work particularly well either - moving from the death of her father back to a birth, and building up to the gestation and performance of a piece which seemed totally unrelated to the opening section of the book. Some good writing, but frustrating and annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull and very obligatory book about an interesting woman.","review":"With great expectations I began reading 'Grace Notes'. The first half of the book was very pleasing, interesting and gave much insight in family-relations dominated bij catholic creed and paternalistic upbringing.

This is truely second to none due to Mary Stewarts classic and human approach, her flair for suspense and attention to almost poetic detail. I have fondly read epic fantasies before but would guard against placing this tale in quite that catagory, rather I would call it a 'Classic' in its truest sense. It brings history, humanity and heart together in an inspiring, timeless tale. All of Merlins magic is where any of ours can be found, in his soul.

I thought that many of the example pictures were classic examples of what not to do with busy yarn and textured patterns. Even though the book is called Dyeing to Knit, I felt that there was very little discussion about designing yarn colors and patterns for a goal finished project.I was also very disappointed in the patterns, I thought that many of them were pretty awful, and the only one that I would knit at all was so basic that one hardly needed a pattern to knit it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hip Hop Pets are the Pits","review":"The MP3 players stink.

As the investigations proceed, the two cases collide with more murders and a secret kept since the 1960s.Freeman creates complicated characters that are fascinating and very involving. The plot is a complicated one, dealing with secrets, power, trust, betrayal, loyalty; all the characteristics that can either lead to the best or worst in people. In this case, it's mostly the worst. There is suspense, gunplay, and secrets revealed, long with love and sex.

I've used my multipro to do this exact same job multiple times as well as much heavier gauge metals such as steel. This pile of garbage is going back and I'll find another way of doing my planing work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly design tool","review":"The tool heats up very quickly during short use.

Numerous times the metal bit flew right out while the tool was running. Once it flew out with such velocity I never saw the bit again (couldn't find it). Finally the metal teeth of the collet broke off and the thing is now unuseable.

However, for the price, you really don't get much. The product is forever dependent on Dremel accessories, heats up a LOT at high RPMs, can't handle any type of real work (this is good for small projects as I said, nothing of contractor grade), and does not have a trigger switch, which I think would help a lot.If you really want a Dremel, go to your local auto store and buy the Chinese version of the tool for $19.99... you'll save money and it will do the job just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle in a can!","review":"I have an old Yamaha CA-810 integrated amp that I really like a lot, so one day when the right channel quit, I was pretty bummed.

I'd heard of the Deoxit contact cleaner doing some amazing things, so I went ahead and bought a can. When my Deoxit arrived, I pulled the case off of my Yamaha and went to town cleaning every last switch and pot. I gave the deoxit time to dry, slapped the Yamaha's case back on, reconnected everything and crossed my fingers. I didn't get my hopes up, because I was skeptical that cleaning the contacts was all the amp needed. As you may have guessed, the Yamaha's dead channel came back to life.

It meets the (perhaps frequent) naive expectation of an invariable and immediate recognition of a polished proofs rhyme and reason. It consequently points to the often necessary autonomous efforts of the student to independantly unravel the proof of a theorem or definition.The book moves rapidly from the necessary setential logic and truth tabels (a Wittgensteinian invention) to the chapters on proof writing and follows with chapters on functions, relations, closures, and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fundamentals Book","review":"After reading this book, proofs have become second nature to me. Before reading this book, I had no idea how to prove anything, I would stare blindly at a problem without knowing where to start.

The book cover proofs on sets, functions, relations, number theory and induction. The subjects are classical and well know.

He has been dead for almost 20 years now and we have been watching each year in season order on DVD. And we still think they are very funny.The writing, the actors their use of facial expressions and the one liners are all timed very well and cause us to laugh out loud.

You will not hear James Brown's 'Get Up Offa That Thing' which was even better when played by Oliver James at the party in the film. You will also not hear 'Have I Told You Lately', 'What A Wonderful World\\", 'Heaven Is A Place On Earth', 'Shout', 'Because You Love Me' and 'You Get Me'. I bought the CD based on other reviews, and when I listened the first time, it was good, but wow - it is like buying a hamburger and leaving out the beef. Taste good but leaves you feeling as though you missed something. Oh well, at least they were kind enough to include Oliver James songs on the CD. Who ever put the soundtrack together, must have forgotten to cut Oliver out too, because they sure cut out all the rest of the best. This could have been the greatest soundtrack, but the record label missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolest CD Ever","review":"This is the coolest cd ever. I actually heard this cd on the internet's listening party before it went into stores and it is really good. They have some popular stars on it such asLucy Woodward, Craig David, Duncan Sheik, Willa Ford, The Clash, John Gregory, The Donnas, Meredith Brooks, Leslie Mills, and even Oliver James who plays Daphne's boyfriend in the movie sings two songs.My favorite songs are: Half-Life by Duncan SheikRide of Your Life by John Gregory, and Long Time Coming By Oliver James, and Greatest Story Ever Told by Oliver James.

The music on it was horrible, but then again I'm not a pop fan. The songs I did like were the ones Oliver sang and London Calling by The Clash. How you can give that 3 stars whilst the rest get 5 is beyond me. The Clash are one of the best if not the best punk rock band of the 80s. You've got to give them more credit than something that \\"sounds great\\" in your opinion. It's the best song on the whole freaking cd. Craig David was good until he sold out to an appealing American crowd. Actually, Duncan Shiek (Sheik? whatever) is pretty good. Other than that I don't recommend anyone buying this album unless you're really into pop.

However, there are some notable errors in the book and strong statements that deserve quite obvious and important caveats. There is no discussion of the importance of effective porosity. Using the wrong porosity value is a common error used to bias analyses of contaminant transport velocity. There are errors such as stating that organic carbon is associated with clay content, which is completely wrong in many parts of the country where clay residuum dominates. Clay minerals have no carbon content themselves, but may be associated with organic materials in alluvial settings. There are many such problems with this book and I am hesitant to offer it to those learning the practice because of all the corrections I'd need to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some mistakes make the book hard to believe","review":"It may be that the book is a good work, but some mistakes make it hard to believe. As a simple but illustrative example, on page 315 the author says that some synonyms of carbon tetrachloride (formula CCl4) are \\"carbon disulphide, carbon disulfide\\" and some others that are not, in any way, related to carbon tetrachloride but to other chemical (formula CS2).

Any book that purports to cover a topic as complex as environmental site investigation in under 400 pages has to and ought to be looked at skeptically.A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Granted it might be useful to lawyers, you know, the bunch that are first with the obvious. By the title, I gather that is the audience the author is pandering to.My 6 year degree in geology and remote sensing did not totally prepare me for my role as an expert in aerial photo interpretation. Several thousand pages of additional reading and countless hours behind a stereoscope did.So see the book for what it appears to be, an expensive overview of a very complex and interrelated discipline that should only be dabbled into by trained scientists and environmetal engineers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrench earrings","review":"We love the earrings but they started changing colors just in a few days of wearing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"good look at understanding anger styles","review":"A good example of understanding,rather than controlling your anger.

In fact, the subtitle \\"Conquering Your Insecurity\\" was a big enticement (if only...). Unfortunately, this book explores and recommends very little. Once the premise is set forth, that tenderheartedness or toughheartedness is a congenital predisposition, and how it comes about, and how it manifests itself in daily life, (career, relationship, etc.) the book goes no further - just keeps repeating and attempting to substantiate that premise. The \\"case studies\\" used to demonstrate these ideas are WAY too long and utterly lack substance. It's like when someone says \\"to make a long story short...\\" you know you're in for a long, drawn out nothing. If you're looking for concrete self-help, thought provoking substance and engaging reading, this ain't it.

If you love big band sound, you will love this. Mostly seventies tunes with a big band sound. Great arrangements and of course Bill Chase on trumpet. Love them horns."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting album, but doesn't stand the test of time.","review":"Woody Herman always kept his band relevant, and didn't keep playing standards from the 30's and 40's, like many of his contemporaries. His exploration of rock tunes in the late 60's, early 70's, is laudable, and arguably more listenable than the original artists, at least to jazz fans. These songs contain inspired solos by many of Herman's sidemen. However, the arrangements as a whole, don't hold up well 40 years later, and exaggerate the inherent weakness of these songs. Demonstrating what jazz purists have discovered in the succeeding decades. Rock songs don't adapt well to the jazz idiom.At albums end, the listener may conclude that they have just heard a halftime performance of a college marching band from 1970. Fortunately, Herman returned to less experimental music during the short remainder of his career. I don't think this, or any succeeding \\"Herd\\", revisited any of these tunes in later years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon book purchase","review":"I love the book. Thank you.

The sounds are 100% better than the whine and whizz of the GT4 cars, and believe me the graphics are just as good if not better; at least in Enthusia, you don't get the fuzzy, out of focus effect from a game that pushes the abilities of the PS2 too far.Trade in or sell your Gran Turismo 4, and get Enthusia.

Although \\"Maria Stuarda\\" is middling Donizetti, the singing and staging make it seem like a major work. The leads strike fire in dramatizing the conflict between Queen Elizabeth I (Anna Caterina Antonacci) and her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots (Mariella Devia). The singers should be better known in America, for both their voices and their acting. This is one of my favorite opera recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious!","review":"Except Sutherland's which is only on CD and (alas) has Pavarotti, this is the most beautiful Maria Stuarda I ever heard. The end is grim beyond belief, but that's not music. Devia is wonderful and while I can't honestly say I think she's the equal of Sills or Sutherland at the high notes, she is terrific nonetheless. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Stuarda, Donizetti, Devia or music. I love it. Two notes. Elizabeth was crying at the final bows, and she and Devia embraced, clearly not enemies, though that needn't have been pointed out, though I liked it. And (damnit) another Stuarda without \\"vil bastarda\\" - is music having a renaissance of prudery?!Just had pointed out to me she does say \\"vil bastarda\\" - after \\"impure daughter of Bolena\\" near the end of her speech, but it's mulched into the words and music and easily (by me anyway) lost, not isolated and spat out like I'm sure I remember hearing from long ago.

It has a rechargeable battery, but I already used rechargeable AA batteries in my old CD player. The remote control is useless because the press/tilt button always does the wrong thing for me, and I don't use any of the other controls on the remote control. I could never figure out where to attach the remote control to my clothing, and recently the clip broke off so I cannot attach it at all. The track and time display is on the remote control, not on the CD player, so I am stuck with this surprisingly heavy and awkward remote control dangling from the headset. Finally, the asymmetrical length cords on the included ear buds are a terrible idea: unless I attached the remote control to my shirt collar, the left ear bud would pull out of my ear when I looked up because the cord was so short, so I've thrown them away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD Player i've ever owned!","review":"This CD player is one of the most convienient i've ever owned.

He brings out the good and bad in Moses' life (something we all struggle with), and gives an honest portrayal of God's plan being worked out in God's timing for God's greater purpose. If you struggle with accepting God's role of leadership, question God's chosen leaders in your life, or just enjoy a good character study, you will benefit from reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simple Look at Moses","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift last year.

I do not have any major criticisms of the book like the ones I found in Job: A Man of Heroic Endurance, but I do not plan to read any of the other books in the series in the near future. I will take a break from these easy-to-read biographical works and spend some time on more challenging books that have been on my reading list far too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different, darker, tone than most of Swindoll's work.","review":"As a fan of Chuck Swindoll, I've read and really enjoyed many of his books. This one, however, has a tone I haven't seen before. He paints a dark and foreboding picture of those who love the Lord. 'You may be in the depths of despair,' 'you may be at a very bad time in your life,' 'you may be very unhappy,' 'you may have just lost a loved one,' etc. The book is full of this type of thoughts. I really fell sorry for Swindoll, who, after thirty years in the ministry can say, \\"But I can't name many true, caring, servanthearted shepherds.\\" He must have had a rough ministry, because a pastor can't live without such people. The book is about 10% Moses and 90% Swindoll's dark lessons to be learned from Moses' life. I liked it about 10%. As opposed to Phillip Yancey's uplifting books, The Jesus I Never Knew, and What's So Amazing About Grace, Moses left me really down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless as a guide!

I would highly recommend it as a supplement to whatever text you do choose to use, whether Balme, or Wheelock, or Ruck, or whatever else.The first third of the book is a summary of forms: noun declensions, verb conjugations, etc. The real strength is the last two-thirds of the book, where the author gives excellent coverage of the syntax. It's well organized, with lots of examples and clear explanations.My copy was printed in 1958, and from the sample sentences you can see that this work was probably designed for Catholic high schools; many examples have a \\"Caesar in Gaul\\" flavor.

I had to let the unit cool off, and left wondering if I made the right purchasing decision...If it's any indication, the unit comes with a small set of rotary bits. Though the inside of the toolbox holding the bits was made of cheap molded plastic that can be crushed by a finger. Leaves me wondering what other corners were cut to keep the cost down.

Then something happened...Bizzar came out and ICP's talent went into hiding. (I guess it's because Bullet and Full Clip came and jacked it)But now about this CD.This was the worst Psychopathic Records CD ever released, even worse than Mysery's CD. ICP started makeing complete crap with Bizzar but this one takes the cake. The only halfway good song on here is \\"Supa Villans\\" w/Esham, and it's only half a song.ICP should quit and devote all there time to the PSYCHOPATHIC RYDAS.

Keep in mind that I live in one of the mildest climates in the US: SF Bay area. The table was always kept out of the direct weather during winter-time, not indoors, but sheltered. Starting just after 1 year, the problems started with water ingress swelling the pressboard material underneath the aluminum top surface. This aluminum is beer can thin and blistered and delaminated near the edges. Stiga would not support this problem since the warranty was expired by a few months. Now the 5 year old table surface has blistered to the point where normal play is impossible. Icing on the cake: the legs are rusty and folding is stiff.When I bought this table I thought it would be in excellent shape for 10+ years. Try 14 months.

But fortunately, that's no longer the case.A resurgence of interest in Jamal has produced a string of near-complete performances on cd. The Pershing has grown yet again, this time by a few tracks, but we also have large portions of the Alhambra and Blackhawk shows spread out across thier own hour-long cds. All of which demands further attention from the faithful.These current releases relegate this double cd to little more than a very good sampling of Jamal, the kind of thing you might give the curious uninitiated, but one simply has to hear the concerts, however still incomplete, in their largest offerings yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choosing a Jamal Album","review":"I have on vinyl \\"Ahmad Jamal at the Blackhawk\\" & \\"Chamber Music of the New Jazz\\".

One section of the book comprised about 40 pages of one of the character's nightmares, which, eventually, I just skipped over.I had liked the film version (starring Rock Hudson and Burl Ives) so much, and I had enjoyed Hartog's \\"The Fourposter\\" and I must say I was very disappointed with this book.

The second half of this outstanding novel (which is written in the form of a diary), showcase's Luna's move to the country with her family. Now being a mother herself, Luna muses on her past as she and her own children find themselves confronted with bigotry. Luna's California Poppies is a cleverly crafted, reader engaging, and highly recommended novel from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from acceptable","review":"This seal looked as if it had been cut out by someones dog chewing on it.

The plot is tedious, dragging on forever. There are far too many characters, none of them interesting or well-developed. I had a pretty good idea whom the killer was as soon as the character was introduced, but the story -- such as it is -- just meandered on forever. I had to skip ahead -- skip all the tiresome descriptions Kellerman muddles his book with -- to get to the end. Boring! And poorly written. I liked the dog, so the book gets one star from me.

The last 100 pages I read pretty fast, but before that I kept debating whether or not to finish it because it was so slow and I couldn't keep the 300 different names seperated!

I have not seen that since a bad 1930's gangster film, and even then I don't believe the police were really using them.

I judged the book by the cover and I liked the overall appeal of the cover and the headlines, but as I read it went into so much detail that I would forget what I was reading. It took me about a good month to finish it but it wasnt worth reading 500-600 pages... lost count. But it was not worth waiting getting to the 30th chapter to wrap it up and get to the point.

They couldn't beleive I got as far as I did.I like fiction, and even meaningless pop-fiction like Patterson, Stephen King, Grisham, etc., so I'm not a literary elitist. Bad Love is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. I am shocked that people have given this garbage 5 stars.

Everyone in Ken Park, just like everyone in Bully and Kids, is a sex-obsessed lowlife with no conscience. The characters commit murder, adultery, you name it, with no guilt or second thoughts.Nothing motivates the characters but base pleasures. We see them getting high and screwing around, but never talking about what they want to do after high school. They don't talk about music, sports, or skateboarding--nothing above the wasteline seems to interest them.Near the end of the film, one of the characters, Claude, talks about about a book that describes his version of utopia: an island where the inhabitants do nothing but have sex all day. This is the film's great failing. The characters are not just immoral; they are boring. They are too shallow to be shocking. Ken Park is pornography trying to pass itself off as edgy film-making."},{"rating":"1","title":"ken park","review":"I thought it was going to be a new copy,But when it got to me it was a burned copy.It worked but still looked not the best quality.In the future please tell people that it is a duplicate and not a new copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porno with a Plot","review":"Larry Clark has taken extreme to a whole new level with Ken Park. He has surpassed Kids, Bully and every other film he's made with this. This has to be his 'sickest' film yet. I had to watch this with japanese language over english so it was kind of hard to understand all the words but this piece of work takes 'clark' to a whole new level. It has a man who touches his son, a kid who commits suicide, a scene with a kid, a knife and his grandparents that truly disturbed the hell out of me and much much more. There is full frontal nudity for both sexes and its just a lot more extreme than Kids or anything else hes done. I wasnt really feeling this one just from what I saw. This will shock you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rivetting Film!","review":"This is a brilliant film. i saw it in the theater while living in Paris a couple of years ago and fully enjoyed every moment of it.

It tells the story of four typical teenagers, 15-16 years old. It chronicles their issues with loneliness, derision at home, sex, acceptance and alienation in their social settings and devotion to each other.It is a true explanation of teenage life in the 21st Century. These are real stories, not written, simple, truthful. They are not noir stories, or happy endings. They are the depiction of the lives of authentic teenagers (they are not actors, by the way).This film does not shy away from the physical sex of young adults,in explicit terms (masturbation and intercourse), which, of course, we all remember. It is part of the story, that's all.Parents need to watch this provocative film-their children already know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking, Daring, and Mindblowing","review":"I'm a big Larry Clark fan, I've always loved his approach in film making in not shying away from controversy starting from Kids, Bully and Ken Park. Without a doubt, this is quite a disturbing look of suburban teens making through life with different challenges and obstacles yet also showing not all things in the suburban culture isn't all grand as it seems. Some will probably watch and be immediately turned off by the hyper sexual/graphic nature of the film among teenagers, yet those like myself will keep watching for it's approach and not shy away from shock value. I definitely will say for mature and open-minded viewers who have watched any Larry Clark film in their lifetime, please watch this one and find its silver-lining beyond the sex and violent moments of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong premise/subject, poor execution","review":"Was intrigued by the premise and subject of this movie. Although the characters in this movie aren't in my demographic, i am older, I had expectations of the movie.

All of the explicit nudity in this film was of the male sort. Sure the women were naked but its the kind of nudity you see on late night cable nothing explicit. The guys were a different story so the people who want to see explicit male nudity will want to get this. I think this movie has done great harm to Larry Clark's reputation as a guy who delivers on the hot young female nudity scale.

Maybe I missed something, but I didn't feel like there was much of a point to the movie. Like another reviewer said, the female actors in the movie are all very attractive; however, every male in the film is scrawny, pale, with a less than attractive face. It made the sex scenes awkward and gross for some reason. If you watch the movie, be prepared to see quite a few penises too.

But Ken Park is just a insane and very perverted movie. More like a strange porno. Alot of things happpen with no explanation as to why.

El sonido no es bueno, en particular con los canales analogos, pero con la television satelite y los DVD, el sonido es aceptable. No imagino como se ve la television digital. Recomiendo un sistema de audio alterno, con lo cual el sonido se torna \\"de pelicula\\".En fin, recomiendo este tv de Sharp.No he podido configurar o programar el control remoto para operar mis otros equipos de sonido (Home Theater, DVD player, SAT Receiver). Las instrucciones del manual son imprecisas e incompletas. Alguien me ayuda?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Sharp, Consider Samsung Instead","review":"I got the LC37D43U on 5/30/08, by Nov it had a red line thru it from top to bottom. I called Sharp for warranty service, they came out and said the screen needed to be replaced. It would be 10 days. I called them 25 days later and found out they had not even ordered the part yet. In the end it took 7 weeks, they replaced the TV today.Pros:The PQ is fine. Colors good, chrisp imagesGood remote compared to others, easy to use menus.Good sound for TV speakersCons :Quality, it should not fail in a couple of monthsLOUSY customer service, NO follow up, no calls...zeroThe tuner is slow to change channelsThe side HDMI connections are not easy to connect to unless you have a small handSharp is famous for having banding issues on larger setsReccommend ; The Samsung 37\\" instead.

Not many choices in 37\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice tv","review":"I was shopping for a new LCD tv with size as a major requirement. I started looking at this model based on size and purchased it after reading the reviews and looking at the tv at a local Sears. It arrived fine and we have been real happy with it. I am using an antenna to receive local digital channels and they are very clear. Having a few issues with VCR playback, but that is the only complaint I have. The sound is amazing. Easy to setup and configure. PLenty of connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"TV received broken","review":"Second TV finally delivered after first one received broken & returned. Eagle Shipping very unreliable and \\"white glove\\" service poor. Would not repurchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will I ever get my TV back?","review":"Definitely would not recommend any Aquos TV to anyone! I had this TV about three weeks before a purple line appeared across the screen out of nowhere. I took it back to the retailer who told me it would take at three weeks for them to diagnosis the problem. They couldn't simply exchange it because of a deal they have with Sharp. So after three weeks they told me they were going to exchange it. So far it has taken another three weeks for Sharp to send another unit. Sharp and hhgregg have had my TV about twice as long as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet TV","review":"I love this TV, Everything works perfectly with my Comcast Digital Cable and Philips up-converting DVD player. The images are crisp, clear scenes. i don't have any issues with image stretching properly as I use the cable boxes feature that locks the output to only those that are fed into it and the TV just reproduces them as-is. I don't get some channels in wide screen and others being stretched to fill the whole screen but rather the black bars on the sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Disappointment","review":"I purchased the Sharp Aquos after hours upon hours of reading reviews and THOUGHT I was going to be getting a solid TV. Instead what I got was a $900 piece of junk. The HD channels look grainy at best. The colors in standard definition are terrible. Sure, there are a lot of features that can be adjusted but none of them make the true skin pigment even close to real. If you do get a color setting you are happy with you still have to deal with the fact that people look unrealistic. Every person's face and skin look as though an artist drew them with oil colors. No amount of tweaking can get rid of this problem. Because Tiger Direct does not accept returns, only exchanges, I am now stuck selecting from one of the televisions they carry - none of which I am enthused about. Thanks for nothing Sharp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture is grainy from DVD's + Sharp Warranty consists of threats","review":"The good points of this TV are: 1. being able to buy it through Amazon, 2. good owners manual.Unfortunately the bad points are:1. The picture from DVD is very grainy. It is an extremely poor picture. Please read the latest issue of Consumer Reports: you will find the Auqos ranked near the bottom in every screen size (I wish I had that issue several months ago).2. The power button has to be hit several times to turn the unit on.3. The volume from one of the HDMI connections is very low.4. When contacting Sharp Warranty for points 2&3, they \\"threatened\\" numerous times that I would be charged if the tech could not find an issue. The threat of being charged came up so many times & also very rudely, that it came across this threat was a tactic to avoid warranty work.I suggest your read the latest issue of C.R. before considering this TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"great purchase","review":"i have a few friends that purchased sharp aquos and having been able to watch it and inspect it first hand helped in making the decision to get one myself. i'm the type that is very hesitant in making such big ticket purchases. i tend to research things to death and find it hard to commit since so much money is being spent on it. so after 2 months of researching, i finally made the decision to go with the sharp. i do not regret it for one minute. i love it! but in order to enjoy all that my new HD tv had to offer, i had to upgrade to an HD cable box (a must to have the full experience of HD television).all in all, this was a great purchase. the quality is amazing, design is sleek and compact, and a wonderful product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV at a Great Price","review":"This is an excellent tv. Crisp, clear picture especially in high def. Plenty of adjustment features to obtain the picture and sound you prefer. Very easy to set-up and customize. Plenty of input/output ports for most tv viewers. Unbelieveable colors and details. Standard definition broadcasts are also improved. I do not have a high def. dvd player, but since it is a progressive scan player the picture quality is very close to high def. with this tv. I would recommend this tv to anyone looking for a top of the line tv at a great price. I got mine for $900 with free shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!! Dont waste your time or money.","review":"I am a big fan of vampire movies. I hesitate to call this a vampire movie, it most resembled porn. I was very very disappointed in every aspect of this film. The cinematography as well as the weak plot non-suspense non interesting performance. It was sooooo bad you didn't care about the characters or anything else that this horrible movie offered. Someone rated it a five star movie, they must be on something very prowerful. Trust me IT IS NOT near a star!!! I would have given it no stars but you dont have that option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gritty?","review":"Gritty? When I saw that review I had to write my own. \\"Night Junkies\\" is not a gritty film. Nor is it that far outside the genere, as the vampire-as-junkie film has only recently been done elsewhere; e.g. \\"I Pass For Human\\", & \\"The Thirst\\". This has better production values than those two films I'll grant it that.But there's something that peeves me about a film that deceives from the very front cover - featuring a girl with puncture marks in her neck. There's no fangs in this film. Instead the vampires tear into the throats of their victims.This serves only to trick people into buying a film they might otherwise avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"sexy vampire movie","review":"This is exactly what I look for in vampire movies; huge [...], women stripping, lots of blood sucking and plenty of violence. Towards the end of the movie, you see mostly violence and blood sucking. The movie is about male vampires stalking prey at night, they visit a strip club and have sex with some of the strippers and stalk and kill the women. There is the typical vampire line up, the evil vampire that wants to feed and kill on everyone and the good vampire that falls in love with one of the strippers and tries to save her from the evil vampire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Night Junkies did manage to keep my attention, however I felt like I was watching a movie more like Requeim for a Dream than a vampire movie.

I purchased another copy in hopes that a new disk would get me back in business. It has the same problem as my original disk and will not install on my XP Professional Computer.

Version 16 seems to be a good fit for my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best CD I have ever purchased!","review":"This CD is amazing! I had seen the movie when I was young and bought this soundtrack last year on a whim. You don't have to be a Chipmunk fan to appreciate their great harmony and jamming songs (though this CD has sure made me one). This is one of the few CD's that I have ever bought that I acctually like every track and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chipmunks @ their Best!","review":"I was 7 years old back in 1987 when this movie came out, and I used to watch it religiously everyday. Now, 12 years later, I obtained this soundtrack and boy has it brought back memories! It has the popular, get-stuck-in-your-head-for-days-at-a-time songs such as the upbeat 'Girls of Rock 'N Roll' and the sweet balad 'My Mother' plus it contains 3 songs not included in the movie - 'Weekend in France...,' 'Flying With the Eagles,' (my personal favorite out of the entire soundtrack), and 'Mexican Holiday.' This is a MUST HAVE for any fan of the Chipmunks - and a MUST HAVE *NOW* for any fan of this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cr4ppy on the Kindle","review":"Dear Amazon, what is the deal with graphic novels on the Kindle Fire?You know what size the screen is, so you should know what the _MINIMUM_ text size should be. There are many panels in this book you need a magnifying glass to read, even after the panel is magnified by the Kindle App.Also, it looks like there are several pages in which the kindle thinks the panels are in the wrong place, so it is magnifying random places on the page.I dread to see what this would look like on anything smaller, like a phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good reading experience","review":"First of all, you can't zoom in the pages, you can only go with the \\"panel view\\", it's main function is to allow a bigger panel while reading. In my humble opinion is not a very good system for reading this great graphic comic.Second, the panels that use two pages look weird in the screen, very small, and since you can't pinch to zoom in, it's very frustating, and \\"The Doll's House\\" uses a lot of unconventional panels.I recomend Comixology to read graphic novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed & bewildered prime member","review":"I would like to review this graphic novel I really would. I purchased the first volume using the kindle app on my Samsung tablet and both read and was delighted with it. Then I purchased the second edition anticipating working my way thru all Neil's Sandman series. Imagine my surprise and dismay when I found out I couldn't read it on my tablet. Apparently I can buy and read Volume one and eight but not the others. Now I know that Amazon likes us to buy their kindle's but really does it matter much since I pay them for the products either way? This is lame, even the kindle fire has too small a screen to read these graphic rich books which is why I went with a 10.5\\" tablet.

I've been looking for something to tide myself over in between other series and this just came into the center of all of them.

I won't be reading the second book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy Firsts","review":"First of all, I confess, I didn't finish this book. As I was reading, it seemed that the author used profanity and crude language because she thought it sounded cool and hip and trendy, rather than because it was necessary to portray the characters correctly, or to set the tone, or advance the plot. I bought this book for my 14 year old daughter, but didn't pass it along after what I read. Not only was it crude for no apparent reason, it also wasn't very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"lightweight","review":"Protagonist Jessica Darling is a bona fide Mean Girl, only without the yen to shop. The author gives her every sympathy button possible: distant dad, mom who prefers glamorous older sis, best friend moving away, etc., but somehow fails to make Jessica particularly likeable or sympathetic. Rather than the sensitive, profound outsider I (think) she's supposed to be, she comes across as a potty mouthed little girl who whines endlessly, avoids taking any real responsibility for her woes, has one thing on her mind only: the two guys she has crushes on and compulsively refers to her female classmates as skanks, bitches, hos, and worse. I know chick lit is supposed to be fluff, but can't we do better than this? I've read the reviews, and if this many girls want to be Jessica Darling, the future looks bleak."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book!","review":"I saw my friend burrow this from the library and I was looking for good books to read so I decided to put a hold on it. It's great! I couldn't stop myself from reading the second book right after because it kept me in suspense. I finished both books in 2 days. It's really really good.

Jessica starts out liking a varsity track runner until she learns his shocking secret. Then she turns to some one you would never expect .I would recommend this book to anyone who has had trouble understanding or getting they person they love. Megan McCafferty has taken a very hard subject and made it extremely fascinating and fun. I loved this book and have read it over and over again. If you do read this book, please take it seriously.

I highly suggest you check out the sequel as well... it keeps getting better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tales of an Unaverage Teenage Girl","review":"Sloppy Firsts is an accurate representation of the teenage girl that many people over look. Jessica Darling is a sophomore in high school whose best, and only \\"real\\" friend, moves away. This leaves Jessica devestated, and causes her to alienate herself from her other more superficial friends. This book brings to life the pains of a more mature high school student who sees above the superficiality of cliques, fashion and gossip. Jessica is not only one of the smartest people in her class but also one of the most over looked. This book is for anyone who has ever felt underappreciated or has dealt with the pains of an American high school. McCafferty captures the essence of the unaverage high school girl in an insightful and inspiring way. Although depressing at time, I've never read a book that explores the mind of an untypical teenage girl so well. A great read I must say."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTRIGUING and WITTY","review":"I'm sixteen years old and I could totally relate to this book. I liked it A LOT. Some of the jokes, however, were a little over my head. But I love the writing style of Megan McCafferty, the author.This book is about a sixteen year old girl who lives in Pineville, New Jersey. Her best friend moves away and she becomes angry. She deals with her angst by running and talking to Marcus Flutie. This book is written in diary format, but reads like a regular first person novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely greeeaaaat!!!","review":"this series is absolutely incredible. i picked up the book on a whim, but fell in love with jessica darling and her pineville woes, and eagerly counted down the days till the next two books were released. i havent been able to put down any of these books since the day i got them. i just read them over and over again. i think this shows a side of teenage life that is way more than your typical boy, best friend, and acne drama. it is witty, touching, wise, and just plain REAL. absolutely amazing read- don't pass it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS BOOK","review":"This is the most amazing and interesting book I have ever read. Being a teenager, I know I have alot of feelings that I can't understand, and I feel alone. Reading this book made me realize that I'm not the only one who thinks the things I do, and feels the way I do. Jessica Darling's journal is so un-sugar coated and shockingly real, that you'd think you were reading your own diary. Her witty comments make me laugh, and her troubles with Marcus and her other fligs make me cry. This book is the perfect example of an average life of a teenager...only Jessica isnt afraid to keep anything from her journal, so you know exactly what is running through her head. By the time you finish this book, you feel as if Jessica is one of your closest friends. You also develop a crush on Marcus, the most perfect un-perfect nonexistant guys in the world. =P"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!!","review":"I think this book was great. I stayed up all night so I could finish it. I think that Jess shouldn't have left Marcus like that just because she assumes that he's trying to do what he's doing. She never let him explain. I hope Megan McCafferty will continue to write about what's going on in her next book. Keep up the great work!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best book!","review":"This book was a great book and is hard to forget!

It could've been better if it had ended in a good way but even the ending felt like a roll of film run out. it just dribbled off to nothing. maybe worth reading, definitely not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR YOUNG TEENS!","review":"My 14 y/o daughter borrowed this from the library, and the title made me want to peek through it before she did. I'm not overly protective, but I also feel I should not be promoting inappropriate lit or entertainment for her either. So, without reading much of it, I could easily see TONS OF PROFANITY, primarily the F-word, all throughout the pages. It also has 15-17 y/o girls and boys discussing sex - both for themselves and others. For example, \\"eff-ing the ess out of someone\\". Whether or not kids talk like this at school doesn't give a good reason to have my daughter read about it. What message are we sending teens if we hand them books that are trash talk?? Sorry, not for my girl. There's plenty of other good books out there that don't have to sensationalize sex and foul mouths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great read!!! (unless you're 13 or younger)","review":"This book is a confusing mess of poor grammar and teen angst. It is the story of a (VERY) cynical girl's home and school life. Her troubles are meaningless and this book clearly lacks substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My All Time Favorites","review":"I read a lot of books in my spare time, but I must say that Sloppy Firsts is one of my favorites, if not my ALL TIME favorite. This novel is written from a point of view that most girls going through adolescence will be able to relate to. It's almost like reading your best friend's diary--and that's what Jessica, the main character, becomes almost: your best friend. You'll cry with her, you'll laugh with her, and you'll go through every possible emotion with her as you read this book. The characters in this book are so realistic that you almost feel like you, yourself, are in the book. Even though I rarely ever read books twice, I've already done so with this book...I'm actuallly reading it a third time right now. I also recommend reading the sequel, Second Helpings, but by the time you finish this book you'll be so into Jessica Darling's life that you won't need my recommendation to go pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"this book changed my life. i know that is a stupid cliche but seriously. i loved it. and reader from portland TN are you kidding yourself. she wasnt encouraging those things she was merely showing you a glimpse of what a teen life is like. we cuss, have sex. its just the way things are. its not like we are going to go and have sex becuz a girl in a book did. dont be so niave about high school and a high schoolers life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Terrific Novel","review":"Sloppy Firsts is a terrific, engaging, amusing novel, one which should not be limited by the \\"young adult\\" label. I enjoyed it and, well, I must admit, it has been quite some time since I fit into that category. Jessica, the heroine and narrator, is devasted by her best friend's moving out of town, and must now contend with friends she doesn't think she likes and the unwanted advances of a high school jock, among other things. The novel covers her life in 2000 quite well--we follow her ups and downs which develop in an unpredictable way. Her parents drive her crazy, as do her hormones. I think all \\"young adults\\" would enjoy this novel, as would any one else who enjoys romantic comedies, or just good reads in general. The novel is refreshingly original, funny and endearing. I for one am looking forward to the next installment of Jessica's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sloppy ... Ending.","review":"\\"Sloppy Firsts\\" by Megan McCafferty is a light, fun read. I enjoyed the book up until the ending, which left me with a sour taste in my mouth. It ended with a lot of strings untied, and just kind of ruined the rest of the book for me. Up until the ending, it's a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I was so excited to read this book! It seems as if it would be a terrific \\"beach read\\" of a book, something funny and light-hearted. I thought it would make me laugh at the funny and emphatic events that teens go through during high school, but I was surprised to read a story of stupid plots and annoying characters. Although depicted very well, the main character, Jessica Darling, complained throughout the whole book. I was very dissapointed; instead of an enjoyable story about a teenage girl, it was a stupid plot about a teen who did nothing but complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sloppy Firsts - the best","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read! I couldn't put it down after I started. I've never been able to identify with a character before like I did with the main one in Sloppy Firsts, Jess Darling. She had to deal with many things I do in my daily high school life, one of the worst being cliques. She portrays very well what it feels like to be trying to fit into high school life, especially since her best friend just moved to a different state. Jess is also hilarious with her witty and sometimes sarcastic comments.The other characters are exactly like ones that I have known in high school. The jocks, upper crust, and druggies are all shown as they really are. Some books about high school can exaggerate or put too much into a stupid clique. I think Megan McCafferty did a great job on getting inside what high school students really have to go through.A great book worth picking up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in a long time!","review":"I haven't been able to read a book for fun in a long time. I've been so busy with school books and what not. So I took the time to read this one! But it didn't take me any time at all! I read this book so quickly and yet it is still one of the best books I've ever read. I would read it during class at school and get strange looks from the title, but do not judge it by the title, you'll find out what it means if you read it. A girl in one of my classes borrowed it and could not put it down, so when I finished it I gave it to her. She finished it in like two days and now I have a list of girls waiting to read it! It's just sooooo good! Everyone should get it and I can't wait until the sequal comes out so I can read more about Jessica Darling's adventures through her high school years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT for young teens","review":"This book was entertaining but it is not for a 13-year-old. It is set in a sexually sophisticated world, where most girls have sex with whatever boy they happen to be dating, and it's not that unusual for one of your pals to be known for her proclivitytoward oral sex, lots of it... There is an entertaining story going on behind all of the sex, though, and I'm sure older teens and some adults will enjoy the book. I found it to be entertaining. I just wasn't expecting it to be quite this sexy. Not that the sex is explicit. It is just there, everywhere.\\"Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging\\" has a little less sex in it but enough to fascinate a 13 or 14 year old, I'd say, and it's hysterical. If you are buying a recent book for a younger teen, try that one. (If you're buying a book for an 11 or 12 year old, try \\"Zazoo\\" - it's got a great story with just a bit of romance.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sloppy Firsts","review":"If I could I would rate this a 10 star! I loved this book! It is so entertaining and funny, and at the end when I read the sneak peak for Second Helpings I laughed so hard I felt like I was going to burst. I finished this book in one night, and I can't wait to get a copy of Second Helpings and Charmed Thirds. I would recommend this to a teenager who wants to read about real issues or even an adult who can remember when their life was as crazy and hectic as Jessica Darling's life. Also if you're looking for an awesome gift, this is PERFECT for any teenager!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your sweet Traveling Pants book --Not for young teens!","review":"I bought this book because it was recommended if you enjoyed the Traveling Pants books. My 14 year old daughter and I loved both of the Traveling Pants books, but there is no way I would let her read Sloppy Firsts. I have never sent a new book back in my life, but after reading the first few pages of Sloppy Firsts, I decided Amazon could have this one returned. The language is foul and the sexual references are beyond the \\"young adult\\" genre scope. This is not a book a young teen should read. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awseome Series","review":"This is the first of the Jessica Darling books by Megan Mcafferty.Her books are real in the mind of a teenage through college girl. She doesn't sensor herself and speaks just as a young girl would when angry at her parents or whatever the situation may be. Don't be offended by the language because that will make you miss out. Other people have noted on the language, but it is not excessive and is just used when it is being true to life. This book is one of my favorites because of the sarcastic nature of Jessica. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I did not want to like this book.","review":"I thought it was going to be the type of thing where the author pretends she is hip and knows how to talk. Aside from a few slang terms that made me cringe, it is pretty accurate.The thing is, it is amazing how much I could relate to Jessica. Hanging out with people you don't really like because it is better than the alternative, trying to understand your parents as humans instead of parents, negotiating with the things you love in life.One of the greatest things about this book is it doesn't take the typical \\"It's tough being a teen!\\" stance. Instead, the characters are real people with real problems rather than caricatures of adolescence.This is a really honest book and it was a pleasant surprise. I look forward to reading more about Jessica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to be \\"Sloppy\\"","review":"A year in the life of a teenage girl named Jessica Darling. Told dominantly through journal entries and letters, the book runs from January to December, following Jessica's life after her best friend Hope moves away. Now she hangs out at school with three girls she really doesn't like, fights a crush on a drug-loving boy, and simply tries to make it from one day to the next. This is a cute debut from Megan McCafferty that will certainly appeal to adults who have survived the high school experience and to the teens who are currently living it. If you like a light comedy, if you liked The Princess Diaries or Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging, you'll enjoy Sloppy Firsts."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite Book","review":"This is now in the number one spot on my top ten book list! I LOVE this book. I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful this book is. Seriously, evey teen girl has got to read this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"was she spying?","review":"I LOVED this book. From the minute I read the inside flap in [local store] I knew I had to get it.I recently moved across the country, away from all my friends [sort of like Hope], and I could relate so much to Jessica Darling it was scary. Even though she wasn't the one that moved, she was still experiencing all the lonliness and confusion that I am [and that Hope was].In one part of the book, she's standing in the bathroom stall during lunch thinking, \\"If Hope had been there, I wouldn't be here\\" - and I've done the exact same thing.Sloppy Firsts makes you feel allthatmore normal because Jessica is thinking all the things you are, too. It makes you smile, and it makes you want to cry. It also makes you want to scream, \\"ME TOO!\\"Go out and read this book if you're going through, or have been through, lonliness, depression, insomnia, or just plain confusion. I guarentee the only bad part of this book is that it ends - and you have to wait until Spring 2003 to get the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book To Read Over and Over...","review":"I personally loved this book. It's been the best book I've read this year. It was extremely insightful. And as I sixteen year old myself, I felt I could relate to some of Jessica's problems. She made me laugh and her adventures were, well adventurous. It kept me hooked throughout, I couldn't put the book down. I can't wait till the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea that went downhill","review":"Despite the rave reviews this book has been getting, I found the overall story not only unrealistic, but depressing to boot! I have friends that I stop talking to because they whine like Jessica Darling did, and by the middle of the book, I had to force myself to keep reading. If you want a real high school experience, check out \\"Speak\\" or \\"Catalyst\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest","review":"At last, an honest look at what high school was really like. I loved this book, and can't wait for the sequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sloppy Firsts- Great Book","review":"Sloppy Firsts, by Megan McCafferty is well worth the effort of reading. It centers around Jessica Darling, desolate after her best friend Hope moves away. Left with only the group of friends she and Hope dubbed The Clueless Crew, Jess's outlook on life is none too hopeful.I think Sloppy Firsts is a funny and very honest look at teenage life. I really sympathized w/ Jess, and I felt her embarrassment on more than one occassion. I only gave this book four stars; however because of the multitude of swear words. Other than that, this book is funny, and true to life. Bring on the sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soppy Firsts","review":"I loved this book! It didn't take me very long to finish it. I could definately relate to everything Jessica was thinking and feeling. It doesn't even seem like an adult wrote this book because she knew exeactly how we teens feel. A great book by a wonderful author. I totaly reccommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All About Teens...","review":"I first picked this book up at my local library and when I seen the title I immediately thought of something nasty... but once I started reading it I fell i love the main character and her so-called drama! This book is one that all teen girls and some coming of age adults should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU NEED TO READ THIS!","review":"OMG! this book is sooooo funny! i am in love with all the characters and i was so sad when i finished the sequal second helpings cuz i will miss jesica darling(the main character) so much! this is book is very good read it will hook you and make you laugh out loud(and i dont laugh out loud in many books!)well read this and you can thank me later"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing","review":"I'm 32 and this seems a little young, I couldn't get into it. I guess I should have paid more attention to the target audience age."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am in love with this series","review":"I love these books. I started reading them when i was 16, and ten years later, I still like them. Funny, honest, and witty."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"I found this book an easy read. It was probably directed at the average teenage reader. I found jessica to be a confused teen who delt with peer pressure, boys, and friends. This book is insiteful and a great laugh. I especially love how she is caught in between a mom who says she needs perspective and a dad who she feels she has nothing in common with. I liked how the author didn't make her most popular or the dorkiest of dorks. And how she is is torn between a lost friend who moved away, a non-caring \\"clueless crew\\", and an odd twist which enters the book at the end of sophmore year turning her into an experiment. Although, this book was an excellent read it didn't turn out how I expected it to. So in my opinionthe ending was horrible but my friends liked it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing...","review":"I bought this book based on all the fabulous reviews it received. I read many of them and thought, why not!? Be prepared...this book is not what it seems. It is like reading a diary of 16/17 year old girl. There is not much dialog between the characters and for me, quite boring. I know this is just personal preference, so I am not knocking the writing...the writing style just was not for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever","review":"This book is great. It got me to start reading again in high school and made me appreciate books. It is great for girls of any age. I especially like the modern aspect of it and how everything doesn't always turn out perfect.DON'T read the inside front flap because it will give away me favorite part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for teens","review":"Based on several online reviews, and recommendations at one of the national bookstores, I purchased this book for my 14 year old niece - who I am trying to encourage to read. While the research I did said this was an appropriate book for 14 - 17 year old girls - I totally disagree. The sexual inuendo and bad language are totally inappropriate for teenage readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sloppy Firsts","review":"Sloppy Firsts is one of those girlie books, yet it has a twist. Jessica Darling brings you into the novel by her journal. There you uncover her feelings about her best friend moving away, the boy that still wants to be with her even after their break-up, the girls that she is left to hang out with, and many other high school dramas. Jessica finds ways of dealing with these problems, which make the book a must read. Her ways of getting out of a sticky situation just land her in a new one. It's a fun and enjoyable book that will make you laugh and even relate to. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Megan McCafferty has undescribable talent!","review":"If I could recomend one book it would be SLOPY FIRSTS. Megan McCafferty has a talent of making you be very emotionaly envolved with the charecters in this book. She has a great gift for writing and is definitly on my favorite authors list. YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK!!! Get it. It is SO realistic. Me and all of my friends read this togeather and laughed as it mirrored us in diffrent ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sloppy Firsts","review":"This book was very good. It took me took me on a roller coaster of emotions. But the ending was horrible. and sometimes horrible endings ruin books."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the story of my dreams....","review":"This book kept me sucked in it the entire time and i couldn't put it down. The romance and reality to it kept me thinking the entire time \\"this is the story of my life\\"....atleast it would be if life was really so great...but it's so real and it's not a perfect fairy tale. I loved it and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sloppy Firsts is anything but rotten","review":"This is just the most incredible book! I'm 16, I wanted a book containing a character that I could relate to and I found it in Sloppy Firsts. I love Jessica's cynical taste in life even though its nothing like my own...she is all that a suffering teenager is and more. I seriously reccomend this book to anyone, call me obsessed but I have read it at least four times and I hope that the sequel is this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irresistably Un-Sloppy","review":"McCafferty's book's title does it no justice. \\"Sloppy Firsts\\" is undoubtedly not a sloppy first. If anything it is the essence of experience-even if it is a first. Jessica's character is portrayed perfectly. Maybe it's because I have a thing for angst, honesty, comedy, and romance (hey isn't that all the genres?) but this book was one of the best that I've ever read. Now, I had heard about how good this book was, but I had never picked it up, so I don't suppose this will convince you to pick this up, but really. Please? You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!!","review":"You know how people say \\"laugh out loud funny\\" when describing a book? Well i've read books described like that and never actually laughed out loud until i read Sloppy Firsts. Even after having finished it a few days ago, i'm still laughing when i think of some of the hilarious things Jess would say. Not only is Sloppy Firsts \\"laugh out loud\\"(seriously) funny, it's also got a great plot(and what every teenage girl wants, a love story, well more than one actually!) I would reccomend this book to anyone! Girl, boy, man, woman! Anyone can appreciate this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"This was a really good book--I loved the character and I loved Marcus! McCafferty is a really good writer and she talks like a teenager, which is good to read instead of those books where old people write about teens and sound NOTHING like us.Thanks for a good book, Megan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like me, but with more guts","review":"This book absolutely blew me away. Jessica reminds me of exactly how I was, or more accurately how I wished I were, in high school. All of the drama from trying to fit in and be liked to problems at home nearly perfectly mimiked my own life. The only difference is that Jess takes charge of hre life. She is a heroine whom is easily admired. She is down to earth enough to be respected, and someone you wish you could be. I can't wait to see what happens next for her in Second Helpings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy Firsts","review":"I started out really liking this book. I could relate to alot that was going on in Jessica's life and the humor in it was great. But she really struck a nerve with me when we basically had to listen to how wonderful Jessica is, and how everyone else in the world, except Hope, is beneath her. She complained about how all her classmates were nowhere near as smart as she was. Or how she was always going to win her track meets. Why? Because Jessica Darling is like, perfect. That's what I hated most about this book. That in her OBSESSION with her best friend Hope. So make some new friends. But who that's right. Jessica is way too shallow for that.I'm not sure yet if I'll read the next one in line or not. I may give her one more chance yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT!","review":"I picked this book up, which was laying on my classroom shelf. I would have never guessed by it's cover that it contained such and endearing story. \\"Read it Yourself\\" it said in big letters. You can tell this book is old and foreign, by the details and colors used. Even the end pages contained illustrations. The words are simple and not overwhelming. For years I have read many versions of \\"The Elves and the Shoemaker\\", but this one was special. The book was thin and about the size and width of an adults hand. The illustrations contained, warm dark colors that are not found nowadays in childrens books, which are usually bright and loud. This added to the coziness of the book. The book is simple enough for a child learning to read. Yet, also surprisingly enjoyable for the adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Example of 3D Animation and Effects","review":"I like this DVD... The 3D effects like waterfall, explosions, fire, water are top notch. The Quantum Mechanic \\"chapter\\" is my favorite... There is one scene showing \\"Hollow Man\\"-like figures and hands coming out of a surface. Spectacular! I wish I can learn to do all that. The music was clear and goes well with the motion (good synchronization), transitions, morphing and great beat. Good computer animated art with great music.However, there are SOME scenes which aren't sharp as they should be... like viewing a VCD full screen. These could have been better, improved to more DVD-quality. Hence I give this DVD four stars and not five.After viewing this DVD, I would certainly like to view the other DVDs in the Mind's Eye collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"This is the watered-down, glib side of electronic keyboard music. Granted, a few songs are listenable if you can just forget you're listening to Thomas Dolby, but when he apparently tries to be deep (i.e. the ascension of man would-be epic) one feels instinct tugging at the vomit reflex. Some points reach the nadir of electronica. The attempts to mix up this dated hooey with singing go terribly awry, dispelling any notion of stand-alone music (as good keyboard music can be). If you expect NOTHING from this album, you will be rather pleased. For the love of real electronica, however, turn elsewhere. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gate to Out-Dated Animation","review":"Can you say \\"out of date\\" Kids? The problem with choosing computer animation based on how it might \\"wow\\" people with it's state of the art effects, is that in just a COUPLE YEARS it becomes \\"history\\". I'm a digital artist and was deeply disapointed that this collection focused on what WAS, at that time,: 'state of the art'. I've seen a lot of computer artists using both new and old software to create 'timeless' art. Too bad this collection was looking at the 'new' EFFECTS, rather than looking for true artwork. Because of this, we get work that was out of date just a couple years after it was created. If you're into the history of the evolution of computer animation, this is a fine example. If you were looking for something that would be considered fine art decades after it's creation, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice blast from the past...","review":"I remember picking up \\"Gate to the Mind's Eye\\" years ago and marveling at the animation, so well suited to the electronic music by Dolby that I picked up the soundtrack and listened to it often in the car. That was 1995, when cell phones were finally starting to look more like phones and less like briefcases. This throwback to an earlier time in animated music doesn't pack quite the same punch as it once did, but it's still an enjoyable experience. The graphics are somewhat dated, but still interesting. Some pieces resonate more than others (\\"Armageddon,\\" \\"Quantum Mechanics) but there's a nice variety here that represents a nostalgic point in animated music production.The double disc set includes \\"Televoid,\\" which offers more of the same, (although I'm slightly biased towards the music from \\"Gate\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same as the original...","review":"Having been born in 1994, I literally grew up with this film. It was my favorite movie and will always hold a special place in my heart. To date, I still lug out my monstrous VHS player in order to play my original 1994 copy, handed down to me from my father. So, I jumped at the chance of buying a DVD copy of this fantastic film. However, upon viewing, I found it was definitely not the same. In the DVD version I received, the sound effects had been drastically changed. Arguably the best part of this film is the music. Thomas Dolby is a freaking genius. But in the DVD copy I got, the sound effects often drowned out the music. This new version had added tons of spacey sound effects that had either been far quieter or not present whatsoever. This really frustrated me. I really want a copy that is just like the original release, but it costs like, 30 bucks to transfer a VHS to DVD. Oh well, at least the DVD was cheap..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing!","review":"Kind of a \\"New age\\" video from the early 90s with a technology still a little behind to what we see now but still a very captivating video; the price and quality of the DVD, the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless piece of trash writing","review":"I'd give it zero stars if that were an option. Shallow characters, thin plot, gratuitous gore meant only to cater briefly to that genre. Clancy is riding on his reputation in this one, and I, for one, am sorely disappointed. Hate to admit I paid full supermarket price for a new copy. He used to be my all time favorite author, but I'll preview the next novel before I spend money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!!!","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I expected something packed with suspense and intrigue since it was a Clancy. Instead, I got a boring story that never went anywhere.

The characters are uninteresting, and the plot is uninteresting at best, convoluted at worst. Even the title is a misnomer: There was barely a mention of the internet in the book. Even the topic of digital encryption, which can be fascinating when presented correctly, came off as just some political bickering. I feel like I've put up with these \\"Created By\\" books to fill the gap between *real* Tom Clancy books, but I couldn't even chalk this one up as a stop-gap measure. This one was just bad. Honestly, it felt like they came up with the computer game first, and then wrote the book second.

I will have to watch Clancy write his next book before I buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad research extended to choice of ghostwriter","review":"Tom Clancy's works are carefully researched, intricately plotted, compulsively exciting right-wing propaganda. This ghostwritten monstrosity is merely right-wing propaganda; the most difficult research done must have been to find an FBI/CIA/NSA spokesman to dictate the back-to-front explanation of crypto policy.It's not as if this issue isn't thoroughly and widely discussed, even in the mainstream outside techie circles, so there is no excuse for totally misrepresenting non-spook opinion.It is amusing that the book tries to promote crypto regulation for Clancy's spook chums, but that even dramatic necessity dictates yet another case for deregulation.Tom Clancy does have a clear style; it can't be that hard to duplicate it. In this case it seems the publisher considered it enough merely to use his name. This will turn out to be a commercial mistake, as readers will now learn to avoid books \\"created by\\" Tom Clancy.Predictable, disappointing, dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruthless.com is an action packed thriller!!!!","review":"I like all the action in the book and how Tom Clancy goes into great detail. I also like the plot of the story.

Additionally, I found the whole story line to be lacking. Not the usual Clancy suspense and elaborate story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book would make great kindling for your fire.","review":"A nice comparison for ruthless.com would be a pre-fabricated house. This book is boring and probably took less than a month to write. Trite dialouge, with a lot of techno-babble in between makes this the dullest, Clancy book yet. The characters are poorly developed as is the plot. Would somebody please bring back Jack Ryan? Even the OP-Center series were better than this book produced from a video game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underdeveloped storyline and characters","review":"Sorry, but this is one of the worst \\"Clancy\\" books I've read. The characters are some of the most paper-thin personalities Clancy has created to date. Also, the plot took forever to unfold, then rapidly wrapped up in the last 15-20 pages or so. This left me feeling cheated, especially because the first chapters of the book were well done. Overall, I would have to say that if Clancy writes or \\"creates\\" any more books like Ruthless.com, I will stop reading his work.

It is written as if the government was OK with that, but these high minded software companies don't want this powerful encryption technology to fall into the hands of EVIL (apparently any non US citizen would be that, but of course there are no bad guys here!). Anyway, this is pretty funny because in reality the government was the one without a clue and was blocking encryption software from being sold outside the US, even though much of it was freely available from many places outside the US already.Another funny bit is the \\"stock crash\\" news clipping: the stock fell over $15 down to $45 over a week.

I found myself trying to finish this book just for the sake of finishing it. Most of the charaters were faceless to me and disconnected from one another. The plot never developed into a story that was exciting and the ending did not seem to be realisticaly tied to the rest of the book.

It sounds good, has enough volume, unless you enjoy hearing loss. Even the squished Atrac compression suprised me. However, some of the basic playback features I found lacking. When playing compressed files, the CD stops spinning after gathering enough info and putting it into memory. This is cool, because the spinning uses the most battery life. However, there is a fairly lengthy gap between each cut. This is not a problem with most music, but if you have a continous mix CD, then you lose the feel of the DJs performance every time a new track is dropped. This is my first device of this sort, so maybe this is not unusual, but it is aggravating. Otherwise it's a great little gadget.Dr. Anthony Danza"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarification","review":"In response to the person below me, this *does* play MP3s.

It succeeds in doing just that and then takes us with her on a journey towards love and redemption. It is beautifully photographed and brilliantly directed by Tom Tykwer. Giovanni Ribisi is pitch-perfect as Cate's counterpart/love interest and the instrument of her redemption. The screenplay by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz is a thing of moral ambiguous beauty and the supporting cast is universally wonderful. I cannot recommend this little piece of cinematic genius highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ribisi","review":"Kate Blanchett is indeed great and is the \\"star\\" of this film. I think Giovanni Ribisi is also (underappreciated and) great and should be given a lot of the credit for why this film is so good. (I confess, I have not read all the other reviews.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Misterios del amor","review":"No es predecible lo gran lograda que es la pelicula hasta con el transcurrir de ella. Cada minuto entrega elementos que sorprenden por su simpleza pero a la vez por la profundidad y delicadez de las interpretaciones de Cate y Giovani. Quizás pueda desilusionar un poco el final, dado lo acontecido a lo largo de la pelicula. El amor, no lo definiría en esta pelicula, pues de una parte está muy claramente demostrado, mas no por la otras, ahí la magia o la desilusión de la trama. Gran pelicula para descubrir los inicios de Cate Blanchett y Giovanni Ribisi."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential, so much pretentious eurotrash","review":"Cate Blanchett is, of course, good, as is Tom Tykwer, and the premise and scene-setting of this film are both solid and, frankly, full of promise. From that point onwards, though, it palls, and then some, culminating in just the kind of plot device that turns people off aesthetically/conceptually-driven films."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY TO DAY","review":"I am a big fan of giovanni ribisi (due to his boyish good looks and brilliant delivery on screen) but what was the purpose of this movie? he meets this woman who's upset about drugs being sold to children and wants revenge so he helps her than there's a scene where he wets the bed COME ON! I was very dissapointed by this movie and I must say the only good thing about it was that in a majority of giovanni's scene's he spoke in italian besides that please save yourself's the grief ( and the money) and just skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and intriguing film","review":"Heaven is a gem that I discovered in a magazine that covers upcoming films. Director Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run; Princess and the Warrior) provides a wonderful script that is only paralleled by excellent acting on the part of Cate Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi. An excellent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cate, we need to talk","review":"Yeah, so Blanchett's character plants a bomb to kill a drug dealer. Where would an English teacher get a bomb in Italy, in a Boms-R-Us store? And why did not she simply unleash a Godzila on that bad guy? Then she faints and falls in love with a guy who has as much appeal as my supersonic toothbrush. And that's Cate Blanchett for you guys. Rejoice already. Then they shave their heads - a masterful plan to blend with Italian peasantry crowds. Great. Now what do you do when your shaving heads plan thing does not work? Jump on a helicopter and end the movie. I don't know... Sounds kind of stupid. Is it me or the movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ribisi and Blanchett are very good but the movie is so-so","review":"The beginning is the most shocking thing in the movie. Cate Blanchett bombs a building and she is taking away. She escapes fromt he help of Giovanni Ribisi and they run away together. Blanchett even shaves her head bald. Ribisi's and Blanchett's chemistry is very good but I just didnt feel very happy during this movie and it kinda turned me off a little bit but the 2 leads give honest performances. Good performanes, good story but for me it ran out of steam"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Southern Gospel Classics","review":"I love this CD.

Bebe has a strong, emotive voice and when he sings, the listener becomes privy to his feelings. Each song is uplifting as always, but \\"I Have a Dream\\" is phenomenal. It is refreshing to know that the spirits of our leaders are being kept alive and well. Not only does this song speak to the memory of Dr. King specifically, but it really pays homage to every man, woman and child who has given their lives for the cause of freedom, justice and equality. I have an even greater respect for Bebe for continuing to create music of substance and quality. Great job once again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fats and Friends","review":"An incredible show.

This is a buy that I will never regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only I had been there that night","review":"Three of the greatest on one stage. I ordered this after I got an email clip from the video. I was disappointed there weren't more songs performed together. They each perform separately first, which I enjoyed, but I was really looking forward to their group numbers. Enjoyed it, but wanted more. The one I saw on the video clip was the best number they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Dance to this one!","review":"Great sound and performance. These guys really get into it and rock the house. You'll be jumping and dancing all over your house. Really interesting to see Jerry Lee slowly get into the mood and eventually smile after jumping up on top of the piano. You'll be smiling too. If you want a mood changer, this one will do it.

Oh well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The three top Rock 'n Roll piano players together!","review":"Wow ... the three top rock 'n roll piano players in the world at the time playing together in a jam session! Fabulous footage. Thank you so much for documenting this wonderful event on DVD for us. This historic footage is now one of our musical treasures."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Ain't Worth The Money!","review":"The sound sucks on this DVD. The song selection is tiresome and Paul Shaffer looks like he needs a good hot bath and a bowl of soup! It's worth watching because we now know why Ron Wood plays guitar... because the guy sounds like someone is torturing a cat when he sings. He blows! I give it one star because Jerry Lee Lewis is still something to see. His first song, \\"I Am What I Am\\", is great and so is he and his guitar player Ken Lovelace. Ray doesn't have a clue where he is and Fats is okay but he looks like he's out there with a bunch of guys who just broke out of the Met Detention Center in New York City. Forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT manual! If you only buy 1 book, THIS IS THE ONE.","review":"Short and sweet, this book will give you the confidence needed to successfully repair your Subaru! Not only did I use this book as a \`reference guide' I went ahead and read it like a text book to learn EVERYTHING about my 1984 GL wagon. This book also enabled me to do big jobs from replacing engines and clutches, to swapping out drive trains. All with NO prier knowledge! Now that I got a '93 Loyale, I will be picking up the updated version. Remember: ALWAYS go with Haynes. Chilton's manuals are TERRIBLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I purchased this item and love it. Its rated #2 in consumer reports. I have a denon and Pioneer receiver in other rooms that I paid much more for. This is a much better value.

Software patches, how many bugs can this Redhat have, I have never seen so many patches to download in my life. I spent hours downloading and the system would hang up and quit responding! How any can say this is worth 5 starts, maybe a NEGATIVE 5 rating!This has to be the biggest over-rated bunch of NON-working software I have ever purchased.

It is about as easy getting devices to work as have dental work without numbing medication. Whoever states that Linux is cheaper to run than Windows does not own a business. It costs more money in the fact it never works right or you have a application crash with a 'SEGV' error. AGGRRR, I think now I have some very expensive coasters for drinks... I am going back to Windows something that WORKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No software is available","review":"After purchasing this software I quickly found outthat you are your own 'support' person. If someapplication does not work, then you have to searchon the internet, or user forum. I don't know aboutyou but I do NOT trust complete strangers on theinternet. It is like inviting someone into yourhouse you don't know. If you want to use Adobe youcan forget it because they do not make any softwarefor Linux. And several other popular Windows apps thatare not there. So in the end I wound up buying a MAC, atleast there is software available and MS Office!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definitive Work!","review":"A definitive work on the subject of American made lanterns. A wonderful documentation of the history, contribution and technological progress of lanterns in the United States. An engaging photographic investigation of companies, people, places, uses and prices of kerosene lanterns from 1830 to the present. Contains a wonderful restoration chapter with great hints. It is safe to say that it is a complete treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the novel","review":"I first got caught up in the lives of the McCorveys and the Kavanaughs back when Sarah Mankowski serialized the web drama, Blossom Lake, online. The wildly entertaining story of small town life in Central Florida kept me coming back each week eager for the next installment. I was ecstatic when I found out the drama was to become a novel. Even under the new title, Wind Scarred, the novel manages to maintain the same feel of reading the drama. Yes, it expands on the original characters and plot, while it still manages to be faithful to the original story. If you enjoyed the drama, you will LOVE the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"seems very dated","review":"This book seems very dated for having been published in the 80s. The patterns are pretty simplistic, and, in my opinion, lack appeal. The book is 144 pages long, and there are only 4 pages in color. To me, the only redeeming point of the book is that is has some black-and-white photos of classic samplers worked in the 1700s and early 1800s."},{"rating":"2","title":"the dream giver","review":"highly recommended for everyone. this book maps out the challenges you have to face in each new adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This product arrived in good time.

This card performs significantly worse than that older card. Do not be fooled by the fact that this card has 128 mb of RAM. That really means nothing. This card has no fan and seems likely to overheat unless your computer's cooling is really top notch. This card does not run Battlefield 1942 well. I think this card is pitched to gamers w/ its 128 mb of ram, but the performance is really unacceptable. There really is nothing good about this card whatsoever. Don't buy it. Spend a little more if you are gaming, or if you aren't, and just need something basic, you can get as good a card for half the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Documentary","review":"About a year ago on the NPR show \\"This American Life\\" there was an episode called \\"Home Alone\\" Nov 14, 2008 which dealt with the topic of people who die without any next of kin.

And we're happy with the player. It seems most of the other players we've seen are all about exactly the same...they even have the same remote control as if one blanket company is making them for many companies. This Panasonic is definitely original. The Audio/Video Enhancer button is great. This is the best DVD player we've seen in its class (under $100 single disc). Why not 5 stars? Well, if this unit lasts a long time then I'll come back and give it 5 stars. UPDATE: It is now years later and I would change this to a 5 star review if I could because this player has been fantastic...no problems, good at playing scratched discs, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the remote..........","review":"I bought this dvd player, because it is one of the first ones that will play dvd-ram disc's that have been recorded on my Panasonic dvd recorder.I really like the remote on the dvd recorder. The remote on this dvd player is just as good.I bought this player to replace tow cheaper players. The first was a Daewoo, and the second was a CyberHome. Both of the remoted on these were hard to use. All of the buttons on the CyberHome dvd player's remote were small, marked with small print and looked alike.From now on, I'd cleck out the remote, before I bought any other device using a remote control. As a satellite TV and home theater installer, I have experience with thousands of remotes, and I can navigate amost all of them with ease. But for long term use, I prefer one that is easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"great player until it died","review":"Add me to the set of users who were delighted with the player's functionality... until its demise at the age of only 18 months, with the classic H07 error.I used to hold the Panasonic brand in high regard, but it'll be a while before I buy their products again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it for viewing home made DVDs","review":"I've been looking for a player that will play DVD-R's I've made myself. I've been creating DVD's from our home videos and finding our older player (and many new players) will not play them without skipping or freezing. I went through all the players at a local retailer and this one was the only one that played the whole DVD with not a single hiccup. It does a great job on purchased DVD's, and allows us to view our picture CD's on the TV. Anyone involved in home movie production may wish to test this player on their DVD's.I rated it for four stars out of 5. I would have liked enough front panel controls to permit easy DVD menu navigation for those times you misplace the remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought 2 lemons","review":"I bought one for my Mother in law for Christmas, Her's started acting up after 2 months. I bought the same model for myself at the same time. Mine broke after 4 months. Panasonic only covers labor for 90 days. I spent a few dollors more on a Panasonic instead of a no name brand because of the Panasonic name, I thought I was getting something better, I found out that I was wrong. I will think twice next time I buy a cheap Panasonic product. I recomend staying away from this model. I would still purchase a Panosonic but not there bottom of the line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Little Player","review":"I bought this Unit for $78.00. I purchased it because I needed something to play my DVD-Ram disc that I record from my Toshiba DVD recorder. The picture from this unit is awesome. If you can use the componet hook-ups I highly recommened you do so. I have a Panasonic 5 disc changer and the remotes are interchangebale. This is a very easy unit to use. If you do use the component jacks and have a reciever that you run your sound to you will have to purchase a set of connectores to run from the player to the receiver as it doesn't come with these. That is the only negative I found. It is compatible with -Ram, -R/RW, and +R/Rw. Buy this unit and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Don't buy Panasonic DVD players. Go to Google and do a search on Panasonic and H02 errors. Their DVD players die quickly. Mine died within about six months and I only watched about two movies a month. What's more Panasonic wants to charge quite a bit to fix it and from what I hear, once fixed, it will die again in another six months. A company that doesn't stand behind their products doesn't deserve our business. Don't buy Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a text book.","review":"It's a literature text book. that's about it. it has that nice new book smell. and that's the only advantage it has. if you have to buy the book, just get it unless you're confident you can find all the stories online or at your school library for free. Myea, nothing special here.Also if you're a lazy student, keep in mind that this thing is a good 2 or so inches thick and kinda heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great c/d","review":"This is an excellent c/d.

It is the best newgrass you'll ever hear played by the five best bluegrass musicians in the country, Sam Bush, Bela Fleck, Mark O'Connor, Jerry Douglas and Edgar Meyer.The musicianship on this album is stunning. This music has changed my life. It inspired me to start playing the mandolin and ten years later bluegrass music has become a major force in my life. I was fortunate to meet Sam Bush this year at mandolin camp and he is an inspirational teacher, musician and human being.Do yourself a favor, if you don't have this CD, BUY IT! It may change your life too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard","review":"This is the second review I'm doing for this album. I'm only doing it because I forgot to mention something in my first review. If you have heard Bela Fleck's \\"Live Art\\" then this review will be better understood. \\"Telluride Sessions\\" is better than \\"Live Art\\" in my opinion. Although \\"Live Art\\" has some solos on it that can't be matched this album in terms of musicality is superior. \\"Live Art\\" is a very hard album to beat ( I'm sure many of you would agree with me) but this album does it. For those of you who have not heard \\"Live Art\\" go ahead and buy it and this one also. The quality of the musical compositions on this album can rival anything out there today."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate bluegrass","review":"Hailing from Arkansas, like I do, I always regarded bluegrass as \\"Marrying Your Sister\\"- music and withstanding all the hillbilly-Bill Clinton jokes the rest of the world could muster. THIS IS NOT BLUEGRASS!!! This is acoustic jazz played on bluegrass instruments. This cd first exposed me to Edgar Meyer, Mark O'Conner and Jerry Douglas, three of the most creative talents in modern history. In music, speed isn't everything. Taste and phrasing are even more important. This cd, along with Hop, Skip, and Wobble provides all 3 elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"A big fan of all these musicians, so I'm picking up a few CD's I don't have..... The playing on this CD is very mechanical, just going through the motions. It will go into the rack of CD's and likely never get played again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good friend","review":"This CD is a revolution of a new style of music. The gateway to bluegrass is here! As a matter of fact, you may notice that my name is Elijah O'Connor - similar to Mark O'Connor. That is actually because I am a rather close relative of his..........his son. I know each of them pretty well - Sam used to babysit me as a baby, and Edgar, when I was about 2, threw me into the air at a dinner party type deal and slammed my head into the ceiling! I don't quite know Bela as well, but Jerry is a really cool guy as well (I recently ran into him at the August \\"Down From the Mountain\\" tour in San Diego, California).My dad is really neat as well! Please, I would recommend getting into his music - very enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good blankets","review":"These blankets are on the smaller side and kind of thin but they work great for throwing them in a stoller or over a bouncy seat, etc. They wash up well, I haven't had any problems.

The singles were terrible except True but even that song isn't typical George Strait. What the heck is with all of the slow ballads on here and they are long songs to some of them go for just under 5 minutes. George Strait luckily bounced back to his usual self in Always never the same and by 2001 The Road less Traveled was such a better album full of great singles and better songs George Strait is still going strong today with new songs and will be around for many years and I hope this album gets put away forever because it stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lame for George Strait","review":"This is a decen talbum by anyoen else, but coming from George Strait, the master of modern country music, this album is straight up boring. A lot of the songs fall kind of flat, and aren't very memorable.If you're a fan of George's get to add to your collection, but if you're not, skip it and get a better one. Always Never the same is pretty good, and so is Blue Clear Sky. In 5 or 10 years though, all the people who rave about this now are going to forget all about it and it'll sit on the shelf collecting dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is pretty bad","review":"I am a great fan of George Strait and have many of his albums, but this one just sits on the shelf. I would trade it in and get $2.00 credit for it at the local cd store, but I can't bring myself to part with a Strait cd. She'll Walk away One Step At A Time is a good one, but the rest are either mediocre or just plain boring.Save yourself the money and send him the message that he should record only decent songs -- decent being good, solid country songs. I don't even want to know what he was thinking when he picked these tunes, but it sure wasn't good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strait Disappointment","review":"Probably the biggest George Strait fan there is, I almost died when I listened to this recording. He strays so far away from country that it's hard to call it country at all. I had faith in old George, though, and he made a strong comeback with Always Never The Same. There isn't a bad track on it, and I hope it will produce many more greatest hits for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A View From Down Under","review":"Being a pure George Strait fan, and a person with appreciation for all types music, its no surprise that Mr Strait once again, has excelled in his choice of songs to compile on this CD. As a leading New Zealand Line Dance Instructor, there's many great dance tracks including the up tempo We Really Shouldn't Be Doing This', and the remake of the old song \\"I Just Want To Dance With You\\" but also the songs which warm the heart and engross you in the story of the song."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed with this CD","review":"George Strait is my favorite singer. I received this CD for my birthday this month. My wife thought she couldn't go wrong with George Strait. He let us down this time. His voice and the music are great, it's the lyrics that ruin this CD.My children listen to country music with me, but I won't let them listen to this CD. George Strait has been doing great for years, he doesn't need songs that are nothing but adultery.In his movie Pure Country Grandma Ivy said she would come to see him 'just sing', no lights, no smoke, no loud music. Why can't it be no sex, no aldultery.George should sing songs that are appropriate for all ages.

The musicians seem more than competent and the arrangments are interesting-sounding, which is something to be said, for sure. Andrea Summer's vocals are nasally and occasionally flat, a bad impression of Natalie Merchant or something, but perhaps that's just a victim of the weak production, or the lack of numerous takes to get it right. Lyrically, most of the songs are adequate, but a few, such as Melanie, sound like bad jr. high poetry unfortunately. If she could get some good lyrics and a smooth professional production to go along with the excellent musical arrangements, she'd probably stand out some from the pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick another","review":"The customer service was good but the product was no good.After they sent 3 harddrives, 2 with disk clatter and the other with bad sectors I gave up on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Possibly the Best Book ever written","review":"If you can amagine a book that takes you back to your childhood, and then transports you to your present day, with all your experiences under your belt, and then lets you be that child again, then this is the book.You will not be able to put this down, and I challenge anybody to read this book and not laugh out load once.I hope that anybody that reads this book gets as much enjoyment from it as me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honing his skills","review":"Brookmyre is one of the few authors who can make me laugh out loud. This was the second of his books that I read and (forgive the cliche) I could hardly put it down. He always has a semi-political message, but he masks it under some really funny adventure. The scene where the ex-cop starts gets involved in the story is truly genius. He has a talent for making you care about his characters. People do occasionally die in Brookmyre's books, but he stays well away from really bringing you down. This book will make just about anyone happy -- it's a great book for a quiet evening at home but won't tax you too greatly if you're looking for a holiday read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book,.....couldn't put it down","review":"I have just returned from a holiday where I read this book.

(only downside is that there is some MSG in these... but really, who knows what's actually in those greasy chips in your kitchen right now)- my advice is to try these wonderful snow pea chips- you won't want to go back to your regular (unhealthy greasy high fat) chips after you've tasted something so much better- and it just so happens that these baked snow pea snacks are better for you as well- who knew a lower fat snack could taste this good! ;0)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Muy mal.... de baja calidad...","review":"Bueno, cuando compre este disco estaba esperando algo refrescante, algo nuevo, algo diferente...

Reminding myself that I wsn't reading for my own enjoyment, I pressed on. Chapter 5, \\"Newman and 'Liberal' Religion\\" began as a sensible condemnation of relativism (what Newman called Liberal religion), which Weigel then conflated with a defense of U.S. political neoconservatism.

Kyne, a writer from the 1920s and '30s who was not too highly respected by critics. The critics be hanged. This is a charming book peopled with characters that reached into my soul and stirred inner feelings that had been lying dormat. It is a romance. It is humor. It is a moralistic tale. Two people at the depths of the depression struggle through, aided by their outstanding code of ethics and a generous benefactor. The book is filled with improbable coincidences, but the story is told so charmingly, it doesn't matter. If you like well written dialogue, interesting situations, and feel-good endings, this is the book for you. I can't wait to read more of Kyne's efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krusell Handit","review":"The Krussel Handit Platinum is a good basic leather cover for the Treo 650.

However, rare is the book that explains each flower's role in the world's history and literature, as well as their medicinal uses and, the roots of each flower's botanical and common names. That is why Bobby Ward's A Contemplation Upon Flowers, which traces the history of eighty plants from the time of the Greek's to today, is such a treasure.This book is a must have for any serious gardener. Bobby Ward reveals long lost secretes about some of the world's favorite gardening plants that until now where lost and hidden in books and manuscripts that have been out of print for ages.

Every single muslim in the film is a terrorist and every christian an innocent. Every mosque speaks hatred and there are no other voices shown. The message is so blunt in this film. Nobody outside Washington memo readership could be distracted enough to believe this. Blatant rally the public propaganda. Really quite shocking if you have spent any time enjoying the hospitality of these parts of the world. Produced in Italy and the UK and I have to wonder who financed this. It is clearly motivated by a wish to incite hatred.

Although I haven't read The Old Curiosity Shop, this DVD version was enough to convince me to skip the book. Even compared to other Dickens' works, the story here is overly dark, morbid and depressing. As for the production, the cinematography was fine as well as the casting. Unfortunately, there was not enough character development to make me care or sympathize with the main characters as they experienced tragedy after tragedy at the hands of a very creepy villain. The end came as a relief. Recommend you skip this one--maybe the book was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"I'd watch anything with Derek Jacobi in it. He's an amazing actor.

The worst crime commited by those involved in this travesty is the creation of a \\"happy ending\\" to make our hearts ache a little less. What idiotic rubbish!

Now, I make sure that my i2 is on board before making a non-routine trip.As for its navigation capabilities, the i2 is not so intelligent as moi. However, that is not saying much (LOL).

The relatively small size can be a plus- it might be small, but the screen is large enough that I've never been reduced to 'squinting' or straining to make it out. Features all work just fine. My only complaint is that the arrival time is grossly underestimated. I've had few arguements with Ms. Garmin when she chooses to send me in a direction I feel is illogical... But you're always free to disagree with her and she'll just take a second to recalculate and try to send you on her chosen course.All in all, a great value. I am a sales rep in the atlantic states area, and the data card holds all these states plus additional maps for my trips to florida.

Its hard to find addresses on maps or mapquest. The streetpilot i2 is amazing. I enter the address and away I go. Never get lost.

It usually pretty easy to figure that out though. I would highly recommend this. I used to spend about 1 hour every night planning the next day on mapquest, now I don't have to.

Dad. He doesn't need anything fancy, just the basics, so I thought this cheaper model would be perfect. It was more trouble than it was worth. It was difficult to program the maps, the \\"Where to\\" was tedious to input, and it was just more trouble than it was worth. This was difficult for me and my husband and we knew if we couldn't deal with this that my Dad would be totally lost.

It works wonder for a first-time GPS buyer. I was first introduced the unit when I was travelling with a friend who had one in his van and we travelled together one evening. It does what it is designed. Though the trans-flash memory capacity is small that comes with the unit, it does what it is designed for.

Let the buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toronto did not win the Stanley Cup in 1966","review":"On page 43 of this book, it states that Toronto won the Stanley Cup by defeating Montreal to win the best-of-seven series, 4-2. In reality, Montreal defeated Toronto, 4-0. Before you post a review criticizing another reviewer, make sure you get your facts straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Stanley Cup","review":"I don't know what the reader from Livonia is referring to. Montreal did win the Cup in 1966 4-0. But the very next year Toronto did beat Montreal 4-2 to win it. It seems the reader misread the year, not the author miswriting. I could find no reference to Toronto winning the Cup in '66.In all I find the book to not be of the quality of Total Hockey by the same publisher (a great buy) but is certainly worthy of purchase. If you're into statistics there's plenty inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing book in confusing series of books","review":"I have no particular love for this book, but I don't really know what to make of it. It seems to contradict many of the things said in The Great and Secret Show, and some of the characters have lost focus(ie..Tommy Ray, Jo Beth, and Howie). However, every time I think Barker's full of it, he throws some twist in the story that pulls me back in. It's a confusing book to say the least, and he doesn't answer much at the end, but this is only the second book in a series, so I'm not sure if Barker's got something up his sleeve...There have been worse \\"middle of the series\\" books around that have still ended up good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like having root canal..","review":"How can I say this nicely? I know it's fantasy/horror, and maybe I just don't get the genre, but what the hey it's my review, right? I hated this book. It didn't make any kind of sense it's obtuse and it just plain stunk. Clive must have been on a real binge when he thought up this plot (or plod, as I see it). By the time I got 2/3's through it, I was hoping the Iad WOULD wipe everyone out and MY misery attempting to finish it. The best thing I CAN say about this book is, that it's over and on to something I like doing, like having a root canal.

I just saw a question on here about the third book and thought I would give everyone a heads up.It appears the third book is not out yet and will not neccessarily be out any time soon. Please see the following link for his reasoning for this http://www.clivebarker.dial.pipex.com/newbooksb.htmlIn a nutshell he says that the last book will be a monster and that it takes time to prepare to write this type of book. It also says that he has other series going on as well that take time. Too many ideas running through his head and that he needs to clone himself. Anyway - take a look at the link if you are interested but he says that he promises it will be out before the end of this century.....Happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does justice to The Great and Secret Show","review":"I just reviewed The Great and Secret Show and thought I'd come here and speak my peace about this one as well. It is a brilliant continuation of the first book of the art. This novel explores the origins of some of the characters from the first book and goes even farther in it's descriptions of things like the dream sea and the Iad. We learn new things and are given a taste of what is to come in part three (I can't wait). If imaginative literature is your thing, then you'd best read the books of the art."},{"rating":"2","title":"*~A dreamlike web of love, lust, and other vicious circles~*","review":"An amazing story...fast-paced, complex, teeming with imagery both sensual and disturbing.

I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst horror story I've ever read","review":"This book was a major disappointment. It gets one star, just because there is no 0 star option. The plot is dull, the characters weak and the horror scenes can't scare even a little kid. Although the parallel worlds idea is intriguing, Barker only utilizes it superficially and wasting the potential of making a great story. It is a mediocre book overall and I strongly discourage anyone from buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second part was just as intriguing read first","review":"I loved this book.. it really got me back into reading after months of taking a break from picking up a book. At first I was daunted by the length. I admit it! But by the end I wished it were double in pages. I hated that the story ended and that is a true mark of an enjoyed story. Now I'm reading the first part and am able to make all these connections with characters referenced before that were never rightfully introduced (ie Jaffe, Fletcher, Kisson). The order hasn't confused me too much. I feel like I know secrets that these characters don't. I know how the story ended before it began. After The G and S Show I know I'll be wishing there was a part 3.. Maybe Barker would consider. There are still a million stories on the story tree..and I for one would love to read another book of the Art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everville: The Second Book Of The Art","review":"If you're at all interested in the world of comparative mythology and it's connection to psychoanalysis, or even the world of fantasy and the occult, you'll love this book. More than anything it's relentlessly engaging. At several turns it's romantic, horroriffic, erotic, mystifying, etc. A story that delves into the idea of a world beyond worlds. A story of dream and fantasy. I guarantee it's well worth the read. Best of all, this book stands on its own...meaning you don't have to read the first installment of the book, \\"The Great And Secret Show: The First Book Of The Art\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"clive??","review":"I'm not sure what has happened to Barker. I can't believe the man who wrote mind blowing pieces like the Books of Blood, the Damnation Game, and Imajica is the same one who wrote the aimless Everville.

Everville wouldn't have even been good as a money-motivated, posthumous release."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVERVILLE IS EVERYTHING BACKASSWARD!","review":"You gotta understand that you should ignore the 1 rating; itsrating should really be a -10.

(Hey Clive! Go back to short stories; relearn how to stroke the ideas, man! And quit trying to be a British cowboy! You just ain't cutting it, dude!

She told me to read it and gave me a copy of the book. When I finally got around to reading TG&SS i couldn't put it down. When i was finished i asked my mom to go out and buy the sequel \\"Everville\\". I didn't think it could get better but it did. Clive Barker is a true genius and these two books prove it. One thing has been bothering me however since i finished Everville. What's Next?? There has to be more. If anybody knows which book it is (if it exists...) please email me at pyromaniak690@hotmail.com. thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody Shoot Me","review":"All I can say is that this is one book I wish I had never read. If you are a fan of The Great and Secret Show, like I am, DO NOT read this book. Mr. Barker basically destroys everything he built in The Great and Secret Show. When I look back I find I can name numerous things I hated about this book and nothing I liked about it. The only reason I can think of that this book was ever written for was the money. All I can hope is that a third book in this series is written and we find out that all that happened in this book was just a bad dream of one of the main characters. In conclusion, treat this book like the plague and never touch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brighter Than Phosphor Bronze","review":"These strings are one of the many sets I've tried on a Seagull S6 Dreadnought and so far, these BY FAR sound the best.

I definitely prefer these to D'Addario EJ16 Phosphor Bronze, as those are not as crisp and bright as these 80/20's are.

There is a good section at the begining of the book, giving tips on how to tell stories At the end of each story, there is a review of the story in point form so you don't have to read them to your audience. You can actually \\"tell\\" them the story. The stories are adaptable to many settings and I have used many of them around different campfires for youth aged 5 to 18. The stories also have endings that will not have younger youth having nightmares and having \\"accidents\\" in their sleeping bags. I highly recommend it for any story teller, scouter, guide leader etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"What camp did you go to.","review":"I dont think the author of this book every sat at a campfire, let alone told a scary story.

I was actually ok with following Sam, Marcus, and Phillip, but Lance and Asia's story was not told as well as it could have been. The chemistry between those two characters was enough to hold its own in a novel by itself. Why did it feel like their story was told as an afterthought? Sam's storyline bored me to tears; Marcus was a little boring, but got interesting towards the end (left me \\"breathless\\"); I liked Phillip because he was such a caring father.A part of me was glad that Lance and Asia didn't end with everything wrapped in a predictable neat tidy bow like the others, but it still could have been better. I really hope we see those two characters again. There's no way they can end like that.All in all, this book was okay.

Although it seemed a marked departure from her usual, I thought the storyline had the potential to be interesting... and it DID, although that potential was certainly unfulfilled. Like another reviewer, my main issue is that there was just TOO MUCH GOING ON. The characters were ill-developed, and I found myself having to keep flipping back to remind myself of who was who, who they were dating, why their past relationship had gone sour, etc. I finished the book still feeling like I didn't KNOW any of the characters, with the exception of Lance and Asia. I agree with the many who said Lance and Asia's story could have been a novel in itself. Ironically, their storyline was the only one worth following - and the only one that was ultimately unresolved.I'd recommend one of Ms. Jackson's prior works instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"my opinion","review":"no offense but everytime i read a book about a hero sleeping with someone else that isnt the heroinne and seeing him enjoy it really turns my stomach, besides if sam or whatever his name is didnt feel anything for tina why did he say her name every darn other page, he even thought she was the best person hes ever slept with, he should of just left the other girl he was interested in find a better man..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thank You","review":"I thought I wrote a review for this a few years ago, but I guess I didn't it just came up for me to write one after I purchased the book for someone else.

Of course my favorite couple was Lance and Asia (a die hard playa and a determined sista)both fighting love. I loved how all the other relationships played off of Lance's book. Mrs. Jackson must have really done her \\"playas\\" research because she nailed it right on the head. Lances book helped Philllip , Marcus, and Sam realize that being a player wasn't for them.

A fitting conclusion to the story continued in DESPERADO (I've not seen EL MARIACH, so I can't comment on it).

If not, please don't bother because you will not appreciate it.If you based this movie on characters...Johnny Depp would win...his character is humerous, sexy, vicious, and just all around Johnny!

Don't expect things to particularly make sense. But, if for some unknown reason you are like me and love the Mariachi series, this one is a must. You just have to accept it for what it is, even if you can't really define it into a convenient pigeon-hole. I wish I could not like Johnny Depp and Antonio Banderas, but unfortunately they are just too good to not like.I hated Antonio Banderas just because he was so pretty...but when I actually saw some of his work I realized he is a great comedic actor.

What a waste of a talented cast who are obviously begging for something meaningful to do.Antonio Banderas returns again as the mariachi with and guitar case full of guns to save the Mexican President and shoot up the bad guy--Willem Dafoe.

Some good action scenes, I give it that....but it doesn't make a entire movie without a decent plot...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flick!!","review":"This was my favorite movie of all time. Amazing direction combined with special effects that will blow your mind, this movie is a must own. To say that you need to have seen the first two to like this one is untrue. I saw it before I even knew that it was the third in a series and I still loved it. Anyone who says that it doesn't have a plot is a complete liar. You just have to pay attention to what's happening. Oh, Horrors. If you didn't understand this movie, you weren't paying attention enough. Se it again. Great DVD with awesome special features including a \\"ten minute cooking school\\" that explains how to make a tasty dish featured in the film. I myself have made it twice. It also includes a walkthrough of TROUBLEMAKER STUDIOS that is unbelievable. For any action-mystery lover, this film is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING ZONE 1 ONLY","review":"IF YOU HAVE A DVD THAT IS FROM OUTSIDE THE US - REGARDLESS IF YOU HAVE MOVED TO NORTH AMERICA THIS DVD WILL NOT PLAY ON A MODIFIED OR NON-ZONE 1 DVD PLAYER.

If you are looking for a fast paced fun action movie get Kill Bill Vol.1 or check out 2004's remake of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", both are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"Oh mi god, this movie is soOoOoOo lame! Plum full of one-dimensional characters, tired caricatures and grody-to-the-max violence. Even more annoying was its pointless plot and weird (not in a good way) dialogue/scenes. Example: Depp's character shoots a cook in a restaurant because his cooking was \\"too good\\" and things just needed to be \\"balanced out\\"? What the F%&#? What I wonder is why so many first-rate actors signed on to this turkey, though you wouldn't guess they were first-rate by their performances. The only reason I saw this flick through the end was because I wanted to be polite to the person who rented it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!","review":"This was, by far, the worst movie I have seen in years! Not only is it filmed in an annoyingly \\"hi-speed, quick scene shift\\" fashion but the plot is flimsy and the acting is bad, very, very, bad! Selma Hyack appears briefly in flash-back sequences while Antonio Banderas is in just about mind-numbingly boring scene. Don't buy this DVD, rent it if you must and if you want to waste two hours of your life. Otherwise, stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the h*** was the plot of this movie????","review":"What the heck was Robert Rodriguez thinking when he made this awful movie? He is a usually pretty reliable, but this movie mad absolutely zero sense. There were way to many characters, and there was no character development at all. I didn't even know a lot of the character names until the credits ran. And by that time, I didn't really care.Some of the actions set pieces were fantastic, but they had nothing to do with the plot, what ever the plot was.DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO RENT IT! Save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheres Salma?","review":"I watched this movie because I did enjoy the first one. However if it wasn't for Mr Depp it would have been a complete waste. He was the only part of the film that was amusing and kept it going.

That one star is for Johnny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not play","review":"I can't even watch this.

The action is of the everyday action movie affair. The plot is a rambling collage to give a reason for another action scene. Antonio Banderas and Johnny Depp are great, but not superhero enough to save this mess. Desperado was just plain cool, even original at times. Maybe Desperado will be remembered as the one that Rodriguez got right. Once Upon a Time in Mexico will be remembered as the one he made instead of fooling the kids one more time with Spy Kids 4!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More like 2 1/2 stars","review":"Loaded with bloody action and loads of explosions, the third film in Robert Rodriguez' El Mariachi trilogy is an unnecessary, but somewhat fun, sequel. Antonio Banderas returns in the role that made him famous with Desperado, but his character and performance is outshined by the always fantastic Johnny Depp as the mysterious CIA Agent Sands who recruits the Mariachi for his own purposes. Salma Hayek's role is nothing more than a cameo in the beginning flashback of the film, and the colorful cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke, Rueben Blades, Danny Trejo, and Eva Mendes; most of whom go greatly underused. Once Upon a Time in Mexico is nowhere as great as either El Mariachi or Desperado, and the film would probably be a clunker were it not for Rodriguez' well crafted action scenes and Depp's film stealing performance. All in all, this is worth checking out for fans of Depp or fans of the Mariachi, just don't expect much from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"growing on me","review":"I've had to rethink this film. I don't think it's as good as Desperado primarily because el mariachi is overshadowed by the convoluted plot. Nevertheless, the style and cinematography is pleasing. Depp as the sociopathic CIA agent steals a few scenes but doesn't quite steal the show (much like Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday in Tombstone). Rodriguez could have probably made a dark, comedic film just on Sands. Overall, the mariachi series is a fun trilogy and Rodriguez is an extraordinarily talented filmmaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deteriorates into a depressing gross-out","review":"While \\"El Mariachi\\" and \\"Desperado\\" were stylish and fun, this is so violent and depressing, it's almost unwatchable, despite excellent performances by the lead actors. At points, the violence becomes simply sadistic to the audience, with horror-film-caliber torture sequences, and the characters are so non-chalant about shooting innocent people, it just wears you out. (Just a note: I'm a big action movie fan, but this is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre than John Woo. Methinks doing kids flicks like \\"Spykids\\" has made a monster out of Robert Rodriguez.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dull to boo","review":"Once Upon a Time was eagerly anticipated after its laugh a minute predecessor. But despite a stellar list of cast members, the most amazing thing about this dud was that someone who is now hopefully out of the movie business made the decision to put it into release.Granted, Banderas and Hayek have an amazing scene descending the front of a five story building while chained together and under fire. Johnny Depp has a few flashes and several very cool tee shirts. And there may be redeeming moments that occur after the point at which we turned it off. But overall, it's the cinematic equivalent of going out on Saturday night to watch people pump self service gasoline."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films of 2003.","review":"Antonio Bandares, Salma Hayek, Johnny Depp, great actors right. I am not going to say bad things about them, but who ever wrote what could've been the corniest script since Gigli. \\"Are you a MexiCAN or a MexiCAN't\\" After an hour of torment I could'nt take it.

Too bad - beautiful setting and the audience could have been treated to an exciting western!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Rodriguez's most violent film","review":"This film is violent, gory, and full of profanity. There is one scene where the CIA agent (Johnny Depp) gets his eyes pulled out and he we see him with no eyeballs and blood all over his face. It is not good, just fair. Desperado was better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Awful. Johnny Depp plays a crazy CIA agent who tends to shoot people a lot. Just that is seriously laughable to watch. He is involved in a plot to assassinate a president of Mexico. Wait, he wants to kill somebody named general(who has a nice big mustache and scowls a lot) Marquez who wants to kill the president( and Johnny Depp's character doesn't care if he gets killed). That brings us to Antonio Banderas who wants revenge on Marquez for killing his wife(again?). With me so far? Antonio Banderas looks very handsome and spends most of his time walking around with a guitar and shooting a lot of bad guys who come out at him from all directions. There is a lot more to the plot but its so dumb that I don't even want to bother repeating it. Needless to say I pity anyone who actually bought this movie sight unseen and wasted their hard earned money. I love action movies but this is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Script?","review":"Someone did not read the final version of this script.

I don't understand the reviewers here who thought Desperado was good - I gave Desperado one star beause zero stars is not an option.Once Upon a Time In Mexico is the same recipe as Desperado: poor writing, poor acting, and poor execution. This is the type of movie that you throw in the trash rather than donate to a book sale, simply because it is inhumane to subject people to this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once there were some idiots who thought they could direct","review":"If I had known Desperado was going to have a follow-up I would have rushed to the store at once to find it, but in fact I just stumbled over it and I wish I hadn't.It continues where Desperado ended, showing scenes where Mariachi's (Banderas) girlfriend (Carolina - Hayek) is killed by her ex-boyfriend. A corrupt CIA agent offers him a deal he can't turn away : revenge.It works now and then, but too often it's too confusing and too many links and scenes that in my opinion could have been deleted and just left out, but then the movie would only be 30 min (OK by me).It's an OK movie if you have nothing better to do a friday night, but to call this the sequel to Desperado is just taking it TOO far."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite","review":"I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan & this is one of my favorites.

Then it all went to hell in handbasket. The \\"is it a sequel?\\" Sequel \\"Once Upon A Time In Mexico\\" unfortunatly resembles the end of \\"Desperado\\" and not the beginning. Johnny Depp is the only redeeming feature in this movie, and it isn't one of his better performances. There is way too little of Selma Hayek, zero character development, and the action sequences are laughable. The plot, however, is solid, and the only reason I watched this movie to the end. If only the plot could have been matched with what worked at the beginning of the first movie, this could have been great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise, they get better","review":"Unlike most sequels, this is the best of the 3 and this is saying a lot. I had to search high and low for the first Mariachi movie... Spanish with English subtitles no less. It was super but a little less thrill than the Banderas #2 and #3 sequels. This one has the most action and the most humor and yet still maintains that Mariachi tone (and kind of a \\"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly\\" movie tone also). You'll have to suspend some disbelief but that's expected after #2. Johnny Depp is actually ok in this but I still can't stand him in person (he keeps threatening to move to France, so WHY DOESN'T HE???). Banderas is so likeable in virtually all he does and he shines here, although he is less of the star than #2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run quick, save yourself.","review":"This movie was such a waste of time. It gets a half star for having semi-decent shootouts and another for a great perfomance by Johnny Depp. Personally though, if you want gunfights you'd do better by renting a John Woo film. By the way whose idea was it to give Enrique a gun. With that said rent at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major oversight!","review":"Am I the only person in America who cannot believe \\"Once Upon A Time In MEXICO\\" -- the third film in a series that began with a Spanish-language film -- is NOT available in Spanish format on DVD??

There are altogether four sex scenes(2 showing the sex between the two parties in full, one is only showing sex scenes at half body and the other one is just erotic(no sex).

At least I think she tells lies (I fast forwarded through most of the clothed scenes).Shannon plays a DEA agent who goes undercover to break up a Mexican drug smuggling ring.

I really enjoyed the tastefully done nude scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shannon Tweed is deadly!","review":"This movie while definitely in the B category is still worth every penny just to watch Shannon Tweed. I believe she was a former playmate and wow is she still hot! She plays an FBI agent deep undercover in ol Mexico. Apparently a casino's boss is in cahoots with a drug gang and it's up to the dangerous blonde bombshell to infiltrate and bring'em down. In turn, her body proves to be her best weapon of offense as she executes some great martial arts moves against the baddies.(The best scene is when a couple thugs break into her room and try a sneak attack only to be taken by surprise as Shannon knocks them out cold with a couple spinning back kicks to the head all the while still dressed in her nightie) All in all with this movie you get what you expect,..a polished lady that brings down the bad guys while showing off her beauty. Now what could be wrong with that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you sure it isn't a comedy?

If you're not going to have a decent story, at least have some hot women take their clothes off. I mean, it just makes sense.

Instead of using 2-seven socket surge protectors(neither with all plugs fully occupied), I now use this 11 outlet. It is good because now everything is in one central location. It also comes with cables needed for your phone,a DSL slot and a cable slot if you need those.Unfortunately it really does nothing to cut your cord clutter.

It has 3 led's, one green that lets you know when it's turned on, one yellow that lets you know when there's an overload, and the coolest feature, one red to let you know that there's a problem with your internal wireing at the outlet. That's right, this will tell you if your outlet is properly grounded! Now this unit comes with telephone and cable jacks for surge protection, but if you use either dial-up or Cable internet it will kill your connection. I only suggest using the phone line for your actual phone, and the cable for your tv. The plug activated protectors is a great feature. Sure you have to push extra hard to get the plug in the socket, but it also helps provent dust and other unwanted items out of the plug sockets as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are going to use Coaxial cable protection, don't buy this one","review":"I bought this one for its coaxial cable protection function, but the result is terrible. It greatly degrades the signal. When I use it with TV, the program on TV became unclear.

One feature I particularly like but isn't described very will is the always-on outlets. These three outlets are surge protected and filtered just like all the others, but they do not turn off when you flip off the power switch. I plug my TiVo into this outlet so that I can turn off everything else with one switch when I go on vacation, but the TiVo stays on to record shows. The quality of the plug-strip itself feels very solid, but the coax and phone cable provided are cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product...","review":"Very nice product, I was initially worried about the size, seems to look a little large in the photo but once received I was pleasantly surprised as it is quiet compact. Seems like a quality unit for a very reasonable price.As most have mentioned, it is a little difficult to plug something into the the outlets but as others have also mentioned its typically used for long periods of time.

I've tried plenty of detangler and dematting combs, but couldn't find one that was easy to use (cats don't always stand still) and works fast. If I could have designed one myself, this would be it. It's small and fits well in your hand. The curved combs prevent jabbing the animal while they quickly and easily grab underneath the matt. Then as you pull, the inside blades safely and quickly slice the mat right out of the fur. It's fast and makes this chore SO much easier. The cat no longer minds the process.

The XPR takes a new kind of motor brush and no one carries it!

I sent it to the company, who replaced it for free, and just burned out the second one after using it probably two or three times. Most recently it was used to cut off a stripped screw, that's what killed it, a screw. Anyway, I'm very disappointed and would not recommend this tool, or really any other Dremel.

I had an older Dremel from about 1997 but sadly it was stolen from my shop. The basic design is flawed. The motor and switches get clogged and choked with dust and debris from everything I have tried to cut. The stop button to change the tips locks up. The on/off switch is so difficult to turn on and off I almost cut my hand off. I am saddened to see what has happened to the Dremel. Bosch seems to have taken a once great tool and ruined it. Same as they did for Skil. I am not trying to bash Dremel. I purchased the 3956-02 model and it works fantastic. Its just seems to be the 400-6 model. My recommendation is to skip this model and go for the less expensive Dremel 3956-02 model."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good tool for small jobs or hobbies","review":"Since I don't own a drill or reciprocating saw, I thought that this tool would replce those. I live in an apartment and need it only for small jobs. For the most part it had worked as a replacement for those. However, I still needed to buy quite a few parts not included in the kit - drill bits, blade for the saw, extra chucks. I realize that I'm not quite utilizing the tool for its intended use, but it has served my purposes. I've been fairly happy the few times I used it. Just note that the tool get very hot with extended use. Overall, this was a good package with the best variety of tool attachments, as for the bits themselves, they could have provided a better selection and slightly better instructions for their use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dremel XPR 400","review":"The XPR is a modest departure from the traditional Dremel Handle. Ergonomically, it may be a slight improvement, operationally I don't see a great diffence with the expception of the variable speed and the on/off switch being seperate, although I think some of the previous models have this feature as well. Dremel engineers tried a little too hard to make a compartmentalized \\"carry all\\" style tool box for this unit. I find it cumbersome, especially due to the difficulty in storing the power cord for the drill handle itself. All the little drawers are tedious to deal with. The \\"sabre saw\\" attachment works but I would rather use a conventional sabre saw. The Dremel really doesn't have the power to handle that kind of cutting. Overall a good product at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Classic Switch-a-Roo!!","review":"Be very careful!

They are just as sturdy with a non-flexible straw. The colors are very vibrant with matching tops and straws.The only suggestion I have is insert the straw AFTER you have placed liquid inside and capped it. Otherwise the liquid will squirt right out.The cups wash up really well in the dishwasher. The straws fall through my utensil container so i do have to hand wash those, but that is the only hassel.Overall the cups are great for toddlers. My daughter can drop it and as long as it does not land on the top side it rarely leaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take and never Toss!","review":"When my son started drinking liquids, he just didn't understand sippy cups. We tried lots of sippy cups, then I spotted these gems. He figured these out right away. Fast forward 2 years, we are still using some of the original cups. The lids stay on very tight, I've never had one open up unless the lid wasn't snapped on all the way. The straws fit very tightly, so it creates a vacuum, and very little if any spills as long as the cup is assembled properly. He went through a long phase of chewing the straws. I refuse to buy any new cups until the straw chewing phase ends. He seems to have stopped it, and his brother is just starting to drink, so I think we'll invest in some new ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"We bought the take and toss 5 pack with straws.

But this 5-pack is bad for a few reasons. First, the colored cups make it impossible to know what's in the cup: water, juice or milk? Second, the colors are actually pretty ugly.Finally, First Years annoyingly does not include a cup and cap in each of the five colors.My 5-pack contained:2 green cups2 blue cups1 yellow cup, 1 yellow top2 red tops2 orange topsIf you look closely at the product images and keep in mind that the five cups are on the bottom, with the five caps on top, you'll notice that they have the same problem: 2 cups in color A, 2 cups in color B, 1 cup and 1 top in color C, 2 tops in color D, and 2 tops in color E.It's just strange and lazy. Makes no sense at all. But even if you can get past this, just get the clear Take & Toss cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"These cups are useless. If your toddler needs a straw cup to prevent messy drinking, he or she is likely to throw it to the ground, at which time the lid pops off and beverage goes all over the floor, or turn it upside down, so the beverage spills all over your kid, or just take the lid off, which is easy to do, and -- you guessed it -- the beverage spills everywhere. Even for just drinking water, these are useless. I'm going to buy more of the Playtex Twist and Click straw cups. Those lids stay on, and they have some mechanism in the straw to prevent all the liquid from pouring out if the cup is turned upside down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect","review":"This is the only cup my 11 mo old will use. We've tried regular sippys, straw sippys, with handles, without handles, etc. He really only wants this one. The straw will leak if it gets turned upside down (it often does with my son) and if it is on the fuller side and gets dropped (Thrown) to the floor, the top can come off and spill. I guess I'll have to deal with those negatives being as this is the only one he will use! On the plus side, they are cheaper than other cups....walmart is cheaper than amazon...four cups for under four bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Frills but Great","review":"I use this cup for both my kids. Never tried sippy cups but I have tried other straw cups but the mechanisms that keep the liquid in them from being spilled is harder to wash and I feel like germs are in the little crevices that I cannot reach. These cups are great because they are simple. I wash the straws with the little brush that comes with the DR Brown's Bottles.The cup isn't spill proof so definitely be more attentive to the kids when they're using it or you'll have a mess!

Recognizing that a catastrophic astroid strkie on Earth is statistically likely, mankind begins to plan a response to save the planet. When the apocalyptic astroid is discovered, Captain Singh and his crew head out to meet it, in the hopes of giving it enough of a push to miss the Earth.With lots of emphasis on scientific details, and an interesting overview of the social and political structures of a multi-global society, this is science-fiction of a classic style. While Clarke does try to provide some character development for Captain Singh, this story is idea and plot driven, rather than character oriented. But for fans of hard science-fiction who like to contemplate \\"big\\" ideas, this book is packed with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hammered","review":"The plot has been overdone. The setting, characters, and mood are poorly developed. Arthur C. Clarke is unquestionably one of the best three or four authors in the science fiction genre, however, this book would not make the top 100 list of science fiction novels. I wish to take nothing away from Clarke's reputation, except that I don't think he was really trying when he wrote this uninspiring piece. As another reviewer has suggested, the lunar olympics was the best portion of the novel and it did not develop anything else in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Clarke's worst","review":"This reads like the notes for a novel, instead of the novel itself. Large type and lots of unnecessary \\"book sections\\" with long passages taken from other authors are filler for what should have been a short story. Clarke seems disorganized and scattershot in this book, tying together a lot of unrelated things to attempt to fill out a story. Anytime any bit of tension is built up he deflates it nearly immediately. The prose is particularly uninspired and in an absolutely bizarre instance he spends a chapter describing a signal from an alien intelligence, \\"proving the existence of extra-terrestrial intelligence\\" only to never mention it again. At many points he brings up interesting moral and ethical quandries to never address them, something Clarke would have never done in earlier work. Clarke never once engaged me for me than a page or two. This is the worst piece of writing I've ever read by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Change of Pace","review":"I loved this book! Clarke takes a different approach in Hammer of God, switching from technological forecasting to sociological brainstorming, and hits one out of the ballpark. His predictions are hilarious; Christianity and Islam merge into a single religion! On the surface his ideas seem absurd, but a quick glance at the front page of your daily newspaper suggests that Clarke's ideas might be closer to reality than one would like to think.The only thing about Hammer of God I didn't like was that it was too short! I know Earth will be saved, but Clarke creates such an interesting social panorama that I want to know more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Clarke's best effort","review":"I just read this thing, and I was very disappointed. He spends too much time on perdictions for the future, mundane minutia that takes up paragraphs at a time and slows the story to a frerakin' crawl. The thing jumps from the main character's old age to childhood to adulthood, with peripheral mentions of families he supposedly loves, but loses due to cicumstances that aren't really made clear, so you don't get a taste of his reaction. In short, you really never get to know the main character, you're just supposed to sit back and be in awe of Clarke's futuristic predictions, many of which are old news at this point. Pick one of hos other books, if you're gonna read Clarke."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for all students of French!","review":"This book is essential for any true student of French.

Sorry to say, I was very disappointed. John Wayne actually gives one of his finest performances in the service of a corny and poorly made film. The distraction of all the mistakes helped to ruin the film for me. There are so many, but for example: The search pilots can hardly see out of their windows because of all the ice, yet when the planes are shown from outside, there is no ice to be seen anywhere. Another? During a blizzard, the wind is howling and the snow is blasting down around them, but the limbs on the trees behind them are not even moving. There are so many others, I could make a list.The use of third party voice-over narration was corny even by 1950's standards. It was usually relegated to educational films shown in the public schools.This one was hardly worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Aviation Film with the Duke","review":"Shot back in the 1950s, Island in the Sky is a classic aviation film that stars John Wayne, and a host of other strong actors. The plot is pretty simple - crew runs out of fuel and is forced to land somewhere in Canada. Their comrads go looking for them, while the crew does their best to stay alive.While some of the action is pretty slow paced, the story wraps you in and keeps you hoping that the crew will be found. The Duke does a great job in his role as Dooley - the plane's captain.

The '64 European Tour at full strength, before Johnny Coles dropped out due to illness. Half-hour versions of Fables of Faubus and Meditations! Treatments of other songs that run past the ten minute mark. Nothing gets boring or repetitious.Everyone gets many chances to shine with long solos. Lots of tight unison playing, too. On Fables of Faubus, while one player solos, the others variously lay out, comp and play portions of the theme--all during the same solo! How they know when to come in and when to drop out, and manage to stay out of each other's way, is beyond me. Meditations has the most beautiful bowed bass and flute at the beginning and end. At times the bass seems to weep.Can't say enough about Dolphy. Genius. But that's not to say the others aren't stellar, as well. And Mingus--shouting out in joy, exhorting the others, making jokes, and some of the best bass playing, ever.Also recommended: Mingus At Antibes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent 2 disc live set from St. Patrick's Day 1964","review":"This was my first Charles Mingus album as I bought it more as a fan of Eric Dolphy. The first disc starts slow but then explodes in a series of 20 minute-plus jams. 'So Long Eric' is especially notable as Dolphy tragically died in Europe shortly after this tour. 'When Irish Eyes Are Smiling' is an enjoyable tribute to St. Patrick's Day. Good liner notes too.The sextet includes: Johnny Coles on trumpet, Eric Dolphy on alto sax, flute and bass clarinet, Clifford Jordan on tenor sax, Jaki Byard on piano, Charles Mingus on bass and Dannie Richmond on drums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good god.","review":"I have never heard music that was more filled with life than the music on here. The best of Mingus' studio records have the same effect - raw, hard, deeply entrenched in blues. But this recording is special - we get a rare glimpse of how Mingus was as a stage entertainer, cracking jokes with the audience and yelling out encouragement in the middle of someone's solo. It's simply an incredibly recording. The musicianship is unbelievable, and the music runs wildly out of control at times only to be reigned back in a second later. Jaki Byard is a maniac on the keys. Dolphy is his usual virtuosically insane self. The guys were all having FUN. Funness is occasionally forgotten about in the sombre face of jazz, but that's what it's all about.Get this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Was There,and What Memories It Brings Back","review":"I traveled by bus to Cornell from my college in Binghamton NY to attend this concert. I had been blown away by Mingus' records since 1961, and wouldn't have missed it for the world. I was the jazz disc jockey for my small college radio station. It is one of my most indelible memories of years of listening to jazz. I can't improve on the positive comments of the other reviewers of this CD, except to say AMEN. This is not the greatest Mingus recording. There are a dozen that equal it, but you cannot go wrong by getting this CD. One \\"Mingus story\\" I want to share is that half way through the concert, Mingus started to pound the pointed leg of his bass hard into the stage, saying the stage surface was slippery and his bass was slipping. I don't know if this tactic worked, but I'm sure the marks were in the stage for quite some time. In my opinion, I find this music superior to any of the recordings made by this group in Europe a month later."},{"rating":"2","title":"A scholarly treatment of world religions.","review":"The treatment of each tradition varies depending on the perspective of the various authors.

This book was very big on bed sharing. The book stated that you needed to be a good parent and practice parenting even during the night. The book was full of questions that parents had asked about getting their toddler to sleep in their own bed, well after Dr. Sears told the parent to let the child sleep in the parents bed when they were an infant, Dr. Sears told the parents to put a bed or futon in the parents room and develop a 'special sleeping area'.

He shows 14 drawings (each with a title and caption) to a man in the publishing business. Intrigued with what he sees he eagerly awaits the completed stories, only Burdick never comes back.It's kind of weird especially when you see the type of drawings he left behind, kind of spooky.

At 5 bucks a pop I was leery too, but it was save you that much in 1 winter with today's utility prices.

It was like I hot-glued my windows shut! I had to pry it off with sharp tools. The Dap brand pulls right off easily. It dries to a consistancy like the glue dots that seal up envelopes.

I had the basement exterior door open during installation, but obviously had to close it once night came. People who buy this are going to use it when it is cold outside. Not when it is 60 out and we can sleep with all the windows open in the house. The ability to open the windows totally negates the use of this product.There are many other solutions that are safer for your families health and are just as effective.

Even 12 hours after application fumes are still present. Any savings by sealing your windows will be lost by the amount of time your unsealed doors/windows need to be open to let out the fumes. If you think about it the product's instructions present a perfect oxy moron. You need to apply in a well ventilated area yet you are sealing the very windows that would allow for ventilation. It seems that the manufacturer could have developed the product a little further to eliminate the fumes and thus the need to open up your whole house for hours to get rid of them. I recommend using another product or method to seal your windows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for its purpose, but beware of harsh fumes","review":"I live in Colorado and purchased 8 bottles of seal n peel to seal the windows in my ancient rental house from drafts. The product itself is very easy to apply and fully dries in about a day. The seal is strong and holds, although it does shrink over the course of a week so I would advise putting about 25% more caulking on than you think you need to compensate for shrinkage. The sole reason this product isn't getting four stars is due to the fumes. I know the nature of caulking, but the smell emanating from the windows was pretty terrible. I actually decided to sleep out in the living room for a couple nights because I was so concerned that the fumes were toxic.

It simply can not keep up with that large of a space. However, in the confines of a vehicle, it was a godsend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked one time only, never again.

One longs for Donald Strachey's wit or Henry Rios's empathetic angst, something that would these characters more believable and identifiable. As it is, they're deadly dull. On top of that, the writing reminds one of a creative writing class reject in need of proofreading (early on, for instance, \\"homicide\\" is spelled \\"homocide\\" - an unintentional glitch or some copy editor's idea of a joke?)

Note that Tammy changes the lyrics to sing the woman's role from beyond the grave. I know there are a lot of people who don't like the standard song. Such people will dislike Tammy's version even more.Most of the above songs are well known and brilliantly performed, but the two obscure songs (Send me no roses and I'm not mine to give) are both well worth hearing.In Britain, this album was paired with Your good girl's gonna go bad, her debut album, on a single CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"TINY, CHEAPLY MADE, CAT CHOKED","review":"these were TINY and made out of very lightweight plastic. i gave one to my cat and in under a minute, she had chewed off the ball tip and was choking.

While Locher's over-arching conclusions are indeed forced and over-reaching (eg., comparing Kwakiutl solar mythology to the Ancient Egyptian Solar Bark, & proposing that serpent mythology forms a cohesive system between NWC tribes), the anecdotal data is priceless, and will serve as a map to seek the source material more easily (you could read thousands of pages of Boas texts to find the scant sisiutl references, or just look them up from Locher's footnotes & annotations).

Just the revelation of compassionate faith that he shared in his time is something today's christian leader and indeed lay-man, can glean from. As you read this account you'll notice that the title is an accurate description of this man's experiences with God. He strongly believed that compassion is essentially linked with faith, especially in the areas of healing and deliverance; an ingridient that today's Tommy Tenney calls a 'Highly developed sense of injustice about satanic oppression'. Adventures in God is a very compelling and small volume sure to leave the reader wanting more, so if you would like to know more, there are excellent other books on John Lake and his teachings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad, But....","review":"The book was very insightful, but you can't help but get the feeling that they are not telling you everything.

There are many other outstanding songs on the album (e.g. Play, Morning Star, Balcony, and Skysong), and not a weak song in the bunch.For those who were hoping for a repeat of Sleepyhead, my advice would be to approach this album on its own merits, otherwise you risk missing out on a gem of an album.Flunk, if you read these messages, please come and play in San Francisco some day, maybe at a club like Bimbo's - you have many fans here!

I compared his bike to about a dozen others in the neighborhood when the kids were all riding around and it would not have fit on any of the 20 inch bikes I saw. The kickstand was at least 2 inches too short so the bike just falls over. I held it up to a 16 inch bike and it would have been perfect. I believe they sent the incorrect size but there is no packaging so no way to tell. It would be very nice if there were dimensions included. It's not like that would be a hard thing to produce. They are a certain length, just tell us which one is which length. Because they don't provide this information I have no way to know if the kickstand just doesn't fit any of these bikes or if I received the wrong one.On the plus side, it seems well built."},{"rating":"2","title":"16 inch kickstand fits Kettler 16\\" Bingo OK","review":"I was very impressed with the sturdiness.And it came with an optional fitting to enable an alternative mounting. In my case it fit robustly either way.The 16 inch kickstand was a little shorter than ideal for the Kettler 16\\" Bingo. It works OK on concrete or in our shed, but I suspect it wouldn't be satisfactory on a soft surface like dirt.The foot design doesn't permit one to buy a larger size and cut it to optimum length. That's the only reason I don't give it 5 stars.The instructions suggested greasing it after installation, but no grease was supplied; not a problem for me, but your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"This is a pretty heavy duty kickstand for the money.

The last time I perused it, the spiritual depth and insightfulness overcame me with awe. God used Mrs. Prentiss amazingly in this book, as I believe any open-hearted woman or girl can find themselves within its pages. Though there are a few passages in the book that I have never read because of their dryness, overall it is a surprisingly interesting read and Katy is an engaging narrator. Despite the fact that Katy is older than I am and lived in a different culture, the focus of the book is her walk with God, which spans all times, cultures, and ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"This book is a MUST READ!

I have also bought unpteen copies to use as gifts for Christian friends, particuarly teen-aged girls. Why? Sometimes it is so difficult to see spiritual growth in our own lives, while those around us are saying, \\"Wow, that girl is really growing spiritually!\\" It is this concept that is so beautifully expressed in this book. The central character is really discouraged, feeling she's not progressing at all. But those around her see her love, caring, and spiritual empathy. It's a great book. I really love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing","review":"Stepping Heavenward is a wonderful story of a teenage girl who chronicals her life and growing faith. The young woman admits her faults and shortcomings readily to her journal and records her continual struggles to overcome. Coming to terms with all that she feels that God wants from her; she then reveals not only her own inward struggles but shares the struggles of fellow friends and believers as well. She realistically records her inward thoughts, grievances, and challenges and recognizes in the end that the soverign hand of God was indeed best for her inspite of her own preconceived notions and desires.

But in reading this book, I realized that what I am doing is perfectly OK! As a matter-of-fact, my family has decided that we would leave our family planning to God! Mary Pride has truly re-enforced the concept of back to the basics in living your life as a traditional mother and father. The world is filled with anti-child thinking (ex: family planning, children are incovenient etc.) She really has helped open our eyes on the truth about family life. We are now homeschooling our children, and seriously looking into home birthing our next child(ren)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clarion Call for Biblical Thinking","review":"What a tremendous book for any serious minded Christian, who wants to order his family along biblical lines.

I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and Full of Good Sense","review":"This book was excellent. It was full of good sense and it was very uplifting. It praised large families, yet made childless people realize that they had something to offer others too.I agree with the author that you should have as many children as God would bless you with. Our economy is in trouble today because we don't have enough people to do all the jobs that are available. Also, having babies at home is the SAFEST place to have them. Hospitals are full of germs and the policies they enact are not usually for the baby's or mother's benefit. For this reason among many, Mary is right to recommend homebirth.Many people may not be ready to listen to Mary Pride. But the world would be a better place if they did.

For example, on infertility due to a past abortion: \\"These people were just not meant by God to have children, for reasons that should be obvious.\\" Later on in the book she goes to the doctor with her perfectly behaved children and revels in the compliments she receives.

The sound quality is excellent. Unless your a super-geek who needs a 500 dollar system to feel good about themselves, you will love this system. The bass is EXTREMELY powerful, and makes for a full sound. The speakers themselves have great sound quality. They also don't look like missile silos (as the Logitech X-530- does).On the back of the speakers is a place to put a screws head in to hang it, if your interested in that.The controller is great, you can adjust the bass, the overall volume, and even turn the system off. There is also a headphone input for private listening.The only bad part about this system is the cord lengths (but because this doesn't affect the actual performance i don't' care much). You can just go to radio shack and buy a $5 cord extension for this and your set, no biggie."},{"rating":"2","title":"retro for me","review":"if not just to look at the development of the corporate identity of various well known companies (and some that haven't changed!) then you surely need this book just for your retro-fixation... i know i did anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference Book for Logos","review":"This is a large book, jam packed with really great logos.

But it did, in fact, it exceeded them. I loved every page just as much. It was every bit as good as Sloppy Firsts, with added characters and situations to make it unique. The dialouge, commentary, and pacing remained just as perfect. Rarely is a sequel written that is just as good as the first book, but Second Helpings is one of the rare exceptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"After the wonderful Sloppy Firsts, we were left yearning for our own Marcus Flutie, craving for him and Jessica Darling to be together. With this sequel, Megan McCafferty most certainly has not developed Sequel Syndrome. If possible, the sequel is even better then its predecessor. Second Helpings is incredibly witty, often times spurring bouts of laughter. McCafferty perfectly captures the essence of a brilliant teenager, like Jessica. The entire novel is indescribable. As close as I can get is simply this: phenomenal. The ending is pleasing, leaving you wondering, but satisfied. McCafferty has hit the jackpot with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"I hated to read before I read the prequel Sloppy Firsts and this book Second Helpings.

Read this book if you haven't already"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"This book is full of halarious, witty, and at times (ok well, all the time) cynical comments. This is the second instalment of the journal of Jessica Darling. Readers of Sloppy First will love Second Helping as much, if not more than, Sloppy First. Many speak negativly of sequels to wonderful works but this sequel is magnificent. All of our favorite caracters from SF are brought back including the mysterious bad-boy Marcus. It's like someone has stepped inside my own brain and just had the courage to write all of my thoughts down on paper. This is like the teenage bible to live by. I wish I could be like Jessica just a little bit more, to have her brains and wit. Lovers of SF will not be dissapointed!

Jessica, in the time since we'd left her has become even more cynical (excellent!) about her high school life, and more scathing about her classmates.

I am so into reading books about teenagers trying to deal with high school, boys, ect. Because that's exactly what I am doing. Anyone doing the same, I would suggest this book.

I adored the first book and love this one even more. . .I've read it four times and I've only had it for a week!Ms. McCafferty creates a cast of characters that are all dear to your heart. Besides Jessica, you have Bridget, Pepe, and Gladdie-characters I love; Manda, Sara, Scotty--characters I hate but still love just because they're so real. Everyone was fleshed out more, and you find yourself completely absorbed in the world of Pineville.Jessica's sarcastic but dead-on commentary of high school life was just my style. I loved her to death, but when she kept shoving Marcus away, I found myself inwardly screaming at her, \\"You're so stupid!\\" Then, of course, I have to think, \\"Kara, it's just a book.\\"It was more than a book, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"I absolutely adore the Jessica Darling books.

As much as I anticipated the novel, I was scared that the second book may not live up to the expectations I had built up after enjoying \\"Sloppy Firsts\\". I should have known better than to doubt Megan McCafferty's abilities because \\"Second Helpings\\" is a knock-out sequel! It lived up to all of my expectations and then some. If you enjoyed \\"Sloppy Firsts\\", you will definitely not be disappointed in \\"Second Helpings\\". It is a wonderful follow-up. Jessica Darling is as hilarious, witty, and sarcastic as ever, while still being true-to-life and extremely easy to relate to. An awesome book for any teenage struggling to figure out who you are and what comes next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charmingly inept","review":"As funny and well-paced these novels are, I can't help but compare them to Curtis Sittenfeld's Prep. The protagonist of McCafferty's novels is shallow, superficial and immodest. It makes me cringe to think that teenagers would consider her a role model. On the other hand, Prep's leading character is honestly struggling to find herself through high school and goes through some truly believeable and honest and relatable experiences. Maybe I am old fashioned at the age of 25, but I would've liked to see Jessica Darling treat sex as something other than a purely phyiscal \\"right\\" of which it would be shameful to have not obtained by the ripe old age of 17. These novels contribute to the sad truth that society and media put too much pressure on young girls to look a certain way and have sex when you are still a kid. Of course people evolve as time and culture evolve, but you would think that maybe writers today would encourage upholding morals and dignity.... oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!","review":"this is the greatest book ever, while reading this book you really connect with jessica - as though you are looking at the world through her eyes .. i recommend this book to EVERYONE .. even if you don't like reading -- believe me this book will change your mind.

Read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as I suspected..","review":"This book was great. I think the author, Megan McCafferty, is about the best writer I have ever seen. The most intriguing (but pretty predictable ending) conflict in this book is with Marcus. She goes back and forth..Jessica also starts to be independent, and is sick of making her parents happy doing something she doesn't want to..Parties, parties, parties..She also gets sick of her \\"friends\\". Well I don't want to give away too much, Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIFIC!!!!","review":"Great book! better than the first one (sloppy firsts) it actually made me laugh out loud. that doesn't happen too often. you'll want to read it to know what happens to jessica. you'll wish there really was a macus flootie. ya gotta read it , or you'll miss out. i hope there is a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Helpings-a great treat","review":"I adored sloppy firsts and found myself reading it over and over again. i know i will do the same thing with Second helpings. Jessica is a senior and her adventures are even more interesting, fun, embarassing, and everything in between. I am a sucker for sappy, predictable endings, like the one in second helpings. The book was so interesting, that i could not put it down for one minute. The ending was predictable and very unrealistic, but thats the way i like them-as most people do. i had a great time reading it. sloppy firsts and second helpings portray such real feelings and Megan McCafferty makes it easy to relate to jessica. reasing these books make me feel like my social problems arent that bad. i praise sloppy firsts, second helpings, and especially megan mccafferty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Book for a Senior Girl","review":"The second book in the series, this novel caught my attention from the first diary entry. I immediately related to Jessica Darling, and felt her pain. She shares her feelings on the difficult decisions a senior girl has to make. Her trials and tribulations about boys, school, sleep, drama, and colleges makes the reader feel very lucky they are not dealing with her high school. The problems Jessica has with her parents, older sister, and her best friend that moved away gives every reader something to relate to. I could not put this book down because you, the reader, becomes part of the book. I wanted to help Jessica, and I wanted her to hook up with Marcus, as though I was Jessica Darling. It takes a very talented writer to capture the reader to this extreme point, and I believe that Megan Mccafferty has achieved this wonderfully. Every senior girl with any type of stress or concerns should read this book, it will bring a smile to your face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me. Yes. Me","review":"This book is totally awesome. I'm 18 years old and I loved this book. After reading the first book: Sloppy Seconds- I had to get my hands on this one- and I enjoyed it even more!! Jessica's life is the complete same as a regular teenager- heartbreak, sex, friends, family, death, birth. And I really enjoyed her sarcastic thoughts- they weren't annoying at all. I was literally laughing out loud. I cannot wait until the third book. Anyone who has an interest in this book, definately take the chance and read it. I wasn't able to put these 2 books down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Helpings is not enough!!","review":"When I first picked up Second Helpings in my bookstore, I didn't think it could even compare to Sloppy Firsts. Was I ever wrong. From the first page of Sloppy Firsts I became completey immersed in Jessica Darling's world. And when I began to read Second Helpings, the inside view on Jessica's life came back. I felt like she was a friend that had just moved away (much like her best friend, Hope) and she had come back to visit and give me the latest scoop on her life. I hope that there will be some thirds to this series because second helpings made me longing for more!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"this item was perfect easy to install and better than buying the whole external dvd rom drive.

They have a comfortable relaxed fit that hits a little above the knee, but not so long that it interferes with climbing ladders, crawling under the truck or attending a Hank Williams III concert. The heavy weight cotton stands up to the most humid summer day in my favorite urban heat island, Richmond, Virginia, without turning into a mass of wrinkles. These shorts are close to indestructable. Typically, I will only toss them out when there is more paint than fabric showing. I have never ripped or split a pair.

They are a bit thick and may not breathe well in the summer, but they seem like they'll last forever. Really handy pocket placements abound and the fit was just right.

The problem is that the planer is only designed to be used in one direction. If you can't use it in the direction they want you to, you are out of luck. Also, you can't change the depth of the cut, so if you don't want that deep or shallow of a cut, you are out of luck there too.I ended up using the planing bit without the casing, and had better luck doing it that way, but it wasn't perfect like I was hoping the kit would be able to provide.I would have given it only one star except that I was able to use the planing bit alone for what I needed.

By the 3rd door the motor was sounding rough. The motor burned up the next day using it with a cut off wheel. This attachment makes the unit get realllly hot. The tool is turning a really large blade compared to anything else you turn with it. To top that off with the end of the blade isnt supported by anything it just fits in a hole and rides metal on metal. Dremel says the blade is designed to last as long as the attachement 500 BF. I did about 200 and its pretty much ground off (Very old Pine).I think if you keep the motor well blown out. Dont over tax it and plane a fair amount of 3/4 or less wide your good to go.

Next watch will be one that is really waterproof since my daughter is a swimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great child sized watch","review":"The watch is perfect size for my four year old. There is plenty of strap for a larger child as we had to cut the excess with scissors. The elastic does not have to tight on the child's wrist to stay on.

I wear it constantly as I am always playing in water, dirt, etc. and certainly don't want to wear an expensive watch while playing with a 3 year old.

He has small wrists, so I was pleased to see this watch adjusted to fit perfectly! The band is so soft that my son wears the watch constantly! He loves the little lizard that goes around the face.

He can tell time easily on this watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cute","review":"I purchased this for my 2 year old niece who always wants to wear our watches. It's a very cute watch, the lizards move across the face like a second hand. The band is elastic, so once it's fitted for a small wrist you can just pull it off without re-sizing.

Even trying to remove the screws to investigate the problem is a failure because you can't back out whatever type of chincy screw they used to put it together with. Batteries had plenty of power, but it would not pump out the fluid. Followed instructions as directed. Has anyone had any better luck with the sprayer attachment?

It contains alcohol which not only damages some furniture surfaces (namely wood floors), but also causes the product to evaporate more quickly thus making the effective time on the stained area shorter.

I blocked off the area and let it dry. No go (no pun intended.) The urine smell was still there. The blacklight still shows the area where he urinated. I tried it 2 more times with the same dismal results. Don't waste your money on this useless product! I've contacted NM to let them know this. Gee, they have a new, Advanced product.

Too bad Rock has moved so far down the chain of popularity that nobody probably has heard of Fireball Ministry. I never heard of these guys but caught an older video on Fuse (\\"King\\") and was impressed. I picked up a couple of their CD's on Amazon.If you like bands like classic hard rock bands like ACDC, Van Halen, Priest, and Dokken and more modern Hard Rock bands like Stone Sour, 3 Days Grace, Atreyu and even a little more poppier rock like Foo Fighters and Nickleback, I do not think you will be disappointed.2nd Coming is also pretty good, \\"King\\" is a classic.

Having lived in a Muslim country myself for over 15 years, it became quite apparent that Goodwin did not direct this book towards anybody with personal experience with and foundational knowledge of Muslim culture, either in theory or in practice. Rather, she seems quite intent on stirring up the most childish and irrational of human desires in ignorant Americans to attack a very cleverly engineered Hollywood fantasy of \\"oppressed women in a land of radical, Islamic fundamentalism.\\" Considering the movement in most Muslim countries to abandon their heritage in exchange for Western modernism (this being nightclubs, satellite t.v., McDonald's, and hip hop clothing), such a gross misrepresentation of reality is symptomatic itself of fanatic, cultic irrationality.

Only Arab Muslims were interviewed. While they may be \\"the original\\" Muslims, they are not the is all and be all; indeed they do not even constitute the majority of the worlds' Muslims. As such, there is a sampling error, and thus a biased representation of the religion.2. Only the fundamentalist movements are considered. While these may be the noisiest (and most noisome) movements afoot in Islam, they are obviously not the only ones...how else then would one account for the explosion of converts in teh last decade?Overall, although a bit simplistic, I think Ms Goodwin managed to display the diversity of Muslims and how we perceive our faith, without resorting to pandering, or onesidedness.

LOL Is this supposed to taken as non-fiction? Or is it Fiction? I don't know WHO this author hung around with but it sure has nothing to do with ISLAM as the rest of us know it. Maybe this was just some figment of someones imagination? I for one certainly demand proof in books I read that claim to be true. Anything that can't be proved is therefore nonsense. Too bad writers with grudges or writers that just want to make money from their imaginations off people who WANT books this hyped up to excite them in some perverse way, or writers that don't really know their subject and assume no one else does either or writers that are just plain uneducated in their craft don't really learn what honesty, truth and journalistic integrity really is.

It is amazing how writers will make the people that are looking for horrible things to actually believe them, but that's the key isn't it? This book will gratify the kinds of people that WANT to think these things are true. If you want to read the truth about Islam and the lifestyle then maybe you should write one of the embassies and get REAL information. I called the Saudi embassy in Washington D.C. and they were gracious to send dozens of pamphlets, brochures etc. that tell the truth. If you want the truth, go find it...but you won't find it here in these silly, silly, silly, writer's imaginations. Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha.

Jan Goodwinprovides in an engaging, superbly reported lookat the present-day treatment of women incountries still bound by the strictures ofmedieval Islamic law. Though the book was writtenin 1995, and updated after 9/11, its relevancehas never been greater than it is today as westruggle to understand the increasingly dangerousworld we live in.

When I openned the package at home I discovered that while they are supposed to be 30\\"x30\\" they are really smaller than that. Too small to use for my intended purpose. I have not washed them yet so I don't know if they shrink or how they hold up. They seem a little thinner than other receiving blankets that I have used with my 3 older children.Here I am 1 year later. The blankets have held up in the wash very well and become softer with each washing. Although I did not use them for swaddling, I used a similar set of flannel blankets. The thinness that I complained about actually is a benefit when you are swaddling a baby in hotter weather. A too thick blanket leaves you with a hot and sweaty baby. I didn't swaddle my older kids (it wasn't in vogue 12 years ago), so I didn't know. The only way we got this one to sleep was to swaddle him very tightly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Chaplin Slowdown","review":"Compiled, scored and narrated by Charlie Chaplin in 1958, \\"The Chaplin Revue\\" was a terrific idea to showcase three of the comedian's best films for First National: \\"A Dog's Life\\" (1918), \\"Shoulder Arms\\" (1918) and \\"The Pilgrim\\" (1923). Unfortunately, Chaplin tampered with these particular films by presenting them at a slower projection speed, which ruins the original comic timing and pacing. As a public service, avoid \\"The Chaplin Revue\\" and locate the out-of-print \\"First National Collection\\" on DVD. This excellent disc includes most of Chaplin's 1918-23 work at the proper projection speed. The difference is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steal of a Deal","review":"Being a Chaplin fan, I own all of his movies except the Keystone days. I purchased this because the now defunct First National Collection is 9 (used) to 30 times more expensive than this collection, and doesn't include \\"A Dog's Life\\". I figured at worst, I would get a copy of \\"A Dog's Life\\" out of the deal. Other than the 2 discs being mismarked (switched) for content, I found absolutely nothing wrong with this collection as far as watchability due to the film speed, mentioned in other reviews.

I would recommend this product without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Routine Chaplin shorts - which makes them better than most other silent shorts","review":"Shoulder Arms:The trenches of WWI through the imagination of an Army recruit - and with an anti-war message at the end.

However, this offering from Pakelika does not come close to the high level of quality I expected.

It's not a historically precise piece, and it's not going to win a Nobel prize for fine literature.

A friend who had read both O'Brian's books and the Requiem Shark, bought this book for me and while the style is very different from the old master's, it is every bit as good. Griffin takes as his subject a young man, around 19, who makes one mistake (stepping aboard the wrong vessel) and then follows him closely during the next three years as his character is transformed by those about him. I know it sounds a bit like Lord Jim but Griffin is crueller than most, pushing his heroes and antiheroes through a miserable life on the seas that had me transfixed. There is also a character aboard called Innocent, who has concocted his own religion out of Greek myths and the bible that seems to emphasise the power of stories themselves.

I had no idea of what was going to be found here, but essentially what you get here is a lot of generic dance music, and good luck if you can distinguish one song from another. Gets tiresome after about 20 minutes, and let us face it: there is no Chic without Tony Thompson, the original ladies and keyboardist-violinists from the 70's. Drums here sound like banging on a cereal box, and the singers...well, listen to the demo available in Amazon for this record, maybe you can save some bucks. My respects to Nile Rodgers, but there are some times when you must know when to lay to rest a good band's name, and start another if you want to keep making music.

Right-side-up, Up-side-down, sideways ... you name it ... I shook it as hard as I could and couldn't get it to skip once. Not too shabby. The sound is pretty good, not incredible.

My final analyse is that if you look at the series as only a work of fiction it might be an interesting read but since it uses actual historical events and portends to assume they way actual people (ie Grant and Lee) would have acted if the situation had been different, in my opinion its pure rubbish. The first book about Gettysburg is easily the best of the three since it is closer to the actual events and follows a course of action the participants did consider. The second and third books arer pure fiction and should be considered in that light. I think that all three books are weak in the sense they show a poor understanding of the mindset of both Grant and Lee.

I soon began reading Turtledove and Stirling. Then two plus years ago I read Gettysburg by Gingrich and Forstchen. It was great!The final book in the series bring everything together. The authors keep the story fast paced, but informative. Some things remain the same, others differ. I thought the addition of Custer in the storyline was great. As Turtledove fans know Custer plays largely in his Great War series.Another critic pointed out that the story is biased toward the North. I will grant that with the exception of General Lee. However, one gets so caught up in the characters and the story that this is hardly noticable.I would love to see more from these authors - a 1945 follow-up or even a follow-up to this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The Third book in a series.

This is probably my favorite disc by them. It's classic Crass-influenced Anarchy punk that is still pretty listenable. The songlist is great ranging from slow to maniacly fast songs.In a time when punk was looked at as a past phase, Conflict came and shocked everyone again. Aside from being banned from past of England, their music had brutal messages about war, tyranny, and the system. The first time you hear these guys, you won't be too sure about them, but after listening to it abunch of times, you'll scream \\"Conflict f**king rules\\"!!!However, this is not for the new to punk or the anarchy scene. Before you buy this album you should get \\"Christ the Album\\" by Crass, so you can get used to the difference in music. This is a true musical gem, and I think every self-respecting punk should own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lady Queen Anne","review":"In the biography of Lady Queen Anne, by Margaret Hodges, she describes the life of Lady Queen Anne so well that it made me feels that I was in the same area wherever the scene may be. This is what I enjoyed most. The whole story was well depicted. Most of all however it was the life of Queen Anne and her morals, values, and compassion that made me want to never put the book down.Though the story makes the reader realize that money and wealth aren't everything. Friendship and family values are more important, and the overall lesson is about self-respect. Any reader who enjoys learning about others' trials and triumphs would really enjoy this book. Even readers who like learning about other culture's figures and role models would also enjoy this biography greatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this company (Bargaincell)!","review":"Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline.

I instantly fell in love with the melodic sometimes a bit experimental sounds of this music.

It's hard to take the authors' recommendations seriously when they also endorse their own cookbooks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More sales pitch than serious analysis","review":"This book is heavily slanted towards books that appeared in the last year or so. Some haven't even been published yet--which makes me suspect that one of the authors is plugging books which s/he edited and will profit by.Most of the information in this book can be gleaned for free from catalogs like *Jessica's Biscuit.* What's most disappointing about it is the bland prose and uninspired selections. I had hoped to learn about unknown gems or at least find new appreciation for some of my own favorites. No such luck with this p.r. approach to cook book criticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved reading during pregnancy.","review":"I enjoyed reading this book during pregnancy.

Never have been nor will be pregnant, been curious about the experience though, and this book brought me closer to all those women I have known who have borne children. So crystal clear I can still hear the widening circles of sound from the rim.

I've lent my copy to all my friends in town, and bought extra copies for my out-of-town friends. This book though, was not the same. I still like this author, and will continue to read her work, but I was a bit let down by this piece. Granted, I was expecting a lot, because I just had my first baby at a later age, and was hoping to identify with this character. However, the language was so broken that I had a hard time finding a flow. Two and three word sentences I found grating after awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Love","review":"I just finished this book and LOVED IT.

The Zygote Chronicles is equally funny but the biting wit is tempered by the growing sense of falling totally absolutely in love with this little person she's yet to meet. Ties with my long-term favorite on mothering by Anne Lamott, Operating Instructions. If you're a mom (particularly a 35+ mom) with a sense of humor about the ridiculous expectations of the classic (and useful) \\"What to Expect\\" series, you'll appreciate these books. If you're not a mother yet, you may get a kick out of the humor (I'm an advertising agency owner so the career sections were hysterical for me).If you're enaged, married, thinking you might someday marry, read her first book, Otherwise Engaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Zygote Chronicles","review":"A cute book to read if you are pregnant, have been pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant.

This was the second book of Suzanne Finnamore's that I have read. I so enjoy Suzanne's writing style, as she is funny, candid, witty, empowered, and I can relate to her. \\"Zygote Chronicles\\" is both heart warming and hilarious as a mother-to-be processes this \\"condition\\" that she is going through.....pregnancy! I am sure many mothers will be able to identify with her loving odes to her not yet born fetus. I also appreciated this novel as I am 41 and I hope to be a mother one day, as well. I just received Suzanne's third book, \\"Split,\\" which I can't wait to crack open! Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a collection of GOOD short films!","review":"Short films inherently have a major problem - they can't make money. When done right, they can cost a fair amount, and there is absolutely NO outlet - so they are basically an expensive resume for filmmakers. But that doesn't mean they can't be great - so finally here is a disc jam-packed with great shorts that otherwise you won't be able to see, unless you are lucky enough to attend a film festival that has the good taste to showcase them.So, thanks Toofy!

I admit that there is no misinformation on the description of the product but I was looking for a 3.5mm male adapter to use with a digital pc speaker system. This would not work because it is a fiber not a digital coax which is needed. Yes, it works with most Apple 3.5mm connections because they support Mini Toslink (fiber and digital coax support).

The Times reviewer who called it \\"hip and culturally savvy\\" may have been revealing his own squareness -- I wouldn't say there's much truly countercultural about this book -- but it does cover everything from used record stores to gay bars, so it's not entirely stodgy, either.

Their shows are nuts, inducing the crowd to go ape for a couple hours, and their energy is captured on the album. The best songs are Lucky Lipstick, Chinese Moon, Olympia, Saturday Night, Neon Commando, Bim Bam Boom, and Panorama.

This stuff pales in comparison to the Coppertone I was using. I got burned in the same amount of time I usually spend in the sun, applied as directed, where I wouldn't have if I had been using the Coppertone like usual. There's the proof.Also, it REALLY burned my eyes, and yes, I waited over 1/2 hour for it to dry just to be sure. It's extremely runny and greasy, too, so my goggles kept slipping off my face.FINAL NOTE: Be aware that the amount of product you are getting is only 4.4oz.

At first I found it actively gross, especially on my legs (they stick together whenever I sit down...it's just...ew). It also makes my skin very shiny.Ultimately though? I'm going to pick sun protection over comfort and attractiveness. This is one of the few sunscreens that has been proven to actually provide the SPF it claims it has, it's broad spectrum, and it doesn't have creepy carcinogenic chemicals in it. It's more comfortable to use on my face, because once it's dried a bit I can put matte powder on top and it looks/feels fine (I don't make enough money to cover my entire body in makeup several times a day though.)

Well, that's not entirely true -- we keep it in the bathroom and thumb through it when we're stranded and desperate for anything to read.It's got a lot of completely unnecessary photographs and very little text, and told me absolutely nothing I needed to know and/or didn't already know. I can see the author made quite an effort, but this is really little more than a picture book. At sixteen, my daughter turned up her nose at this book; she thought it was a hygiene text for junior high students. That might be one use for it. I can think of little other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the facts, mam!","review":"Stoppard's brief mention of surrogate motherhood looks like it was gleamed from tabloid tv shows and news clips. The negative portrayal goes so far as to conclude (erroneously) that one way surrogates may become pregnant is by having sex with the biological fathers! Readers who want accurate, helpful information about surrogacy or other alternative reproductive options won't want to waste their money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice book on pregnancy","review":"Dr. Stoppard's book comes from the Dorling Kindersley publishing house, which can be relied on for being correct and uncontroversial, and above all, very nice. All the women are beautiful, all the babies are washed, and there are no really graphic photos anywhere. There are lots of quotes from real people, and they are all fairly positive and upbeat. If your main concern is to have a happy pregnancy without any worries, and with enough guidance to see you and your baby through safely, then this is a good book for you.Of course, some people actually like seeing what birth looks like, and appreciate books that deal with some of the more controversial aspects of motherhood head on. To be fair, this book deals with a fairly important one - episiotomy - in a very helpful way. There is even a two page article about a single mother. But overall it presents a very clean and simple approach to motherhood which some people might find unreal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Edition","review":"I was willing to cut the kindle book some slack because Spanish editions are never very well formatted, but this went too far. Entire sections of dialogue are missing, the formatting is terrible, and the few line numbers popped up at random points in the middle of a text block. It was very difficult to guess who was talking. I recommend searching for the PDF and getting it for free that way.

It's a grindhouse picture, pure and simple. It's not meant to be perfect, which is actually part of the appeal of the film. Personally, I felt the performances were quite good. Michael Biehn was great and I see more directing in his future. It's great fun to see Danielle Harris playing an adult considering she's 35 years old and still almost always gets cast as a teenager or a college student. All in all, you get what you pay for here: a sleazy good time. Previous reviewers on here are obviously not familiar with Michael Biehn or Danielle Harris' previous work if they were expecting any more than that. Not for everybody but it's worth a watch for horror fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate you","review":"one of the worst movies i have seen in a while.

What is this, Manos: The Hands of Fate? Brain-dead dialogue. Half the scenes go on entirely too long. The blame falls squarely on writer/director/star/hero/villain Michael Biehn (not editor Vance Crofoot, who we're treated to at the end of the film, along with the craft service girl). Just a hunch. Biehn plays Kyle, some guy staying in a cabin in the woods. The unexpected Annie shows up at the door, insisting two men are after her. Lucky for Kyle, young and beautiful Annie \\"always had a thing for older men.\\" So we're treated to an extended, out-of-thin-air sex scene with our 54-year old star. One of the worst movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I use to be a huge Michael Biehn fan. Even met him a few times. But it seems like all he is acting in now is garbage. This movie really lacked. They used some actors who were terrible. An executive producer took on a main role. He should stick to producing. I really think Michael has gone back to drinking. His appearance looks gaunt and his acting skills have diminished. He is not the actor he was in K-2 or Tombstone and abyss. He's not the same actor. He wrote and directed this film. Storyline was amatuer. Not worth seeing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Biehn, what are you thinking?","review":"I just finished watching this, and there are problems with continuity, and just plain common sense.

This is a big help for audiobooks. And it doesn't skip even on bumpy roads.However, about three or four months after I got it, it started giving an F 15 error message and the CDs wouldn't play. The manual does not mention this problem. I've tried all kinds of different workarounds, which sometimes work and sometimes don't. Sometimes taking the batteries out and putting them back in helps. Sometimes switching from batteries to the adapter works. Sometimes switching CDs works. But often it just stops and won't play again no matter what I do.

She contacted Panasonic who could not figure out the problem and had her send it to them for repair. She got it back, and it still didn't play tracks in order. Then I discovered that for some odd reason, this player will only play MP3 tracks in the correct order if they are named properly, example, 001.mp3, 002.mp3, etc. Seems odd that Panasonic employees couldn't figure this out. I use Roxio to burn disks and I cannot name tracks in this way.

We owned one for our first son, now 5 1/2, and made the mistake of loaning it to some inconsiderate people who never returned it. When I was pregnant with our second son, I mentioned to someone that I missed my hook-on high chair and this well-meaning friend bought me a different brand (Chicco). After using the Chicco seat a single time, we said never again and immediately ordered this Graco model that we had previously owned. The Graco Travel Lite is sturdy, convenient, easy to wipe clean, and simple to clip to the table. It also folds flat and is easy to carry, even with a baby and diaper bag. It also includes a removable tray, which the Chicco version does not. We keep ours in the trunk of the car for eating out (no more filthy restaurant high chairs!).

It has synopses of all 39 episodes, a little bit of trivia, a good deal of biographical information, and scores of great photographs. Donna McCrohan has written this book with authority, diligent research, and not a little bit of nostalgia--but that's quite alright.

A young writers jaunts through the streets of a great capital, always on the verge of despair but always able to pull himself up at the last minute, either through sheer self-confidence or a lucky turn in his fortune, gives one a sense that even at our worst moments we may still triumph.

From nearly everything I have read about Hamsun and his body of work, HUNGER is remembered as his greatest achievement. I now know why. With its endlessly psychological prose and a strange and intriguing narrator, it's almost impossible to not be affected in some way by HUNGER.Admittedly, much of the novel is strange. It is sometimes difficult to relate to the main character as he insists on maintaining his honor as he struggles against the decimating effects of starvation. Nevertheless, his madness and the events that result from it are so interesting that it's nearly impossible to put the book down. The more I read Hamsun, the more I realize the power of simple and sharp prose. Hamsun, like Hemingway, doesn't linger on the details; rather, he perceives life as the human mind often does: in strings of sometimes rational and sometimes irrational thoughts and feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an amazing book...","review":"I just finished the Lyngstad translation of Hunger and was overcome. This is truly a must read for anyone who enjoys Kafka or Nabokov. It is timeless story, and one that hit close to home.

Only when I finished the book did I have to admit that this simply pales in comparison to his other works. The premise and characters were so much more simplistic than what I had come to expect from Banks. The characters plod along between adventures, occasionally dying, without contributing much to a theme or overall mood..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, depressing end.","review":"First the positive things: If you like sci-fi with a chaotic dark future setting, you'll like this book. And if you're into RPGing, you'll discover typical situations which Sharrow's 'team' encounters in this sci-fi road movie/novel.But in the end, the book left me kinda hollow, if not depressed. Almost all the major characters are dead, quite some questions are left open, and if you pay close attention, there are more than a few events/developments which are at best questionable (i.e. if I didnt miss something, Girmeyn cant be older than 15(!) if he really is what Geis claimed him to be).Of course, Banks had to make his point, how the Lazy Gun and his main character are linked together (I dont wanna tell too much for those ppl who havent read this book yet), but I'm repeating myself - too many deaths dont leave much room to cheer about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I suspect, this is not by Banks actually...","review":"As I said in title, this doesn't look like the rest of Banks's books. I really do admire almost every one of his books, but this one (as well as Inversions) is terrible.Looks like some other writer (still studying in some basic educational facility) tried to mimic Banks's style, but with no success at all.Characters are flat like heroes from some bad anime, the world of the book is a total mess, no logic, no sense, no nothing.What I suppose was done is that Banks had outsourced the book to somebody just to earn money. Mr. Banks, this is a bad practice, people's trust is harder to earn and easier to lose then these damn bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Befuddling","review":"Very confusing storylines that never go anywhere and characters that never come to life made this a very difficult read.

[Possible spoiler] The pocket universe is reminiscent of \\"The Mote in God's Eye;\\" incidents and characters are reminiscent of other Banks novels - which are not bad things, they're done differently, but there it is. And [Definite spoiler] I found the viewpoint character profoundly unsympathetic while all sympathetic characters ended up getting whacked (reminds me strangely of \\"Hall of the Martian King\\" where the author pulls a switch to make the reader feel guilty about his own sympathy for the violent hero).

The book is over 600 pages long but by the time I got to page 500 I was wishing there were another 600 pages, I just didn't want it to end. Some of the story is predictable but there are plot twists that will have your jaw dropping. The ending was about as perfect as an ending could have been.Would have gotten 5 stars, but after such a strong start with the prologue it seemed to drag in a few places in the beginning. It was like a locomotive after that it just kept picking up steam.

This is definitely a book that I will re-read periodically throughout my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Banks please stand up?","review":"I've enjoyed many a Banks yarn. Particularly those in the 'Culture' series. So, I was slow to realize just how much I was not enjoying this book. By page 300, I had thoroughly lost interest in the characters and after 50 more pages I realized I was no longer invested enough to care to read one more page. This has only happened a couple of times in the last 45 years. Nonetheless, I left approximately 300 pages unread and then looked at some other reviews here. There is one which mentions that the last 100 pages bring things together in a way that makes the slog through the first 500 pages worthwhile. Perhaps it does, but based on the first 350 pages of meandering plot and listless, flat characters, those 100 must be truly remarkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects, etc.","review":"I agree with the person below me. The first thing I noticed was the label stating that there were chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer.

I guess the mat works well but I'm too scared to use it, let alone breathe around it.

There's no plot to speak of, very little character development and the only character who does get significant \\"screen\\" time is utterly unlikable. She's a lazy, pathetic slob who never seems to learn from her many mistakes. Even in the end she isn't redeemed.

Our heroine, Bean, is a 30-year-old woman who is finally turning her age. Her journey across the country by train leads her to old friends, old boyfriends, relatives, and self-discovery. For the majority of the book, she is lost, confused, and basically feeling sorry for herself. She tends to be irritatingly weak-willed, but as the final chapters approach, we feel that she is finally finding the voice she had all along, but was just too scared and uncertain to use.Not all of her issues are resolved, but some questions are answered, fears are realized, and confrontations she thought should have taken place are finally defined as nothing more than mistakes that people make.This is a fantastic first effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read! Karin Goodwin is a Bret Easton Ellis wannabe, yet Bean is even less endearing and likable than all of his characters combined.

What you believe about your Creator--or don't believe about him--will affect how you view your world and what you think it should become. This book is a tremendous testimony to the truth that ideas have consequences and that religious ideas and politics do mix with profound consequences. I found the book incredibly interesting and well documented. Even though the author mainly dealt with the religious influences in America up to and during World War I, I found parallels to other periods of history in this country as well---even up to the very present crusade to \\"rid the world of evil.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It's here.","review":"Although this book is historically correct, I found it to be bombastic to the point of ad nauseam.

The \\"goal\\" of the book is the get the trunk with the letters...but we spend 200 pages getting nowhere near the trunk. Then we do and....well, it just all ends a bit abruptly.I'm going to have to re-read LOVE JUNKIE--maybe it wasn't as funny as I thought it was years ago...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surpirsed to find so much hate filled language","review":"I had been looking forward to reading this book for several years. I did laugh once, when the police found a pornographic magazine in the narrator's garbage. Then I was shocked that a character was repeatedly referred to as \\"The Faggot\\", as if that were his name. There is also an obese main character in the book, Jonica, that although he finds her disgusting, is willing to sleep with her and pretend to love her so he can get close to the secrets of Warren Harding. . . . ooooooh boy. Thirty pages away from the end of the book, and I no longer care about the secrets of Warren Harding.

I spent the entire viewing time trying to find some way to adjust the screen. The image has way, way, way too much contrast, and the details are often completely lost in the dark areas. The night scene toward the end of the movie was particularly difficult to watch, as the characters' face and hands were sometimes the only parts visible. The picture is also very soft focus or out of focus, especially disturbing for viewing faces. When a character turns his head, there is digital smearing upon the movement. It is also cropped a little too close on the top and bottom of the frame. We are lucky that the contract between the Chaplin family and MK2 has expired. I suggest waiting to buy this until a better print shows up. Certainly you should not pay any premium price for this; it really is not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost love that was never truly found.","review":"In this classic romantic comedy, Charlie stumbles upon a circus in which he finds employment through some silly bits of mishaps. Upon his inept and clumsy employment, he finds himself the saving grace of the floundering circus by accidentally becoming the hit comedy act and main audience draw. Meanwhile, he falls desperately in love with the beautiful equestrian who also happens to be the daughter of the abusive circus owner and ring master. Charlie has dreams of a wonderful life with her away from the circus until the reality of her heart's true desire is learned. A heart-wrenching story which displays the joy, the horror, and the grace of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monkeys amuck = instant hilarity","review":"There may be other Chaplin features that are subtler, more poignant, etc., but of the ones I've seen, \\"The Circus\\" is his flat-out funniest (ain't seed \\"The Kid\\" or \\"Modern Times,\\" or \\"A Day's Pleasure,\\" for that matter). Maybe that's because I saw it with a large and appreciative audience.Perhaps Chaplin kept it out of circulation because the monkeys (who presumably improvised) were funnier than anything he could come up with on purpose. There are few images in cinema more priceless than (DON'T READ THIS IF YOU AIN'T SEEN IT) that monk wrapped around the Tramp's neck and gnawing on his nose as they swing back & forth on the trapeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Friend's Photo","review":"The technical quality of the DVD is excellent. My interest in the movie is the result of seeing a photo on a friend's wall of Charlie Chaplin and an actor. The actor, Hugh Sasson, was the Uncle of my friend's mother. He appears early in the movie as the person who has his pocket picked. The photo is the shot in front of the hot dog stand when the victim sees the tramp paying for a hot dog out of his wallet. We set the photo on the TV and stepped through this scene on the DVD one frame at a time. It gave us all goose bumps as somehow the extreme slow motion made them seem alive in real time.Additionally, the story of the production difficulties found on disk 2 are fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film","review":"often overlooked between The Gold Rush and City Lights, which bracketed it in Charlie's catalog. I'd neber seen this one until now, but I think it's probably the strongest of Charlie's straightforward slapstick films. He really didn't try this sort of thing in the later part of his career, so it's cool to get a chance to see him do it with the technical progress that had been made since his early days at keystone.And Merna Kennedy may very well be the most beautiful woman to ever live. It's a shame she died so young."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good/product and movie","review":"The seller was very diligient and the product was very, very good.

His performance in High And Mighty is embarrassing and ruins whatever good qualities the film originally had.Never has John Wayne been so wooden as he was in this dated film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The High and the Mighty","review":"Well done for a movie of that time, the early 1950s'. Couldn't go wrong with the casting. Definitely a pre-cursor to Airport (1970) and its' ilk. Also the final scenes give a sense of nostalgia to SF Bay Area residents living here, then, when SFO was still known as Mills Field."},{"rating":"2","title":"The AIRPORT Prototype","review":"This was a film I had heard of but had never seen. Now I have it seems as if I have seen it before. I had not but I have seen all of the AIRPORT series, from the first very good one through the latter, horrible ones. They were all inspired by the HIGH and the Mighty.The story is of an airliner on passage from Hawaii to California when it has engine problems. It is doubtful whether she will make it to land. John Wayne plays the co-pilot running from a terrible accident in the past and Robert Stack plays the pilot. The film is not about them, however, or even about their efforts to save their passengers. Instead, it is about the different ways in which people react to the stresses of the situation. It is a series of short vignettes. They are very well done and the movie is inspiring in a way that the AIRPORT franchise rarely was able to achieve.These stories could have taken place in the midst of any emergency. They just happen to take place on an airliner.Well done drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of John Wayne","review":"Took me years but I now have a copy of a copy(bad) of my favorite movie of all time. For those interested the whistling was done by Muzzy Marcellino for the score. You cannot find a better film to led all others in this type endeavor. Great suspense, pathos, and action.

Unfortunately, the laughs are wholly unintentional. When Leonard Maltin prompts the audience (in his introduction) to watch the film with its historic and cultural context in mind, you know you're in for a stinker. (And it's a long stinker at that.) The screenplay piles on so many remarkably misguided cliches (which must have been hoary even then) you begin to think that somebody somewhere (probably Wellman) must have had his tongue planted firmly in his cheek. And for a suspense film, it's remarkably boring. What Wayne is doing in this nothing part is beyond me. Almost as mysterious is how Jan Sterling and Claire Trevor ended up with Academy Award nominations. Come on, folks, they were making great films in the 50s -- this just isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disaster of a movie","review":"This is a disaster movie. The production was a disaster. The script was a disaster. The jealous husband tries to shoot somebody to his right. How does the bullet end up taking out the motor on the end of the left wing? Did it circumnavigate the earth that fast? Then the shooter sits back down as if nothing happened. No restraints, no reaction from the crew. Then he walks free at the end of the movie, right past the police. Sorry folks, assault with a deadly weapon was a violent crime even in the 1950s. Wayne plays a character who began flying in World War One, but he looks remarkably well preserved for a character who must be pushing 60. Not one gray hair? And after losing his wife and son in another plane crash? The only good line was the very last one. The rest was stilted and trite, stock characters mumbling stereotypical lines. Stick with Airplane if you want an entertaining airplane disaster movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker provided raw material for the Airplane movie","review":"So bad I couldn't get through the first half hour.

What a disappointment! Everything in this film is a predictable cliche. The characterizations are lame, the acting is grade B, and the Duke (whom I love) has very little to do. There is absolutely no action -- it's a bunch of people sitting on an airplane reflecting on their lives punctuated with some pathetic flashbacks. It's interminably long, too. The only thing interesting about it was getting a glimpse of what air travel was like in 1954.

As one of the first films of this type one has to remember that many of the cliches of later \\"disaster\\" films originated with this one. The tension created in this small space is astonishing. Technically there are one or two minor lapses but these do not detract from the drama. Robert Stack's character is particularly truthfully drawn.

American Paranoia. This album is top notch and was very important to me. I had the key back to modern music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong. Bold. Powerful.","review":"Very pleased to have bought this cd. If the streets of the world had a soundtrack, this would be it. The music and vocals are very hypnotic. I keep envisioning blood flowing through the veins of civilization as I listen to this. The words are like cells full of truth. I don't find this dark...it just tells it like it is during these strange days on earth. Jim Morrison only wished he could sound as good as Vega. Pure artistry. Kudos you guys. Glad you are still making music after all these years."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"I will refrain from going down the list of songs on this heap. They are all bad. What makes them bad is really sad too...some of the vocal performances are outstanding, but all of the intrumental parts are just badly produced, sounding incredibly thin, having been performed by studio artists. I own every Maiden album and every Maiden \\"tribute\\" album and this is by far the worst. Do not let some of the big names on vocals rope you into buying this one. I really want to know how they feel about this- did they hear the background band at all- I would venture to guess not. To compare, listen to Di'Anno's other versions of Wrathchild since his exile from Maiden- even the his live version on \\"The Beast...Live\\" is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a sermon than a comedy","review":"I have watched several of Chonda's comedy concerts, and this one disappointed me.

The film deals with the ethnic differences inside Iran, racism, and prejudice, as the woman who takes the boy in confronts the hostility of her husband and other villagers. It has the universal theme of how we confront those who are different from us, but in a totally unfamiliar setting which is fascinating in itself. Iran is a multicultural nation with a variety of geographies, languages, and cultures little known to the outside world, and this movie provides a touching glimpse inside as well as sharp social criticism by the director."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exceptional Read","review":"I haven't read such a well written book in quite some time. This is an exceptional read, which took me on an emotional rollercoaster - I laughed and I cried, but most of all, I felt the character. This book shows the struggles, the excuses and the ambitions that plague both the surviors and the failures of inner-city youth. This is a well written novel, that kept me longing for more . . . I can't wait to read more from Pamela!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I really enjoyed reading this novel. This is a good novel, and an easy read. It has memorable, unforgettable characters. What I also liked about the novel is that it is written in the language of the way inner-city people talk. Although, it is a work of fiction, it is real talk. I think inner city people or those open to truly grasping and understanding of its people will definitely appreciate it and feel this novel. Through the dialogue with different characters we undestand why inner city people are the way they are. Why they feel the way they do and it's deep. This novel gives us insight into more about them. It helps us to better understand them. This book has a real message at the end. I so look forward to reading more novels written by this new author, a new voice in literature indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Streets Don't Always Love You Back","review":"In this Oakland-based urban fiction, you learn of one girl's struggle with life. Diamond, like many of our young girls, is faced with unfortunate circumstances, many of which are caused from not having parental guidance and support. What's sad is the fact that she's really a smart girl with dreams of becoming a lawyer. But her love for what she's been familiar with all her life ~ the street-life ~ eventually wins her mentality over, where she gets caught up in just about every illegal activity imaginable. As time goes on, she earns her share of respect on the streets, EVEN BECOMES AN OAKLAND QUEENPIN! But as we all know, everything that glitters ain't gold. Diamond has to learn this the hard way, but SHE DOES LEARN. She learns something that all of our gems should know: The Streets Don't Always Love You Back! PAMELA M. JOHNSON let the truth be told in this one.Paula Edwards,Author of The Last Bad Decision"},{"rating":"2","title":"You have the power to be a GEM no matter where you're from","review":"The novel is centered around Diamond and is told through her eyes. We learn how San Francisco created her and wants to put her at the top of the drug game. Diamonds desires to be a QUEENpin and the author puts her through hell to achieve this. Pamela Johnson sends us a powerful message that says no matter who you are or where you are from you can be anything you want to be. YOU HAVE THE POWER! It also reads like a christian novel in some ways as Diamond learns that God is forgiving of all of our sins. Excellent read for a stronger mind! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and confusing","review":"This was crap. It just didn't unravel right.

This seems like some cheap knock off of a DGA M-14. I do like the red though even if I don't like the way it catches and the chains rust.All that being said I have seen this basket for super cheap like $50.00. At that price I'd pick one up for my kids maybe.Disclaimer: I'm definitely way into DGA gear now. They've always been head and shoulders above any other company in their baskets but now their discs are really sweet too (no where as big a disc selection as Innova or Discraft though)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great basket for the money","review":"This basket is a great buy. It is all metal with sturdy powder coating. The gauge of the metal is quite a bit lighter than a Mach III, but it is plenty sturdy for practice putting and play. The base, while it looks flimsy, actually keeps the basket quite sturdy even when banging hard, long shots into it. The only gripe I have is the chains. They are much lighter weight than those on pro baskets and allow putts to shoot through quite a bit. This could easily be remedied by adding an interior set of chains purchased from a hardware store. I plan on doing this. For the price, it's the best practice basket out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disc Golf basket","review":"I added an inner ring of chains.Sets up quick. Great in the backyard. Sturdy. Good price and excellent value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Practice Basket!","review":"My wife bought this basket for me for my birthday this year. I have used it a few times for quick short games with family and friends, and some short game practice in the back yard.This hole seems very druable, easy to set up, and very portable. I don't think you can get a better deal for the price. Some reviews have said that the light weight chains are prone to blow through shots, but we havn't seemed to have that problem with this basket. Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic basket for the money!","review":"You simply can't go wrong with this basket. If you want to practice your putts, approaches, and even the occasional drive, this basket fits the bill for portability, durability, and ease of set up. I bought one, and I plan to buy several more. It's a great basket for setting up a temporary weekend course on your property. As stated in another review, an interior set of chains helps block blow-throughs, but it's a great basked none the less. Buy one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"InStep Disc Golf Goal","review":"This is a great product for the price. You can get a better disc basket, but you will pay a lot more. I agree with most of the other reviews. There is only an outer set of chains and the actual basket is not very deep. Again, for the price, you can't go wrong. The discs that come with it are not just bad, they are aweful. The company manufacturing this basket should save the extra 50 cents they spent on all three of these discs. A better idea would be to include one decent putter from a company that knows how to make discs. If you are on the fence about this product, I would recommend purchasing it. I don't think that you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Goal","review":"Santa brought this for Xmas this year. We have had such great weather that we have used it several times already. It was easy to assemble and we are having loads of fun with it. I wish it were easy to take apart so we could take it camping with us but... then it would not be as sturdy. So I do not see that as a draw back. No negatives. Good price. Received it quickly. No complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great basket for the money.","review":"For the price, you can't beat this basket. I wanted something inexpensive to practice putting around the yard. Its extremely easy to setup and take back down. Very easily transported too. There are a few more bounce outs due to the fact that there is only an outer set of chains. I was initially going to add an inner set, but for the very few times I get a bounce out that should have stayed in, its really just not worth the extra money. I always bring mine in when I am done playing with it, so I can't say how it holds up in the weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"needs more chains","review":"the disc catcher is awesome, the only thing is it needs added chains to it cause the disc will blow through it, but it works perfectly fine for back yard putting and the assembly was so easy i think my 7 year old kid could of put it together by himself!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great goal for home use","review":"The instep disc golf goal is a great goal for home use. It stands sturdy without wobbling and is made with good materials. The quick connect pins make it easy to assemble and disassemble. An inner set of chains would help keep a few more shots in the basket (maybe 2 in 10 slip through). Also the top post section could be improved by adding a pin to secure it to the lower post instead of just fitting over it.Overall this is a great basket and I plan on purchasing another one soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal.

The goal is sturdy and doesn't fall over. It's top-heavy, so be careful when lifting. It also comes apart in the middle, so I could easily fit it in my car in two pieces. It's really easy to put together too.I don't leave it out because I don't want to even try to deal with rust. I also experienced issues with bounce outs and will link a chain in the center at some point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priced right, EXCELLENT delivery from VMInnovations","review":"Order placed yesterday morning. Received this TODAY. Amazing service.Goal is what I expected based on reviews. I hit it with some 15-40' putts over lunch and it caught a majority. A few misses may have been caught with a few more chains. For the money, I'll learn to survive.I'd certainly buy it again but would not consider using it for a course without some modifications (additional chains and welding of basket/top to pole). In fact, I'll likely buy another soon so as to set up temporary courses/challenges in the yard and my neighborhood park.It would have been 4 stars for just the product but when adding in the super fast delivery I felt 5 was well earned."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent portable","review":"This goal is a great portable model. It is made of quality materials and works well. The only reason that it didnt get 5 stars from me is that it only has 1 row of chains where as a pro model will have two. There are only a couple of shots in a long evening of practicing in the back yard that bounce out due to the lack of a second set of chains. It doesnt get small enough to put in your pocket but it is very robust in construction and easily stores and transports in the box that it came in. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gold Disc Goal","review":"Hard duty and heavy. Easy to move though and works great for those disc golf shots. Lets us practice in our own back yard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great practice basket...","review":"Product was just as described.Went together in seconds without any tools.A second set of chains to really grab the discs would make it 5-Star.The discs that come with it are not PDGA or ADGA approved and not accurate but I have plenty of discs to practice with.I have not seen a better basket for anywhere near this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter target","review":"Great product for the money. It gives you an awesome target to work with. Its easy to take apart, doesn't weigh much, and pretty durable considering. Its slightly wider than a regulation basket, and only has one ring of chains, which makes it slightly different than the target you are used to on the course, but if you want a great backyard basket for not a ton of money, this is an awesome product. I would recommend this to anyone, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, my star is broken","review":"I received these earrings as a gift, and I was really excited because I love stars, and these small earrings are adorable. I don't have long hair so I never had a problem with the earrings popping off as other reviewers experienced, but I did find that they sat kind of oddly on my earlobes.

Who Knew?","review":"I have got to seriously hand it to Albert on this one. I went into this with luke warm expectations of a strokes retread album. Instead I was left with a sense of optimism and genuine elation from this album. These are fantastically crafted songs. Catchy, well written, harmonious, and emotional. This albums does sound like the strokes a bit however. The trademark itchy guitar prevails but works nicely with Alberts monotone but surprisingly refined voice. There are several tracks that are fantastic on this one. This album seems best suited for listening to straight through while drinking a Papst Blue Ribbon and smoking a spliff with good friends on a breezy summer day. I'm sure that is what Albert and guest stars Julian Casablanca and Sean Lennon were doing while recording this splendid piece of work that will most likely be overlooked this year but will be revisited in the future by future hipsters."},{"rating":"2","title":"mine to keep....forever","review":"I just received this gem of an album today and have already listened to it at least six times....yeah, it's that good! I am a huge Strokes fan, but never heard Albert speak or sing before, so I was a little wary of how his voice would sound, but I was more than pleasantly surprised by his great voice on every beautiful song on the album. After hearing this record, I think the Strokes should split up singing duties half/half on any future albums between Julian and Albert much like the Beatles did. Every song is a joy to listen to, but the one that will never leave my head is \\"Scared\\", which is nothing less than four minutes of pure heaven. If you have the chance to pick this album up, don't hesitate to do so-I promise you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"I had to buy this book for a class, and it is pointless.

Thick with jargon and esoteric language. The final chapter is unusual--it seems the author wishes to use radio talk show hosts to demonstrate that women ask more appropriate questions about automobiles than do arrogant men. Men,due to their gender (according to the author), that must demonstrate expertise where they have none. The rest of the book reads more like a political treatise than history. The bottom line; however, is that as an auto museum docent and lecturer I did not find this a useful or readable book. I would not recommend the book to my classes nor to our patrons. Finally, the author presents a consistent conceptual or ideological point of view throughout the book; thus, I suppose if you are like-minded the book might be of interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!","review":"I was a bit skeptical buying this one but since I love the song bonito I decided to take a chance!It's great!

Their first release has to be heard! (more about that later). While this \\"best of Iniquity\\" serves well and is good, the last songs on the album were taken from their demo, so not as polished. Iniquity are one of those rare death metal bands (like Suffocation) that will spend plenty of time in the CD-Player, because they have awesome riffs, on-the-dime time changes, and is truly heavy. I'm really a true fan of their earlier work which is basically the last half of this album. But the songs sound 1000% better on the original LP \\"Serenadium.\\" Not just that, but all the songs are killer on that album. In fact, all the songs are killer on their EP, \\"Hidden Lore\\" too (again, not all the songs are on here).

The most annoying problem has been the resolution when attached to a projector. Neither I nor Gateway support was able to find a setting that allows the screen to be viewed properly, and I've tried a few different projectors. The image is always to big for the viewing area. This is important to me since I make presentations frequently and bought the laptop for this purpose.Also, the subwoofer developed a sound problem, and wasn't as clear and vivid as when new. Gateway promply sent a new one however, and it seems to be working better.I still feel that the M505x has the best screen (except for Sony's xbrite), the best keyboard, and the best sound compared to all the competitors. If it weren't for the projection problem it would be outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Screen","review":"I bought this computer and about a month later, the screen started messing up!! it starts turning all different colors and i cant play games or watch dvds because it gets worse!Never will i buy a gateway again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story.","review":"As always, Peter David writes an interesting and sometimes amusing story. Also as (almost) always, he ends with a cliffhanger non-ending, so if you share my distaste for such things, be aware of that before you start. (His background as a comic-book writer is sometimes all too apparent.) On the other hand, in the \\"Gateways\\" series, ALL of the stories end that way, so I suppose he isn't entirely to be blamed this time.One oddity to note: he makes no attempt to place this story outside of his normal numbered New Frontier series, but there is no attempt to inform the reader where in the series this book falls, which makes it awkward for the reader of the series who suddenly finds the ongoing plot to jump between two consecutively numbered books; this book (and the sequel, \\"Gateways 7\\") falls between books 11 and 12 of the regular series."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A COMPELLING DOCUMENTARY OF WHAT IT WILL COST TO ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM!\\"","review":"This film is a gritty look of behind the scenes and a look on the inside of Major League Baseball and its top quality talent in the Dominican Republic.

Unfortunately Halo seems to be sold everywhere - we ended up with 3 of these in different weights and sizes and the zippers on all of them are cheap and hard to zip up. Trying to get this on a sleepy baby is next to impossible because you end up wrestling with the zipper and waking the baby every time.

I use the Halo with terry or fleece pajamas and/or with a long-sleeved bodysuit, but then my son's trunk tends to get too warm, aggravating a rash on his chest and belly.

I was absolutely thrilled when the hospital gave us one in our \\"take home bag\\" after I had my daughter last year. The sleepsacks offer a safer alternative to blankets for babies, and since I live in a colder climate, there are plenty of nights I felt like my kids could use the extra warmth. Neither one of my kids liked to be swaddled, and they fought their way out of those wraps. It was great to have something to use even when they were very little.I've used several for both of my kids, and they wear well and wash well.

It's large enough that she can stand up in it without tripping. Very soft and warm, and my daughter loves the puppy applique. Zips from the top down, like all HALO SleepSacks.

And the \\"Back to Sleep\\" logo is embroidered on the front so even non-parents can get the message.I had a very hard time putting my son to sleep without a blanket, especially in the winter. I swaddled him when he was a newborn, and he stayed put in his crib. Now that he is three months old, he manages to wriggle out of his sleep positioner and end up in a different place every night. Blankets were definitely becoming a hazard at that point. So I bought the sleep sack and it has been a great compromise.

She's another clone in a scene--who doesn't add innovation to music. She's a cute girl but she needs to go back into the studio and do something. I don't understand why they make such a big deal about her being 19 and writing her own music?? That's how it's suppose to be. She isn't a bad singer at all, but she didn't make a good album and the only reason I am writing this is because I see talent but it's not being utilized well. And a lot of these reviews are from her label so seriously, you people are lame when it comes to music. Keep doing your thing bonnie, try to put out some good music because I know you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Customs Regulations","review":"MUSIC REVIEWS LTD., the company behind this product, obviously has its head office somwhere within the EU.

It contains an amazing variety of short stories, including some of the well-known masterpieces. My favorites in this collection are \\"The swimmer\\" (an outstanding example of the grotesque), as well as the thrilling story about \\"The baby in the ice-box\\" (sheer captivating story-telling). Rarely had so much fun reading a short story. There are many less funny stories here as well, if you prefer. And you meet many famous writers in little-known stories, which are quite characteristic. Even O Henry is present with a true masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"really helps","review":"really takes the craving away, but the gum is very addictive.

It is a fairly quick read but keeps you interested throughout. The house is still there, but burned completely except for the outer stone shell in the early 90's. It has since been rebuilt within the orignal walls and is now occupied and is a pleasant looking house again for the first time in years. FYI, they are making this story into a movie that is supposed to be released in 2005.

The story is so intriguing about the Cameron family renting this old mansion house right after WWII. They are plagued by sounds and smells that only have paranormal explanations.

A good example: Power Steering Pump replacement. The pump location is wrong. The torque specs are wrong. The belt tensioner location is wrong. The belt routing is wrong. And on and on.Most damning is that the manual states regular power steering fluid is specified for the vehicle. Wrong again: Ford specs are for Mercon.I've been a big fan of Haynes Repair Manuals over 30 years.

First is the price. This is a horrible tribute and it costs way too much. the only reason i'd buy this is if your grandmother wanted to hear some of your favorite music and if it was in the bargain bin for 3 bucks. The second problem is...well....when are you even going to listen to this? The grand piano sounds great and everything but a little too loud to sleep. But this is no rock album either. The guitars, bass. and drums that we all love are gone. I admit it. The song selection is great. But whats the point when they sound this bad? The point is, don't buy this album. waste of money and your music listening time. As for me, i'm going back to the store to sell this piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"As an old fan..","review":"I used to be a Iron Maiden fan until 1990, when they totally slipped and wasted the band in the 90s. I did not listen very much to the albums thereafter, and was very critical to the new albums where Bruce was back in the band. I bought this piano tribute, and it opened my ears for Brave new world, which is a great track.This piano tribute is very good. In my opinion it gets better and better for each listening, as it takes time to get used to the transition. But I will recommend it to everybody, not only Maiden-fans - as the music itselves is a piece of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Sounding","review":"I'm not sure if it's the production or if this was actually recorded on a cheap electric piano, either way it's not a very impressive sounding collection of covers.It was mildly depressing to listen to some of my favorite Maiden tracks become trivialized into a sort of background music. None of the original power, and sometimes not even the correct music - a couple of the songs sound slightly off, as though the key is incorrect or the pianist just strikes a few keys wrong.If you're a collector it might be worth getting, but if you're a collector you'd already have it. Everyone else should probably skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"this is an awful idea translated into an awful album...think about it, Iron Maiden and piano music go together like cookies and ass.

Unforunately, what I found was a poorly put together group of people who almost all came from some kind of health-care background or medical legacy. The only thing that made these people non-traditional was the fact that they were older. I was hoping for a book full of artists and business people who decided to switch paths, but all I found were stories of phamaceutical reps and EMTs. Aside from subject matter, there isn't a wide range of questions or answers. Basically, if you read one interview, you've read them all. There are so many other books that give an eclectic view of the non-traditional student. Save your money. You'll need it in med-school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Book","review":"I being a non traditional medical student read this book hoping it would give me some insight to other students not graced with a prestigious family background, but what I found in this book was nothing short of silly.

However, I did find some laughs in it, although I doubt the author had intended them. For example:\\"I leaned back and let go with a heavy sigh, which hung in the air like a choking fog.\\" - Mothermelters. pg 9One would gather that the author was stating that he had bad breath.It seemed as though Kunzman, the author, had a grudge against a few former co-workers and spent an inordinate amount of time in character assassination of them. The writer tries to paint himself as a gallant knight on a white steed, but only comes across as a Don Quixote chasing windmills. There is very little substance, and no entertaining value in the pages of this book. Save your money and do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book reads like it's written by someone who can barely read!","review":"The book is really hard to read.

From the opening strains of \\"Growin'\\" to the haunting harmonica ending of \\"Fever Dream\\", this album, more than any other, defined my appreciation of music, and made me understand why some people are destined to be bricklayers or accountants, while others are destined to be songwriters and performers.

I think the recommendation is to leave it on for 5 days, but I leave it on about 2 1/2-3 days since I'm super sensitive to the adhesive. I've never had a problem.

I'm size 32 but have thick muscular thighs. I found that the size 34 was still a bit tight on the thighs but stretched out a little after the 3rd wear. Size 36 was returned because they looked like diapers. So I recommend going one size larger if you have thick thighs. If not, go with the same size because the waist is true to size.After about a month of wear, 5x a week, they still look new. They are definitely not as revealing as the lycra pants where those outline your parts.

If you are into hillbilly horror go grab this one quick. Watching the film your head swims as much as the characters as they are pulled into a nightmarish kidnapping/violence game against each other. It had a lot to say about how women are viewed as subjugated by \\"traditional\\" roleplay to the point where they turn against each other. Each one starts out an independent person and gets kidnapped and forced to play and wear swimsuits- something which reminded me alot of the roughie style of the Ameros and Findlays more than the slasher films of today. However, this could be the third film in \\"Grindhouse\\" while it also has an art house sensibility to it . One of the most suspenseful films I've ever seen, comparable to the original TCM or Last House on the Left.

It works quite nicely after a shower before drying off. It's especially nice for leg shavers because you can apply it and you don't get the burn like you may get with other moisturizers with perfumes in them. I've used this on my face in the evenings before bed as my bedtime moisturizer. It's also quite nice on a little sunburn and keeps the skin moisturized so you have less peeling.

I guess the only downfall of the oil is the cute glass jar that it comes in--sometimes it can be difficult to control the amount of oil poured into my hands. It's not a big deal, and definitely worth knowing that once I have exhausted my supply of the oil, I can recycle the glass bottle.

The Hero and Heroine are just not likeable and the story line is crummy. Don't bother to pick up this book it is not worth the time it takes to read the back of the book.

And I am anxiously waiting to see what sex the baby turns out to be.I can't wait for the second book of the trilogy. Hurry, Julia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I now know what I want","review":"I suppose a thank you is inorder to Ms. London because this novel has made it clear what I like in the romance genre. And it is not this book. I should have placed higher value on mrsgiggles review. I, too, don't appreciate a juvenile, petty, abusive, self pitying hero. Unfortunately the heroine in this book didn't have much to choose from in the hero category. In most cases give me Amanda Quick aka Jayne Krentz, Julie Garwood, Catherine Coulter and Nora Roberts. Their heroes and heroines may have problems but they are also entertaining and not constantly sniveling about their lot in life. A man can be rough around the edges, that's character, but forever misunderstanding and wallowing in it and then taking it out on the woman who stands by him...well no thanks. Even when Adrian \\"acknowledges\\" his love his first thought is how Lillie can \\"save\\" him...so much for his love, it's still all about him not them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dangerous Gentleman","review":"Feeling responsible for the death of his friend, what amounted to self defense, Adrian is tormented by what he believes is his fault, the death of his friend. Spurned by his father all his life and seeing everything given to his half brother Adrian is bound and determined to have revenge on his father, when his father disinherits him, and the best way he knows how is to take away his chance to obtain land by having his son, Adrian's half brother, marry the daughter of Lord Dashell. So Adrian sets out to twart that union by offering for Lilliana's hand behind his fathers back. Adrian's rough edges that needed the touch of Lilliana to smooth out and though it was a long battle she smoothes them out very nicely. From one who likes her hero's rough around the edges, but with a heart of gold underneath the hurt and toughness, Adrian was a dream. The opening love scene was a scorcher and the sexual tension was felt throughout the book. Definitely a sexy hero to die for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tediously Dull","review":"Sorry as an avid romance reader I must say I hate books that I have to force my self to finish, Because I actually finished this book is the only reason I am even giving it 2 stars. As another reviewer said the bickering gets old the same old argument for at least %75 of the book, and a dull one at that, however I am a stickler of reading an entire series and so I have learned the the 2nd book is marginally better, only buy this book if you truly feel like boring your self to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother to read","review":"I had read one of Julia London's previous books which was a pretty good historical romance. I purchased the series of the Rogues of Regent Street. The series should have started with a better explanation of the rogues and at least given them one book to get you to know their stories. As it turned out in series one it had very little about them and takes off on a tale that is repetious and full of blasphemy. I do not believe those living in the 1800's liked to swear as much as she does in this book. About every other page uses the name of God or Jesus or Mary in a horrible way. It turned me off. But I started the second series and found that by page three the blasphemy has already started. Her publisher should have taught this new writer how to develop a story and give the readers something that has a good storyline. I wish I could send these back and I will never read her work again. This is some pure garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"An disappointment","review":"I bought this book for the favourable reviews of other readers but I was disappointed. The relatively more entertaining part of this book was the outrageous things that Liliana did to get Adrian's attention. However, it went all the way downhill from there. I couldn't understand why Adrian considered his father's estate was his 'rightful inheritance' when he thought himself the bastard son of his mother. It is alright to have a brooding hero but not a petty one. What was there in that man for any woman to fall in love with ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ!","review":"Adrian is such a tortured soul in need of unconditional love. Yet he has no idea that when he marries Lilliana out of revenge he is getting just that. Lilliana has got to be the best heroine I've come across. She endures being ignored constantly and manages to get attention by all means necessary! I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Judith McNaught, YOU MUST BE JOKING","review":"I have to agree whole heartedly with mrsgiggles review of this book. Too bad I bought the book anyway. I made it to page 95 before I just couldn't stand it anymore. I almost put it down when on page 61 he called her a \\"bumpkin\\". The final straw was when he had almost forgotten his bride the morning after his wedding because hs was preoccupied with finding a packet he had misplaced after a night of \\"whor...\\" with his friends Julian and Phillip. Adrian is a complete jerk; too bad the outcome of the duel was not reversed - but I have a feeling it wouldn't have been much better of a story. Lilliana got on my nerves from the moment she met Adrian. As you can probably tell, I won't be picking up any more Julia London's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Benchmark","review":"If you like superb video and audio and appreciate classical music genius, this is the ultimate disc for you.

It features Bear and his friends (Mouse, Hare, Gopher, Mole, Badger, Raven, and Wren) who make a new friend (an Owl).The pages are sturdy and the book is a good size for little hands- 6\\" by 5.5\\".Each page features a colorful illustration of the characters. Most pages have four lines which rhyme in a fun (not forced) way. For example:\\"In the woods, in the sun,on a hot summer day,Bear feels an itchingto head out and play.\\"I was initially unhappy that the owl was in a hole in the ground and came out in the day so I did a little research. The owl pictured in the book is a burrowing owl which lives in the ground and is a daytime owl."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper!","review":"After reading this story to my four-year-old daughter, I asked what she thought about it, to which she replied simply, \\"Keep!\\" She doesn't exactly have a favorite aspect of the book; rather she stated that everything about it was her favorite.Personally, I thought the illustrations were nicely done. Young children will enjoy asking along with you as you read the repetitive question said by Bear and found 5 times within the story. The plot is nothing new. It's been done before and doesn't wow me, but this book is simple and sweet and my daughter really liked it. The characters are loveable. Any child who likes this series is sure to especially enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Bearish delights.","review":"\\"Great!\\" my four-year-old declared after we read his copy of this book for the first time.I almost think the Bear books need no review by now; Jane Chapman's illustrations bring Karma Wilson's text to life so brilliantly, charmingly, and endearingly as to be almost irresistible. I think our favorite page in Bear's New Friend is the one where the new friend pops out and Bear and his other friends react with surprise and delight.The board books are a great format for those toddlers, and they also make the pages really easy for older kids to turn. Although the smaller format may make it more difficult to pick out, say, details on butterflies in the pictures, the book's size is really excellent for small hands.Bear continues to be lots of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice longer-format story in board book form","review":"This very sweet story is longer than most board books, with 21 pages of text. Plot is simple-- Bear and other kind forest animals find and welcome a shy new forest friend (an owl). The story is delivered through charming rhyme and very special, emotionally rich illustrations.Jane Chapman has a real genius for creating warm, expressive, and friendly illustrations for children. Strongly recommended for toddlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow up book","review":"We LOVED Bear Snores On. This book was a disappointment. A few pages were cute, but most of the rhymes felt forced and the thematic verse (like \\"but the bear snores on\\" but in this case was \\"Bear says, Who?\\") was terrible. It had no cadence and felt choppy and too short. I'm reluctant to buy the other Bear books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another cute book....","review":"We have the entire series of Bear books, and I have to admit, while this latest is cute, has the same wonderful illustrations, and my kids love it, the rhyme is not quite up to par when compared to the previous versions.

Eleanor is a remarkable woman, having been queen to two different countries, but a power in her own right through her title in Aquitaine.Interesting to see a woman with any power during this period of patriarchal control, but the strength of her personality contributed to era in remarkable ways.Like all of Weir's books, there sometimes develop something bordering on personality cults with historical figures. Even so, the author gave a fair treatment of Eleanor's misbehavior on the crusade with her first husband King Louis.As always, Weir's greatest contribution is her making historical figures accessible and personal. If her sympathetic writing may overstate a case here and there, her writing certainly helps spawn interest in people who have been gone for hundreds of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book.","review":"I'm not a history buff and I knew nothing about Eleanor of Aquitaine before reading this and am glad I purchased the book. It was very interesting and I feel I learned a great deal about not just her, but the politics of that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen of medieval times","review":"Ms Weir strikes gold! This is a very well written book of the infamous Eleanor. She was the wife of two kings and the mother of three. Eleanor was no stay at home mom. She went toe to toe with her husband Henry II. Not much is known of medieval women but Eleanor made her magnificent mark on history. Alison Weir has brought her to life. Very well researched and informative as well as entertaining. A must read for anglophiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eleanor of Aquitaine: A Life","review":"This book provides new insights and recolors our image of this high born Medieval woman. The reader is left in awe of the impact she had on her culture and her times. This fact and detail filled book searches for the true identity, motivations and influence of the wife of two powerful monarchs each struggling to carve out and hold onto their kingdoms. As heiress to the large powerful region called the Aquitaine (now a large part of western France), Eleanor becomes a pawn in a majestic power play between two great countries. For 82 years (remarkable longevity for those times) Eleanor wields both direct and indirect power by, for, and sometimes around both her husbands and on behalf of her sons the three Kings of England. After reading this book you will continue to be amazed by the power held by this one woman, which I believe has not been rivaled since. This book is not to be missed. You will not be able to put this book down, as with all the other Weir books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much about Eleanor","review":"While I know there's not much surviving info out there about Eleanor specifically, this mostly details the history that surrounded her during the era, and the goings-on of her husbands. Not much about Eleanor herself. I like Weir's books, and trust her research, but this one was hard to get through, with mundane details and not much life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impeccable scholarship","review":"Weir's breadth of scholarship is astounding but for the reader interested in details about Eleanor of Aquitaine, Weir makes it quite clear that s/he is sure to be sorely disappointed. Although ostensibly a biography of Eleanor there is little about her in the book due to a decided absence of information regarding her life in contemporary sources. I was disappointed in this lack of detail but, not knowing much about 12th-13th century England and France, found myself reading on just to learn about the era. Weir writes with a real objectivity that I appreciated. I recommend this book to the reader interested in the general history of the Plantagenets and the period in which they lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read for fun, but look elsewhere for facts","review":"Although Ms. Weir does a marvelous job of asking provoking questions and painting a vivid version of the medieval world, her editor should do a better job checking her facts. Her conclusions about the number of images of Eleanor that exist are incorrect, and overall she relies on archeology and art history to prove her case - without actually bothering to check on the facts that these two important disciplines can provide. Although charming as a story, Ms. Weir's work is lax by scholarly standards, and should be carefully considered as such. A marvelous writer, but perhaps a less than thorough researcher, Ms. Weir is great fun - but I would quibble greatly with anyone who would responsibly try to use her work as a factual guide or textbook to the time and persons presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Deeply Personal","review":"More than the biography of Eleanor, Weir's account describes where Eleanor's life intersects with the major figures and events in European history of the 12th century. The historical accounts focus upon Eleanor's documented activites and include those of her husbands and children. The historical accounts of Henry II, Richard I, and John I develop well beyond their relationships with Eleanor. Weir's account portrays a cultured,intelligent, and beautiful woman who develops shrewdness and wisedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a textbook style book this is for you","review":"I read 32 pages of this book on what should be an exciting topic and was bored to the point that I counted the number of pages listing references and stuff (just shy of 100). When it takes five days to read 32 pages, it is a sign that there's a problem. It's a text book style where the subject is lost among tons of facts that are repeated and referenced rather than stating them and moving on. I found another book on the the same subject that flows and moves and keeps my interest and is literally a page turner. It is Queen Eleanor: Independent Spirit of the Medieval World by Polly Schoyer Brooks. It's more of novel than boring facts with an academic vocabulary. In 7 pages, I've found out more and care more about the people being written about than in Weirs tome. I don't HATE Weirs book, but will steer clear of any others written by her. Thirtytwo pages was more than enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eleanor of Aquitaine","review":"Unfortunately not the book I was expecting, in fact it had more to do with Henry II, and was extremely factual, if that is what you are looking for.

He possessed unparalleled vision and wisdom about the Carmelite experience, the \\"way of unknowing\\" that leads to our all-knowing God.His writings are challenging, wherever a person may be on his/her spiritual journey, but they are bounteously rewarding to the dedicated reader. The human heart does not change, and you will be surprised how much the people of the 1500s resemble the people of 2004; you will also nod in agreement and amazement at the extreme accuracy of St. John's observations.Highly recommended to anyone interested in developing a deeper, more intimate relationship with God."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Contemplative Guidebook","review":"I was a little reluctant to purchase \\"The Collected Works of St. John of the Cross\\" at first. I am glad I did! The author knew the Lord and I believe this book is one of the more authoritative editions on this great mystic.However, I do have one criticism. The editors give John a bit too much of a sophisticated voice, and at times the reading is \\"muddy\\".

The food is fantastic, it's a wonderful variety, good details, realistic coloring, and very sturdy. They love all of it. The set is great to help explain the 4 food groups to the 3 year old, it's fun wooden food, and large enough for the 1 year old to play with.My only concern is with paint chipping, there was a small chip off one of the pieces, but I put a little clear nail polish over that spot so that it won't chip any further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Food Group Let Down","review":"Purchased this product for my 3 year old daughter b/c I thought it would be a fun way to introduce the idea of food groups to her.

Well, the problem is that most of this food you cannot even tell what kind of food it is. The detail is almost non-existent. The most identifiable food is the banana and even that isn't great. I am disappointed in these because I feel like my 18 month old can't identify most of the items. (I even struggle trying to figure some of them out!) I also wished they included foods more common to a child . . . like instead of a tomato (how many kids eat tomatoes) there should be an APPLE!

After seeing the box dimensions on Amazon, I worried that the food would be too small for them to play with. (I am very strict about choking hazards being around my toddlers.) They are actually a good size. Not too big to play with but not so small they could choke on them. The kids love them! Although, since they are wood, they are hard when they are thrown at one another. (We're working on not throwing things.) I like them and couldn't have asked for anything different. The nice little baskets provide a nice place to store the food in their kitchen. It has been fun explaining the differences in vegetables, fruit, bread, and meat to the kids who apparently find it important to keep them separate. A nice, unexpected introduction into teaching about food groups and balanced eating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small and Not Realistic","review":"Just got it today and am unimpressed with how small and obviously fake the play food is.

I purchased this toy for my 3 year old who's Autistic to help him learn his food groups and learn to make wise food choices. However I was slightly disappointed in the fact that I hadn't even gotten the first crate out of the plastic and a slat had broken off. Something though that you could just easily glue back on and the other 3 crates I've had no problems with. My only other issue with this wonderful set is that some of the pieces lack definition i.e. the orange and the tomato, when my toddler saw the orange for the first time he thought it was a ball and the tomato looks like it could be either an apple or a strawberry. I would still highly recommend this toy to a friend because its great for kiddos who like hands on play and who identify better with things that they can touch rather that a picture on a flashcard."},{"rating":"2","title":"More kids stuff","review":"Great toys for children.

The only downfall is that the orange is just a painted ball and has been permanently taken away due to throwing. The same is about to happen with the lemon, egg and tomato. So, if you have a thrower in your house, beware! They are solid pieces and hurt! Other than that, love it! My son loves to make burgers and hot dogs (no bun with the hot dog though). He also loves to go to the \\"store\\" and \\"buy\\" milk and bananas.

My daughter has not seen these yet because they are for christmas to go with her new kitchen, but i just know she's gonna flip. The quality is great and they will wear very well. I am so excited to play with her and to watch her play with her friends with this toy. I am totally starting to replace these tiny cheap plastic pieces with wooden melissa and doug ones. The only thing is i kind of thought they would be a little bigger, but they fit well with her pots and pans so i guess it's okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor lady wrote poor life view","review":"I bought this book somewhere in Thailand library years ago for shortening my long lasting travelling. At that time my English was so poor I could not understand most of the book so I let it rest at home for long years. I found it this January and as I love everything about Maria I have eventually read it through. But from the begining I felt the only reason for reading it was my English practising.I think the only Jackie\`s problem was her absolute lack of aim in life. She had excuse for all her failure, she gave up a piano player career for unknown reason, it seemed as she had the only life plan - to get married.The editorial reviews from Publishers Weekly is completely right.Boring and poor reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jealous sister wants her 15 minutes","review":"This book is an outragous display of blantant jealousy. The book has 3 parts - Sisters, The Sister (Maria), and Me (Jackie). But all 3 sections are filled with just as much self-gloating, self-pitying arrogance as the next. Jackie seemed to live out her dream of upstaging Maria Callas through her mother (since she was no longer alive to defend herself). I do not recommend this book, for it seems far too inaccurate and bias towards the fact that Jackie thought the world was prasing the wrong sister. It should have been been her up there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Final Fantasy Adventure","review":"Final Fantasy Adventure for the original game boy is one of the best games of all time. Sword of Mana took the original game boy game and sucked all the life out of it. What they got wrong: pacing, length, too much story, and unnecessary deviations from the original. The original had many connections to the Final Fantasy series. The original title for the game even called it a Final Fantasy game. It was as good as the best Final Fantasy games. This version would be a playable, slightly enjoyable waste of a few hours, but only if you've never played the original. For those who have played the original this game will just make you wish you were playing the original again. Bottom line: this is the saddest remake I've ever played in terms of its' destruction of the game its' based upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing entry in the Mana series... skip it.","review":"Well, it's not Secret of Mana. It's not even Children of Mana. It's a totally different beast of a game. I tried on two separate occasions to get into this game, but one single thing turned me off: time actually passes during the day.Remember The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask? Remember how time passed during the day, and people might or might not be where they're supposed to be since they could be away from their house at that time? Yeah, I HATE that. And since Sword of Mana revolves around the same time based system, I HATE this game too.So in reality, I can't give you a true game review. I can only tell you that I couldn't even play it due to being utterly frustrated at having to walk back and forth through areas to wait for the time of day to change to get something done. If you can handle that, however, this may be the game for you.Not recommended for anyone. Epic fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Banana Fana Mo Mana","review":"The game has great graphics, and is very fun to play.

This is mainly because the bad guys are stupid little blobs and bats. The whole game is one bad cliche after another. you can either be a gladiator (sword fighting is extremely frustrating because of air units and land units) or a girl that uses magic (magic particularly sucks because you have to summon a spell and then cast it and it seems to be not even worth the while because it does little damage and wastes huge magic points) I got bored after 2 days and would hugely not recommend it.graphics: 1fun factor: 0.5frustration: 5!!!!!!!!!!!!plot:0!!!!!!!!good for killing time (yes or no): heck no!!!!!cliche factor: 4worth your money? absolutely not"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to overated insults good RPG fans everywhere.","review":"This game is overated. The story is confusing. The characthers arn't introduced properly. The story will have you running around the same place for hours. You get killed to easy. The bosses are waaaaaaaaaaaay to easy. Half the stuff in the menus/items you don't even use. All the custimizable features arn't used that much. It's a long game but to easy.

Not as in depth as secret of mana, but still was very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright","review":"Sword of Mana is a fun game too play for a while. But the background music is annoying.

Once you get to the final dungeon (the game is kind of like the legend of zelda) it locks you out and you can never go back!! If there's ever a game without any replay value, no matter how good, I would never get it...That's why I'm always cautious when buying my games, unless, of course, it's a puzzle game, etc. not being able to play those again would be like locking you away from the game. The last thing I have to say about this game is I got my hopes up that it would be like paper mario the thousand year door (read my review) but instead it doesent save at all once you're done beating the game! You're still in that damn final DUNGEON!!!

While Kelly LeBrock was great, the rest of the actors were only passable, at best. The movie doesn't even try to be realistic and goes way, way over the top (including turning somebody into a piece of turd, mutant motorcycle gangs, nuclear missiles in the living room ...). This movie is just an excuse to be goofy - nothing more, nothing less."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word .......................................... CLASSIC","review":"Weird Science follows in the classic John Hughes style. Although it is not an Academy Award winning film, it is still hard to believe that he wrote the film in only 2 days. Weird Science plays on all of the insecurities and fantasies which go along with teen life. One of Bill Paxton's earliest roles, as Chet, is hysterical in his torturing relationship with his brother. The motorcycle gang scene at the end is unforgettable. This is truly a CLASSIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary, I THought U WerE CombINg Ur HaIR?","review":"I could never get enough of this movie, I still think its as funny now as it was then.

But most will immediately recognize Lebrock, the older, experienced beauty that comes to take control of two adolescent high school outcasts. The two quickly become the coolest cats in town via the flattering comments by Lebrock about the two and her mere presence wherever they go. And of course mom and dad just happen to be on vacation, it's the eighties remember? Chet, the older brother, has to be the funniest character.Pure silliness and innocent, adolescent humor you don't see in movies any longer. Get a copy of the DVD while you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ev-ry damn night? On the telephone!","review":"Leonard Maltin be damned, this is a great movie!

Although I loved Lisa meeting \\"The Parents\\" and the great blues bar scene, it's hard to single out any part of this movie as the best - I don't think there's 30 seconds where you won't find yourself at least chuckling. Like some other reviewers, my sister and I have spent the last 10+ years using one liners from the movie on each other - usually to the bewilderment of those around us! Along with Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller, this is a definite must-have for any of us who were teenagers in the 80's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here da kemper.....","review":"I loved this movie. It's a classic and a must have. LeBrock and Hall are amazing. With great key lines and kind of cheesey effects this is a awesome movie for it's time.

There are others but I don't have enough room to put them here. Not since the latest Animal House with the missing \\"Have you seen my rolling papers?\\" line has a DVD release been so disappointing.

The letterbox is botched. I experienced this same problem with the second \\"Back to the Future\\" film and the studio offered a mail in replacement with the correct aspect ratio. To be more specific, the bottom portion of the film is cut off. I noticed this in the kitchen/omelette scene first. I then compared it to my vhs copy and sure enough, the bottom of the film is missing. I returned my copy and got another one and it also has the same problem. Anyway, I contacted Universal and am waiting to hear back if they have a solution for this. You might want to wait if you are as big a fan of this movie as I am. OTHER than that...it is an excellent transfer and still fun to watch (just wish i could see the whole thing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad","review":"I enjoy watching the 80's movies.

It allows me to keep the interior of the RV at about 40-45 degrees in the winter to avoid condensation and freezing. Fortunately, my RV is well insulated (for an RV), so it doesn't have to run very often.I also use the heater to put a load on my backup generator (for the house). Every month, I start the generator, let it warm up, then plug in the heater and turn it on. This puts a nice load on it, which is what you are supposed to do when you excercise a generator.We have been using this heater for about four years and have had absolutely no problems with it.

The only negative comment is that there is no handle with which to move it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ceramic heater","review":"it heats but there's not much way to regulate it, no thermostat or temp guide and compared to other ceramic heaters i own, it's a loser. Better to buy one slightly more expensive and be able to control it better. Also doesn't throw as much heat as I had expected without running at full blast and sucking down electricity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Heater on earth","review":"This is the worst heater available in the market. Don't go by the looks and end up buying a sloppy product. Initially, I found it to be good but after a couple of months the thermostat won't work, and finally itself did not work.Also the product is real danger when it comes to static clothes near the heater.Please dont waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"This item led me to believe it could be used in a bathroomOnly after i purchased item and called Honeywll was i told DO NOT USE INBATHROOM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chose another brand","review":"1. When I open the box. Found there is a loose screw in the heater.Meaning the product quality control has problem.2. There is no handle to hold the heater.3. There is no second heat temperature selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought this would be good because of its small size. However, it shuts itself off within two minutes of operation and it stays off. It must be programmed to be \\"too safe\\" thus it is ineffective. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erratic heater","review":"This heater is unpredictable and works only 1/3 of the time. It was fine in the beginning, but the honeymoon lasted for less than 2 months. I would not recommend this heater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call the fire department!","review":"I bought my Honeywell heater to use in my office in the winter. It worked okay for the first season, but I had it plugged into a power strip and you had to keep checking the strip to make sure it wasn't getting too hot. Even so, one power strip started smoking and burned. A colleague borrowed the heater and plugged it directly into the wall, and later, smoke and sparks started to pour out of the outlet! The electrician said the entire outlet had melted and burned inside the wall. Needless to say, I have now thrown the heater away. I wouldn't recommend this product unless you live next door to the fire station."},{"rating":"1","title":"seems designed to fail prematurely","review":"Since the space for air flow between the metal fins is so fine, this heater becomes completely clogged with dust in two seasons (two winters) of use and effectively becomes useless. Were it designed with cleaning/servicing in mind, this wouldn't be a problem, as all fan-forced heaters become clogged with dust eventually, but this one is RIVETED shut, the rivets being placed down deep holes, making them inaccessible. Reaching the internal works for cleaning without sawing open the unit is impossible. How cynical or incompetent could someone be to design a unit which will so rapidly become unserviceable? Don't waste your money on this model -- choose a heater designed with accessible internal works."},{"rating":"1","title":"This heater overheats?!","review":"This heater simply doesn't work. I bought this heater to keep me warm at work and while it ran fine for the first couple of months, lately, it will run for a short period of time and then it shuts itself off and doesn't come back on. I'm assuming the heating coil is overheating and it is doing so for safety reasons, but when the heater hasn't been running for that long (less than 5 minutes and at a relatively low heat setting), it shouldn't be happening at all. With all the choices out there, I would recommend finding something more reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"For such a small unit, it kicks out quite a lot of heat. Heats a small room quickly. I found noise to be the only drawback."},{"rating":"2","title":"nifty small space heater","review":"The Honeywell Quick Heat Ceramic Heater rapidly warms up the bathroom. It is perfect for showering when heating the whole house isn't necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great until it quits","review":"Worked great for a couple months. I use it in my office (10'x10')to take the morning chill out. But now it will run for a few minutes and then the internal thermostat or circuit breaker trips after a few minutes. It will not turn back on unless I unplug it and let it sit. I can hear and audible click and then I can plub it back in - for a few minutes and the process starts all over again. It is CLEAN too so no issues there. I hate things that only work for a short time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Junk, Bad Service","review":"I would give this piece of junk 0 stars, but you have to give it one. It worked for about a month of light use, and then it stopped. I called customer service at the company, and all they would do is allow ME to pay $10 to ship the piece of junk back to them! So now I've paid twice. DON'T BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for ONE week","review":"I ordered this heater in late January (got it in early February). This heater worked all of one week. I would not recommend it to anyone. It is throwing your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad From the Start","review":"I purchased this product shortly after buying a home with a non-working furnace. I also purchased 2 space heaters from another vendor. The other vendors products have worked as expected (thank god), but the Honeywell space heater was defective from the first. I probably should have dealt with it sooner, but with painting, plumbing, and refinishing floors and all of the chaos that comes with a fixer upper I let it go.It runs well for about 3-5 minutes and then shuts off. I susppect a defective heat turn-off. I called the service number on the bottom of the unit and was told to mail the unit for a replacement. The cost of shipping was to be paid by me. Since this was a cheap unit, and they were going to replace it with another cheap, possibly defective unit, I decided to save the shipping cost and just toss this thing in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I only gave this one star because there was not an option for zero stars. This lasted 3 weeks until it broke. I bought it during the summer, getting ready for winter. By the time I opened the box, my Amazon 30day warranty expired and the manufacturer requires a fee to send it back to them. Long story short, I'd be out another $15 to get this piece of junk replaced. It's not worth more than five dollars new, seriously, it's a total piece of JUNK. I'm sticking to the oil-filled radiator heaters. DeLonghi is the BEST, I've had several of them, each lasts about 5+ years and you can get one for $50 on Amazon, with free shipping. And the oil-filled radiators are alot easier on the electric bill. Don't waste your time on this piece of junk forced-air Honeywell heater. If you decide to take a chance on buying it, be sure to open it Right Away, so that hopefully you'll be covered by your 30day Amazon warranty when it breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 weeks","review":"This heater stopped working after about 2 or 3 weeks of owning it. It was cheap but is a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy...worthless within 5 weeks","review":"As with some of the other bad reviews, this heater stopped working after 5 weeks, with 20 minutes of use per day. Of course, this happens to be outside of the Amazon 30 day return period. So, we are stuck.Altho it comes with the Honeywell name on it, the box indicates manufactured by Kaz."},{"rating":"1","title":"No on off switch","review":"We had to return this heater. The only way to turn it off or on was to plug it in. Also it has a thermostat that that is supposed to automatically adjust when it reaches a certain temperature which really didnt work. It just kept shutting off and on for no apparent reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing... Worst is the noise","review":"The unit is disappointing in that it sells at approx. $30 and provides only one speed and a very unreliable (basically not functioning) thermostat. It also creates much more noise than other similar units I have seen. Over all I would recommend a different buy. It got two stars because like any other comparable heater, it heats a medium room quite fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had it and returned it - serious design flaw","review":"Being so small and light-weight most times its undetected almost. The issue is the front grill and upon starting up, the heater very, very fast heats up and the grill is really, really hot. Consequently, I have had the following issues:a) My son (3 years old) suffered burns in calf (extreme red bruising) when he accidentally touched it.b) My guest had a small dog which cried for 2 hrs after the thing was switched off but fell on her furry backc) Although manual says xx in by yy in to be kept etc., etc. in reality not always possible. I had some small shreads of rug near the thing and detected burn smell.My advice is it's unsuitable for those who have considerable instances where toddlers/children/pets run around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good or even a safe product","review":"The first time we used the space heater it lasted for maybe an hour before something blew and some sparks flew out and blackened the front of it. I would NEVER order this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little heater","review":"I use this heater to heat our sun porch turing the spring and fall, as well as take the chill out of the basement for my morning workouts during the winter - it does a great job, although it is kinda small. If you need to warm up a room-sized area (I'd say up to 16 x 16), this is a wonderful, reasonably priced unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desktop, not floor heater!","review":"Heater works fine, but the controls are on the lower edge of the front, making it difficult (hands and knees) to change temp. Also, no handle at all!!! is a very bad design flaw. How does one pick it up to make changes if getting on the floor is not in your preferred posture profiles. It could have been done easily, keeping the small format, with folding or recessed grip handles. Good if you want to put it on a shelf or desktop or never touch the controls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honeywell HZ-315 Heater","review":"1. The heaters have not on/off switch, just plug it in. Within one week, one of the two heaters do not work when it is plugged in. I guess at the cost, I got what I paid for, but it is poor quality workmanship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Thermostat","review":"The product certainly heats the room as it should, but when it reaches the temperature its set to, it will not stay off for more than one second. therefore, it keeps going on and off on and off, on and off, over and over again. Not a good purchase. I would up sticking it in the living room to use when we have no heat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"Ive had this for 3 years and just bought a second one. I used it in my baby daughter's room since my husband and i prefer it cooler when we sleep/ This seems very safe and I dont worry about fires when used correctly and it maintains a desired temp rather than just spitting out a ton of heat. it is really compact too so youd never notice it in a room. it is also very quiet and the sound you hear is very subtle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell heater","review":"Great little heater, keeps the me warm at work however it is a little noisy.
