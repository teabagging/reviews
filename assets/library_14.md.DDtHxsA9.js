Johnstone is what candy is to food compared to classic literary works. But then I like candy between meals. His hero, Smoke, doesn't have to get the crap kicked out of him before he destroys the villains. You get to thoroughly enjoy his violence by the set up scenes where someone likable and important to Smoke gets tortured/killed/raped though not necessarily in that order.

This word does not even begin to describe this sludge. Stienman has to be the worst producer ever, and shokcingly bad songs like \\"Rock and Roll Dreams\\" indicate that the title of worst writer just may be his too. The succes of this sequel recall the old saying \\"fool me once same on you, fool me twcie same on you.\\"Avoid at any and all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same - only worse","review":"The original \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" held a certain perverse fascination to it. Overblown. Overwrought. Amazingly pretentious and totally devoid of any trace of humor or spontaneity. Listening to it was sort of like watching an accident that you can't prevent. You know it is going to happen, you know it is going to be awful, yet you can't stop yourself from taking part.So when Meat Loaf's career nose-dived after the album exploded in 1978, it was fairly inevitable we would get the sequel, and in 1993 we did. The problem is that by then the whole gimmick had gone from being bizarrely fascinating to being downright unpleasant. This is almost a note for note remake of the first \\"Bat\\" except for the fact that it is even more unpleasant, and doesn't hold that horrific appeal. The songs are bad (understatement) the arrangements bombastic and the whole project is lacking a trace of charm. Forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old, Same Old","review":"After one of the worst albums in music history, \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" became an inexplicable hit in 1978, Meat Loaf's career promptly headed south and straight into the toilet. For fifteen years his was a has-been, and the butt of jokes. All this changed when he essentially re-recorded the album, gave it an equally insipid cover, and topped off this bout of originality by giving it the oh so clever title \\"Bat Out of Hell II.\\" The result? Another inexplicable hit of bad, overwrought songs with bombastic production and screeching vocals.After the dust settled, Meat Loaf's career promptly headed into the toilet once again and as a result one can no doubt assume that \\"Bat Out of Hell III\\" is just around the corner."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This album is one of my favorites - I listen to it every time I go for a long drive.

Although i couldn't really grasp what any of it was about (not that it's especially complex), I've always loved it. Sure, it's pretty corny and ok, it's sung by an ex-fat guy, but every song on this album is fantastic. Years later, after my dad passed away and you and now download music via the internet, this album is still as significant to me as it was nearly 10 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing comeback album","review":"I was introduced to Meat Loaf's music when I was 13, WAAAY back in 1987. I thought that he was great and it was a shame he never relased another album, he and Jim Steinman had so much talent. I also thought he was some one who would never be heard from again. WELL, when Bat out of Hell 2 came out I didn't think it could get any better than Bat out of Hell, but it did. Compared to BOOH, BOOH2 is much more grown up and emotional. I don't know what it is about Meat Loaf, he is just amazing. The passion behind every word he sings and every note and word that Jim Steinman writes is so amazing. Musically, Meat and Jim are truly a match made in heaven, or should I say Hell? This is thier best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"How epic can an album get?","review":"It seems that very epic indeed is the answer. My perverse love of this record is something that's stayed alive for several years, even though I've never even owned it. I think an overdose would be close if the cd would be right there waiting for me to play it. I listen to it when I visit my friend (a Meat Loaf fan), I sometimes borrow it from the library, and every single time it gives me chills. But it's also very exhausting - once you've played the album through, you've had more than enough of wasted youth, teenage love affairs and bats out of God knows where. I don't think this music tells anything of my life (or anyone else's, for that matter)but then again, it doesn't have to. The strength is in its sheer egomaniacal drama. Modesty isn't one of my virtues, either, and I see no reason to admire quietly mumbling basement alt-rock losers."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"The CD and case look like they were used as a hockey puck.

I've always found that interesting about both album as neither one seem to inspire either extreme in me. I've heard better, I've heard worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best male vocalists bar none","review":"I was blown away when I first saw the music video for \\"I'd do Anything For Love\\". Everything about it was impressive. Meat Loaf delivers Steinman's rock opera songs brilliantly with a wonderful dramatic flare. I had been aware of some of Steinman's previous songs: Bonnie Tyler's \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\" and Air Supply's \\"Making Love out of Nothing at all\\". Out of all the songs that he penned I would have to say \\"Making love..\\" is my favorite I bought Bat Out of Hell 1, but I didn't care for it much. The lyrics just didn't appeal to me. Musically, I think Steinman is a genius, but lyrically...... in my opinion, he is hit or miss. A greatly overlooked Meat Loaf album is \\"Bad Attitude\\". He sounds spectacular on it, especially on the John Parr (St. Elmo's Fire) penned \\"Don't Leave Your Mark On Me\\". Worth checking out. All in all, Meat Loaf is one of my favorite male vocalists based on his powerful vocals on those two albums in particular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited & Censored don't bother unless you really need to see it","review":"After the incredibly painful download of this unbox player, the Video is the G rated version, edited & censored, same as on basic cable.

I really liked the various scenes and compromises our heroine was placed in, and if I have one aspect of the book I did not like, it was the seemingly dismissive way in which our mysterious Dom treated our gal after giving so much of herself to him and for him. A scene toward the end brought this home to me, and I would have liked to have seen a bit more care toward her.

It's hard to stay with. The writing is not bad, but the approach is cynical. Actually, it gives me a feeling that the author does not really like females, and is taking out his aggression on the fair sex by these writings. I could do without being so much in the prince's \\"head\\", or the evil fairy's \\"head\\" - especially before bedtime. Nobody wants a rotting princess full of worms, either. What ever happened to the other fairies? They aren't here. I can't read this book before I go to sleep. It's not a soothing experience. It's dark; but some people like that kind of thing. I don't find it to be an erotic book in any sense of the word - it is more aggressive than feeling.

It resembles Murakami's work in that it is set in an international, pop-culture kind of world, a world that makes as much sense to American readers as it does to Japanese readers. And it is a fast, fun, read, while at the same time at least touching on some more serious themes. However, my overall feeling about it is that it lacked the organization and cohesiveness of Murakami's works. It left a lot more just kind of hanging, and it left a lot of interesting ideas only half-developed. Overall though, definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful","review":"This book does not even remotely approach the brillance of Murakami's writing.

In the short run, an extra ratchet strap ($5) around the whole rack, through the two back doors and under the roof will give me all the extra security I need, just in case.Other than that, construction is good.

With strong yet vulnerable characters (just eccentric enough to add the necessary levity to the densely psychological plot), compelling plot twists, and an ending that is just happy enough to satisfy (one couple is reconciled, one is not), Trollope makes you laugh, cry ... and fear for your OWN relationships. A solid, emotional, intelligent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost 5 stars","review":"I love Joanna Trollope's books. She's perceptive and literate. I think her understanding of children in complex families is very well portrayed. My only quarrel with this book is that she let Mark off the hook.

I get both cobalt and periwinkle, and have found that the cobalt shows flaws more readily than the lighter color.Collecting two colors is fun.

These plates have enough surface area not to squeeze your various food groups together.I've ordered from Fiestaware about four times now, and they always package their product with great care: padded on all sides by sheets of heavy, corrugated cardboard the way wine-bottles are shipped.

The book is \\"about\\" a teenage boy, but the overt... in this book makes me wonder if he wrote it FOR teenage boys. I couldn't even finish it, made it halfway through it then dumped it. Yuck!Did his publisher tell him to \\"spice it up\\" next time? Seriously, before you invest in this read some excerpts. Next time he introduces a new book, I'm going to thumb through it first.In the past I always felt comfortable recommending Keillor to friends, family, the man on the street..... not anymore.I've been a longtime lover of Wobegon antics, and this is awful. FYI I'm only 33 and I found this book pointless as well as tasteless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer - the way it used to be","review":"It's hard to tell which parts of this book are the most enjoyable - his exposure to the wiles of the opposite sex through the magazine \\"High School Orgies\\" and the rather basic primer provided him by his cousin Kate - his ongoing battle with his older sister over all kinds of sibling issues - his experience of becoming the newspaper reporter covering the Lake Wobegone Whippets and their talented new pitcher - his observations of the various personal foibles of all manner of friends and relatives - or just the way that Garrison Keilor tells a story. He makes it seem so easy, yet I defy you to sit down and write like he does. You can hear his voice coming off the pages and darned if it isn't more fun than shooting rats at the town dump to just sit there and let him tell you about being 14 in the Summer of 1956. Really!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"while there were instances of humor, mostly the book seemed rather gross. If Garrison's goal was to get into the mind of a sexually obsessed 13 year old (the main character seemed younger than 14 to me), perhaps he achieved success. I was unpleasantly surprised. It seemed overworked: it certainly was an effort to read it. At least I bought it on sale. If you are new to Garrison's work, please, read anything else he has written!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lake wobegpm summer 1956","review":"Disappointing. Someone recommended At Home it Mitford, which I finished before beginning Keillor's latest book. Although I am a great fan of Keillor's short stories and We are Still Married, this one doesn't compare. Why all the sex talk--I, for one, am not interested in what makes him go! Mitford was so sweet and well-written- much better written. I'd recommend it rather than this last Wobegon book. Sorry! I'll reread the old books about Lake Wobegon. I didn't like K's last novel either. He's better with short stories about others."},{"rating":"1","title":"If This Is A Novel Then Where's The Story?","review":"Apparently Keillor has been writing so long that he thinks a bunch of bathroom humor and the crude sexual thoughts of a 14-year-old boy can hold our interest for almost 300 pages just because it has his name on the cover. Perhaps there was a deadline to meet or Keillor needed the advance for his sex therapy. The book is obviously autobiographical since the main main character is named Gary, a wannabe writer growing up in Minnesota. It's too bad, since Keillor at his best is capable of clever, intellectual and thoughtful work that can keep a fan spellbound. If this is Lake Wobegon then where are all the characters and situations that readers and radio listeners have come to love or at least cherish for all their familiar foibles? Or maybe like a lot of formerly brilliant writers, he's now a runaway train in need of a good editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever, humorous writing.","review":"What a wonderful book! The use of language and timing has always been Garrison's strong point, and this novel seems like an exercise in bringing everything he's learned over the years together. It's a very speedy read for almost 300 pages with a breezy, carefree style and astute attention to what would be the primary interests of a yound teen boy in 1956. Garrison's dry humor shines brightly in many passages. Those who don't see what purpose the crude \\"bathroom humor\\" serves in this work haven't much vision. As always with Garrison's work, he shines a light delicately through the paper-thin mask of religious fundalmentalism to show the anxious creatures underneath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a PG-17 Rating!","review":"Please be warned: If you enjoyed family style listening to Keillor's older feel-good radio-style vinettes of Lake Wobegon, such as \\"Faith\\", \\"Rhubarb,\\" and the like, DON'T play this for the family without reviewing it first. You are in for a suprise.Garrison has made off-color jokes in his monologues to a degree before, but not to this degree, freely talking about erections and much more here.And if he's not talking about the sexual awakings of boyhood, it seems he's giving a backhand jab to the \\"Sanctified Brethren.\\"I tried, I really tried to pass over those parts (as I was listening to it on CD,) but they came so frequently, I just had to turn it off and leave it alone.Hopefully, Keillor will unburden himself in this CD, and get back to the family-oriented wholesomeness that I had come to love him for."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"I've purchased Keillor's audio tapes for years. I haven't listened to the show lately and maybe I should. In the past I've found Keillor to be funny, poignant and nostalgic. This book, obviously autobiographical to some degree, is none of the above. It was not only a waste of money but a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This Lake Wobegon?","review":"Since when do all the Lake Wobegon husbands cheat on their wives and teenage lust is transformed to unnecessary pornography. The writing is nice but the story weak and uneven. It's no wonder this book got panned in the press. And it's a shame since Keillor is wonderful at rendering nostalgia, human quirks and frailties in a way that is so comforting and yet makes us laugh at ourselves. I have the sneaking suspicion that Keillor's editors just publish whatever he writes rather than make useful suggestions regarding plot and tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept -- but ultimately disappointing","review":"Sorry! This should have been a great book. Started with an interesting concept and characters, but did not deliver the goods. Lack of plot. Just meandered around Lake Wobegon and didn't really succeed in holding my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely BORING!!!!","review":"This book is DEFINITELY NOT one of Garrison Keillors best. This book rambles on and on and was sooooooo boring I almost quit reading it many times! I've read and loved all of his other books but this was a big dissapointment. Save your money and spend it on another of his books. I decided to complete the book only to say that I read the whole, entire, boring piece and about the only good thing in the book was the ending! Hopefully GK will come out with something that is more Lake Wobegon again soon. I was disappointed, but will read more books of his in the future I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven -- not GK's best.","review":"This was a real disappointment. I've enjoyed Keillor's other books, as well as PHC, but this book was uneven and just not engaging. There didn't seem to be a discernable plot and it was a struggle to get through the book without losing interest entirely. I recommend you skip this book and read one of his other gems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened to continuity?","review":"As a longtime book reviewer at a midwestern newspaper I have read (and reviewed) much of Keillor's work. It's wise for Keillor to write about Lake Wobegon a.k.a. small town America with all the requisite quirkiness, nostalgia, etc. That's what his audience wants and expects. However, he should also be respectful of this promise. Suddenly LW is populated with husbands who constantly cheat on their wives and girlfriends, and his charming and lyrical pages have become filled with unnecessary pornography. I imagine Keillor's work floats through a publishing house relatively untouched, and that's fine as far as his wonderful prose goes, but a brave editor should have helped him sharpen the storyline to offer more reader satisfaction and to maintain LW continuity. Despite landing on the bestseller list, this book received mostly bad reviews (\\"USA TODAY,\\" \\"The New York Times\\") and I believe these two things would have saved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just As Funny As Ever","review":"Get a grip.

Chock full of boyhood angst, baseball, religion, flatulence jokes and sexual fixation, Keillor elicits memories from his flock of loyal readers and creates a pseudo-memoir that stirs echoes of Bill Bryson's Life & Times of the Thunderbolt Kid and David James Duncan's The Brothers K. High praise for this author and much deserved. If you're a man (especially one who grew up pecking away at his own Underwood) between the ages of 30 and 60, Lake Wobegon Summer 1956 is a 'must read'.

Also, the gritty reality and attention to details help to make Wilf Brim's universe real in the readers mind. Overall this book is an outstanding read alone or beginning to a series.If I had to make a complaint about this book I would have to say that the author does not give enough information on Wilf's background.

This album has some of his greatest compositions, but shows some flaws also. Robbie was an intuitive: always put vision first & technique a far second (\\"Guitar Soli\\" has several of his greatest early compositions, but also some downright funky messes from the first recordings). \\"Pavan\\" is among his most raga-like; \\"Pasha\\" is most santur-like. At the risk of sounding New Agey (Robbie was a true wayfarer, not interested in channeling entities or sweet substitutes) I hope you might approach his music with the expectation of meeting a person of deep heart and pure intention, trying to see the highest peak man can aspire to, and let his wings help you up a ways...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, thought provoking, terrifying and uplifting","review":"It begins with a sketch about a wedding that seems more like a funeral, and ends with a sketch about a funeral that seems more like a wedding.I must have seen this movie over a dozen times over the last several years. It's the only movie I've ever repeatedly rented as often as I have. I keep looking and hoping that it will be less expensive or come out on DVD but I'm still disappointed that that is not the case.

After using a digital projector w/DVD player, and seeing super high-res picture on a 4x8' screen in my living room, there's no way I can go back to VHS and TV.So where's the DVD for one of my favorite movies? They can transfer everything of Kurosawa's except this masterpiece? Let's get with the program.-- JJ"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting and very slow...","review":"When I read the very positive reviews,I was planning to buy it straight away, well fortunately I rented it first.I thought this movie was really slow it seemed to drag on and on.For example, lots of times somebody is walking to a place, or just standing still for minutes long, and you could get the pointafter 30 seconds or something.The visuals of the movie were ok and sometimes very original, the effects I remember the best were the of the man walking in Van Gogh paintings.The stories are filled with various lessons and philosophies about live, but somehow a lot of this felt cliched.I think I understood the deeper meaning of most of the stories, but it failed very much to impress. It was as if I had heard or read these lessons about the destructivity of the human speciesfor example, lots of times. That's my main reason, I seemed to already know that, and now somebody is repeating it for me in some dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well filmed, but very heavy-handed","review":"Dreams was very well filmed, but the message was horribly heavy-handed and not feasable.Being at one with nature is nice, but ignoring the realities of modern life and its luxuries is foolish.I was bored during the first half and offended during the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pontificating trumps storytelling sublety","review":"This anthology of short films by the great director Akira Kurosawa based on his dreams reveals a deep concern for the relationship between man and nature. As one would expect, there are many extraordinary visuals on display here. The first vignette, in which a young boy enters the forest on a rainy day in the hope of witnessing a wedding of foxes, begins the film beautifully. It is startling, mysterious, and fearsome; the boy can be seen as a representative of all mankind, intruding thoughtlessly on the natural world without care for the consequences...and unprepared for those consequences when they come. Unfortunately, while the quality of the visuals remains high, the stories become increasingly preachy and obvious as the film wears on. Only one, concerning a group of mountain explorers that has lost the base camp, approaches the quality of that stunning first episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope it's worth the wait","review":"I've been waiting for Dreams to come out on DVD ever since I got my DVD player. It's movies like this (grand and visually stunning, like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY) that are real must-haves for a DVD collection. I have seen Dreams several times on video tape (unfortunately, I've never seen it in the theater) and hope that the DVD doesn't disappoint.Let the beautiful and poetic stories wash over you. Don't look too hard for literal meaning, rather enjoy the vignettes as sort of visual poems or music. This is one of my all time favorite movies and I can't wait to see it on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Color and Inspiring Imagery","review":"I wish I were eloquent enough to convey just how much I loved and apprecciated the feelings this movie evoked in me when I watched it the first time. Each dream or vignette is distinct and yet somehow connected. My favorite was the 'peach orchard' segment. It was so stunningly beautiful it brought me to tears. The colors were unparalleled and the message was clearly yet sensitively conveyed. It is not a movie with the traditional beginning, middle and end. It is separate 'dream' sequences that fit together in an unusual but highly effective way. I love all of Kurosawa's movies, but this is a special piece I will hold in my heart forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A trip through a genius' dreams","review":"With an eight-stories sequence, Kurosawa expresses the magic of chilhood, the importance of perseverance and resistance, the beauty created by Van Gogh, war and atomic menace unleashed spreading their horror, and, last but maybe most important, hope an joy when the travel finishes. A film not to be seen once but many times, and getting amazed on each."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of if not the best.","review":"This is one of if not the best movie ever. It's incredibly sweet, well done, and in many ways dream like. Kursasawa has a knack for making quality movies and this is no exception. It's not some clashing action thriller, nor is it a Baron Munchaussen, but it still is oddly enough very catchy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzz...","review":"After reading all the glowing reviews here I was really expecting something much, much better. I found this film mind-numbingly boring. Like another reviewer said, it's like watching a screen saver for a couple of hours. But this is just my opinion. Obviously, many people found this film enjoyable, but it's not for everyone. I'll give it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contemplation","review":"After reading the video cover I wondered how one man can sum up our dreams, but Akira Kurosawa sums up our worried dreams (if not all dreams are worries).There is a visionary visual glimpse into what might happen with our nuclear situation, with demons feeding off each other and realistical portrail of horrific chemicals. Childish innocence is shown in the opening 'dream', man's strife and wars are visual treats along with Martin Scorsese as Vincent Van Gogh. But Kurosawa does not leave the train of thought unfinished. He shows us an idelic simple living that makes surprising sense but it is something moderns will have difficulty swallowing.As in early Kurosawa films the stories are there leaving us to wonder but his last works are visual contemplations of this hellish world. The lack of conversations may leave some fidgeting but look beyond smallness and understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"guess my attention span isn't sufficient to appreciate this.long waits for any action.the visuals are stunning at intervals and are worth the priceof admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreams","review":"I have nothing but respect for director Akira Kurasawa. The only Japanese director I know by name. Like every other movie of his that I have seen, this is Japanese with English subtitles. Eight interrelated stories for a total of two hours. I watched two stories. 30 minutes, or 1/4 of this film. Still bored, I gave up. His use of the colors of nature was positively breathtaking, but I just got bored. Every color of the rainbow, I suppose, since the cover plus what little dialogue I read leads me to believe that's a unifying theme. I also read on the jacket what this film \\"is about,\\" and I'm with him. But, well, I didn't watch it. I may have just been in the wrong mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dream come true","review":"This movie features some of the most beautiful images I have ever viewed, in a movie or otherwise. Kurasawa is a genius, not only as a storyteller but as an illustrator.

Elusive and emotional, this movie is a masterpiece in every aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"No others quite like it!","review":"A film to watch over and over. The haunting quality of many of the scenes have stayed with me for years.

It is actually a series of eight short movies depicting a dream. Given an even chance, and a little time to think outside the expectations of a typical modern movie; I think this movie can be quite entertaining and thought-provoking. It is fascinating to explore the mysterious world of dreams, as doctors Freud and Jung have so impressed upon modern society. The color and Japanese feel of this movie are a tribute to the artistic talents of the reknowned director."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out There..","review":"Good as far creative film, but hard to watch if you are looking for a plot.

To be clear, I agree with the sentiments, but I found this preaching, not dramatizing. I found Scorsese's van Gogh annoying, particularly in his speaking in English when the rest of the dream was in French. And I found the pace glacial (pun intended, regarding \\"The Blizzard\\"). The cinematography is terrific, but steer clear, especially if you find long shots with little to no action boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Childhood","review":"A silly inept movie made by Kurosawa in his dotage.

I don't think I'd recommend this for beginners. It mainly deals with 4 languages at once. Html, ASP, C# and SQL. I've had experience with SQL, HTML, and C# previously.

The fact that is such an easy read makes it all that much better.I have read some other harsh reviews. In all fairness, this book is geared toward someone new to web application development. Murach tries to encompass what would take about 4 books and much development time if one were to become an expert in web application development.If you are interested in learning the basics of web app development, this is good place to start.

It is definitely one of my favorite all time books. I sometimes have to go back like once a year and read it all over again. I drove my husband nuts with it, because he isn't as much of a reader as I am and so I would start reading some of the quotes from it. Since he is a humorist himself he enjoyed the smart alecky comments that many of these classical curmudgeons either wrote or said, and still managed to get away with it. What is so astounding is that many of the humorous sayings still make sense today, out of context. Winokur did some decent research on these people and provided some information into why these people had such acid tongues. But he doesn't overdo it, but rather leaves the quotations to speak for themselves. A good late night giggler of a book! Karen L. Sadler.

This started as a 'bathroom book' in my house, but I soon found myself hooked and spent half an afternoon reading it straight through. The occasional biographies of and interviews with some of the featured curmudgeons are a nice touch. Unfortunately the text is rather seriously marred by frequent errors; you would think the curmudgeonliness of the book's spirit would extend to a discernment in typesetting, but apparently not.

Let's just say that I didn't end up giving the book to my friend.Instead of pure quotes (as you are led to believe by previewing the first few pages), Winokur has included his own 'analysis' of why he thinks each quote is humourous, or insightful. Sure, he knows the back story of many, but his conveying of said back story is unerringly long-winded and desperate in his attempt to be sycophantic to the celebrity.You want quotes? Look elsewhere.

Found it to be absolutely useless during a round at another course. Turns out that all of the flags were changed to reflective white for the demo. On a real course, cannot give yardage to a flag beyond 100-125 yards if the color of the flag is not white. Very weak laser mechanism, frequently cannot give distances to bunkers. Good for yardages to trees if you aim 10-20' feet up at the foliage, not the trunks.Returned this unit and compared the Bushnell Yardage Pro Tour and Pinseeker 1500 w&w;/0 slope. Yardage Pro Tour is also useless for golf. Either version of the Pinseeker 1500 is terrific and what a rangefinder should be. Purchased Pinseeker 1500 w/slope.

The great beginning showed promise, but the book simply lost coherency. I didn't believe the characters' motivations (particularly Marianne, the nun), didn't much care about the lead players (especially Denton), couldn't sustain interest (Opus Dei just kind of faded away and Beckwith seemed inserted for a confusing scene of two), and didn't buy into the twists and turns of the plot.

Unfortunetly, I only liked the single (#1 on the cd), the rest basically sound the same and that harp music at the beginning is a bit too much. There's one thing I am not in favor of. I bought my 10-yr old the cd. Never in my dreams did I think JLO would stoop to say this in one of the songs: \\"play my mother f-cken song\\".

The song Play proves she doesn't. Hearing her squeaky irritating voice whine over uninspired computer generated beats is about as much fun as listening to screeching tires all day. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Jennifer Lopez CD to date!","review":"I absolutely love this album from Ms. Lopez. It has a lot of songs on it that are great for partying to, and cool ballads as well. My favorite tracks on here are : Love Don't Cost A Thing, I'm Real(remix and original versions), Play, Walking On Sunshine, Cariño, Ain't it Funny, Come Over, Dance With Me, Secretly, Dame,and Si Ya Se Acabo (both great Spanish tracks). I would definetly recommend buying this album if you like Jennifer's music, or if you just want a CD that you can party to.The duet with Chayanne and collaboration with Ja Rule make this a really cool collection of music. Trust me, you won't regret buying this, even if you don't like Jennifer Lopez."},{"rating":"2","title":"she's my role model","review":"i really love J-Lo.... she's not only beautiful, but she also makes her own clothes, and she is just so independent...all though it seems her love life isn't to good... but hey, thats between her and whoever shes with...ain't any of our business...well she's just an outstanding woman...and talk about a good actrss....man...she's everything. Anybody who were to say different is just jealous...girls don't need to bag, they need to give her props cause she's got style.. well i think eveybody should know..how much she has accomlished...and i hope to see her do alot more, but hey, whatever makes her happy...well J-Lo is a beautiful succesful woman...and i diffently look up tp her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, we gotta talk","review":"well, i gotta say this is one of her better albums.

It has a few catchy R&B tracks such as 'Love Don't Cost A Thing' and 'I'm Real'. 'Secretly' sounds like a song better sung by Janet Jackson, and 'Walking on Sunshine' needs heavier bass to accentuate the song. Don't expect a fun rhythm of her debut's 'Feel So Good', Latin romancing 'No me ames', club beating 'Waiting for Tonight'. But then, a real artist won't want to do the same thing twice (or more), she deserves a credit for accepting vocal-challenging songs and another for her cutting-edge appearance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap!","review":"This is arguably a piece of crap masquerading as music. Lopez's voice was awful and sounds infantile. Unlike her debut effort, there's not one catchy tune in this collection. And what's the deal with the Puerto Rican accent??? She definitely needs to take voice lessons or just stick to acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"oh man what is up with these people who act and think they can sing they just plain [stink]. go back and get some vocal lessons lopez. and whats up with you sayin the \\"n\\" word in \\"i'm real\\" if you ain't black you just think your all that but you ain't i had nothing against you until you started this singing carrer. i ruined your career sorry. you lost a lot of fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can have mine","review":"Big mistake.

The other songs are typical gangsta lingo, with the typical references to material items like cars and Rolex etc. The only decent and artistic song in there is \\"Ain't it funny\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"bonito","review":"I think this a awsome album because it show where the hispanics heritages will go and will be.

Unless this cd doesn't have this word on it. Anyway, if play didn't have that word it would be a decent song. Also Walking on sunshine and the 1st track is pretty good.

I give 2 stars for the 3 ok songs and for effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip!","review":"Now I know you guys are probably sick of hearing that Jennifer Lopez wants to be Madonna. I was sick of hearing it to until I heard this album. This album secures the fact that Jennifer Lopez is a Madonna impersonator. One of the many catchy songs on the album called \\"Play\\" was written probably after her record company saw Madonna's single \\"Music\\" being one of the best selling singles of the year and spending a month at number 1. The recalection is scary. \\"Hey Mr DJ 'Play' my record!\\" The song is so sad it makes me actually laugh out loud when I hear it. No I will openly admit that this album is extremely catchy and will probably sit well with lots of people. However what upsets me is the lack of originality! I am not saying that someone need to inspire a nation with a record but if you are going to sing a song about nothing atleast sing it first! All in all I am extremely upset with this record as I rated \\"On the 6\\" with 4 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible C.D.!","review":"I hate having the same first name as Jennifer Lopez!

And for those who think she's not a diva like she says....try working with her! oh brother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get real","review":"I feel the same as just about everyone here. While Jlow is a competent actress, in my opinion, she couldn't carry a note in a bucket. In addition, I think it is incredibly low of her to sing \\"I'm Real\\" then to find out that Ashanti sang the hook and they put in Jlow's voice with it later to make her sound good, because again, (in my opinion) she couldn't carry a note in a bucket. That is NOT real. Sorry. I was proud of her too, as a fellow Hispanic woman, and thought that she was finally giving her all into her music, then I felt like I was duped. I guess she's still acting, even when she sings. Just one listener's opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"this cd is awesome. i'm really glad J.Lo came out with a second cd it is just as good as the first or better. so far the best song is still \\"love don't cost a thing\\" she is a very talented person with acting, dancing, and singing. go J.Lo."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.

Her other CD's are good, but this one tops it off. (It is one of my favorite top five CD's on my shelf. I have 146.) Go Jennifer! The songs have excellent lyrics, you can't pull away from catching on! They are excellent lyrics, and as I said, you can catch on and learn them very fast. I would give her CD 4 stars out of 5 because it is not the best in the world, but it would deserve an A-. I would still reccoment that you spend how ever much money you have to, and ge the CD.

Yes, her image her changed it is a shame her talent had to too. She fails the audience in so many ways with this album. The songs are short, harsh, and to mainstream to be enjoyed anywhere else but on the radio. It is sad the first album made me believe she had talent seemed like a fluke"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's your voice, JLo?","review":"I really like Jennifer in movies. She's beautiful and has a depth and quality that I admire. She's mysterious and can handle herself with total confidence. In front of the camera, that is. On this CD, she hides behind so much technical mixing and erotic-robotics, that you can't even hear her voice on a lot of the tracks. Pitiful. I did not like this CD at all. Even her slow songs don't show the true depth of the quality her voice actually has when you hear it on a movie. I wouldn't have even known it was her except she's pictured on the front of the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"~J.LO~","review":"J.LO did a very great job making this CD, i'am so happy she did...all songs are great except i'm not much fan of her ballads, i'm mostly a fan of her fast upbeat songs like 'Love Don't Cost A Thing' which is my favorite song and 'I'm Real' is also my second favorite song....so if for those of you who'm don't already have this CD please get it, and if you don't already have 'On The 6' (Which i have it) then get both:-)!I hope this review was helpful to those of you who don't have the CD yet...C ya, later."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.LO","review":"what can I say????

Top quality songs!!","review":"This is a great second release for Jennifer Lopez. It was obviously very well produced. Quality arrangement of songs, you can listen to every song with out skipping through to your favorites. Quality and arrangement resemble a Janet Jackson album. I love the releases on the radio, but I got much more from the entire album.This CD is not just for the MTV generation. The Latin influence makes for a great collection of songs. Highly recommended for the X generation and baby boomers too. Way to go J.Lo-San Francisco, CA"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment","review":"This album just can't compare to her first and is a real letdown. No real energetic rythmns just bland semi R&B stuff. The only track s worth listening to are the Spanish ones and even then only \\"Qué Ironía\\" is anything like the standard of her first album. Jennifer has let fame go to her head and she believes her own hype rather than concentrating on quality music. My advice - Don't buy it. There are much better artists to spend your money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok...not really","review":"I was one of the millions of people who bought this album.

Her albums only prove that the music industry is not about talent anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Way to Sell Albums...","review":"When Jennifer Lopez first released \\"J.Lo\\", I ran out and bought it, enjoying every single track. Now she rereleased it with the \\"I'm Real\\" Murda Remix. Since the single is not available for sale in the US, the only way to get it is through the internet or by combing the import bins. I will honestly say that I spent time combing the import bins rather than to buy the same album because it would've been a waste of money to spend money on the same album +1 song. That money was well spent on the import cd single that had the remix w/ Ja Rule, the radio edit, and 3 unreleased dance mixes. I'm really disappointed that JLo would do something like this to raise her album's status on the Billboard charts - especially since it began to slip before the rerelease. Any respect I had for JLo as an artist all but disappeared. This is all I got to say to JLo: \\"Great way of milking more money out of your devoted fans. And you said that love don't cost a thing. Was that a lie?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Real","review":"Ms. Lopez may be a good actress no doubt. However, as a singer, she falls short & is not the singing \\"Diva\\" some categorize her as.

She has influenced those in the music industry, including her ex-beau \\"Puffy\\" Thanks to him & other talented music producers, her albums have been successful. They are the ones that write the songs, her backups sing great as opposed to her squeaky voice. For those crying out \\"Haters\\" or criticizing the opinions of others, let's not go as far as name calling. Afterall, everyone is entitled to their own opinions including yours.

J Lo on the other hand should consider acting only. I think she does better in that area but to compare her to Janet Jackson is just an insult to the \\"diva\\" whom has earned much credit for her singing talent.

J.Lo doesn't sing any on the hooks, somebody sings them for her and all she says is a \\"ooh,\\" or a little \\"ah.\\" They must've realized this \\"talent\\" couldn't sing. The songs off of this album are great, and my favorite songs are \\"Love Don't Cost A Thing,\\" \\"We Gotta Talk,\\" \\"Come Over,\\" \\"That's Not Me,\\" \\"Dame (Touch Me,\\" and \\"Si Ya Se Acabo,\\" I can't believe I started to like spanish music.

She has a TON of them does she not? Well, I'm a woman who sees her for exactly what she is...a very talented and beautiful actress that should stick to the silver screen. I think this woman is EXTREMELY overrated, especially when it comes to her singing. Her TRUE talent lies in her ability to market herself and keep the public's eye on her...in her private life as well as professional. Her second CD is mediocre at best. I agree with another reviewer when he said that some of the lyrics of her songs are downright cheesy, and you get the feeling on some of these tracks that you've heard the lyrics before, only somewhere else! Again I agree with the other reviewer when he says save your money, they will play these songs to death on the radio!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disaster!","review":"What an horrible album. No voice. No sound. No emotions. Just another vehicule for a prefab starlet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of the worst songs I've ever heard","review":"I really loved \\"On the 6\\", but this second album is a real let down. My tastes are more of the trendy dance/pop songs that her first album had, and now \\"J.Lo\\" seems more into the HipHop/R&B style that I don't fancy. If you are into that style, then do definitely give it a listen. But I don't understand how some people here have reviewed her songs saying that her \\"lyrics are great\\" with \\"dancable tunes\\". For example, the song \\"Come Over (#7) is this slow, methodical tune that goes \\"I love ... when you.. come ...over, please come over ... and when you come, it gives me fever\\" & try to imagine this sung over 30 seconds of a slow beat, rediculous. Jennifer L doesn't have much of a voice (as many others here have mentioned) and when the songs are weak, her voice really shows through. When someone is as multi-talented as her, you have to realize that a lot of the credit has to be given to the producers, writers and mixers. What a dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh","review":"Jennifer Lopez is a prime example of what is wrong with the music industry. She cannot sing, write songs, or produce.

Lo isn't so real because she took her I'm real song right from Mariah's \\"If we\\" song with Ja Rule. Jennifer Lopez is not a talented singer. She is just trying to be something she's not. If it wasn't for Mariah, J. Lo's singing career would still be where it started. She would have never made the \\"I'm Real\\" remix because she has no mind of her own! SERIOUSLY Save your money...this girl is definantly not real! Go out and buy the REAL thing, MARIAH CAREY \\"GLITTER\\".

But I have to agree with another reviewer that she really can't sing at all. Plus, this album, like the others, is just mostly machine generated sounds, therefore not music. It is obviously purposefully manufactured with the only intention of selling as many cds as possible. Guess what? Given the ignorant musical climate of recent years and with her formidable physical beauty, that is not too difficult. Its the image that sells. To me, J.Lo's greatest talent is dancing, and second to that, acting. She could be a great choreographer/dance coach, and also an actress. That would make you rich enough, wouldn't it? Oh, well, long live good looks and the too-much-money-is-never-enough-so-lets-get-as-filthy-rich-as-possible mentality."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.Lo - Real Low","review":"Seeing the new Jennifer Lopez album and all its hype, I was expecting a really good CD. Obviously, Jennifer Lopez is not a serious singer, but her songs are usually pretty decent. (Digital enhancement works wonders these days.) However, it seems that not even some major tweaking could help this crummy album. The songs - many written by J.Lo herself, along with 'Puffy' Combs - are unoriginal and boring. The two best songs are \\"Play\\" and \\"Dame\\", but otherwise, no songs really ring the bell. J.Lo sounds like she wishes she were the next Janet, but before she gains diva status, she sound learn how to put some feeling into her songs. Not to mention, some tone in her voice. Sorry J.Lo - your love may not cost a thing, but your CD may have cost you your \\"singing\\" career."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked the first one better","review":"On the 6 is a good mix of English and Latin music and has a balance of ballads and dance songs. J.Lo, however, sounds like a confused mix of somebody else's songs in one album. Destiny's Child, Janet Jackson, Madonna seems to be the influence behind her songs. I had a feeling that she's trying to be someone she isn't. In the On the 6 album, I loved her dance songs but equally adored her slower selections like No Me Ames. Songs like these are conspicously absent in this album. Which is a shame, really!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover your ears.","review":"One of the worst \\"singers\\" of all time....do not waste your money.....bad..bad..bad,how can anybody listen to this crap...0 stars and less."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the weakest voices i've ever heard","review":"You really don't realize how weak her voice is until you listen to her lesser known songs.

Apparently Miss Diva thinks her voice suits ballads as well. Well, let me tell u something Jelly: YOU ARE NOT, AND I REPEAT, YOU ARE NOT MARIAH CAREY! Get over it. Needless to say her latest \\"ballad\\" never got any airplay.That's it, save your money, don't spend it on a Jello CD.

I find this album underproduced and way too poppy. Instead of going for her own sound, Jennifer decided to just go with the trend. I love \\"Love Don't Cost A Thing\\" but it is no near as strong as any of the singles off On the 6. On The 6 seemed better produced and better put together. The album seemed much more professional, and had better songs. The music sounds like much more effort was put into On the 6, then onto J. Lo. J Lo sounds like it was put together in 1 or 2 months...I think Jen should have spent more time working on it, and should have recorded better quality songs. I suggest that you buy the single of Love Don't Cost A Thing, and don't buy this album. Stick with the first one, and if you already own it, you'll be disapointed by this.

Jennifer Lopez is a fine actresse and she shouldve stuck to it just like many actors are trying to do, branch out to music, but fail miserablly. I can't really call Jennifer Lope- err i mean J LO a failure after the millions of copies sold of her album, but it fails to hit the soft spot in hip-hop which it sounded like she was aiming for. Jennifer Lopez never really had any vocal talent to begin with but this album dims her vocals so much more and all thats to pay attention to is the dull beat in every song.

The only decent song is play. This song should say that it features christina milian. The rest of the songs are annoying. Jennifer lopez proves everyone that she is no better a songwriter than she is a singer, for example:come over - This showcases jennifers lack in talent and songwriting skills. Her vocals are lacking quality, and style.carino - In this song she only sings the verses (which she does in 90 percent of all the songs on the album, such as play, and aint it funny)Jennifer lacks in telling us that it is christina milan singing in the chorus of play.

She may be a great girl.But honestly, if she writes one more song about how real she is, or how she is the same old 'Jenny from the block',' I swear I will [*insert harsh expressive term here*] It gets old so fast. I am surprised her label isn't telling her the same thing. There's another wildly popular girl singing the same songs over and over again, and she's been relegated to the pre-teen set (and to that of older guys who get no booty). If this keeps up, we'll see that happen to Ms. Lopez sooner than we think.The best thing I can say is at least she hasn't gone the way of Ms. Carey...Jenny, hon, as much as we all love hip-hop (I was raised on it, so I'm not hatin'), try something new, or stick to the big screen.P.S. It's true, she does sound perfect with Ja Rule.

Anyway, without the cussing, I would probably give this album 4 stars because some songs are good. I like, Walking on Sunshine, Play ( clean version), I'm real original and remix and more.

Well, I certainly have done a 360. Ever since the release of \\"Love Don't Cost A Thing\\", I can't stop getting enough of Jennifer. I will have to say that I am thoroughly impressed with \\"J.Lo\\". Majority of the songs make you want to get up and dance. If you are into ballads, this cd is probably not for you. I am also amazed that she wrote 7 out of the 15 songs on here. That always wins bonus points in my book. My favorite song so far is \\"Play\\".

If she spent more time trying to be creative instead of selling out and showing us that behind that has its own zip code then maybe, just maybe, this would have been a better cd...but as it is...it isn't worth the money i paid for it, but if you like cheesy, overproduced, tired pop then this is the cd for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wack album (hate to say it)","review":"I hate to say it, but this album was way wack.

The manual says that there is a 1 year warranty on the product, so I called RCA/Thompson/whatever, and told them my problem. After a few troubleshooting exercises, we determined that the headphones receiver was broken. They then proceeded to tell me that they aren't honoring any warranties on their wireless products.

Nope, not even close. While the headphone is comfortable, and looks pretty snazzy, this thing contains a lot of static. It will also intermittently pause and zone out, no matter how close you are to the antennae. The range is a joke. After 20 feet, it'll basically turn on and off. It's just a terrible product, and the only benefit I got was the knowledge that RCA actually has the gall to release such a shoddy product, so I can avoid that company from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst headphones ever","review":"There is always a horrible static sound. If you move or breathe to heavily the sound will cut out. Sometimes blinking is enough to make sound cut out.

Example of what American fiction should be. This is the kind of writing one expects in anthologies on how to write.

That's exactly what I thought upon tasting it. It tastes like a combination of pickles and olives, which isn't an inedible combination, but not one I expected or particularly wanted. The part that made it almost inedible was the salt, and that's coming from someone who enjoys processed foods. This was just over-the-top salty. I'm just going to throw the stuff away.

The Classico product has almost 50% more salt in the same size serving, relative to the Buitoni pesto.I have nothing against salt, or salty foods, but the amount of salt in this Classico pesto is unjustifiable and may well spoil your dish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!

The weird taste is very strong - I added only a little bit to a large bowl of noodles (I had a hunch it was going to be bad once I opened the jar, the smell is very powerful), and luckily I had other good brands of pesto around to try to save the pasta - yet you could still taste this gross pickle pesto because it's so strong and weird.

Forget the plot, as there really isn't one.Suffice to say, if you watch this film, you'll see why Peckinpah had the final cut taken away from him on all his other films.BTW, the only reason I give this film one star is that it's the lowest I could go."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books on careers/resumes ever","review":"It's hard to believe that such a book remains on the market.

I went back to the store where I bought it at (REX TV), and was told there was nothing they could do to help me. Next, I called Westinghouse support,and was told the same thing,and that they only service TV's still under warranty.

The frank discussion of serious social issues is done in a mix of hilarity and seriousness. The family of five combines reality and fantasy, cutting through false assumptions and pitting reality against stupidity. It deals with everything from anti-union employers to Robby's fling with steroids and teenage insecurity about 'size' issues reduced to a discussion of the daughter's tail. Most episodes have several plot lines working together.

So when I heard it was coming to DVD, and I had to buy them. The characters were well written and acted, and the storylines were great. Each episode had a underlying story of some sort, and a message to pass onto the viewers. But unlike many sitcoms, the way it was presented was very different.As mentioned by a few other reviewers, Earl and Roy are very similar to the charcters from the Honeymooners. Whether they were modeled after them or not (pretty close), they were still different. So, to say this is a rip of that show, is vastly over simplifying things.I throughly enjoyed the show as I was perusing through the episodes, and managed to laugh at almost all of them. Other than Farscape, I cannot think of a better show using Jim Henson's puppets to this high degree of performance. The humor is still just as good today as it was then, and recommend getting this show to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Dinosaurs!","review":"The product was brand new when I got it, my only problem, which isn't the sellers problem, was that the DVD's have a glitch to them.

Kudos to the authors for figuring out how to use fondant for cookies. However, if I tell you to buy fondant, roll it, cut it with the same cookie cutter, adhere it to the cookie with corn syrup and decorate with royal icing -- you don't need to buy the book.The photography is beautiful, but the book didn't inspire me as other decorating books have. If you are a fondant novice, this may not be the book for you as it lacks detailed instructions. I would also recommend practicing with royal icing before you begin your cookie project. Some designs use royal icing flowers, but there are no instructions about how to make them. These can be purchased at a cake decorating store or you can use other resources to learn to pipe them.I was looking forward to this book, but it has turned out to be a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea- don't need an entire book","review":"Several people already commented about this.

Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients. They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food. This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school. Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.

And NS has grown on me more and more, especially the duet of Girl from the North Country with Johnny Cash. NM is weaker, but it's still Dylan and it's still a decent album worth owning. If you're reluctant to buy because you don't want to pay for NM, realize that this set essentially gives you 3 albums for the price of 2, and NM is free. A great deal, if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan's Box Set","review":"Bob Dylan is one of the greatest song writers/musicians to have ever graced the world with his musical talent.

What does that mean living on the edge of the land? Is it a platform suspended above the land, or maybe it's a boat just off shore, maybe she means outerspace. Why can't she just live on the land like the rest of us? It is this separation between places where we live and natural environments that indicates she more urbanite than country girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronizing Drivel","review":"To anyone who grew up in rural areas, this is superfluous pabulum. I bet Peavey is in fact a big city girl that never got over the \\"quaintness\\" of rural life. I find her writing phony. Peavey writes like she is the only one enlightened enough to be able to appreciate the space and quiet of the West. We really do know what a privilege it is to live here, we just don't find it necessary to think up excessive adjectives for every rock, tree, or sunrise.

The book is written in a \\"hey were all cool, play using the fingers you want...\\"kind of language which in no way makes the long tracts on the history of sound etc any less boring. There are supposed to be casettes ( which in 1984 when the book was first published is reasonable I suppose) to use in conjunction with the book which surely could have been updated to be put on a CD for inclusion with the book rather than subsequent purchase ( does anyone still have cassette players??). In all, this book is tired and needs complete revising and updating.

No matter how much you adjust the DVD or the TV, you allways see the \\"greeness\\" in everything. The jpeg compatibility is awfull. A picture takes almost 30 seconds to load.

He, and a pair of Basque magicians, bring real interest to this fantasy romance.Doranna Durgin's depiction of her lead character's life as a dog groomer, and her portraits of the dogs in the story read like real life.

The first one had a never functioning back light (hard drive problem- no hope there) the second one stopped working after two weeks of no apparent problems. Combined with the, I'm not kidding, hour wait to get through to technical help and the seriously rude phone help (not all, just one really \\"bad apple\\") and the whole experience has been disappointing to say the least. Apple store at the Grove in LA played our knight in shinning armor with an easy exchange for a new one. The first two were engraved for Christmas, we gave up on that and went to the source. Much easier than the phone hassle.Let's hope that three's a charm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool features - Aweful audio = Zero quality","review":"Sorry I will have to make this short. Ipod touch is not the mp3 player you want to have for listening to music. I just wish apple could spend lot more time on sound quality than wasting their time on fancy looks or extra features. They forgot the little machines are supposed to bring music!Ipod touch was such a dissapointment. I could not even start on how bad (or say mediocre) the sound was when I try to compare it with other mp3 players. It just wear me out soon after listenning to a couple of songs.If you are paying money for your favorite music, try Sony A810 or Iaudio series. You will see what i am talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple had to do it AGAIN!","review":"They just have to make you feel like a fool for buying an Apple product. Thanks Steverino!

I used to own a Creative Zen (very cool device) but I cracked the screen and needed a new mp3/video player.I was planning on spending $150 for another 8 gig Zen but I had some extra cash and decided to try this.This device is very cool. The touch screen is nice (but gets dirty easily) I had to buy some clear covers (.50 each) and you definitely need a case. I recommend the DLO HipCase Leather Folio for iPod touch. Great case.The biggest problem I find with this device is iTunes.iTunes sucks.With my Zen I could dump anything on to my device. Dealing with iTunes is a headache.Unfortunately you pretty much have to use itunes unless you want to jump through a 1000 hoops.But the product is great. I recommend it.

Background instruments and subtle flourishes came alive in alternative & pop songs, even when played through my $50 Sennheiser on-ear headphones. I knew Sarah McLachlin has a good voice, but the Touch gave it that wow factor I had forgotten about.I'd give it 4 stars today, but by February when Apple officially opens up it up to 3rd party apps, it will be truly awesome. Sure, it doesn't yet support Adobe Flash or WMV video in its Safari browser, but I bet those are in the works."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING little device.","review":"This iPod is just amazing. I don't mind at all it's 16GB capacity, I just made a list of my favorite song and that's fine. I don't need to have all my 4000+ songs at a time.

I would suggest the rubber case cover and the clear film to protect the screen. Protect it right away. No problems and I have it 1 month. I find that when I need to go and check out something on the net its much faster then starting the computer up to check the tv guide or google something.

The only thing that bothered me about it was that Apple came out with a software update 2 weeks after purchasing this item. They charged an additional $20 for the software upgrade which should have been free since I had just purchased the Touch. This offset any savings I made by getting it at a discount. The upgrade should have been free for anyone that purchased the item within a certain amount of time. The extra features are great and include a mapping program, email software, updated weather and stock information. Just beware that if you are purchasing this item that you will have to pay extra for the upgrades unless you get a newer version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one complaint","review":"I love this iPod. It has an amazing touch interface that works smoothly and is easy to navigate. Awesome product. I deducted one star from my rating due to the storage capacity, max 16 gigs!

You have to look directly at the screen to do anything with it (unlike my old 5G iPod which I can manipulate while keeping my eye on the road).2. If you listen to audio books or podcasts it is nice to be able to fast forward and rewind. The slider bar on the iPod touch is too small to use effectively. I try to move backward 60 seconds, and I end up moving 5 minutes (or the beginning of the track). It drives you insane.. I have just stopped using it and gone back to the old iPod.Nice video player, great web browser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, especially with new updates","review":"The ipod touch is everything you have read in the other reviews. High quality screen, great for movie and TV Show playback and the music displays and ease of use are unmatchable by other media player. For me, i really like the ical syncing abilities. I can bring all my calendars with me and now thanks to apples new update i can even edit and add new appointments from the ipod touch itself. I also like the ability of the touch to go on the \\"real\\" internet whenever a Wi-Fi connection is available. I would recommend getting a case, a screen protector is not necessary but if your worried about the ipod getting scratched (even with the scratch resistant surface) then get one, i got one for $10 and it was easy to apply and now my ipod touch is completely protected.

Fantastic screen. Beautiful UI.Now the negatives. Although gorgeous, the UI is a pain in the butt as an everyday mp3 player. It requires way too much attention to use. With a regular ipod you just slide your thumb in circles to navigate. Almost everything you want to do with the iPod touch forces you to look at the device. Couldn't get the wifi working with my home network. Never had a problem doing so with my computers, PDAs, or phones.

I would recommend it, and purchase it again.Update: 2010 I also have other iPods so this one sat in a drawer for several months-when I got it out recently and went to update the software in my iTunes program it would not update and just keeps telling me there is an error of some kind, did I want to clear it off. Yes I did and now it no longer works at all--so having paid a ton of money for this originally--it is now useless.

Anyways, just bought this item and its versatility/functionality defies logic. Slim, Sleek and incredibly easy to use, this new generation of Ipod seems like something that was developed by an alien race and accidentally left on our planet. Beyond the ultra clear screen shots and the silly easy menu setup is the mind blowing wifi capabilities. I enabled the wifi search function on the way home the other day and picked up over 140 hotspots in a minute drive. A very sensitive receiver antenna combination. With all the additional functions this product is a massive step up for Ipod users."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait for improved version","review":"Prior to buying the Touch i used the Nano for music and my PSP for games, photos, and movies. When the touch came out i was excited. What a disappointment!! Photos and video are not even close to the PSP. If you enlarge a picture on the touch it will show noise. On the PSP i can enlarge any photo and still get clear pictures. I suspect it is because the touch \\"optimizes\\" the photos. It also cannot read PDF files and you cannot set your appointments manually (what a waste). This is really no more than a bigger music IPOD. I suspect the only people who will like this are fanboys of apple or have never seen or used a PSP. Overall this is a real ripoff for $400.00.

I have been downloading ABC news video podcasts to watch when I get home, and the Touch is great to watch anything with; it's like a big-screen TV in your hand.

I like using it to check emails or a quick browse in the early morning or at night when I don't want to boot up my computer. Its quick and easy and the display is sharp enough to read text without a problem.Another plus is the battery really lasts longer on this than on either or my two earlier Ipods.

No matter what image you have assigned to song X, the image displayed in \\"Cover Flow\\" is the first image assigned to the first song on the album where song X appears. This is worse than useless! Fortunately older iPods can still be found that don't use this interface.Apple -- either allow us to assign an image to each album (independent of the image(s) assigned to the songs on the album) or display in the \\"Cover Flow\\" interface the correct artwork as assigned to the songs themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"iPod Touch 16Gb","review":"one cannot believe all of the \\"spin\\" online!

This product, although part of the iPod line, is not optimal. It has relatively small capacity, larger size, and no way to control it outside of the touch screen. It is also expensive compared to the other options.On the other hand, if you are like me and wanted a decent PDA without getting the iPhone, this is the way to go. As a mac user, all we have to use is Palm or use a 3rd party software program for Windows Mobile based PDAs. Palm has not done a significant update to their product line in years. With the new firmware, you can add calendar events, browse the internet, listen to music, lookup contacts, etc. All with the touch of your finger. So as a PDA - 5 stars. As a music player, about 3. In total, its about a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bracelet band quality","review":"I disliked the quality of the band because after two days wearing the new watch some scratches appeared on it.

It was the final insult, after struggling with overly long sentences, a word choice that suggested the injudicious use of a thesaurus, and unbelievable dialogue.

After a little research, the best value I found was a used EOS ELAN 7ne. It arrived and worked perfectly, along with a Canon technician certified test and checkout sheet. It uses the same lens as my digital EOS camera, so we can share for awhile. Nice features, easy to use, probably the best pre-digital to come from Canon. I have to admit, I prefer Canon to the others, but other than personal preference and brand loyalty, Canon and Nikon are on the top and the EOS ELAN 7ne is one of the best film cameras around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This series is the best.

For me, Season 1 started off a little slow & shaky. I wasn't sure I was going to like it, until about the 3rd or 4th episode, and then I was hooked.

The Irish potato famine in a major player in this story, very interesting and very moving, and the main characters are very interesting and very moving as well, especially Owen Fitzgerald, a character I will never forget. This book stirred me emotionally as no other Trollope book has, and I've read many of them and loved many of them. But this one is in a class of its own. Incidentally, the father-and-son Mollett team provides some delicious humor to give the reader a break from the strong emotion produced by the telling of the potato famine. The portraits of Irish servants were wonderfully rendered--I could see and hear them, and I loved them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tragic story with a happy ending","review":"This story is beautifully written with never a dull moment.

I returned it because of size and format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Futuristic, shoot out at the OK Corral","review":"I specifically watched this movie to analyze its special effects and props as viewed from 1999. It is interesting to note how trapped movie makers are by the current state of technology. The interaction by Sean Connery with the computer and the lighted display of the impending arrival of the shuttle were typical of computer technology as of 1980. It is interesting to see how much more \\"user friendly\\" computers are today. I like to view these \\"futuristic\\" movies and reflect on how close to reality they are. At our present pace, it does not appear that we will be mining Io by the year indicated in the movie. As an aside, quickly review the movie \\"2001\\" and note how unlikely it is that we will be enjoying space travel to the moon by that date; what a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible quality!","review":"Let me start out by saying that I really LOVE this movie. However, this is a HORRIBLE DVD. It really looks like they took a VHS and a camera and filmed it. Wavering video, lots of visual defects (splotches, fuzz, lighting defects!, etc.). WB should be ashamed. This should have negative stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High Noon in Space","review":"Sean Connery and Peter Boyle are always fun to watch. No exception here. Connery is the space marshall newly arrived at mining moon with something to prove to himself. Boyle is in charge of production. The marshall learns that miners have been dying under strange circumstances and starts to look into them which leads to confrontation with Boyle. The marshall learns that hired killers are coming in on the next shuttle to kill him.His deputies are unwilling to help as the arrival time nears. However he does receive help from an unexpected source. Suspense builds but final confrontation between Connery and Boyle is slightly disappointing. Overall worth watching and above average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seen it before.","review":"Like so many themes, it is a remake in a different setting. This is \\"High Noon\\" in outer space. Maybe not a classic but still fun to watch. Of course, I will watch practically anything with Sean Connery since \\"Dr. No\\". My opinion might be a little stilted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A perfect example of shoddy DVD releasing","review":"This \\"new\\" release isn't new at all. It's the same bloody disc from 1997 repackaged. It was nice of them to get rid of the awful snapcase, but the movie desperately needs a new transfer. Everyone should urge Warner to make a new (preferably HD) transfer of this classic movie. It was still worth the 6 bucks to me to dump my VHS right now, even though dubbing myself a DVDR from the VHS probably would've looked about the same. Great movie though, if you haven't seen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful movie, horrible DVD transfer.","review":"This version has possibly the worst quality in a DVD that I have ever seen, and that includes some of the transfers of those old '70s biker flicks we all know and love. Too bad, too, because the movie itself is one of the best SF movies ever filmed. Sean Connery, Peter Boyle, and Frances Sternhagen are fantastic! I was hoping I would find this one restored in wide screen, in Blu-Ray format, but no such luck. Funny how crap movies are available in great quality, and classics like this are still being sold (to suckers like me, in this case) in the poorest quality available. I am not kidding, this DVD looks like someone put a camera up and filmed it off an old TV set! The print is full of scratches and drop outs and the image actually jumps and jitters as it plays. Want some pain? Screen this on a big format, hi-definition set, and watch the upconverter on your bluray player grow a tumor trying to play this mess. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely poor dvd quality!","review":"Wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing. I can remember seeing the film on TV and thought it was great but this has to be one of the absolute worst transfers to DVD ever! Hard to believe a studio would allow this to happen. Truly disappointed!!! The one star is because of the extremely poor DVD video quality which at times is so bad it's difficult to make out what's going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, terrible DVD","review":"After reading all the bad reviews on the DVD quality, I decided to take a chance and order it anyway. The only copy I had was an old VHS copy I made off an over-the-air broadcast 25 years ago.THE OLD VHS COPY **LOOKS** ***BETTER***.I hope they eventually remaster this great SCI-FI movie and produce a Blu-Ray version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yup - 'nother release of the same garbage transfer","review":"This gets more and more interesting. They re-release the same old unacceptable quality DVD yet again, Amazon deletes the old reviews, and those of us that care about this film come back here and tell everyone that this is a good story but the crawling, shifting, pixelated transfer to DVD will give you a headache. If you really want to see this entertaining story - buy a used one for the lowest price you can trust. You will enjoy the story but be disappointed by the view. You won't play this DVD often because of the way it was mastered. I would give it four stars if the DVD were even acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware...NOT enhanced for widescreen TV","review":"This DVD's back-cover states that this DVD is enhanced for widescreen T.V.'s. IT IS NOT. This is a non-anamorphic, non 16x9 compatable DVD. Still a good movie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outland","review":"A gutsy Connery confronts corporate greed on a Jovian moon mining colony.Not one of Sean Connery's most successful films, it is a must-have for sci-fi buffs. Unfortunately, the widescreen transfer is sub-par. Thin horizontal lines, horizontal edges of objects, and stars wink in and out of existence when they pass across horizontal scan lines and due to film jitter. Although noticeable at first, this defect becomes less noticeable as one watches the video.Until a better transfer is available, it is still a \\"keeper\\". This 3-star film gets two stars due to the transfer problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent movie, but needed some help","review":"The best part of this movie is obviously Sean Connery, who does a fine job in a fairly routine role as the lone good guy fighting the many bad guys. I also liked the look, even though it is the grungy look perfected in Alien. The exterior visuals and special effects are not very good, looking very much like models. I take one star off for that alone. Overall, a good rental but not one I would buy. 3 and 1/2 stars in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bootleg quality dvd","review":"First of all, let me say, that I really do love this movie and I will talk more about it below.However... this is by far the worst quality dvd I've ever seen. I didn't know that picture quality on a dvd could even get his bad. The picture is grainy, and just plain terrible (see other reviews who will say the same thing!) Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews before I bought it, and I paid the price. DVD Quality 0/5 starsSaying that, I still love this movie. Those reviewers who said it was high noon in space are exactly right, but it is also mixed with 1980s paranoia about the morality of private companies, and fears about drugs. Sean Connery plays the character of the Marshal excellently, as to be expected, and the movie is entertaining throughout. Movie Quality 4.5/5 starsOverall I would recommend waiting to buy this product only after it is rereleased and you see some reviews saying the picture quality is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The French Region 2 is better than the U.S DVD !!!!","review":"I Brought all my dvds from France and was surprised that my dvd of Outland stopped after a few minutes. I Bought a new Region 1 (U.S) to replace the damaged one. The Region 2 was in Widescreen but U.S version is in Letterbox. The previous version had bright colours even though most of the movie takes place in the dark. There is a sort of whitish dots and the image is grainy during the whole movie. Stay away from this version.......and buy the Region 2 instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still looks Excellent on a big screen TV.","review":"Hard to believe that this movie made 22 years ago still holds up but it does. It is a dark movie, lightingwise, but on my HD big screen TV it still looks great. Sean Connery is superb as the loner Marshall aboard a space mine on a moon of Jupiter. When the bad guys find that they can't control him, which means ignore his duty, they send assassins to kill the marshall. Connerys only friend is the spacey doctor.If the two movie High Noon and Blade Runner (though Bladerunner has made after Outland) could have a baby, that offspring would be this movie. Some had called it slow moving, but the tension that builds helps to emphasize the hopelessness of the situation. This is also a story of doing the right thing instead of drinking the koolaid for the party or the company. The values taught in this movie are slowly being obliterated, so admire this marshall that takes a stand and that others must obey the law."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warner Bros. Sucks.","review":"This a pretty good flick, not great but watchable. The DVD, however, stinks. This was one of the first DVDs released in the mid-1990s and over ten years later they still haven't done a decent remastering job on this. They just repackaged the DVD with a new cover! They even say that this is \\"Enhanced for widescreen TVs\\". It's not - it's just letterboxed. This is basically unwatchable. In fact, with all the juddering and shimmering it's worse than VHS. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly poorly made DVD","review":"This is the worst looking DVD I've ever seen. I loved the movie; I was delighted to see it, and bought it right away. I knew it was old and the SFX would be dated, no problem. But... watching it was like dragging fingernails over a blackboard. It jitters. It blurs. It hiccups. The color is bad.The only other DVD I've ever run into that was even close to this bad was \\"The Final Countdown\\"; I can't help but think this DVD is actually defective in some way, except for the fact that it plays continuously without any complaints from my hardware.So... if you loved Outland, I guess this is what you have to buy, but man... be prepared for a sub-sub-sub-optimal experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Add this movie to your collection if you can take movies that are characterized as moving \\"slow\\" for the general population, if you like dark sci-fi's, and Sean Connery. I didn't think the movie was slow at all. I remember seeing glimpses of this movie as a kid, and when I finally got it for the low price, I was happy I did. I only wriggled in my seat because the movie wasn't widescreen, but I don't feel like spending money on the DVD, although I am curious :). This movie is about one man's fight against what seems like everything else in his world, being in the position that he is in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Horrendous Transfer","review":"A- For the movie itself. A fine hard-science film in the Alien/Blade Runner traditionsF- For the transfer.

Wait for the studio to fix this inexcusable travesty and then buy the inevitable DVD or BD release"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good film gone to bad copy!","review":"Outland is a very good sci-fi movie and, for its time, a breakthrough of a sorts. Frances Sternhagen as the doctor stole the show. (The part was originally written for a man and was not changed when she was cast, thus making this role, in 1981, a new concept as a role for women).In spite of being a fairly good movie, the DVD version is awful!!! It is covered with \\"snow\\" and the characters and background scenes are jerky and bouncy throughout. The letterbox version is so small that even on a 52-inch TV, it was difficult to see.If you can, wait for the Blu-Ray... maybe they will do a better job then of transferring it so it is watchable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"High Noon in space","review":"This is an excellent film, even though it steals it's plot from the 1952 Gary Cooper film, \\"High Noon\\". It is a very good adaptation of that film, with good character development and fine performances. That it takes place in a future possibility of a mine on Jupiter's moon Io is icing on the cake for any SciFi aficionado. Special effects are of a high standard, and the music score is top notch, perhaps one of the finest ever.That being said, the DVD transfer is awful. The picture squirms continuously, colors are muted, the image is grainy, and the aspect ratio seems to be somewhat \\"crushed\\" in the wide screen version. I have to say this is the worst transfer to DVD I have yet encountered.Any SciFi enthusiast needs this film in his or her collection, but I would advise you to wait for a remastering of this film. It is a very good film, and well deserves special treatment. Perhaps a Bluray version is worth the wait..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No widescreen version on this disc","review":"This disc is supposed to have both standard and widescreen formats, however after a couple of minutes the widescreen reverts to standard for the remainder of the movie. Very, very, very poor quality. Unless this gets remastered don't buy it and based on other reviews I wouldn't even try the Blu ray. I'm returning this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ow! My Eyes.","review":"This is probably the worst film transfer of any film I have seen since the True Lies THX DVD. It is so compressed that it is unwatchable on large displays. This film SHOULD be as visually stunning as Stanley Kubrick's 2001. I saw it in theaters in 70mm. This is another example of NON anamorphic widescreen. They actually print the black boarders on the DVD and take up valuable space for picture data. Needless to show say, it shows. Trying to watch it like staring at a rapidly flickering fluorescent light.I love this film. It deserves a much better treatment than this. Petition the studio to put out a proper transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed - worst DVD EVER","review":"Great movie, remember seeing with high school friends it at the Cinerama in downtown Seattle when it came out in 1981.The DVD itself is an absolute disaster. I could only watch about 2 minutes of it, skipped forward a couple of chapters to verify the whole disc was that bad, and then threw it into the trash. It is truly not watchable. This is the only DVD I've see that is worse than VHS.Let's hope the remake will cause WB to spend a the time making a decent Blu-Ray of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed - a horrible transfer...","review":"I bought this thinking a new transfer would make this chestnut watchable all over again.Wrong. It's easily the worst looking DVD I have ever seen. Avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad transfer","review":"The movie itself gets four stars. The DVD gets two. The transfer is the worst I have ever seen. It shimmers, the colors are washed out, and the picture is softer than VHS. There are also few extras, which are becoming so common on DVD's these days.Again, the movie is wonderful, but wait for a better transfer, with more extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEADACH ANYONE?","review":"I saw this movie a long time ago, and liked it. When I saw it for DVD I bought it. 110 mins. later I tossed it with some junk in the garage for my garage sale I plan to have. Nothing against the story, or the acting, or special effects, but this movie took no advantage of the format at all. I dare you to lock your eyes at a fixed point on the screen. The picture wiggles all over the place making the viewer uneasy and agitated. Not to mention dark and grainy sceans. It's too bad, but don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old favorite","review":"I was so happy when I popped this in my player and one of my space dramas began. Great movie and I'm so happy I didn't let one reviewer's unfounded complaints about the production turn me off. It looks great, sounds great, just as it was when I first saw it. It was made in the early 80s. I don't know too many movies back then that had production value on par with today's stuff. If you've ever seen this movie at the theater or on TV, this is just like that. Buy it! You'll like!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outland","review":"This plays as a western, but works very well as a sci-fi. Blue-ray brings out so much more of the movie sight and sound.

It seemed to be a quick copy of a high grade VCR tape. Very strong old-school interlacing made much of the movie very difficult to watch on a progressive screen.

You find yourself loving each character more and more with every turn of the page, and knowing they will live eternally in your mind and heart after the book is over. Their strength and bravery is touching and commendable, and after reading this novel, you will see what is really important in life is love and making the most of each day.

Literally, the only thing I could do with the old refrigerator is to throw it away.Amazing. I'm not in the habit of throwing out appliances after 2 1/2 years. What a shoddy company.

On the softer tunes, Miles Davis proves once again he is the true master of the ballad. My only complaint: Columbia does it's usual inadequate job in post-production--they didn't even take the time to edit out the duplicated announcements (from the two seperate records). When one looks at what a great job Fantasy/OJC or Bluenote does on their re-issues, it makes the overpriced Columbia reissues pale in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Music is without equal, BUT > > >","review":"Sorry, but i just can't recommend this.

As a sculptor and art educator, I have accumulated an extensive library of books in this area. This is one that I had to squeeze into its rightful place on my most used shelf.

Plus, I don't think she applies the same level of high-mindedness to herself as she does to other people. She seems to like to cut down trees but then complains later about flooding from upgradient homeowners that have cut down their trees. Also, she drowns possums. She complains that she raises her food to live on and she can't spare any to varmints. I'm not sure what she thinks the possum was eating the food for. I suspect to live on. And some of her arguments don't hold water. Like the vegetarian argument mentioned earlier. THis book could have used better editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story... Unimpressive Author","review":"After seeing this book at Kitchen Arts and Letters, I was intrigued, and finally picked it up a few weeks later. I am half way through the book now, and although the story and descriptions are informative and somewhat entertaining, the author continually disappoints me. She takes every opportunity to \\"toot\\" her own horn, and this is extremely distracting to the story. It is a real turn off from continuing with the book. I wanted to read it because I've always thought the idea of being able to grow your own food was fascinating, but she constantly name drops and say's she discovered this and she discovered that (not to mention she describes her husband has \\"handsome\\" on the first page)... I mean who really gives a hoot. Just tell up about the plants. Her personality really begins to irritate you after a while.

I have had good luck with other Evenflo car seats so tying another model was a no-brainer. However, I have been very disappointed with this seat. I agree with another reviewer who said the harness tightening knob is very hard to turn because it is pretty much right up against the seat of the car. My fingers get stuck between the knob and the seat when trying to turn. Probably the biggest reason I dislike this carseat is the comfort. The way the head rest is positioned, it actually makes my daugther's head go forward a bit instead of either just straight back or reclined. We travel a lot and there have been many times she tries to fall asleep but ends up crying in pain due to the way the seat forces her head forward. There is no possibility of resting the head back or even to the side. We've had this seat a few months now and I'm definitely going to call it a loss and get a new different one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE QUILT TRIP....","review":"A FANTASTIC HANDBAG TREAT TO ADD TO YOUR WARDROBE !

My son was fairly interested, I admit, but the concept is not so much the problem-it's the prose. The sarcasm in the attempt to make fun of Santa's \\"job\\" has the opposite effect it intends; the only sentences that seem to land are the ones questioning the plausibility of Santa's work. The main character as many have written here, is thin, and sappy; it seems like a book that was sketched out to be the basis of a third rate kid's movie, with the undeveloped stock characters and cardboard dialogue you'd expect in that genre. The attempts at adult humor which drive the plot are forced and unoriginal. Santa Kid could have been much more, but it wasn't.

It is about 1/2 size too long, but with the narrow toe that might be intentional. The downside is that the sole is very thin, which is fine for a dress shoe. However, the sole is absolutely flat and very smooth, and provides no grip whatsoever on many surfaces, such as carpets. I can literally carpet skate with these. I will need to get these shoes modified so they grip, but with the thin sole that may not be possible.People complaining about thin leather probably haven't worn dress shoes before. These are really not that thin. The leather is soft and more flexible than other dress shoes, but the thickness is just about what you would expect.Note, the seller will rip you off with shipping. I got charged $45.90 for shipping, even though the package it came in says that shipping was only $30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin may or may not be in","review":"These shoes look great and are extremely comfortable...but be forewarned.

I truly believed that I was going to tear the eyelets the first time that I laced them up and I am not kidding when I say that the sole of these shoes are comparable to moccasins.

I believe his statements speak VOLUMES...he's done the work for me.Out of the 240 pages in this book, only about 80 of the pages contain written material, the rest are appendicies, footnotes and the writing trips and falls over itself into half-baked, obscure and unintelligible oblivion.I love China and its people and its culture, so this book truly saddens me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn in-depth ways to use library information!","review":"This is a terrific book for anyone interested in books and finding information.

Unlike Rennison, the story is told in a first-person narrative and not a diary.

I found only philosophical points of view and nothing that I would characterize as scientific such as is contained in some other publications from outside mainstream science. At the beginning of the film Dr Goswami references an occasion when he was very envious of other scientists that gave interesting lectures and he obviously decided to do something about it. He has now apparently become guru for many persons that think he is very great and he searches to recruit others to his group of quantum activists. He has certainly succeeded in his endeavor, but on the expense of insight and advance of science.The film has many clips to support associations, which makes it less dull. The clipping has also made a great job of putting together sequences from several interviews and lectures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone..","review":"I loved it!

The book is filled with short stories by her and contributors (including myself) that recount special and sometimes ordinary moments that left impressions and lessons. The stories are humorous, heartbreaking, inspiring, frightening...like a typical day as a parent. I enjoyed the range of ages covered in the book. There are cute toddlers-say-the-darndest-things stories and moving stories of parents and adult children facing life as peers. It's a fun book to grab and read pages at random. But there are underlying themes threading the stories together. A lot of effort went into this book and it's a nice piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"lil girls shouldd be seen and not heard","review":"somebody spank her and send her to her room with her little barbie dolls yes my little pony fantasies are in the house this girl spent too much time watching cheretah girls on disney channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst New Artist of the Decade","review":"\\"Lip Gloss\\" is the most annoying, aggravating, ridiculously stupid song to hit the airwaves in 2007.

Some of my favorite parts from the book didn't even make it into the movie and some of them I feel were really essential to the plot line and were what made it so amazing. Also they changed how some of the characters were. Cheese was nothing like he was in the book which really dissapointed me because part of what i was excited to see in the movie was how they portrayed his character. All of that a side though, even if I hadn't read the book I don't think I would have liked it. I actually think I would have liked it less. It was too jumpy and it felt like I was watching some made for TV movie. I wish I could get the time I wasted watching this movie back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommending to everyone I know","review":"I loved this one. Its not China Town but its a damned fine piece of work with some nice twists and great background.I do wish I knew a bit more about Casey Afflecks character, especially given who some of his friends are and how for such a skinny guy he kicks a$$ and commands some respect from locals. Other than that quibble this is a great R rated film to recommend to others. I would rank it right up there with Mystic River."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I like the work of the author who wrote the book on which this movie was based, and have read the book.

Not a big fan of the actor portraying Kenzie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some things I'm thinking right now","review":"Well, some directors are also born pretty. Now we know, the previously actor known as Ben Affleck is a gifted director to watch in the future. It is true that the little snipets of low-class Bostonians are tossed around like a sledgehammer, but I found everyone of those informative even on a sociological level. There is also one action scene that is very well shot (in a house). The suppossed mystery is easy to solve once the half point of the movie is reached, but the moral question proposed is still relevant (and by the way, the movie does takes sides, because even with doubts, its heroe does). (I give this film 3 and half stars. I give only in rare occassions more than 4 stars, so this means it is good, watch it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid 99 cents & couldn't watch because there was no volume!","review":"Paid 99 cents& couldn't watch because there was no volume!

I've always perceived him as a person with integrity of character and with that said i was really looking forward to his directing debut.But about twenty minutes into gone baby gone, and my senses being assaulted by the incredible amount of vulgarity pouring out of the tv into my livingroom...not to mention finding the story line really confusing, it felt like long enough to want to waste another minute watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT pay money for this one...","review":"I need to disclose the fact that I haven't seen this movie. That is exactly why I'm giving it a terrible review.I recently received this disc and was excited to watch it because of the positive reviews of the movie.

This is the first time I've seen Casey Affleck and he certainly is a good lead actor. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris were at their usual best. Whether Affleck's character did the right thing haunts us to the end. Ben Affleck did a great job as a director.Too much cursing forces me to rate this a 4 - yes I am a prude."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVED IT RIGHT UP UNTIL THE END.","review":"Aside from the fact that I had to turn on the subtitles because I couldn't understand half of what the Casey Affleck character saying, the movie was well-made and very well-acted. In this respect, I would give it 4 stars. But I am giving it 2 stars because of the way I felt after watching it. Most of my friends thought this was a great movie. I would tend to agree. But the end just left me drained and disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Adaptation of a Great Book","review":"Being a huge fan of Dennis Lehane and his Kenzie/Gennaro novels, I was anxious to see the movie adaptation of Gone Baby Gone. I can't really separate the book and the movie, therefore I do take a bit away from the movie in comparison to the book.First, the good. I liked Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan as Patrick and Angie. Although I pictured them to be a bit older, I thought the actors did a fine job. The direction by Ben Affleck is wonderful. The movie did a very good job in following the book, although it was like reading a Cliff's Notes version.I only have two complaints. First, Angie's character is almost non-existent. She's a major player in the book, and much more than just Patrick's girlfriend. Second, I was really hoping to see more of the unstable Bubba Rogowski. He's another major character in the novel and the other novels as well.My complaints aside, this is a terrific movie. Exciting, gritty, and heart-breaking. I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Discomfort","review":"A lot of people here said they hated this movie because they hated the ending. That's how you're SUPPOSED to feel! I love complicated stuff, and this movie is full of complications.

Definitely a movie that carries a lot of baggage but doesn't seem to hit you over the head with it. Love that."},{"rating":"2","title":"great debut","review":"Ben Affleck makes a spectacular directorial debut with his effort on GONE BABY GONE, getting wonderful performances across the board from his brother Casey to the small Boston regulars who fill in the background and amp up the authenticity on this terrific film. His co-authoring the adaptation is also a fine effort. The movie is gritty and real and well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone Baby Gone","review":"Ben Affleck proves himself as a director with his perfect casting, choice of scene location, and ability to stay true to the storyline of the book. Take it from a rabid Dennis Lehane fan - Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan ARE Patick Kenzie AND Angie Gennaro sprung from Lehanes book onto the movie screen. Can't wait until they team up again to do another Lehane book to movie make (like \\"A Drink Before THe War\\" - Lehanes first and probably most violent book - makes Gone Baby Gone and Mysic River look like boy scout stuff)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"I saw this movie last night and during the first hour, I said to myself, \\"Wow, this is one of the best movie I've seen. How come the Oscars totally ignored this movie?\\" Sadly, the answer dawned on me during the last 20 minutes of this film. Spoilers now ahead...Apparently, the movie portrayed Boston as a city in some Third World country; no one in this movie has heard of Child Welfare Services. If the girl's mother is unfit, the uncle could have easily contacted welfare services to take the child away and then adopt her legallyor put her in a foster home.. Why is there a need to come up with a convuluted kidnapping scheme involving the police and drug dealers? I'm shaking my head as I type this; it is just that ridiculous of a plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"One to think about....","review":"This movie starts with an engaging whodunit and in the last 30 mins or so turns into a moral question I still don't honestly know what the right anwser is, yet the film gives both sides equal time. Very good film that deserves a look and it will stick with you long after the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Year's best","review":"I'll join the applause for this Affleck, Freeman, Harris vehicle. The drug addled mum of the kidnapped girl also gives a stunning performance.The twists and turns were enthralling enough right through to the vulnerability of the head cop. I've watched it a few times and still have trouble with the diction though; not attuned enough to catch all of Affleck's murmuring, and right off the map with the drawl of the head gangster(but the intentions are manifest). The cinematography and camera work are first rate. The sets and dirty realism, totally commanding. The choices each protaganist makes throughout is the nub of the investigation, and the one Affleck has to make at the end may cost him his closest ally. Yes, together with the Robert Ford outing, Affleck has made a big statement in my head these past 12 months and is one to watch for. The film is an excellent accompaniment to,'Mystic River', written by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never actually \\"hate\\" anything except poverty, illiteracy and despair","review":"If you're nostalgic for all those elements of Boston - Massachusetts really - that are its very worst, this is the movie for you.

They even get the Boston accent right. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good dramatic thriller. It has a lot of character depth throughout the movie and it definitely will keep you guessing scene by scene. Just when you think you have it all figured out, you don't...

Never heard of it before and purchased it because of the price for a Affleck production seemed like a worthwhile movie. I was right. I really like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite good, until the end. No Spoilers","review":"I had heard a lot of good about this film so I decided to check it out. Well, I was truly into it and the mystery surrounding the characters that I had my hopes up for a (finally) great movie in 2007. Weeeellll, then the end happened and I think my jaw dropped because I was in such shock. And not because it was good, but because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was just so wrong and odd and ridiculous that it actually made me hate the movie altogether. It truly was a great film until that point. I could not believe I had wasted my time. What a dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Effing Language","review":"I read some reviews and thought I would give this movie a shot. I mean it starred Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris. The story line was actually pretty intriguing. But I just got tired of hearing the eff word in every other line. I guess the one positive point of this movies was giving me gratitude that I don't move in the same circles as the people being portrayed. I'm sorry I wasted the $10. But it could have been worse. I could have wasted more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get past the first 15 minutes","review":"I really wanted to watch this movie, given the outstanding reviews. I just could not take the relentless profanity. I realize it's depicting a seamy environment, and I get that, but when 90% of every sentence in the bar scene is a string of filthy words, it just becomes a distraction. No movie needs that much profanity to make its point. Despite Affleck's other directing chops, I regard the overuse of profanity as a weakness. I would try to watch this again if it came on on TV, where they bleep out all the distracting words, because the characters are strong and the plot is compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"White trash filmmaking","review":"Looking for a film with a moral high ground? Look elsewhere.

This film belongs to him. He deserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic Boston, but the tale grows weaker by the minute","review":"I was bowled over by the authentic Boston look, accents and the real people cast in this crime drama, based on a Dennis Lahane novel, directed by Ben Affleck. The beginning works extremely well, and the film seems to be over halfway through, but then takes a few more plot turns before the ending, which doesn't work for me. Casey Affleck is very good as the central character, and his accent is perfect because he grew up in Dorchester. I just thought the plot lost some credibility as it went on: have real police ever been involved in a kidnapping to try to save a child from neglect? I really doubt it. Otherwise, this is first-rate, and moves along without any dead space whatsoever. Extremely entertaining and watchable, despite the plot weakness."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are all sinners","review":"A great Boston movie. Good actors, good script, great scenes. Who's good?

He couldn't have just let the family ride off into the sunset, no, his brother had to be a moron and be all \\"by the book\\" and bring everyone to justice. Now the little girl will suffer for it. BAD ENDING to a potentially great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This movie was pretty good up until the ending. The ending was just stupid. I also have to say that there are some scenes in this movie that are very disturbing. During one scene, and it was just a flash, split second of a scene, I was so disturbed and can't believe they felt the need to add that into the movie. We got what happened..you didn't have to show it. Ugh. All that aside, Casey Affleck was great. Awesome, talented actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Bostonians sound like morons!","review":"I watched a half hour and was totally appalled. The accents were so ridiculous and over the top.

I live 20 min from Boston and I say \\"Car\\", \\"Garage\\" \\"Harvard\\"...all pronouncing the R's. I thought Mystic River was an excellent movie and book.

The use of profanity to get an R rating is such a cheap trick. The only worthwhile actor in the bunch of these unknowns is Morgan Freeman - but why would he associate himself with such a loser film? Casey Affleck has the worst possible diction, a lightweight voice that doesn't carry, and putting on an accent when he murmurs instead of speaks makes one believe the viewer has a hearing problem. It is hogwash in its purest form. STUPID, DUMB, PROFANE TO THE POINT OF DESECRATING JESUS CHRIST - well, Mr Ben Affleck the writer, how could you pen such filthy abomination? Repenting won't cut it for you sir, and as you must have found out by now, no one will touch you with a hundred foot pole. Career: OVER. Same goes for you Jennifer, how can you and your kids applaud Daddy at the end of the day is beyond anything I can imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A for Affleck, B for Boston, C for Casey, D for ?","review":"One of the most difficult tasks is adapting a book to the stage of film. However, this gritty urban (and urbane) drama deserves every star. It truly is an ensemle cast of excellent actors (and actresses). When you can forget Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman, or that Ed Harris is Ed Harris--there is something magical going on. From the dirty kitchen sinks of the \\"neighborhood\\" where the narrator grew up, to the quarry tagged in every available space, this rings true and is in a class with \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\"--in color. Every few minutes there is a plot twist, and you don't really know who is good or evil--and in the end, you still will be left wondering. A great film leaves you with more questions that answers, and I would put this film in that category--especially when they are moral issues.No plot recap is needed here--judge for yourself. You will not be wasting your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Directing Debut From Ben Affleck","review":"Ben Affleck continues his return to respectability with his directorial debut Gone Baby Gone. Exploring an area he knows quite well, South Boston, Mr. Affleck elicits strong performances from a first rate cast including his brother Casey in the lead role, Morgan Freeman, Michelle Monaghan, Ed Harris, Amy Ryan, Amy Madigan & Titus Welliver. The movie revolves around a missing child search that turns into a kidnapping plot involving police corruption. There is a dark edge to the film with a mix of salty and earthy South Boston characters that add even more gruffness. Although this film didn't receive the Academy Award recognition of another Dennis Lehane adaptation, Mystic River, I found Gone Baby Gone less pretentious and overacted and ultimately more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original with lots of surprising twists","review":"It's not often that something totally original comes out of Hollywood.

All anyone heard was a splash, and that was good enough for everyone!!!I mean, come On!!! How hard would it be to find a body in a quarry!This blew the entire thing for me. This goes beyond suspending disbelief. This is just stupid writing, and it shows laziness, as well as a lack of respect for the intelligence of the audience, but after seeing how many glowing reviews have been posted, I realize that they must have assumed correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casey Affleck is awful","review":"Good movie but Casey Affleck was horrible.No expression & mumbles to the point of being incoherent.Ed Harris was excellent as always & Morgan excellent too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storytelling at it's best","review":"The power is in the details. Director Ben Affleck takes an well paced, richly textured and unflinching look at the hapless of Boston. It is like visiting a foreign land, without the smug, albeit false, protection of malls and mini-vans.The characters, mostly, are ugly. The sort that almost slither onto the screen. The sort you would not stand close to at the grocers. Even in this milieu there is one woman and a child that shine as worthwhile. Meanwhile the law enforcers do their job...and the law and the decency imposed is what keeps this social strate from slipping into the sewer.The law enforcers do their job - except when they don't.If it were not for one scene of haunting horror, this would be a great date movie. It is provocative and not a movie I will forget.

Thanks Dr. Turek!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what's asked of it","review":"I purchased this unit last week and so far am satisfied with its performance. Getting the memories set up was a bit time consuming . I'm not particularly impressed with the styling of the base unit-would have preferred a more rectangular shape with larger buttons. The audio on the answering unit should be made a little louder and clearer. I ordered it thru J&R Music and was astonished to find it on my doorstep the very next day!I purchased this unit to take advantage of my new Caller ID service and to replace an older At&T Desk unit and Casio answering machine. To sum up, I would reccomend this unit for its overall good performance and reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"AT&T 1487 not so good","review":"The answering system on the unit I purchased is acceptable. The audio quality of the cordless handset is disappointing: I hear a constant hiss when using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad audio, poor product","review":"Neither the base unit nor the cordless phone were satisfactory in terms of sound quality. The answering machine was often unintelligible. I would take note of the fact that Amazon's current price is approximately 50% of the list. I like bargains, but in this case I suspect it is a matter of not being able to sell the stock on hand -- for a good reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great for telecommuting","review":"There are 2 standout issues regarding this phone:1. No mute button on the cordless handset. There is a mute on the base, but it seems like a grave omission not to have mute on the other handset.2. When you insert or remove a headset into the headset jack, it makes a horrible screeching noise on the other end.If you need a phone for telecommuting, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless Handset is Static","review":"I wanted a combo speaker phone and answering machine, so this one looked great. Overall it is OK, but let me point out the items not so great:- No battery backup, so the clock has to be set again if you have a power outage.- The cordless handset is very much full of static, even close to the base, and even if you try to change channels.- When you do loose power, the unit does not dial in touch-tone- it uses pulse!- The caller ID history use useless since you can't append a 1 for long distance calls.The LCD display should show more answering machine features, instead it is just caller ID and directory numbers.On the plus side, for the number of features, the price is right, and it has been reliable so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flashback","review":"If you love Cyndi, you'l love this remix CD.

The fabric is not opaque but actually sheer, so it lets a lot of sunlight through it. There is also a lot of black fabric fringe, which absorbs heat, further raising the interior heat. Lastly, the way it is sewn together keeps it from fully opening so you can't get full coverage across the windshield."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of attitude, little theory...","review":"This is a fun read, if only for the attitude. On theory, the text is more than a bit light: Cinephiles after more heavy current philosophical grist should seek to grind elsewhere. Johnson's reliance on Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Freud and Sartre, et al., also indicate his modernist tendencies, which is, of course, in academia these days, still passé, if not taboo, though that doesn't make his argument irrelevant. It's sort of refreshing to lie back and let Johnson make his point, even if he reads, at times, like an old fashioned muckraker."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely wrong","review":"Okay, I'm a fan, not a critic. I didn't read this entire book, just skimmed it after I got the basic gist of it. I'd suggest to any Lynch fan to try to get this from the library before buying it, which luckily I did, because you won't want to own it. This writer is convinced his theories are correct and everyone else, including David Lynch himself, are the ones misintepreting. One thing I know he gets wrong: he claims Lynch takes himself so seriously that there is no irony or humor in his work. Just because you don't get it, doesn't mean it isn't there, Lynch's unique sense of humor shows up in all his work. And to claim that the study of \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in dramatic fashion forwards a conservative agenda makes no sense to me whatsoever. I guess you either \\"get\\" Lynch or you don't, and this writer does not. The only thing I got out of reading it was to make note of the other writers he refers to who he says are all wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"If the shoe fits...","review":"Maybe jetsetal from Rochester should write a book on Cronenberg - one of those sticky artists-as-saints sucked up by eager creative writing sophomores - but leave Lynch to Johnson. I just read the book cover to cover in one sitting, and I'm convinced - along with most other mainstream critics... as for Lynch on Lynch, I think it was D.H. Lawrence who said to trust the singer, not the song. Saying Lynch is liberal doesn't make it so, and after Johnson's critique, it doesn't matter what Lynch wants to be, his work is mainstream Reagan/Bush pap."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"If you are a David Lynch fan you'll most likely hate this book as it goes to great lengths to discredit him as a true artist. By the same token, if you don't like Lynch I doubt that you'd want to pay $32.00 and waste your time reading this book to justify your lack of interest.I love David Lynch and found this book to be misguided at best and completely idiotic at worst. (it was a gift)I am not an Oliver Stone fan, however the idea of actually buying a book on why he's not a great filmaker seem fairly pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't hold black oil sunflower seed","review":"I bought this as a gift for a friend in another state, I just got a report from her that the wire mesh is too large to hold black oil sunflower seeds. This was the reason I bought it, so I'm going to have to give it a very low grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely bad transfers","review":"Beware of bogus claims of remastering. These are unbelievably bad transfers, even of the newer movies. It is a complete rip off, preying on people's love for these wonderful old movies. Spend the time to research and purchase only legitimate remasters, even if you end up paying a little more. Trust me: these are so bad as to be annoying and to destroy your enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Poor quality reproduction. I agree with the other reviewer. I played the collection on two separate DVD devices to verify. Too many artifacts (blobs of dust) and jerky movements. The sound was muddy. For films with snappy dialogue, these were a disappointment. Closed captioning was not available.A side note, I usually check for closed-captioning before I purchase a DVD, this time I was too enticed by the low price. Generally, inclusion of CC indicates slightly better quality DVD production. And, NO, simply turning up the TV volume does not help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"There's a reason why this strap is relatively inexpensive - it isn't very good.1. The polypropylene web that the strap is made of is grating against the skin. I keep adjusting my shirt while playing so that the rough material of the strap won't dig into my neck or shoulder.2. Planet Waves' gimmick - the supposedly universal strap lock - is actually a hinderance. The locks are so large and bulky that they interfere with the guitar's body. I can't use the strap on my acoustic, because the lock is too big to fit onto the strap button located where the guitar neck joins the body. It's also annoying to use the strap on my Les Paul-type electric because - AGAIN - the lock mechanism is so bulky that it constantly interferes with the amp cable where it plugs into the output socket on the guitar.I was taken in by the low price & the company's marketing blurb. Now I have to buy an actually decent strap and am stuck with Planet Waves' inferior product. Don't do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong color","review":"This product looks fresh and pretty in color, but in reality the guitar strap's color looks nothing like the official picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is very uncomfortable","review":"Call me a sissy or what you may, but when I use this strap, the back of the front end of it rubs against my skin and after a few minutes REALLY starts to hurt. I have adjusted the strap every which way and it's just not even worth it. Pay a little more and get the d'addario strap that clips on. I was too big of a cheap ass to pay for another one of them, and I regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No locking part on the strap...?","review":"Unlike all the reviews I'm seeing and the picture of the item itself, my strap did not come with any kind of locks on it. It's just a regular red strap with leather (or fake leather) ends to stick the strap pins into. There's no locking mechanism to speak of. I don't know if I was just sent the wrong item or what, but it's a Planet Waves strap, looks otherwise identical to the picture above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Strap","review":"I play bass guitar and love to jump around on stage. I had to me careful with my strap. More than once I would have to grab my guitar as it fell off the strap. I didn't really want to alter my basses (I have 2) with strap locks. I found this gem in a local music store. I've had it for about a year and never had a problem with it. It works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"this will destroy your guitar","review":"I got one of these as a gift and it doesn't fit on Jackson strap buttons and it ripped the strap buttons out of my PRS because the ends are too rigid to flex I have owned 9 guitars and it has only fit two the PRS which it damaged and my Gibson which has Dunlop strap locks so it was just a test and I wouldn't leave them on it I would recommend buying Dunlop strap locks instead because you can have a mor comfortable strap that won't destroy your guitar"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guitar strap","review":"I only practice guitar in my room, so I can't speak for how it performs in gigs. But it has stayed on since I put it on. Very snug fit on the guitar, as comfortable as I was looking for (it's not padded or anything, but it's very broad/does not cut into my shoulder). I got the blue, which is quite bright (but not too bright) and looks very nice. It has stayed attached since I bought it a month ago, seems like it will last. Very cheap. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed to replace the strap buttons on my RBX170","review":"Recently started learning to play the bass guitar. Picked up a Yamaha RBX170 and purchased this locking guitar strap. Even being a newbie, it was obvious that the locking mechanism was not going to work with the stock strap buttons on the guitar. So, I sent away for the \\"free\\" replacement buttons offered by D'Addario. In actuality, I had to pay $2.50 for shipping and handling. Didn't take long to receive the replacement buttons. I put up a picture to show you the difference between the stock RBX170 buttons and the replacement ones.So, with the replacement buttons in place (using the original screws and not the fat ones that came with the new buttons), the strap performs well. I only use this guitar at home (for now), so it's not subject to any flinging about. What matters to me is that the strap works, it was relatively inexpensive, and the locking mechanism does its job."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works.","review":"It works but it's not amazing in terms of comfort.

The plastic under the rubber scratched my guitar around the strap pegs. After a couple months of using it one of the plastic ends snapped off while I was playing a show.

If the lock is design to only be able to fit it one way, at the very least it should say in the description that guitars that have the forward pin in the back of the body will not be able to use this locks."},{"rating":"1","title":"whats wrong with you amazon!","review":"I clicked on a strap with the locking ends.

Check out the \\"sniper rifle\\" that the main character is holding. Check their wide open position. No cover. No sniper would no this! It's SILLY STUPID! Apparently they cut costs by not hiring a military consultant and so they did things the way they assumed it would be done, and sadly that is far from reality. I gave it ONE STAR for TWO reasons: 1) because it was free; 2)because I could not give it less than ONE STAR. I turned it off and applied a second coat of paint to the living room walls.

Starring as a NTSB investigator, he stumbles upon time travelers from a future earth. The entire movie's concept is interesting and innovative, however the acting is OK with dialog that seems forced and artificial at many places. Probably the biggest letdown of this potential blockbuster was the special effects, all of which seem fake. Everything from the robots in the future, to the opening scene when the pilots in one airline jet look out their cockpit to see another airline jet coming on top of them; all the special effects could have been improved upon. Overall, an OK flick that is alright for at-home viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unique cabin explosition (6 stars).","review":"I saw this movie years ago,and it's an ok 'B movie',the only thing that was unique was when the passenger cabin inside the airliner explodes and you can see the pilots cabin being ripped away first and the carnage just slowly traveling up the passengers cabin.

The word \\"starter\\" did not appear in the product description, which led me to believe it was a full-sized kit, not a package of miniature products. The product arrived in a damaged external package (torn side) and with some of the products spilled open so that there was a strong scent attached.I've seen the same kit sold in local stores for a couple dollars less, without adding the shipping and handling costs. It was not worth the money or time of purchasing it. The seller should more accurately represent what's being sold in the description, a larger image, and more detailed text. Also, proper packaging to prevent tearing and spilling would have been nice.

Before you read it, read Midnight Rainbow and then Diamond Bay. Personally, I like this one the most... the plot is refreshingly different from many other romances. I have read almost all of Howard's books, own almost all of those, and I think that this is one of the better ones. I thought Diamond Bay was okay, but the ending was a bit of a let down, and Midnight Rainbow was good. I don't want to say much about the actual plot of White Lies, but it starts out with a bang and you really don't know where Howard is going with the plot. It is worth the read... enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"White Lies","review":"This is one of my favorite Linda Howard books! I'm on my third paperback copy. I've reread it that many times.

The plot of this book was obvious from about the tenth page. The book was extremely predictable and not very romantic or thrilling for a supposedly romantic thriller. The author definitely uses a standard formula for writing. If you have read one Linda Howard book you do not need to read another they all follow the same format of weak heroines and over-bearing heroes who constantly get their way. Granted this book is almost 20 years old and expectations have changed over the years it is still a bad book I would have enjoyed more complex characters and a more substantive plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old but sweet romance!","review":"This is one of Linda Howard's earlier works and though it lacks somewhat in the action department, the romance is very sweet and fulfilling. Jay and Steve's story is very special and we're shown how two people gradually fall in love and end up having the most amazing chemistry. A very special love story in my opinion, and one, not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rev. Timothy Wright Does It Again!!!","review":"This is a great album from start to finish!

So far, they haven't shown much interested in this...even at almost 6 months of age.

I am definitely not satisfied with the overall product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true work of classic film art, Hopper did it right!","review":"Classic Don Johnson, Virginia Madsen cast perfectly in her sultry, southern white trash, vixen role. Dennis Hopper really put this one together down to the perfect lazy southern blues music. This complex but basic good and evil plot leads you down to a riveting and heated climax. The city slicker character(Don)learns a thing or to from this sleepy southern town which he thinks he can wrap around his finger. Jennifer Connelly is the pure, innocent, and beautiful contrasting element among the devious characters in this tumultuos, kinky circle of characters. Great, memorable lines and dialogue between Johnson and Madsen. See it twice for the details you miss the first time. Watch it with friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong zone, pay attention to the region when buying a DVD!","review":"This film was based on a book written by our great uncle. It was my fault that I didn't realize what \\"zone\\" meant when buying it. Have not been able to watch it because it was produced in another country and my DVD will not play that zone. Please pay attention to the zones when you are buying a DVD. Would be nice if that were more self explanatory in item descriptions. Region 2 does not work well with most US DVD players."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hot Spot","review":"Having bought \\"The Hot Spot\\" almost exclusively on the reviews of Jennifer Connelly's topless \\"scene\\" here on Amazon, I was disappointed in that respect. This scene is outstanding but not worthy of the hyped-up reviews.In general, the nudity is less than I expected. But it's hard to complain about any nudity involving Virginia Madsen and Connelly. Both are as hot as I've seen them in our out of clothing in any project.In his own right, Don Johnson does an excellent job in this movie as he still has some of his \\"Miami Vice\\" prime left. Surprisingly, the script and plot are excellent as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"good dvd","review":"I really like this movie....One of my favorites of all time, especially the soundtrack.I'm pretty sure this was the last project that Miles Davis worked on before he passed.But I don't like the reproduction of the video from the movie on this DVD.

Well directed by Dennis Hopper, the film at just over 2 hours manages to hold your attention throughout. Fascinating to watch really bad people doing really bad things to each other.Jennifer Connelly (very young) showed tremendous promise in this.The big surprise is Johnson who is actually terrific as the stranger in town that sets all the action in motion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh . . .","review":"I bought it for Jennifer Connelly's chest, I got that and quite an eyeful of Virginia Madsen, and what this all boils down to is that Dennis Hopper directed this movie. Seeing as how he did so many drugs in his time, that would explain why this movie makes woefully little sense.But hey, I got what I paid for. It's not like I was expecting an Oscar-winning effort here. But, oh, did my head hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just under-rating Texas (except for Jennifer Connelly)","review":"I live in Texas for 15 years and this is my home. The movie is empty, meaninless and just a waste of time. Jennifer Connelly is an exception, as her play (an in many other films) indicates an actress in a growing process towards the Oscar she won, well deserved at least, with a Beautiful Mind in 2002.Would you wish to see Connelly mastering? Please watch Waking the Dead.It is so much deeper, meaninful, no comparison at all.Texas is an wonderful place. Its traditions, its way of thinking, has nothing to do with this movie.And yes... Jeniffer... You deserve so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Good 35mm Film","review":"This is a confusing, sweaty mess of a film, that tries to be a sexy story of southern seduction, and turns into nothing more then a tribute to the heat and humidity of the south.

Just pick and choose the verses I want, cut and paste.Anybody who has studied Islamic science will find this book extremely skimpy and biased in its explanation of the various subjects within Islam.

Instead what I found was a thinly-veiled criticism of Islam point-by-point in comparison to Christian values. The authors are converts to Christianity who note an Islamic precept and then condemn it as inferior to Christian views. I read about 20 pages and then threw it away. This is by no means a balanced view of a religion and is NOT to be recommended to anyone who hopes to learn about Islam from an open-minded approach.

Many 5s and 1s. This tend to happen when there is some bias for either side. Unfortunetly, it turned out to be the case. The book will do two things:Make the authors richer.If you have blind hate towards Islam, it will FALSELY justify this hate. If you do not have any prejudice, it is a biased book so do not begin from here.Please do not waste your money on this. If you hate Islam, nothing will change, justify your hatred elsewhere.Dont waste your money. And by the way, if you have an ounze of critical thinking in you, this book will be annoying because its arguments are so lame that you will not sleep thinking how stuff like this even gets published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick","review":"Sick and disgusting. Islam is not necessarily the best religion but it isn't evil. ANY religion can be portrayed as evil. It is all from your perspective. THis book has a biased author.

Not an opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Disappointing","review":"I am a practicing Christian and have never really thought about Islam. In the last few months I have become good friends with a Muslim. I checked out a few books on Islam so I could understand a bit more. I was very disappointed in this book. It seemed to take all of the bad parts of Islam and pair them up with all of the stereotypes we've heard lately. I thought it was very negative. Definitely not a book for someone looking for a non-biased view into Islam."},{"rating":"1","title":"An agenda piece...","review":"I read this book after it was recommended to me by a pastor at a local church. I am a rather prolific reader of theology, so it didn't take long to see that this was neither a theologically sound or scholarly look at Islam. The authors either have a poor grasp of Islam, or they chose to pick bits and pieces to reinforce their bias, which is evident on every page. This book is intended to assist Christian evangelicals in approaching Muslims, but it is more harmful than helpful. Muslims will ask \\"If your knowledge of my religion is based on half-truths and lies, how can I be sure that what you tell me about yours is the truth?\\" My advice for evangelicals...stick to works by reputable scholars and investigate their background and their agenda before you buy into what they are saying. I recommend \\"The Heart of Islam\\" by Nasr and \\"101 questions about Islam\\" by Renard for the basics. Skip this pablum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate portrayal of Islam","review":"The book is rather bias against Islam (although not as extreme as some). Whatever the two brothers claim, they do not seem to have a good understanding of Islam. They lack education regarding key aspects of Islam. Their argument that jihad is physical and does not have a spiritual dimension is wrong; the fact of the matter is that Jihad has both dimensions with the spiritual dimension being the greater as the Prophet Muhammad himself said in a Hadith. This is just one example from the many errors in the book.If you want to learn about Islam, find another book written by someone who has a good grounding in Islamic education and understands the Islamic tradition in an authentic manner. Murata & Chittick's book \\"The Vision of Islam\\", for example, is much better. This one is not an honest account I'm sorry to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor--BE HONEST","review":"If you are unknowledgeable about Islam,this book will lie to you. If you are knowledgeableabout Islam, this book will disgust you.If you are already biased against Muslimsdue to ignorance, religious intolerance,bigotry, or racism, then this book will excite,intrigue, and confirm your current assumptionsabout Islam and Muslims.If you harbor fears about what you don't understandregarding Muslims and the religion of Islam,and you wish to remain in a state of uninformed fear,then this book will help you accomplish your goal.So please, be honest with yourself in regard towhat your seeking to accomplish when looking for bookor information on Islam and Muslims.There are MANY honest, impartial, and academicallysound books about Islam, this is NOT one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for All Christians","review":"This book is a must read for all Christians. I studied briefly the tenets of the Islam faith many years ago but it merely touched the surface. In our current political environment, each Christian should make a point to discover more about this religion which is impacting our lives so heavily. These two brothers make it clear that a knowledge of Islam will help all Christians to be more effective witnesses for Christ as we discover the characteristics of Islam that have allowed it to spread very rapidly. We have a duty to our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ to witness to everyone at his leading, however, being effective as a witness is more difficult when we are faced with the cultural differences that so often characterize people born into the Islam faith. Read this book and Re-read it so that you are equipped to represent Christ and allow him to work in the lives of the Islamic people that you come into contact with."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiring Look at Life in Islam by a Former Muslim","review":"The author is a wonderful speaker and has written equally as well in this book. He is fair and shoots straight from the hip regarding fundamental Islamic beliefs and creeds. He uses the very Koran to back up his writing, which gives this book credibility and makes it a powerful tool for Christians to understand where Muslims are coming from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well-written","review":"I was very interested to learn more about the Muslim faith and was somewhat dissapointed with information conveyed. The authors have a bias being former Muslims who converted to Christianity. I found the book to be not well-organized nor well-written. The information is not presented in any logical format.

For example:\\"And spend in the way of Allah and cast not yourselves to perdition with your own hands and do good (to others). Surely Allah loves the doers of good.\\" (2:195).Allah shows love based on good works. Islam is based on good works in order to receive the entrance to heaven and God's mercy. In Christianity Love is unconditional. The Caner brothers go to special lengths to specify the differences in their book and this is one MAJOR element. Apparently the prior reviewer was so one-sided in his view and beliefs or Islamic faith that he failed to see the hole picture.I recommend this book highly to anyone wanting a quick overview of Islamic faith and how it relates to Christianity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair and biased perspective","review":"Muslims themselves criticize how other Muslims(particularly extremists) handle situations. Yes, Muslim extremists do suppress women, but that doesn't necessarily mean Islam sanctions oppressing women. Problem is, the secular and extremists Muslims have a lot of voice, we hear what they do. But the majority of Muslims who are educated, or \\"moderate\\" are the ones who do not suppress women and follow thier religion with logical thinking, these Muslims are the ones who hardly have a voice we can hear. Extremists use violence to send thier message, and secular Muslims, or \\"westernized\\" Muslims have the west to express thier non-islamic opinion.To make it short and sweet, this book is just an opinion of the average Islam-hater explanaition you'll find in those typical internet chat rooms, with just a little more logic. Yet, any Islamic scholar, or just an average Muslim can realize this is in no way an understanding of any of Islam's teachings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaffected turn against their roots","review":"The Caner brothers are a pair of gentlemen who have greatly benefitted from the September 11th attacks, like other authors with Muslim backgrounds, they have cashed in by turning on the faith of their ancestors and writing a tell-all on the evils of Islam.Too bad that this book is poorly researched with numerous citations that are inaccurate. If the citations are inaccurate, then the information itself is inaccurate. This book is a mess, and Im surprised to see that it is being presented as a scholarly work by some. However, I am not surprised when I see that these people are the same who use God to make a buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Quran sais it best...","review":"\\"Is it such a message that ye would hold in light esteem? And have ye made it your livelihood that ye should declare it false?\\" Quran 56:81-82. The Caner brothers have made it their livelihood to tell lies about Islam. Read this book if you want to learn how much Evangelical Christians hate Islam. Don't expect to learn anything about Islam from it. If you wanted to learn about Christianity would you read a book written by someone who converted to Judaism? My recommendation is \\"Islam and the Destiny of Man\\" by Charles le Gai Eaton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did the author even read the book?","review":"This book has proved that the author never even happened to glance at the Koran let alone analyze it.This book is really for those who want to make themselves believe Islam is not a peacful loving religion, either because thier ignorant, racists, full of hatred and the likes.For those who know Islam well and aren't stubborn, this book will sure leave you laughing and stunned when you observe the stupidity of the author's claims. The book isn't worth a dime.But for those who do purchase it, make sure you save the reciept...you'll need it for your refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and hateful","review":"An extremely biased book sadly used to demonize Islam.

I could already disprove this book myself.But there were some things that struck me, which I later found out was taken out of context. Funny, how they attempt to decieve people out of a religion.Basically, if you hate Islam, you will like this book regardless of its content. If you like Islam, this could be a joke. If you want a honest approach, what can be better than the Quran(and make sure you get the official one too, i recommend (yusuf ali)].Other books I would recommend is;Unholy War: Terror in the name of Islam.Idiot's guide to the Understanding of IslamOr better yet, buy the DVD/VHS \\"Muhammad; Legacy of a Prophet\\" You won't need any other book(other than the Quran of course) if you watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unvieling Islam???(Please Read)","review":"This book is quite biased.

It is worse than useless because it misinforms the reader. There is nothing about it that gives the impression that the Caner brothers have any first-hand knowledge of what it really means to be Muslim. An excellent introductory level correction to their errors is found inWho Speaks For Islam?: What a Billion Muslims Really Thinkby Esposito and Mogahed which reports the results of over 50,000 hours of careful polling of Muslims by Gallop. It is a must read it the Caners' book has infected your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludicrous","review":"This book is filled with half-truths it's quite sickening to anyone who knows what real Islam is like. The author's knowledge about Islam ranks close to my knowledge about nuclear physics: practically none. It's sad that instead of trying ot emphasize the similarities between Islam and Christianity (which are numerous) the author tries extremely hard (though he fails miserably) to show that Islam and Christianity (which worship the same God-Allah is Arabic for God, used by Arab Christians and Jews BTW) are not related in any way. The author idiotically attacks a few 'bad apples' that abuse Islam or misapply it, and then he sticks these accusations to Islam. It's like saying Christianity is an evil religion because there are criminals and war mongerers who are Christian. It's a very childish 'argument' and it is simply a cheap shot at the religion that asks people to \\"think, read, and learn\\" (The first word that came down on the prophet of Islam was \\"read\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out on a Limb","review":"This book might look good on a coffee table, but that's about all.

Mr Stiles has written on the subject for over thirty years and has published several other books on treehouses, including, Tree Houses You Can Actually Build.

This album opened avenues of music to me that I was previously unaware. It was a musical epiphany, and remains one of my all-time favorites.While the songs in themselves are classics, Willie Nelson sings these songs reverently, pensively, and goes all the way to the soul of the music.

If you decide to purchase this recording you won't be disappointed. As a couple of other reviewers have mentioned, the sound is mind-blowing. Nelson's singing, his phrasing, and the orchestrations of the songs are all under-stated and elegant -- all except on \\"On the sunny side of the street\\" which I found rather wooden. Nelson is much more than \\"just\\" a country singer -- he's an original with a unique musical perspective. You could almost say he's a jazz singer with a country twist -- or vice versa.

Then I later discovered that the reason was due to there being two directors and a lot of the scenes I had a beef with were shot by Richard Lester not Richard Donner, who was fired after the first film's premier. Most painful to watch was the Clark Kent tripping scene and the Lois Lane Niagra Falls jump scene.And then there's the stunning lack of Marlon Brando as Jor-El. A decision that was made to save money. Thankfully, that has been rectified.Amazingly, Dick Donner and Michael Thau were able to recut the film using footage that was thought to be lost and did a whale of a job.And fittingly, Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, is dedicated to Christopher Reeve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first moive, but entertaining","review":"I liked the performances overall and there were some very daunting special effects for this movie, but the charm of the first is not evident. When we see the characters fly, we do not believe it quite like the first one. For instance, when Superman flies through Lex Luthor's lair and up into the sky after the missile, I really believed that was him flying. There is such a great suspension of disbelief permeating that movie. With this one, however, the atmosphere is one of comic relief and its okay in that regard. The music is not nearly as good as Superman, either. Its part of the same but different. Overall, a very entertaining movie. The best were Reeve, Hackman and the three supervillains. THey all gave great performances. Although Hackman didnt sound like himself in some parts of the movie. Its almost like they hired someone to do his voice in parts. I dont know but thats what it sounded like. Definitely not as good as Superman the Movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not perfect...","review":"While the BLU RAY version delivers crisp images and is an excellent improvement in image quality from the DVD I wouldn't use this BLU RAY as your system SHOW OFF as there are better BLU RAY show off movies. One interesting thing is that due to the high resolution of BLU RAY and if you have a proper high quality 1080p display, you will find (at least I did) that the Metropolis street scenes where shot in a studio location recreating the city.

I agree with others that the change at the end was lame, but I can still pretend that the original ending was used. Although I also agree that the \\"magic kiss\\" was lame. This was fun to watch and I feel the scenes with Brando give it more weight and tie it better in overall theme to the first one. A great movie from my child hood. It was nice to watch it with a different twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superman at its Best","review":"This is one the best Superman movies ever made. There is a never-ending debate on whether this or the first movie is the best, but I just buy both of them! Personally, I do prefer the first one, given the legendary cast and writers and a lot of what is in the first movie actually was supposed to be in the second movie. Investor/studio pressures force the director to put all the goodies in first movie to ensure its success so there should really be no contest. But yes, this movie does put Superman face-to-face with more worthy villains which gives him something to fight against. My favorite parts are actually those involving Lois and Clark because they have great chemistry. Make sure you get this dvd and not the blu-ray Donner cut which is just atrocious...don't make same mistake as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same story, new nuances.","review":"I found the Donner cut of Superman II quite interesting. I watched the Lester cut first and then went to the Donner cut. I've always found some of the Zod stuff to be too long in the Lester cut, and i was thankful that some of it was missing in the Donner. I didn't miss the Eifel Tower scene at all, and the alternate revelation of Clark being Supe is actually quite good, even if it is a screen test. The scenes in the Fortress of Solitude are different in places, but no less believable.BUT the 4 stars are because of the ending. I was never wild about the ending when it was used in Supe I, but to reuse it at the end of Supe II (even if it was the original ending) makes no sense. It reverses too much, and the famous diner scene couldn't possibly make sense. It would be even more fun to insplice the best moments from both films and have a super SUPE II, but that won't happen. I'm just glad to have the alternate available."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"It's a shame it took over 20 years for this film to see the light of day. This films makes chronologically more sense than Mr. Lester's II. The first time I watched it, I was in awe. The second and third times I've watched, I kept thinking that it was a shame it was not released back in 1980.I hate to think 'what if..', BUT just this once, 'WHAT IF Mr. Donner's II been released?' I'm sure it would've been a huge success, then we would've had III and IV, all with Donner at the helm, and there might not have been 'Superman Returns' (a great homage to Donner's I an II, but missing the heart).The beginning and end sequences are a thrill to watch. The 'missing' scene where Clark gets his powers back is not only great, but if you are a father, inspirational. A father sacrifying his own life for his son to live? Great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth All the Fuss","review":"When I heard this was coming out, I was really excited. I did think that, beginning with Superman II, the franchise was more camp than action movie. So I was hoping to see what different direction Dick Donner had planned. Apparently, it was different camera angles. The beginning is the same, the end is the same, there's details in the middle which are different, but add nothing new or worthwhile to the story. I wish I had rented it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely overHYPED!!!!!!!!","review":"The version of the second movie was NOT worth it. Sure there were extra scenes with Jor-El, but there was definitive errors in editing. For example, in the end, Superman leaves Lex Luthor in the Fortress of solitude. WTF?!?!?!? Plus, at the end, Superman reverses time like in the first film, but then goes into the diner where he got is butt kicked to fight that guy Rocky; since he turned back time, it actually never happened. Plus, there were plenty of deleted scenes altogether.Don't waste your money!!!! Stick with S1 and S3 (with Pryor)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappoint","review":"I already owned the DVD and I thought if I bought it in Blu-ray Disc it should be fantastic.

The other sups paled in comparison to the original. So when this version came out, the Donner cut, I figured why rent, the 2nd was good, donner's will even be better, buy it. Wrong. I feel like this dvd cut version was put together in a day. The cuts are bad and abrupt, the effects a cheap. The original, back in the 70/80s are better, and the story itself isn't fleshed out. It just goes from scene to scene, and if you've never seen the film, you would be lost. It's a real shame. I know Donner only filmed a bit, but still, this version is sub par and the ending..um we've seen it, and this time around it's a total cop out. AVOID and see the original 2nd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"I have been looking forward to viewing the Richard Donner interpretation of Superman II.

In the original theatrical release, you laughed because of the humor.

Lester is not a great film maker, his one meal ticket was with the Beatles in HARD DAY'S NIGHT, and that was it. He did not know nor care about Superman, he just wanted a pay check and the real loss was the movie going public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold up","review":"I saw this film recently, and it just didn't hold up over time. The story is still great, and general Zod rules...but a lot of the movie came across as...cheesey. The scene where Zod and gang terrorize New York was just plane silly, and New York looked like a sound stage. It's too bad, because this was one of my favorite films as a child. Maybe your kids will like it, but as a previous fan...the magic was gone.On a positive note, I saw the Wrath of Khan recently as well, and that movie did hold up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching Richard Donner's sour grapes!","review":"After four Superman films and Superman Returns, watching the Richard Donner cut is like watching Superman VI. It's an almost completely different film, and it sucks!After watching this dud, I concluded two things; Warner Brothers clearly had good reason to bring in director Richard Lester as a replacement AND that there should be a statute of limitations for revising a film that has already been in long and good standing with movie audiences.Two major problems under Donner's direction. One, the overall story seems far less gripping as it almost completely undercuts the special bond that develops between Superman and Lois. Two, the edit and cuts are so poorly arranged, you feel like you're watching a movie that has been edited down to run in a shorter time allotted.SUPERMAN II was never broke. It should not have been fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, rubbish DVD","review":"This is one of the best of the Superman films. In fact, I'd put it on a par with the original. Superman faces the twin conflicts of his love interest with Lois, and a trio of super-crooks who have escaped Krypton and are released from their prison by Earthly weapons. It is therefore unfortunate that this DVD has been put out without care or interest. Not only is the picture untidy, but I now have two versions of this DVD, and neither work properly. In both cases, the screen kept freezing and jumping several minutes. I then get an error message saying the DVD player can't read the DVD. Do yourself a favour a buy this on cassette."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This item took only a couple of days to arrive. I bought it used & it plays perfectly.

Obvious footage swap from Donner, but also obviously necessary, make a better movie. I always liked the original Superman II, but this Richard Donner Cut shows the promise and greatness that this young director at the time had. As far as I'm concerened Richard Donner is Superman's father because he gave birth to 2 perfect movies that his fellow directors were unable to re-create in the following awful sequals. The Marlon Brando appearances were far more affective than the \\"mommy\\" substitute. Great version. Great movie. Greatly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give us the Theatrical version on blu-ray please!","review":"I grew up on this movie, and I love it. Superman 2 was my favorite of the Superman series. In my opinion it was the strongest and most enjoyable, and I believe there are many critics and fans who would agree.I bought this version because the theatrical version was not available on blu-ray, and boy do I regret it. It is nothing like the film I excited to see again (no Eiffel tower sequence, the Niagara sequence is also almost entirely cut). Instead, I got a weak hodgepodge of material that was never intended to go together, or even (some of it) to be seen anywhere but as a deleted scene in the special features menu. It's a novelty, not a film, and more than that, not the film I knew and loved and would like to own. I'm sure there are many people who are glad to finally see the Donner footage, and I'm glad that this makes it available to them, but it is unacceptable as the only version of the best movie of the Superman franchise available on Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DEFINITIVE Superman II!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have waited a long time for this moment. The fact that this actually happened is nothing short of amazing. Seeing what the extra material is on this only makes me want this version more!! It's got a docu on the restoration, deleted scenes, an intro by Richard Donner, and what im most looking forward to.........a full length commentary with Donner and Tom Mankiewicz. This will be amazing. Truly amazing. The fact that they even allowed Donner to come back and finish completing his film after he had been fired is astounding!! This is not the version most of you are familiar with. That one was directed by Richard Lester. This one by Donner is considered the true sequel to the original Superman-The Movie, which Donner also directed.

She's a very hot super villian-ette (not sure if that's really a word - I may have just invented it.)There's nothing I can say bad about this movie. Christopher Reeve was fantastic in this, as was everyone else in the cast. The story is very good. It's got a great mix of action, romance,humor and adventure.As great as the original Superman movie was, I think this one was even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time of revenge!","review":"In the first entry of this saga, a handful of villains were accused of betrayal and attempts to subvert the order in Krypton. The last person of the Council was precisely Superman' s father, and they return to the Earth in search of their revenge.Finally we will witness the expected concretion of the romance between Lois and Sup.

Perhaps this version makes sense to Donner, but it is far less entertaining than the Lester version. There are many continuity problems and plot inconsistencies. The movie appears flat and lifeless.

It contains interesting footage which has never been seen before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - Don't waste your time","review":"Donner should be kicked in the groin for making this very dumb version of Superman II. The ending is lame and unoriginal. The re-cuts do not really add anything to make the story better.

Save your time and effort and stick with the original one you saw in the theaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Return of Superman!!","review":"Thank God for the Donner Cut of Superman II! After the lame rehash that Superman Returns was and the disrespect Brian Singer showed for the character and his universe, it was a treat to watch how reverently and skillfully Richard Donner handled the Man of Steel in his version of Superman II. The Richard Lester cut is good,I've always enjoyed it. BUT,...the Donner version is considerably better. Donner's version excises the weakest aspects of Lester's version and gives us a more coherent,deeper and romantic Superman film that respects the fans and the source material. It's not just different, it's a substantial improvement. Get it, you'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does everybody love this movie?","review":"This movie is at best average. It's a violent \\"normal\\" sequal and as usual can't live up to the original. The original lived up to the comic book and was very faithfull. Christopher Reeve was again great as the man of steal and who could top Gene Hackman. Terrence Stamp was good as General Zod and Sarah Douglass was goods as Ursa but Jack O'Halloran as Non was a wasted and useless character. The great Superman theme by John Williams is still there but as massive and exciting. If you want a good sequel see Superman 3. But only see this if your a die hard fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Release the original - please!","review":"Superman II is one of the most underrated movies of all time. It moves at a blistering pace, has bad guys you want to hate, comic relief, and one of the most satisfying endings I can think of.

It's amazing the films are as good as they are, given that the studio fired the director halfway through, split the work into two films, and refused to reward the actors for the second movie. Instead they cut Brando's work along with the entire point of the movie. This is why Superman II was really little more than Superman dispatching three bad guys introduced in Superman I.In that regard, Superman II had always been a letdown for me. This new cut restores the heart and soul of the original vision, yielding a profoundly enjoyable film. It's truly the best that can be done with the material available. You've got to see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was just like the 1st one","review":"Superman II was more exciting and fun to watch. I loved everything about the movie.

They generally make more sense and provide better continuity than the ones filmed by Richard Lester.Terence Stamp was very effective as the authoritative and menacing General Zod. \\"Come to me, son of Jor-El!

I was a 13 year-old, seasoned superhero comic book collector when \\"Superman II\\" was first released, and I was in absolute awe! I saw it FIVE TIMES in the theater (which for me is unheard of, even to this day). Yes, they gave him extra powers, but excitement of seeing Superman fight THREE evil Kryptonians was just too incredible to allow one's self to whine over minor details. Plus, who would have ever thought that Lois Lane would ever actually find out that Clark was Superman?

Three criminals from Krypton (as seen in the beginning of the first movie) arrive on Earth just as Superman is giving up his powers so he can be with Lois. Why he needed to give up his powers (which he couldn't anyway) didn't make any sense. However, the action made up for the script and plot shortcomings.

The Supervillains can immediately speak English, after Superman loses his powers he can still go back and forth to his Fortress of Solitude (in a very remote location) without too much effort. The special effects aren't quite as good as the original, and are a little bit dated by today's standards. In spite of these plot holes and other leaps of logic, not to mention several superfluous moments of campy humor, the movie manages to propel the audience along with enough crowd-pleasing adventure and excitement to be more than worthwhile.

The only positive side to this version is that if it had been originally released in the theaters, instead of the Lester version, the public response would have been so negative that we would have been spared the image-tarnishing third and fourth movies.

I don't understand why the bonus material is worth an extra $15 more than the movie alone is apparently worth.If I'm wrong, and it is the extended version, then the packaging is poor for failing to say as much (I would certainly get it if I could be certain it was the extended version I remember.) Based on at least one reviewer here, I'm betting I'm right, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intensely enjoyable","review":"Having not seen the \\"theatrical\\" cut of Superman II in years, I can't speak to how much better this picture is than that version--what I can say is that after the embarrassment of \\"Superman Returns,\\" Donner's cut of the original sequel was a welcome breath of fresh air. In fact, it was so good, so enjoyable and so much fun that it actually helped to set the stage for \\"Superman Returns\\" a bit, and helped the later film on subsequent viewings.Still not crazy about turning back time, though, and as much fun as the second \\"diner\\" scene might be for viewers, it really seems un-Superman-like for him to go beat up on some guy just because he's a jerk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty decent sequel compared to its predecessor.","review":"\\"Superman II\\" is not the best film compared to the first one, but still worth watching. Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, and Margot Kidder did a pretty okay job in this one, but not as good as their performances in the first Superman film, which also starred Marlon Brando. You see Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor character in league with the three outcasts from Krypton to find a way to destroy Superman. But you also see a little bit of a repeat from the first film, where Lois Lane is still falling for Superman. But still, this is one of the best sequels around, with action and romance, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darker, serious Superman II as the way it should be seen","review":"I was amazed at how much different Richard Donner's version of the film was compared to the original Superman II. They basically made a 'new' movie by throwing in as much of his original footage as they could while keeping the overall story consistent and coherent. The mood of the movie is much darker than the original, more serious, but it was the way it was meant to be filmed.As for the DVD itself, I was a little disappointed that they didn't add any real special features. You open it up and see only a DVD in there; no chapter lists on the side or anything. It's basically a disk with the 'new' movie, an intro by Richard Donner, a short documentary about restoring the footage, and subtitle options. But still; the movie is a masterpiece that would make Christopher Reeve proud if only he were still alive today. The movie is also dedicated to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon cuts out","review":"Unlike Netflix, which has high quality most of the time, we seem to have an issue with amazon movies stopping in the middle and needing a complete restart every time. We were happilly watching superman two and it just froze, then when we finally got it back, the picture quality was diminished. This happened with other streaming amazon purchases but has never happened with Netflix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the movie you think it is. Be warned...","review":"I bought this because I love Superman II. It was one of my favorite movies growing up and I figured \\"How different could this version be?\\" Well it's a lot different. From what I understand we (the audience) are supposed to view this film as a \\"What could have been if Donner had directed it\\" and forgive the fact that it makes the movie choppy and loses the heart that I thought was what was so great about it. If I were going to release this to DVD or especially to Blu-ray, I would have made it an extra disc released in a boxed set like they did with Blade Runner. Why is it so hard to believe that people would want the original version on Blu-ray? If I knew when I bought it what I know about this version now I would have just kept on shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lester Version Was More...This is a Bad Version","review":"Just finished watching this movie and it was FAR, FAR less entertained than the theatrical version.Gone is the cool Eiffel Tower scene (replace by Donner's choppy opening to link it to Superman I).Lois Lane finds him out by much less interesting means (by shooting Clark Kent...really, Donner?).Gone is the romantic scene where Superman travels the world to get flowers etc for Lois Lane.Spolier coming up...Superman \\"undoes\\" everything by spinning the earth backwards - one of the lamest scenes in Superman I.If I could return this DVD, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Anamorphic!","review":"Be warned that this Blu-Ray of \\"Superman II - The Donner Cut\\" is \\"not\\" anamorphic. That means it was recorded with solid bars on the top and bottom of the 4/3 box in which the film is copied. That means that the actual resolution of the film is only about 650p, not the advertised 1080p. The remaining 430 lines are used to record the black bars, which are visable when the movie is viewed with the TV set to 4/3 format. Many movies, even major releases like \\"The Matrix,\\" are released like this and in so doing, misrepresent the resolution of the viewed movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled","review":"I am so glad I purchased the regular DVD version of the Donner cut before I knew the Blu ray version was out. If you are a fan of 1 and 2 as I am, this is a rip-off and a waste of time and money. Case in point, there is a scene between Superman and Lois Lane that was imported in from \\"screen test\\" footage. They didn't even look the same. Don't spend a dime of your valuable Blu Ray money on the Donner cut. You'll be sorry you did. Be forewarned."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD","review":"WELL I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE END HOW EVERYTHING GET BACK TO NORMAL EVEN THOUGH THE TOWN HAS BEEN DESTROY OTHERWISE I LOVE THIS MOVIE EVERYTHING IS PERFECT"},{"rating":"2","title":"The saga has come full circle","review":"This is the version that should have always been, the tone matches the first Superman movie in every single detail. It has erased the shoddy quality of the Lester cut for me. Well done, Dick and Tom."},{"rating":"2","title":"real superman II adventure continues","review":"First of all i want to thank all superman fans because of this product. I think superman II Richard Donner cut is direct sequel of superman the movie. Even opening credits is same style of first movie. There is no campy, slapstick gags in this movie like in superman III and Lester's cut. Also music is original not the Ken Thorne's themes like the Lester's cut. Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder's chemistry is awesome, Marlon Brando's scene is excellent because when you see this scenes you understand why in the first movie he said to his son something about father and son. Of course there is some problems in this movie like test screens of Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve but they had to use it. Richard Donner's cut definitely superior to Lester's campy version. I pretended that I never watched superman II. If you like superman the movie , you love this cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well researched account of outstanding officer","review":"As ever, Mark Yerger presents a well researched, highly readable and thoughtful work about an outstanding WW II subject. This is an honest account of the career of one of the Waffen SS's lesser know figures; illustrated by numerous photos and presented without the all too common, knee-jerk, anti-German \\"victor's bias\\" which is so prevalent among works which purport to \\"tell the real story\\" behind the War and those who fought it. Reminds both German and American readers of the terrible personal price which was paid by Krag and so many other German soldiers and their families after the war; a price levied simply because they served their country honorably and that country happened to be defeated. Happily recommended to anyone who likes history reported accurately."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfavorable","review":"A total of 64 pages. One half of it is in German, the other half in English.

As difficult as the novel is to read, one doesn't have to get too far into it to realize that the author was a genius with words. I think to have any appreciation for the movie and for Jeremy Irons performance, it's best to have read the book. Otherwise you might find Charles Swann completely insufferable and the movie boring. But for those who have read it, I think you will find Irons performance maddeningly perfect. Ornella was beautiful,and I agree with the reviewer that the movie, at the very least, gives one an idea of the fashion and style that made up the early years in young Marcel's social life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intense love story","review":"Obsessive love is the theme of this movie, based on the book by Proust (SWANN's WAY). Set among the idle rich in 1890's Paris, Jewish aristocrat Swann (Jeremy Irons) is in love with courtesan Odette (Ornella Muti), who is obviously beneath him in station. Racked by jealousies and fears of not being able to win her (probably most who have ever been madly in love with someone who didn't quite love back at the same intensity can relate to this), one wonders if his agonies are worth it: even if Odette decides to marry him it's doubtful she'll ever remain faithful. Like ULYSSES, its near-contemporary classic by Joyce, it's almost an impossible novel to adapt to the screen, though director Volker Schlondorff does a credible job. Beautifully photographed, the movie is an eyeful of aristocratic France; the musical score adds much to the flavor. As to be expected, feelings and nuances predominate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring only iluminated by Muti's eyes","review":"It's a slow boring film, where nobody shines.

However, \\"Adjustments\\", in my opinion, is THE BEST BILL WITHERS album to date. Although a couple of songs from this album have been reissued on \\"The Best of Bill Withers\\", the world is being deprived of other such greats as 'Heartbreak Road', 'You', and the list goes on. If record companies (along with \\"on-line music sites that assist in advertising\\") would care about the shear satisfaction of their customers, they would put all of Bill Withers' albums back on the market and it really will be a \\"Lovely Day\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"this is so good it makes me want to puke","review":"The first track, \\"Use Me,\\" is maybe the greatest thing ever. If funk were steak, \\"Use Me\\" would be a 48-ounce porterhouse. The funny thing is, the studio version of \\"Use Me\\" isn't that great at all. This live version is incredible. Worth buying for that track alone. \\"Lean On Me\\" is also very strong.

On a whim I ordered this book used for 1 cent. It was published in 1947. It is a fond reminiscence of the Irish experience in Australia. The shanty Irish provided the brute labor for the Aussie Industrial Revolution. They were poor as dirt and lived in decrepit tenenments where bed bugs sucked there blood as a nightly ritual. The flaws of this family are fondly recounted. This family is afflicted by alchoholism, poverty, and disappointment. There is a tragic loss of a young child. The daughter is are so naive she gets knocked-up and needs to visit a back alley abortionist. There is mostly grinding poverty occassionally offset by glimmers of joy or moments of happiness. This book is surprisingly readable. It is like a soap opera which opens a window on the early 20th century Irish immigrant experience in Australia. The author shows pride of craft and executes at a high level. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"This classic Australian novel, comes highly recommended. It is about post-WW2 Surrey Hills slum dwellers, revolves around members of a poor Irish immigrant family and their neighbours. It's a standard story of poverty, dysfunction, filth, teenage pregnancy, alcoholism, violence and despair. None of the characters is particularly attractive and it has all been seen before.

If you want basic how-to, this is it. The framework is particularly relevant for those raising funds for new projects. The book follows the development of a single proposal related to human services and, as a result, readers in that field will find it particularly easy to relate to. Excerpts of interviews with grantmakers about what they are looking for and a reprint of one foundation's actual proposal scoring sheet are valuable enhancements. The book also covers building relationships with funders and includes information about researching funders, which help to place proposal writing in a broader fund development context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't fail step-by-step procedure","review":"We are using this book to put together multiple project proposals.

It provides a fair amount of general information that will be useful for readers who lack proposal writing experience. Unfortunately, the book suffers from being a bit too general in its approach. The author attempts to cover both private and public grant writing, but the overlap between these two areas is not great enough to justify lumping them together. My only other complaint is that an index is not included."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!!","review":"I cannot believe it took this long for this documentary to surface on DVD. Yes, probably some marketing tactics involved but this release is long overdue. An awesome movie to say the least and it really brings back memories, not only of the man himself, but when I took a bunch of friends to the movies to see this on the big screen. A few of my friends, not crazy Beatles fans like myself, really enjoyed this film I remember. It is also amazing how John's life keeps on \\"Shining On\\". I cannot think of anyone, including Elvis himself, who has been gone for 25 or more years, that has a very strong presence today. \\"Imagine\\" answers that. John was someone above human life who only wanted peace and love, stop the fighting, let's all be one.

It's an interesting story, told well, narrated by the subject himself, John Lennon.I'm old enough to remember the heyday of The Beatles, but they didn't reach Roxboro, North Carolina to the degree that they did other places. I grew up in Elvis country. The history of what John did as a Beatle and as a soloist is fascinating in and of itself. If you don't believe me, watch the DVD. You'll watch it more than once.Were you ever listening to a song by The Beatles and thinking, \\"It's okay but it's not their best?\\" Of course you have. All Beatles songs are like that! But this DVD is not. It's the real deal.The Beatles, by the way, were positively wonderful in interviews. All of them are clever, even the drummer.

I almost want to transcribe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Addition To Your Beatles Collection","review":"It took me almost four years to find this movie. For a time, I've listened to the soundtrack, and it was so amazing. I just had to find the movie. Finally, I managed to purchase it and I was awestruck. The film depicts a lot from Lennon's private life from his life with Yoko to his untimely death. Although, some live appearances, especially with the Beatles at the 1963 Royal Variety Show, were reworked using some studio recordings. Another thing is the scene when John and Yoko make love is a little irratating. I'd rather skip that scene, for the rest is absolutely brilliant. I can't wait for it to come on DVD. I hope they'll add footage that couldn't make to the final cut, for they have over 200 hours of footage. If you like John Lennon at his best in his own movie narrated by himself, my advice is to get this NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"I had never seen this 1988 piece before, and I was suitably impressed with its mature view of Lennon. I especially enjoyed the footage of him in the studio with Phil Spector, who looks very cool in 1971, though he doesn't appear to do anything to assist with producing or recording. Also great are a few little clips with George, as well as the rooftop concert. This makes me realize how little of the Beatles filmography I've seen. This film looks warm in its present incarnation. You will learn a great deal from this if you watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I loved this movie when it first came out and almost 25 years later, it's still just as wonderful.

Film certainly captures moments; his youth, Beatlemania, Yoko, the \\"Bed-in\\", his deportation troubles, etc. But other unsavory elements aren't mentioned; such as his brief heroin addiction, and even though May Pang offers comment, his affair with her is only touched on briefly. Am I poo-pooing this? No. I'm just describing it. There's a few moments of uneasy premonition, such as when John laughs when a fan letter predicts an assassination attempt, or when he states that fortunately he doesn't know the future. Highlights include verbal judo between John and cartoonist Al Capp, as well as the music and a peek into his treasure trove of home movies. A must-have for fans, and a rough demo of \\"Real Love\\" opens the movie, which the other three Beatles completed in 1995."},{"rating":"2","title":"John!","review":"I loved this movie so much,and I actually cry every time I see it.

Absolutely no money was spent to enhance the audio or the picture. I understand the picture quality, some of John's home video's are so grainy to begin with that it's probably be impossible to improve on them much but the audio was 2.0. It would've been kinda nice to hear some of the songs on a 5.1 surround. With today's technology, it can be done, and rather cheaply too. This is why I give it a 2 star rating and I didn't really mind that the \\"extra's\\" weren't worth a pot to spit in.The movie, itself, is 5 Stars. This is THE definitive documentary of John Lennon. It shows the good and some of the bad too. It gives him a more \\"human\\" quality and , of course, the soundtrack is awesome.

There are TWO John Lennon videos called \\"Imagine.\\" If you're looking at the 1972 copywrite, this is a collection of videos from the Imagine album (there are a couple of Yoko videos as well, from Feeling the Space). This is notable, not so much for the videos, which are fairly self-indulgent, but for the outstanding sound. I believe this has every song that was on the Imagine album, and the sound here blows the CD away. So, if you love the Imagine album and want really superior sound, this is a \\"sound\\" investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine-John Lennon","review":"Imagine is an excellent film: I have seen it more than 7 times since 1988 when the movie was made. I strongly recommend this DVD to any audience. It shows the music and private life of one of the best musicians of the history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhilerating!","review":"I'd never listened to Wendy Woo (and her Woo Crew) until today. I'd heard bits and pieces about them, however (all very good things). I ditched a birthday party that I was supposed to go to today so that I could listen to Wendy Woo and the Woo Crew at our summerfest and am I ever glad I did. I would highly reccommend her stuff to anybody who appreciates music. Thanks much to Wendy Woo and the Woo Crew ...

Some of the fiction is good--but I had already read it elsewhere. The non-fiction, though: He is asserting that HIV doesn't cause AIDS, he basically supports creationism and he's saying that ozone depletion is nonsensical. If they were well-supported positions I could accept that from a SF author, but they are only well-supported by very selective use of evidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price","review":"It is much cheaper than local Pet's mart.

It's more of a dark comedy than horror, though. Peter Weller stars in this movie about a man who has his life turned upside down by an unwanted guest in his home. The acting is good as Weller does a terrific job as usual. That being said, I thought this was supposed to be a horror movie, and from that standpoint, I was disappointed. I guess it's a brand of horror, but not the kind that appeals to me in that sense. However, as a dark comedy this movie does very well. Just depends on what you're looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"If It Can't Bore Me To Death . . . Nevermind, It Did","review":"The Good -- Peter Weller shines in this movie. As soon as he first speaks, I believe he is his character and that he believes he is his character. Great actor.The Bad -- Despite this movie's short running time, things drag on for way too long; so much so that I fell asleep about halfway through for a few minutes, woke up, found that the scene I fell asleep to was repeating, and then went back to sleep until the last few minutes. The worst offense a movie can commit is to bore and this movie did that in spades.By the way, this movie is basically a one-man show -- Peter Weller vs. the rat. The advertising makes it seem like his family is terrorized; they're not; they're only in the movie for a few minutes.The Ugly -- The killer rat. Really. It's ugly. And extremely fake-looking. Its first appearance brought out a laugh from my wife and I. A horrible effect for a horribly boring movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time - worst movie ever seen","review":"I saw this movie when it first came out in the early/mid 80's. It is by far the worst movie I've ever seen and the only reason I watched it to the end was to see how much more ridiculous the story line would get. Basically, the movie depicts a man who goes on a hunt in his house trying to catch and kill a rat, and in the process the man destroys his house. My husband and I were talking about the worst movies we'd ever seen and I told him about this one bringing him to Amazon's site to show him.

Maybe I was just missing the point, or maybe I expected too much, but instead of beguiling it just annoyed. On the positive side, the use of different times and spaces concurrently worked well, but the introduction of so many famous faces from the past... Just flashing familiar faces and building on their stereotypes does not make it an interesting historical novel.

The problem that the characters have are very similar to the ones that people do really have in their teenage years. A part of the book that I really didn't like is, that some of the problems are very fake . They really have no reason behind them. I also have compared this book to many other books I have read.

In the match where a combat was offered to decide upon his rights to teach other non-chinese students, according to Bruce Lee's wife LInda Lee.. she watched that match..I think this movie is just like the case with Jet Li's fearless.

Bruce suffered a pinched nerve in his back through improper weight training. Any true Bruce Lee fan knows this movie is not accurate.

If you're looking for a good film about Bruce Lee, this is not it. Sorry, but despite Jason Scott Lee and Lauren Holly giving very good performances, this film is about as historically accurate as a tabloid story on Madonna's intact virginity.What is described as Cohen's 'artistic license' is in plain English another Hollywood money grubber exploiting Bruce by manufacturing lies to sell a film and line his pockets at the expense of Bruce's life. Bruce would be outraged at this blatant rip-off! You should be too.If you want to know about the real Bruce, see the films Enter The Dragon, Return of the Dragon, Fists of Fury and The Chinese Connection. Also read his books such as the Tao of Jeet Kune Do, the Tao of Gung Fu, and the series entitled Bruce Lee's Fighting Method by Bruce and M. Uyehara.

Lee is presented as a man full of insecurities and disappointments. It his heartbreaking to see the main role in \\"Kung Fu,\\" a series conceptualized by Lee, go to David Carradine because Lee was too ethnic for mainstream American television.

Knowing that each stores 2.5 oz makes bottle prep a snap. I wish that they came with some sort of dispensing system for the fridge so that the freshest one was always in front. Sort of like those dispensers for soda cans that you can get for your fridge. You would drop the most recently pumped bottles in a hole in the back and the ones to use first would roll up to the front. Otherwise it's kind of a pain to store them in the fridge. The bases are narrow and they tend to tip over on the wire shelves in my fridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best storage bottle!","review":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE these.

I recommend it to everyone, even if you dont have a medela breast pump. as a matter of fact i pump with my Avent pump and pour into enough bottles for 3 feedings and the rest of my milk i freeze in bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"Pusher\\" for playtex drop ins","review":"If you're using playtex drop-in bottles, you know the frustration of trying to push the air out.

I've just heard too many stories about bags ripped/broken and milk loss. I work too hard to make it to see that happen!My only reasons for not giving these 5 stars:1) I wish they were bigger, but that's Medela's product team's issue, not Amazon's.2) The description on these says they're sterile, but I've gotten sterile ones that were individually shrink wrapped, and these were NOT.

If I'm puming after a feeding or something they're fine, but if I'm pumping in place of a feeding, I generally pump about 6 oz which is just enough that the bottles won't hold it all, but also enough that if I try to switch bottles I wind up with two bottles that only have a quarter z or so each in them. It's annoying. And maybe I'm missing something, but it doesn't seem like you can buy the larger collection bottles separately - you either have to get them with a kit, or with a feeding and storage set, either way you're paying for additional parts you don't need. The plusses though are these things come pre-sterilized and the small size has some advantages - topping off a newborn who only needs an ounce or two, or pre-measuring a couple of ounces of breastmilk to mix with cereal, for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're better off using freezer bags","review":"The average baby who nurses 8 times a day needs at least 3 ounces of milk per feeding, but these only hold about 2.7 ounces each. You'd need at least 9 bottles to store a full day's supply of milk. If you just want to store small amounts of milk for occasional use, these might be fine, but if you're trying to build up a good-size supply, you're better off using the plastic storage bags instead. The bags are way less expensive, and when stored flat, they take up a lot less room in your freezer. I pump into bottles, then pour the milk into the bags to freeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so bad","review":"when the product arrived it said it was new but there was a safety seal on it that was broken and un sealed. the seal said do not use if seal is broken for safety reasons. the bottles had water drop marks to suggest they had been used and washed. I was very disappointed and threw them in the trash. I figured if i had to pay shipping to return not worth the time. Please whoever sent these please let them know especially for storing breast milk this was so unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells terrible after multiple washings","review":"These have a horrible plastic smell after 2 hand washings, 2 sterilizations, and a run through the dishwasher.

Bumgarner's depiction of character and dialogue are as good as any I've ever read. I'm a fantasy guru and don't normally read thrillers or mystery, but I will read everything Barri Bumgarner writes. She is such an incredible individual, as I met her at the guild conference last year, and I think we will soon be reading about her in bigger places. She may be the first Missouri author to really hit the big time! If you want a good winter read, I suggest you get 8 Days, but don't plan to go anywhere for a while...it is a page turner, and you will not be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and poorly printed","review":"While getting ready for a two-month stint in Japan, I found an entry for this book and it looked helpful. When I received it, I was disappointed in the quality of the printing. Not only does it look cheap, but it is also difficult to read.When I got to Japan, I also realized that it is more than a bit dated. I have been traveling for more than a month now and have stopped using it. Granted, the cities are still in the same place on the maps, but the city maps need to be updated and corrected. This book was put together in 1991. My bad choice here. In the States, I would never depend on maps over 12 years old.This is just my experience. Take it for what it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful","review":"I am an American who has been living and working in Japan for two years and have gone on many road trips here, but I did not use this book at all. It has a nice detailed bilingual driving map of Tokyo, but you are better off taking the trains since they are faster than driving in Tokyo's traffic. It has a nice map of the train lines in major cities but you can get maps of the train lines in English for free at many of the major train stations. So don't wast your money. I did most of my driving through rural areas and country side where it makes more sense to drive, but this atlas did not give good details of the roads in those areas. Many of the roads in this atlas did not even have labels and were not clearly marked. Instead I use maps that were given to me for free from the Japanese government."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIlingual","review":"The key here is that the atlas is bilingual, and has surprising depth of detail, down to fairly small towns.

The illustrations are stylish and clever and just enhance the subject matter of the book. This is the kind of book you should have as a keepsake or give as a gift to all your single female friends and even Salmansohn suggest that it should be given to whoe she calls your\\"nudgy\\" friends and relatives. At my age I am asked all the time \\" why aren't you married\\" a lot and if something is wrong with my appearence or something because I am not married. So I knew when I saw this book in a catalog I just had to order a copy for myself and I highly reccomend it to all single women everywhere. I thought even of getting a copy of it to send to a long time friend of mine in another country where people put pressure on women to get married. This is a book I highly reccomend and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sass Sisters Unite!","review":"I love this book! For every woman who has been to a family reunion or worse, a wedding, and has been asked,\\"So are YOU seeing anyone?\\" or \\"You're an attractive smart girl. Why aren't YOU married?\\" this book is for you. After years of feeling awkward and sad about my Singlehood, I was fortunately, able to come to my own realization that I am actually pretty happy being single and that it will take someone special to fill the shoes ofHUSBAND.How I wish I had found this book years ago, though!It's a sass sister's dream come true! I found myself laughing out loud and nodding my head \\"Yeah! Right on!\\" It's a snappy, clever look at the prevailing social pressure to get married. It reminds us Single Girls that while marriage may seem like the key to everlasting happiness, there is a more realistic side to matrimony. I'd like to kick back and drink a Cosmopolitan with the author. She sounds like a cool chick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I purchased this printer because it was nice looking and advertised prints for as low as 24 cents. I was disappointed with this printer. This is an item I did not buy from Amazon but purchased at Staples Office Supply because of a rebate offer. I returned the product.The picture quality was poor. The pictures were washed out looking. The faces were white with pink but no warm overtones. You couldn't tell people's eye color. The pictures were definitely not photo quality. I compared the pictures to my Dell-all-in one and the lack of warmth (can't think of a better way to describe it) was very noticeable.HP makes good products but this is not one of them.

By October of 2006, all of the sudden, I had problems with the paper feeding correctly. I called HP, I spoke with a sales person from Staples (where the printer was purchased) and they suggested I get a cleaning kit or check the type of paper I was putting in and cross checking with how the printer was defaulted in the computer to print. I did that and it still only works if I have a certain amount of paper (not too much, not too little) and if I give the top piece of paper a little push. It is the most frustrating thing to print anything!! When this printer actually does print something, it comes out nicely, but the effort is definately not worth 6-7 months worth of use. I would suggest to keep looking!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JAMS! JAMS!","review":"I hate this printer. I hate this printer. All it does it jam and that is all it has ever done.

But, outsourcing saves money, you know. I did a live chat with someone on HP website and though she was helpful, it did not solve the problem.They offered to mail me a new cartridge 2 months ago but got the wrong zip code for my address.

Terrible print quality too even on the best settings after multiple calibrations and cleanings with HP photo paper.

One other thing..you can use it with a usb print server (not included) for network or wireless use, but when the thing jams the message handling does not function properly, especially with Vista.

Now I can't print anything on it, not even for the stuff I need for my wedding. We tried using a new cable thinking it was the cable that didn't work and still no result. I kept stopping myself from \\"accidentally\\" dropping it to see if it would work. I give it two start because at least it gave me 6 months of use until it died.

It is a modern author who writes in a Victorian style and setting. The novella is both intriguing, and shocking as it comments on society's hierarchy and the morality that lies within. The narrator is a trustworthy voice who is caught up in a world of bugs and insects that he does not see the activities going on in the house he is in.

But baring my ignorance, I will say the book was tedious. The most interesting question for me was whether Edgar and Eugenia were in fact brother and sister of any stripe since they had different mothers and fathers. This moral question is very much one for our day when Woody Allen can marry his putative daughter who is not a blood relation. Was that wrong? Did Eugenia and Edgar engage in anything more serious than a sexual liasion outside of marriage. This question although presented (see page 27 for description of blood relation) is not even addressed. A lot of work to consider an interesting question that wasn't considered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most of the Comedy is only Smile worthy, this is kind of entertaining","review":"I purchased it, because the director did Commonwealth and Dance with the devil and it was very cheap. To me this movie had no laughing moments; I had a couple of smiles though. It is better to take this as just entertainment not expecting any gut-busting sequences or funniness in general. The music video on the disc was more entertaining and lively than the whole movie itself. The girlfriend/arrest sequence is a plot hole in a way because it never explores if the fat guy really liked her. How funny is a fat balding guy getting slapped with a reaction of no emotion?

As a concert film, it isn't long enough. As an example of cinema concrète, well, who knows...Interview bits with Mingus in his loft apartment are spliced with club concert footage. The interviews are mostly monologues, as Mingus spews free associative stream of consciousness juju, at one point firing his shotgun into the apartment's ceiling. Later, as he's being evicted for nonpayment of rent, he wishes aloud for the Red Chinese \\"to blow you people up.\\" The concert material is worth watching, of course, for the opportunity to see the late master at work.

The twist here is that the existential anti-hero isn't riding a chopper or racing across America in a Challenger to keep one step ahead of \\"The Man\\" but in fact IS \\"The Man\\" --a motorcycle cop! One-shot director James William Guercio, previously known for producing the band Chicago and creating the Caribou Records label, does an admirable job (and leaves one wondering why he didn't continue to pursue filmmaking). Robert Blake delivers his second-best ever perfomance (\\"In Cold Blood\\" remains his highest watermark) as a highway patrolman yearning for a more glamourous (to his perception, at least) posting as a homicide detective. All the supporting actors are superb, and the expansive cinematography recalls \\"Vanishing Point\\" and \\"Badlands\\" with its sweeping vistas of the American West.

As a campy b-movie: Three stars. It's almost like a euro art movie, even Fellini-esque, except I don't think that was the intent. Are you reading this review to make a purchase/rent decision or to validate your opinion of the movie? Hmm. If you like \\"normal\\" movies and just want a good normal movie to entertain you, then skip this one. Too weird. If you are alone, like \\"Repo Man\\", and it's late at night and nothing else is on, then, sure, give it a try. Bizarre and entertaining. Archeological. Baretta as a simpleton.

There was way too much overacting, and the main character was a friggin' dork. Why am I supposed to root for some highway patrol cop with a Napoleon complex?

Clark manages to offer an intelligent Marxist-based claim about class and the emerging Parisian landscape in the 60's without losing sight of the paintings themselves. While most scholars feel the genius of this book lies in his wonderful discussion of \\"what couldn't be seen in Olympia\\", I find the first chapter \\"Environs of Paris\\" equally fascinating in its discussion of Manet's Exposition Universelle of 1867. A MUST read for any lover of Parisian history or Manet."},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"Well I bought two cause I though the price was great but unfortunately when I put it on it was really bubbly and Ali of dust got caught under it. Even after removing and trying to fix it several times It did not improve so I threw it out And bought a different brand"},{"rating":"2","title":"With patience and steady hand.....","review":"Had a few bubbles but with close inspection under very bright light, I could remove the lint with Scoth tape and re-lay the screen protector without a single bubble. It takes patience to remove the bubbles and without glue, the screen protector is easy to work with until perfectly aligned, bubble-free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price, Good Product","review":"I have installed a few screen protectors in my day and this one was a little more difficult then other products. This product came with a tip sheet on how to avoid bubbles and dust. These tips helped, but no matter what, I had dust and bubbles. The bubbles are very easy to remove with the supplied tool. The only way to remove the dust is to lift up the protector and use tape to remove the dust. It took a few times to get all the dust out, but once you have it, its a really nice product. The protector does get fingerprints but the supplied cloth removes the fingerprints very well. The product also prevents glare pretty well. Overall, I'm very happy with the product and may purchase a few more as backups."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more fingerprints on my new Kindle Fire","review":"This product has totally surpassed my expectations for the ridiculously low price I paid! No fingerprints, no glare and excellent touch control. A WINNER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"It was easy enough to install, but it is not anti-fingerprint....there are so many fingerprints on this after just a few hours that I can barely see the screen. There is still a glare and this screen protector makes the screen looking foggy and kind of blurry. Really screws up the resolution of the Kindle fire HD. Not bubble free either. I just got a shipping label from Amazon and will be returning this item. I was hoping they would have the same screen protector I purchased for my first Kindle Fire which was a GreatShield EZseal Plus, but they don't offer it for the Kindle Fire HD. The saying goes, \\"you get what you pay for\\". I would not recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant see a difference","review":"I just received my screen protectors and can't tell a difference when reading, may as well not be on there except for protecting the screen. I couldn't get all the small bubbles out, the larger ones were no problem. I think this one should be passed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"I bought this screen protector because it was cheap. While applying it I managed to get some dust and a hair trapped between screen and protector, and a few bubbles that refused to come out. I tried to use the \\"applicator card\\" and ended up putting scratches on it. This is one of those one chance only protectors--don't try to move it once it is down! I kept it on for a week or so, until the bubbles and dirt drove me crazy and I took it of. I haven't purchased another screen protector for my Kindle Fire yet, but the gorilla glass screen seems pretty durable, and I keep it in a sleeve or case most of the time. I will say that the screen protector did help with the annoying fingerprints that I always get on the touchscreen. So if you want a cheap screen protector that will help with fingerprints, and you are talented with applying these things, give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bargain Great Product","review":"my wife loves her kindle and now she has the protection on the screen.

Like the screen itself, the BoxWave still gets fingerprints on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price","review":"Maybe I am talented when it comes to putting screen protectors on but I managed to put this one on with less than five air bubbles. Those few bubbles I had went away very easily too. The protector does reduce glare, just not as much as expected, which is okay because the thing was only $2. Also, I like the matte finish on it because it gives more resistant to the touch screen and reduces some finger prints. If you're looking for a cheap protector, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Box Wave non-glare screen cover for Kindle Fire","review":"This product was everything it advertised. It does reduce the glare on the screen of the Kindle Fire and it was extremely easy to install--no little cardboard piece to scrape over the screen to remove air bubbles. It just pressed on in seconds. Very good product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good coverage","review":"It's a great item. Really cuts down on the glare and is fairly easy to put on.

It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to install and works great!","review":"This anti-glare screen is the best! It was easy to install and fit my Fire perfectly. It only took one try to be successful; the few air bubbles that popped up as I unrolled the backing were easily \\"scraped\\" to the sides and eliminated by using the smoothing card. After I finished, it was totally impossible to see that any protective screen was on my device, except for the tiny indented cut-out on the top left corner where the sensor is. This screen also \\"feels\\" better to touch. And, it does not affect the device's sensitivity at all. It is one heck of a value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"What customer service?","review":"I received my protector in plenty of time,but I am having issues with it.I tried 2 times to reach customer service, no contact has been made.

I followed directions exactly and tried using scotch tape as well as an air blower while applying this and still could not avoid getting a dog hair or particle of dust stuck to it. After trying to apply it myself and failing I tried to get another person's help and still got bubbles! This might work for someone with no animals and who has a dust free home! I did only pay $1.99 for this plus a few bucks for shipping so I didn't feel too bad when I balled it up and threw it in the trash!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"this screen cover was very thick and sturdy when first pulled out of the package. As with most screen protectors if it had many air bubbles, problem being once you removed the screen cover and tried to replace it it would not stick.

It distorts the screen, everything becomes pixalated.

This device is back lit just like and ipad you will never really be able to see them at the beach. But as for reading in the car or on an airplane during the day this glare protection works! Its practical, easy to remove/clean, and a decent price.

I had a cheap clear protector on it before, and that did not do the job.I bought the BoxWave Amazon Kindle Fire protector a few weeks go. It was very easy to install, and it works. I can now use the Kindle Fire at the gym with no problem. I have not tested it out in the bright sun by the pool yet, but I'm happy with the results so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I rarely write reviews, but this screen protector is awful! I read all of the instructions and I have applied plenty of screen protectors onto my phone, so I know it doesn't take more than a minute to apply flawlessly. After thoroughly cleaning the screen, I applied it carefully to the screen. I noticed some bubbles, so I used the enclosed card to squeeze them out. I even tried using the skotch tape trick as illustrated in the instructions. The enclosed card scratched the screen and now I have more bubbles than ever. It looks really cheap and scratched and the words on my kindle are extra blurry. It is anti glare and anti fingerprint as promised, but I would trade all of those options for a clear invisible screen protector, even if my fingerprints are all over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"I was skeptical after reading the back and forth reviews. This wasn't my first attempt at trying to put a screenprotector on my Kindle Fire. My past purchases were crap. My husband put in on after looking on YouTube and he said it was the easiest by far!. I was nervous that I wouldn't like the anti-glare, but it is fine and I actually like the was this one feels better than the crystal ones. Also, the touch features are not compromised. Definite buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic","review":"The other reviewers here that reference their 13 year olds enjoying this book are absolutely right. This book is for 13 year olds. As a 25 year old trying to wrap his mind around programming, it leaves much to be desired.If all you want is a gloss-over for someone who has no intention to continue in the field of programming, but just wants a non-programmers understanding of programming, this book is for you. If you want something you can take with you on a journey into real programming, you will have to really dig deep to distill the few morsels of theory offered here. In fact I had to reread most paragraphs dozens of times in order to find the underlying concept he was trying to teach; to find something that would still be useful to me after finishing the book.Bottomline: A waste of time if you are out of high school and attempting to truly learn something about programming. Take a few minutes to skim thru the pictures at your local bookstore, then go buy a real programming book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY ARE YOU NOT ON DVD???","review":"I give it five stars because it scared the hell out of me when I was a kid.

I own this on dvdr along with it's cover sleeve as well as artwork on disk! This flick does have it's rememberable scenes!!! There is an american remake of this little horror gem called \\"The Shaft\\". It's not as good; sad to say. If your a fan of odd-ball horror than get this movie!!!

My godson calls him Boo-boo bear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good action","review":"My only complaint with this movie is that it felt too short. If they would have extended it past the one hour mark I think they would have been able to get more out of the plot line.

That process is completed now and the book being published again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor at best","review":"I give this product a poor rating. The packing case is nice, but little else. The included plastic bottles are available from various retailers and are adequate. I do not like the Lexan eating utensils, which seem to have a greasy feel even after being washed with hot soap and water at home.Worst of all are the pancake turner and cooking spoon, which are not heat-resistant in any way. The tip of the cooking spoon melted immediately upon contact with the bottom of the small pot I was using when attempting to stir ramen noodles. The \\"pancake turner\\" melted and stuck to the griddle surface as I was trying to flip pancakes. By the time I was finished, all three edges were completely melted and small patches of plastic were adhered to the (non-stick) griddle surface.I would not recommend this product.Edit >> This review does not reflect poorly on this seller.

In particular, having the added insights and explainations of Sean Barron, himself, in reference to the often bizarre and seemingly unexplainable behaviors that are associated with autism, gave me a unique new set of eyes to see my son through. What a gift this,is in terms of the insight it provides and the hope it inspires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"if you are a parent who just has found out about your child's diagnosis, or you are feeling discouraged about the disability, I do not recommend reading this book. While it is the story of Sean, the boy with autism who did eventually come out of it, the process throughout the entire book is not encouraging but rather depressing. The whole time I was reading, I kept hoping for some glimmer of hope that something good was going to happen, but it wasn't until the very end that anything remotely happy happened. It is a good book if you are looking for some factual things about how a person's mind works who has autism, but do not read if you are having a hard time with autism."},{"rating":"1","title":"none","review":"the book was ok but i felt the motgher kept stopping his behavoir if he wanted to knock blocks down so be it he couldnt help that. just a thought but ohter wise the book was ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon speedlite 430EX","review":"This is the first flash bought bye me and I feel it gets the job done.

It stays pretty much like it was in the first one. Nobody really looks different or anything. This film deals with some different issues like how Rocky spends his money and fame and how Apollo deals with his victory. Rocky seems to not understand show biz in this one. The final fight was big time suspenseful, as in early in the series you did not know if Rocky would win or not. The plot about Adrians coma hurts the pacing and Apollos journey is rather one- note, but it gets you where you need to be in this movie. Mickey sure did scream a lot in this movie. Rocky II is not as good as the first and I feel there was something missing in this one so there went one star. Buy it if you are a real Rocky fan like myself. God bless you and have a great day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Story Part II","review":"Rocky and Rocky II are movies in which every parent should show to their kids.

Picking up on the heels of the first film, Rocky II finds its lovable protagonist trying to settle down and make a name for himself outside the ring.While there aren't any surprises (and the effective camera work of the first is sorely missed), Stallone has effectively recreated the characters and atmosphere of Rocky. Unlike the numerous sequels, this picture is very assured. With a run-time of 119 minutes and most the action packed into the last 25 minutes of the movie, Stallone goes a great distance in an effort to involve the audience. There are a few clumsy scenes at the beginning, but for the most part he succeeds. This is due, in part, to fine supporting work from Burgess Meredith(excellent as the trainer) and Carl Weather(returning as the serious champion)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a poor remake","review":"To see Rocky doing the same things again is just plain boring.

Just a series of disjointed, low-class, rambling tales. If this is the real Willie Nelson, we've been had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Willie Nelson Should stick with singing and thats that.

I thought the story was excting and was written at a brisk pace, no endless filler. The main character, Ryan, can be hard to root for at times, but in the end he has the best interests of the 1000 men he's leading at heart. I really liked the character of Colonel Fincham who is insubordinate to Ryan at every turn. The detail of what it was really like in a POW camp were excellent, and the same goes for later in the story when the men are herded like cattle into train cars. Von Ryan's Express is a quick read and tells a compelling story."},{"rating":"2","title":"All American way","review":"THis was a great survivor series , and there was really only 1 boring match. THe razor team vs. the irs team was a great match very exiting and very entertainin , the family fued match was kinda slow but good , and it starts a huge storyline the whole bret and owen rivalry. The smoky mountain match was the borin one i didnt even know who was fightin it was bad but it was really the only bad match , then prolly the best match was the 4 doinks vs. the bam bam team , it was luke doink , butch doink mable doink , and mo doink it was really funny. Then the final match , the all americans Captain lex luger , undertaker , rick and scott stiener vs. forieners captain yokozuna jaques quebecer , crush and some finland guy but a good match , overall survivor series 1993 was a good pay per view!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say no to Survivor Series 1993","review":"This event is just as bad as WCW's Greed PPV back in 2001. There were many substitutions that hurt the matches so badly like Randy Savage subbing for Mr.Perfect,HBK subbing for Jerry Lawler,Crush subbing for Quebecer Pierre and UnderTaker subbing Tatanka. The Worst matches on the card were The Family Feud match & The 4 Doinks vs. Team Bigelow match. No good matches at all at the PPV. By the way,NONE of the 4 Doinks were Doink himself. The main event between The All-Americans(Lex Luger,Undertaker,Rick Steiner & Scott Steiner) and The Foreign Fanatics(Yokozuna,Crush,Ludvig Borga & Quebecer Jacques) was bland and the confrontation between Luger & Borga was boring as a Ed Wood movie. I give this event a 0 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best mills I have ever owned","review":"For those who use sea-salt and prefer to purchase it in the natural un-ground form, this is the ONLY mill to use. When you purchase your grey sea-salt in bulk, it is shipped damp and you want to KEEP it damp to preserve its natural benefits and flavor. Nothing but ceramic will stand up to the test of grinding damp salt without corroding the mill itself.This mill has a nice capacity, is easily adjustable, and even has a nice looking design. It should be ideal for peppercorns and other spices as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"versatile, fresh flavors","review":"Grinding seeds, cumin, caraway, etc. gives a stronger and more complex flavor than the powdered version.

It fits in with your other standard-sized spice bottles too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sea Salt Grinder","review":"I keep it on my table for company, but actually, it grinds so little, so slow, I don't use it myself. I thought from the ad on it I had at last found something that would grind sea salt (This is the third kind I have bought)but I'm still not satisfied. I doubt I will try any more brands.

They've established themselves as a great .NET resource!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comprehensive book!","review":"Over the past couple of years I've become aware of the Murach series of books which fill a definite need for a complete coverage of a subject.This book,Murach's ASP.NET 3.5 Web Programming with VB 2008, is no exception.While it would be impossible to cover everything about asp.net in any book (nor should anyone try), this book covers a wide range of topics that will give the reader a very good set of knowledge and tools to develop almost any conceivable website.It does start from almost the beginning with html and procedes with actual examples and a growing project through the various server controls, navigation, validation, formatting, data access, security, ajax and custom controls.The reader should have some familiarity with programming and related concepts but beyond that a new person to .net will get a very practical education with this book. There is a lot of information packed into the 1000 pages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really BAD -- Not a Training Book","review":"This book is really misleading. If you expect to learn how to do web programming from this book, forget it!!! At best this is a decent reference book. This is not one of those how-to-do books. The examples are short, and this book has no step-by-step lessons for learning. You will not be able to teach yourself ASP.Net programming from this book.The only way this book is good is as a supplemental textbook in a class with a teacher going through the material. If this book had sections for step-by-step self-teaching, then this book would be good. This book is sorely lacking in that area. The cover says this book is for training. That is very misleading.If you need to purchase a book to teach yourself how to do ASP.Net programming, do NOT buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Training and Reference Book!,","review":"This is a big book (999 pages) with a lot of technical information. The \\"paired pages\\" format is used in this book: how-to on the left page and examples on the right. This style contributes to the effectiveness of the learning process. ASP.NET 3.5 has many new and improved features which contribute to quicker and better web applications. This book starts off showing how to use Visual Studio and ASP.NET (158 pages). The next section (204 pages) covers HTML, managing state, master pages, and other need to know knowledge. Section 3 is devoted to data access including SQL, data controls, object data sources, and LINQ. Security, authentication, personalization, custom error pages, AJAX and much more is in Section 4. Custom user controls, custom server controls, and web services are discussed in Section 5.There is a lot information in this book. It is well suited for both training and reference. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Reviews","review":"I purchased based on the reviews here and now realize they must be paid reviews. So much talk about another Murach hit, and 'This book continues the Murach tradition'. What a bunch of baloney. This is a decent reference book - thats it. Don't purchase thinking you'll learn to actually build something beyond the most simple site. A fair reference but 'Easy to read, using the \\"paired pages\\" format' that every review raves about is not as good as having an actual excercise to follow. Bottom line - do you want to read 800 pages or do you want excercises that will lead you through the process of building a site?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price","review":"The book has a great price, and the delivery times was a little bit slow but nothing that didn't work as advertised by the seller.The book itself is not that great, if you are a beginner this may not be the right book for you. However the book has great information and the information in it is easy to digest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halfway between two great styles doesn't make a great style","review":"Tutorial books with step-by-step instructions hand-holding the reader through a complete solution to an example problem, followed up by some gently-guided exercises, are wonderful.Reference books that present complete just-the-facts information in a well-organized manner are wonderful.Trying to do both, while adhering fanatically to a pathological style of paired pages (one text, one figure), leads to disaster.Either goal - tutorial or reference - could have been accomplished magnificently in a book this heavy. Neither was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but not for beginners","review":"I purchased this book after reading the excellent reviews. I have decent html knowledge, and some limited asp 3.0 skills. I wanted to start using asp.net 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005. I found myself quite confused with the first one page project in the book. This was because the project is presented as if the reader already has VB 2005 experience. I found similar reviews to Murach's ASP.net 1.1 web programming book. If you are looking for entry level use of VS 2005 with ASP.net this unfortunately is not it. I was hoping to see explanations of different controls in the toolboxes, etc. I will keep this for future reference and keep searching for a good beginner's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ASP.NET 2.0 book!","review":"In short: simple and clear explanation, practical code examples, good coverage of ASP.NET 2.0 features, and the paired page presentation format makes the book an easy read.This is certainly one of the best programming books that I have ever come across. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book..","review":"At the moment this book is my absolute favorites about Web Programming with VB 2005. If you are interested in this topic, I can only recommend this book. Great Book. Easy to Read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a Beginner in a Hurry","review":"The book goes into a lot of theory and gives a lot of good background, but I needed to learn this today and get something coded up for the boss by tomorrow. I couldn't wait until I finished Chapter 4 like it says on the cover. I ended up getting what I needed from Evangelos Petroutsos \\"Mastering Visual Basic 2008\\", Chapter 26, and had something up and running in just a few hours. The format of the book sounded good when I read the other reviews, but I changed my mind after a few pages. The right hand page just reiterated what the left page said, sometimes with relevant pictures. But, in the long run, it just seemed to make the book twice as big as needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intro to desk Reference","review":"I picked this book up at my local store the price is better than many others on the same scale.

I had high hopes for this book because the movie is so fantastic, but it really let me down. It didn't hold all of the meaning, and coming-of-age feeling that the movie did.

Although very funny, and further enhanced in places by an almost Quentin-Tarantino-esque plot line, this book is neither as comic nor as credible as its precursor. This is due in part to the fact that the first half of the book is a pure fantasy within a fantasy, and real laws of existence are totally disregarded, and also to the fact that almost none of the book even vaguely relates to the series, without which there would have been no Red Dwarf cult following anyway. Certainly, BTL is original and amusing, but hard-core Dwarfies will become somewhat confused over its frequent departures from the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only really good RD novel is the first one.","review":"This has a few moments, but not too many, frankly.

There is no justification for this other than to grab more money from fans' pockets (and of course to tie-in with the past-its-prime 6th Rocky flick coming out). I bought the original Rocky DVD box set, because I am a fan of the series. Then there was the second set that miraculously appeared with \\"improved video\\" or whatever. Now, Rocky is rererereleased in a 2-disc version, and the second box set is being rererererererereleased. WHEN WILL IT END? When will one release of a movie be the final one?

I remember seeing a group of students at school discussing just how great this movie was, how inspiring, how positive. After viewing the movie myself, and trying my best to be upbeat about it too, I never felt this way about the movie. In fact, I thought it was stinko. Seldom could I understand just what rocky was saying, since he seemed to be talking with a mouth full of ham sandwich all the time.What is the basis of this story? A guy, severely outclassed in ability and experience goes up against an impossible foe. It is an old plot of amature vs pro and the amature winning. So what. There are so many movies that use this plot - outnumbered, outclassed, outeverything vs what appears to be an unbeatable foe. Many of these movies do carry this through and show how the beaten down can sometimes come back and win it all. These are the ones to see, not rocky.I do not recommend this movie to anyone seeking an inspirational movie.Joe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only person who does not like this movie?","review":"I dislike all of the Rocky Movies.

Sylvester Stallone is not that good of an actor, in my opinion. He's not the worst actor ever, but he's definetly not the best. The main reason why I gave this movie 1 star is because the showdown between Rocky and Apollo Creed at the end is very disappointing. I was expecting a big climatic boxing match, but I was appalled at just how boring and short it was. Rocky didn't even win the damn World Heavyweight Championship belt from Apollo Creed because the referee stopped the contest too soon. Right before the credits at the very end of the movie, Rocky looks so retarded screaming, \\"Adrian!\\" over and over again. What a lackluster conclusion. I've heard people tell me how the climax of this movie gave them goosebumps. Well guess what? I didn't get one single goosebump! The ending to this movie sucked! Nearly everybody else seems to think that this movie is just the greatest thing they've ever seen, but I don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me????","review":"I bought this because of the fact that the DVD cover said \\" Nominated for 10 acadamy awards!\\" This movie is aweful! 1 star is giving it too much credit.

A word of warning this movie has some mild language, mild violence and a couple midl disgusting parts like when Rocky drinks the five egg yokes uncooked. Rocky is a young little now boxer who's struggling to make a living. He's fate when he is given a rare chance. This thirty year old 180 pound man gets a chance to go up against the heavy wait champion a 30 year old 225 pound young buff black man Appolo Creed. This movie may not have a ton of actions but it makes up with it's beautiful potrayed characters and thrilling musical score. This is a movie that will inspire the most discouraged of all people.

Four more rocky's came after this but this is my favourite and the original and made Sly Stallone what he became.He wrote this film and he was the Director as well so he is not as stupid as people make him out to be.

Stallone got his wish, and like Rocky, made good on the unlikely opportunity to clinch his fame. Although the feel-good, come-from-behind story has been done to death, Avildsen's mix of low-life street drama, heart-tugging romance (with Talia Shire as Rocky's faithful girl), and bruising, in-the-ring melodramatics hammer home the uplifting message of hope like few films ever have. The gritty camerawork, location shots in urban Philly, and Rocky's intense training scenes with irritable, curmudgeonly Meredith (who's terrific) work beautifully.

I have tried drinking three cups of it now, two plain and one with honey, and I just can't do it. It tastes like celery seed. I made a coworker smell and taste it, and she independently agreed that it tastes like celery seed, so I don't think it's just me.

It shows the whole gang out to help their friend find his way home. With a few embedded lessons like bad things can happen if you accept rides from strangers. Without terrifying them. Showing that family is not just who you look like but who you love. Especially good lesson for adopted children. that friends are valuable family too.quite frankly I think that No elmo is a major plus! Remember when Kermit the frog was a big hit?

I was primed to write up a good old-fashioned rant about this book, but just read the other reviews and you'll get the gist pretty quickly. Destination: Morgue is a compilation of half-baked nonfiction pieces (most of which will be old news to anyone who has read My Dark Places) and three truly, embarrassingly awful novellas. And just because they are written badly on purpose doesn't make them any less horrible. On top of the painful prose, Ellroy takes his standard Post-WWII Racist Cop Thug caricatures and plops them in modern L.A. It doesn't work. At all. Like watching a man on a high-wheel bicycle ride in the Tour de France, it's just ridiculous.If you've never read James Ellroy, I recommend you stay away from this and start anywhere else.

I found it less intense than her other books, but I still found myself wanting to throw the book a few times, in frustration when the main character was mistreated!

I am a big fan of V.C. Andrews books. I have decided to not conitnue reading this series.

Reading this book made me glad not to be an orphan or not to be in the position her stepmother put her in. I also think if you're interested in ballet (or not), or are in ballet this will be a great book to read. Butterfly caught my attention and keep it there. I couldn't put this book down for anything!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just lame","review":"Butterfly is the first novel in \\"VC Andrews's\\" Orphans miniseries. I would strongly advice any one against buy this dull, silly litte book. The heroine is pathetic, annoying and not worth reading about. I am also sick of \\"Rich people are evil\\" which happens in every book of the Orphans series. Very tiresome of Andrew Neidermann to have such tired old stock villains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butterfly: Falling From the Sky","review":"Okay, this book, is poorly written, clichéd, and all of the plot twists can be seen from miles. So, why did I buy the book that contains all four of the Orphans' Stories? Because even though they aren't very good, there are scenes that are decent enough to be read once in awhile.Janet \\"Butterfly\\" Taylor, an orphan, is a adopted by Celine and Sanford Delorice. Celine wants Butterfly to be a dancer, just like she was, before the car accident that crippled her. However, Janet is not her, and the results of trying to force the eager to please girl into the Pointe shoes, are disastrous."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"I just loved this book!

It was really a short vinet' into a short period of this girl's life and very little happened (according to the standards of her other books). I hear RUNAWAYS will be a full novel (unlike these little 200 pagers), so my guess is they need these 4 insignificant little background stories to make the big picture work. I was let down, but I don't think Andrews is going to lose readers unless the whole series flops. Most of the buyers are die-hards, so they'll see it to the end just to see if RUNAWAYS is as pointless as the rest of them. My advice, change your mindset: Don't think of BUTTERFLY and the other first 3 as short, pointless background storys, think of them as a really long prologue to RUNAWAYS. Andrews' people would be smart to get the others out ASAP before people lose interest. Only time will tell..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major let down","review":"I couldn't believe ir when I read this book, I expected so much and I got nothing. Butterfly (Janet) gets adopted, moves, goes to ballet, then leaves. That's it nothing else happened. The reader does not find out anything about Janet's past, the family she's with, and nothing major really happens to her. I think the V.C. Andrews ghost writer(s) had better rethink what they are doing to her name, because their story writting is going down hill big time. I was a major fan, now I couldn't care less. What a let down to the V.C. Andrew name.

You couldn't even get into the head of Janet cause she was a bland character who went along with everything. The writer doesn't give the main characters point of view on anything and leaves her extremely underdeveloped. Still....there was one major event in the book that made me squirm anxiously so I recommend this book for anyone looking for an easy read. But if your looking for moving and poignant plot writing steer clear of Butterfly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This was awful, thankfully I only spent about 2 hours reading it. There was no origniality in plot, characters, development, etc. Every moment was a cliche. From the Janet, the main character who uses the symbol of butterlies tosymbolize her need to \\"soar\\" to freedom. To the nasty person who runs the orphanage. What happened to the ending?

However, as part of the VCA collection, it is unacceptable. Mr. Neiderman should have written this series under his own name, or under a different nom de plume to attract a younger crowd. This does not even begin to compare to the Dollanganger or Casteel series, and is a far cry from even the recently-published-before-this Logan series.The story of Janet is mildly interesting and provides a light read for teenagers, and is a nice quick read, but had no real depth. I don't know why Neiderman decided to go in this direction. For a diehard VCA fan, this book (and the rest of the books written after the Logan series) simply aren't good reads and are barely reminiscent of VCA's writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Recommend This Book!","review":"This is a very short book for someone age 12 or younger.

If you really want to read a good book, check out Flowers in the Attic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I've read all of V.C. Andrew's books but stopped after reading Secrets of the Morning. Why? Because the stories were beginning to all look alike: dark secrets in the family, incest, main character never getting along with her parents etc... it's as if the writer is following a recipe! Butterfly's plot was so predictable because characters were so 'stereotypical'! There wasn't much of character development... Well, maybe in a 170 pages novel you can't do much of it. But then, if you can't or won't develop the character, what's the point of writing the book??! The name of the school that Janet went to, Peabody School, isn't it the same as the school Dawn went to?? I mean, how original... Reading Butterfly, I got the impression that the writer didn't put much thought into this and wrote the book just to make quick money. Cheap shot!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This does not belog in the horror section!","review":"This was the first book I have read by V.C. Andrews and maybe it was a bad choice. I always thought V.C. Andrews wrote scary stories but this book proved me wrong. I know that it is hard to write scary scenarios in books, but this was just not scary at all! I found this book disappointing as a horror, but satisfying as a drama. In fact, I found myself crying! But then again, I cried in Bambi.

I was at home with a migraine the day Mr. Hornsby, Mr. Skaggs, and Kentucky Thunder were featured on CBS' Early Show. They were doing a remote from North Carolina, if I recall correctly. I had the sound way down but turned it up when they were on. I was blown away by Dreaded Spoon, by the 100% pure joy in it. It reminded me of \\"The Christmas Story\\", how the narrator remembered \\"The Old Man.\\" Mandolin Rain is a lot better on CD than it was on TV that day. I'm not a regular viewer of CMT, and sometimes bluegrass grates on me with the high-pitched singing and instruments. The sound becomes so strident, I can only listen to so much. So I hadn't even heard of the album until I saw the boys on TV. I ordered it as soon as I was up and around. I can't remember any time I was glad to have a migraine, but there you are. Buy it, enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd rocks!","review":"Though a bluegrass cd, this cd absolutely rocks. The songs you know take on a new life, and the songs you don't know will sound great from this first playthrough. My son (5) loves the album and we played it over and over. As a Bruce fan, I can't get over how talented Ricky Skaggs is. As a Bruce fan, I love to hear Bruce stretch it out and do his bluegrass thing for an entire cd. If you're scared of the \\"bluegrass\\" label, don't be. There is nothing unusual about this album. You'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd just doesn't cut it","review":"If you are really into Bluegrass you will probably like this cd as it does offer quality instramentals but Hornsby's voice just doesn't fit this musical genre imo.

Unless you are a fan of Bruce Hornsby, you will probably not like it. Do not buy it based on the fact that it is Ricky Skaggs, which is what I did. If I was Skaggs, I would be embarrassed to have my name on it.The songs where Skaggs is featured are okay, but I would consider it mediocre work for him. The rest of it I could not even listen to. I had to skip most of the songs after listening to the first 10 to 20 seconds. It is that bad.Most of the CDs I buy are excellent, and again I am a huge Ricky Skaggs fan. I am floored because I rarely dislike CDs as much as I dislike this one. Plus, I am even more disappointed that it is a Ricky Skaggs album.I recommend you preview it heavily before purchasing. If you think you will like it, then by all means buy it. I wish that I had previewed it first because I would not have purchased this album based on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Music","review":"I'm a real lover of Ricky Skaggs music, but this is by far the poorest put together CD in my collection.

She was much brighter and more compassionate than her journalistic style (based largely on soundbite simplification and name-calling) might reveal her to be to those who don't know her.

I strongly disagree with Malkin's advocacy of Big Brother, Big Government tactics. Recently in one of her columns she defended John Ashcroft's sinister, frightening, and draconian methods.

Rather, she engages in ad hominem attacks on her opponents and uses bombastic language to make her point when the facts don't back up many of her contentions.The fact that it is recommened by the likes of Juan Mann, an anonymous Justice Department official who writes under a pseudonym, is all the more reason to look critically at what is written by Michelle Malkin.If she knows who Juan Mann is, perhaps Michelle Malkin could state who s/he really is rather than promoting further anonymity.

Malkin should focus on her own Philippines, as a number of Filipinos have been deported from the US to the Philippines for having alleged ties to terrorists organizations. Malkin's hatred of Mexicans knows no bounds. She was recently part of the smear campaign against California Lt.

She should be eternally grateful that pundits of her ilk in the late '60s (who uniformly described anyone from that part of the world as \\"nips\\" and \\"slopes\\") didn't adversely affect the same immigration policies that allowed her own parents to \\"slip under the radar.\\" Honestly, there is no logic here -- only fear, xenophobia, whatever you'd like to call it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An easy way to make money","review":"This book does not offer anything new.

There is nothing here that you wouldn't find in other more comprehensive books (e.g. Earthly Bodies, Heavenly Hair by Dina Falconi). I was also mystified by Ms. Byers statement that facial steaming was bad for everyone (or something to that effect).

The glue that plan toys uses does not work well at all...this is the second toy that we own from this company that has glue issues. The green track underneath the toy became loose probably a month after owning it from everyday use...nothing abusive just a 9 month old playing with it. The balls are very hard and can hurt a child if thrown, but I expected as much from a wooden and supervised my children accordingly. Recently one side of the green track came off completely. I am really dissatisfied with the quality- I expected that any wooden toys that I've purchased would be saved for my kids to give to their own kids someday. My son still bangs the hammer around alot but that alone isn't worth what I paid for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"endless amusement","review":"I recently bought this for my seven-month-old son, and, despite the fact that he's a bit young for the whole hammer-to-ball coordination thing (I let him play with the hammer only under close supervision), he LOVES it.

Plus, it's durable and green!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly a well-loved toy","review":"My 9-month old son initially didn't know what to do with this toy, and I actually didn't think it looked like much fun just hitting balls into holes. He first learned to place the balls into the holes, then to push the balls through. What was beautiful to watch, however, was the other ways he played with this toy. He pushed other little toys through the holes--some fit through while other didn't. He turned the bench upside down and placed the balls on the ramp, watching them roll off. He also turned the bench on its side and balanced the balls on the slit. We let him play with the mallet a couple of weeks later, always under our supervision. This toy is solidly-made with quality materials, withstanding all his banging and teething. I am very pleased with this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Balls fall through holes","review":"These type of toys are great. But this one is terrible.

You will find yourself thinking about the story and characters long after you've read the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love his work but he's over-reached himself this time.","review":"I place \\"The Golden Gate\\" and \\"A Suitable Boy\\" amongst my ten favourite novels but I was disappointed by \\"An Equal Music\\". Seth has over-reached himself. Being a music-lover (even such a passionate one as Seth) does not overcome the essential problem of conveying the effect of music in words. The reader simply becomes tired of all this gushing. Then there's the setting - Michael is supposed to be English but his London is a foreigner's London (he hangs around Hyde Park and Oxford Street) and he never uses even the most basic Londoner's slang. These aren't meant as factual quibbles: in a book which attempts to be realistic (as opposed to Rushdie's magic realism, for example) these things weaken an already boring character and fail to spark the reader's interest in him. NOW, a factual quibble: how the heck does a struggling musician pay the annual service charges of a portered flat (with lift) in Bayswater?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious for the non-musically inclined","review":"So much information on the music, distracted this musically uninformed reader from the slowly moving plot. However, the suspense built up, despite the rather nonsuspenseful story line. One good point, at least the ending was not predictable, nor was it too neatly wrapped up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julia's narrow escape","review":"I would agree with the other reviewer who says that the book was well written but not pleasant to read. The reason for this is that we are allowed to witness Michael lose his grip on reality as he is reunited with the only love of his life. He acted selfishly at that moment in life and lost her love. He again begins to act selfishly as he desires to resume his relationship with her even though that would involve hurting many, many other people in her life. Towards the end of the novel, I began to hope that Julia would be able to escape Michael. She doesn't know it but she narrowly avoided spending many wasted years on Michael rather than the wonderful, calm man that she did marry. It takes a very skilled and courageous novelist to allow us to see life from the perspective of someone so flawed and oblivious--for that reason as well as others, I really admire this particular novel by Vikram Seth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vik","review":"This book is very well writtin and my senses explode with each description of the music. I can imagine everything Mike sees and everything he feels i feel. Nothing can top this book on this level of writing. He fills every peice of this book with mystery and twists of surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but for other reasons.........","review":"V. Seth has an incredible way of detailing the every day lives of people - keeps readers very interested. His novel is unparaleled in its portrayal of the lives of european-classical musicians. Book starts off great, however begins to drag in the middle. To a certain degree, we can all relate to Michael's situation with Julia but, the novel's flaw is that after awhile his endless infatuation become too pathetic, a bit unrealistic, and boring. The underlying story somewhat reminds me of Hardy's \\"Jude.\\" Overall, I recommend Seth's novel first, for the special glimpse of classical musicians, their passion for music, and the wonderful imagery of classical music and second, for the overdrawn story of two former lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harlequin For Highbrows","review":"I was SO disappointed with this book. I was looking forward to reading it, especially as many reviews compared it to Rushdie's \\"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\\" (both stories centered around music and both authors from India I guess) but actually finishing this tedious book exhausted me. The interactions and struggles of the Maggiore Quartet, to which our narrator belongs, were mildly interesting but the rest of the book was weighed down with such hackneyed conventions that at times it became unintentionally funny. When Julia's big secret is revealed, when their tormented lives are discussed in toe-curling dialogue, you realize this is pure Barbara Cartland beach reading. If you want a shmaltzy romance then you will love it. If you want to read a good book that is based on the life of a struggling classical musician, read \\"Grace Notes\\" by Bernard MacLaverty."},{"rating":"1","title":"He can do better!","review":"I rushed to order this book and was disappointed ! It does not come close to his \\"magnum opus\\" \\"The Suitable Boy\\". But to give him credit it is hard to follow up on a book like that. The language and style were his alright but the book lacked the feeling, depth and spontaneity of The Suitable Boy.I think he would do much better with the the setting & feel in a novel set in India .That was the charm and beauty of his earlier work .

Travelling through London, Venice and Vienna through his eyes, i can hardly wait until i see these places for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRETENTIOUS & BORING","review":"I was SO disappointed in this book. The characters were whiney and unrealistic, scenes were sloppy, characters not developed or stereotypical. Plus the whole story was just ludicrous - Michael never sufficiently explains why he left Julia nor does he sufficiently make up for it - it's just all about his selfish wants...ugh, I couldn't wait to finish this book...almost didn't. The only thing I really liked was the opening poem by John Donne"},{"rating":"2","title":"Play on, write on, Vikram Seth!","review":"This is a lovely book: unpretentious and touching, it is a love story involving triangles, the foremost of which is between Michael, Julia, and music. It was Michael's relationship with music, in the form of Karl, his early mentor, that forced the pair of lovers apart over a decade before the story opens. Seth seems to be asking if the love of music by the artists can be equal to the love found in a relationship. Like the reader from Canada, I too found myself playing the pieces mentioned in the story (the Trout is a favorite of mine) and seeking the Fugues. Nevermind the hyper-critics: read this beautiful homage to music and be enriched by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader from Tokyo bang on the money","review":"I wish to echo the sentiments expressed by \\"A Reader from Tokyo\\". This is a near perfect book that not only works as a piece of literature but as something of an education. I personally am trying to track down a copy of Bach's \\"Art of the Fugue\\" as well as some of the other pieces referenced throughout the novel. In fact, my only quibble with the book is that I wish it had provided a music bibliography with more precise details than the characters sometimes provided. Anyway, a very worthwhile read and one that makes you appreciate classical music more than you might already. And the ending leaves room for a sequel: my suggestion is that Michael wakes up from a coma and it turns out he and Julia nbever went to Italy: I call it The Phantom Venice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and uninvolving","review":"How can you possibly write a novel that conveys the beauty and passion of music in mere words? Seth tries hard but fails. And because the characters are so slightly drawn, this novel is merely a classical music primer. After the brilliance of A Suitable Boy, it's disappointing to read this flat, distant novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic characters","review":"I loved A Suitable Boy because of its strong interesting characters.

The book is an exercise in futility (on both the writer's and reader's parts)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Misfire","review":"As a former professional violist, I purchased this book with enormous enthusiasm, expecting an accurate and sympathetic depiction of the chamber music subculture. Instead, it consisted of a long-winded and uninspired account of a relationship between the second violinist and his lost-long lady-love, a married sex godess/pianist with major hearing deficits, an apparent composite of Demi Moore and Beethoven. For those readers interested in this subculture, I advise against reading this silly and distorted novel. Rather, spend your money on tickets to live performances of serious classical musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Muzak.","review":"Having been recommended to read this by two acquaintances, one a music lecturer and the other a music PhD, it was a big disappointment. Basically, it's a potboiler dressed up with often badly misunderstood waffle about music and sold as serious literature. And it's also whiny, moody, depressing, cringeing, and lacks credibility. Jilly Cooper's music-based novels were almost more realistic - they were certainly 'livelier'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dreck!","review":"I really liked the author's other books, so I had hopes for this one. Unfortunately, I found it almost unbearably tedious. Michael seems never to have had a sappy emotion he didn't embrace and then go on and on and on about. There wasn't a single major sympathetic character in the entire book. With about 100 pages left, I kept hoping that Virginie was going to make an appearance and bring some energie and life to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very different book from Vikram Seth","review":"This book makes easy and relaxing reading. But, it is so different from his other books in the following aspects: > All his other books have a strong autobiographical touch to it so much so that I have to make effort to remember 'Michael' the main character is not Seth. > This book can be easily read without keeping a dictionary by the side unlike 'Golden Gate' and even 'Suitable Boy' to an extent. The book is very well written and the story flows, but don't expect to read Seth's typical distinctive style in the writing. I like the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful achievement","review":"The beauty of music is portayed with detail in this book and that is what I enjoyed most about it. I enjoyed the parts where the quartet rehearse and their concerts. Actually, I am dying to get hold of the Schubert \\"Trout\\" Quintet! (I am curious, how many of you have done the same?) This is a rich, poetic book in which the protagonist is music, and you can just about hear if flowing from its pages.My major criticism is that the story suddenly loses pace and interest when Michael and Julia get back from Venice.This is a different book which everyone will surely enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Equal Music that's a step above","review":"I first read this novel several years ago and should have posted my thoughts at that time. Maybe I have forgotten a few specifics but the overall enjoyment I found in this read is still there.I do seek out novels that deal with music and Vikram Seth's work has proved to be a high mark in that genre.I would recommend buying the accompanying CD--as well as the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven in tempo...I wouldn't take a repeat on this one.","review":"I really tried to enjoy this book. As a musician (both cello & piano) I thought I would relate, but pfffffftt-- just couldn't get into it. One good sentence, at the beginning, which seemed auspicious, \\"What I lost there (in Vienna) I have never come close to regaining,\\" promised so much more than the the book actually delivered.

What happened to his simple - yet profound -style of writing prose ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sensory appeal, wonderful prose, highest praises.","review":"A very different type of read for me. Loved the use of musical description in this book. Yes, his characters are a bit distant, but somehow realistic--Julia in her complexity, and Michael in his emotional selfishness. We all can't help but wonder \\"what if\\" from time to time about old loves; Seth does an excellent job of portraying the inability to relive parts of our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unequivocally Brilliant","review":"At one level, this is a book about the emotional and artistic travails of a failed musician. However, the protagonist's emotional turbulence comes across as a bit of a feeble and self-indulgent counterpoint to a latent but more powerful theme that the narrative explores - the agony of an accomplished musician who gradually loses her most treasured faculty - the sense of hearing.The book also successfully captures the author's self-proclaimed love for music. The numerous adulatory passages on sundry pieces of music might be tedious for some but strike a chord with anyone who is passionate about music. Seth's portraiture of the classical music scene in London is as evocative as Victor Hugo's homage to Parisian Architecture in the Hunchback of Notre Dame.One helluva Musical!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful use of music in an audiotape","review":"I'm halfway through listening to the unabridged audiotape, and I agree with whoever said Bates is perhaps not perfect for the part, although he's not bad -- but the music is wonderful and I would like to buy CDs of it. But which versions are best? Can a musician-reader tell us? This is the kind of audiotape to convince people audiotaped novels are a different animal altogether and judging from the comments of those who read the novel perhaps better than the print version of the novel. There is no way the novel could have captured what I am hearing on the audiotape. Maybe in our sophistication we're going back to more of an oral storytelling tradition?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece you will remember for years","review":"I liked this much more than A suitable boy. Seth finally shows fiction the prose he is capable of and his wonderful ability to create the world of artists, far away from political noise and other distractions of the modern world. Its a delight to read about the musicians, all of whom are brilliantly characterized and the lives they all come from to come and sit together to make music. This is a much better book than Ground Beneath Her Feet. Sure footed and lyrical in its gentle observations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"Very disappointing. I forced myself to finish this because I know Seth can do better and because I kept hoping something would happen. The characters are lifeless and tedious.

With the premise of the novel, I thought surely it would be placed on my list of great literary loves, hence I bought the hardcover. Not so. Not even close. In 30 years of reading, this is the first book I've not been able to complete. The writing is so tedious, it's almost painful to consume one page. Attempts to discipline myself & meander through to its entirety were unsuccessful. Suffered through 1/3 & decided to re-read Romeo & Juliet to ease my agony.

This is really interesting!\\" I'm sorry Hal had to go through the hell he apparently endured in the past few years, but this is an honest breakthrough album similar in feeling (if not in sound) to Bonnie Raitt's \\"Nick of Time\\" and John Hiatt's \\"Bring the Family.\\" I hope the Powers That Be in Nashville allow Hal to continue releasing great albums like this that push the boundaries of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding work from an outstanding singer/songwriter","review":"Awaiting Redemption is everything I love about Hal Ketchum. It's edgy, melancholy and poignant, with songs about real life and lost love. Ketchum truly speaks from the heart on each of these songs, with each track written and performed to perfection. While the entire disc is tremendous, Lonely Old Me and Days of Wonder are two songs that are Hal's best, evoking raw emotion in both the lyrics and music.Anyone who has seen Hal in concert knows that this album is a close to concert performance, and is without a doubt the best and most underrated work in country music today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King of Jazz","review":"Dave Brubeck is the master of his trade.

Although the tracks are a basic run through of Brubeck's hits and the album seems a little dated, it is indispensable for any lover of jazz. Naturally TAKE FIVE is a classic, as is BLUE RONDO, one of my favorites, but other less popular numbers like the beautiful IN MY OWN SWEET WAY (entirely performed by Brubeck on piano) and the vicious UNSQUARE DANCE who's rhythm, as the liner notes point out, refuses to be squared (just try clapping to it).

From the very next scene through the conclusion, it becomes a deliberate feminist polemic and deliberately unfunny. Feminism is nice, but filmmakers seem either afraid to have too much fun with it or unable to keep from aiming over the top. (See Nine to Five and The Incredible Shrinking Woman for two other examples.)

The rest of the story is also very good, you really see what's happened on the ground to everyday innocent people in the cities and out in the sticks. One part, where a father comes up and in front of the camera and \\"teaches\\" her small daughter that Isreal destroyed all her toys, cuts right to the core of what keeps the Middle East the violent and intractable place it's been for so long.

This volume contains Hiei's fight and the beginning of Kuwabara's. No farther.That being said, the first two episodes on this disc are an absolute MUST for Hiei fans. He is as arrogant, sexy, and just as cool as hell as always. However, and this is a big however, for whatever reason the animators decided to play a cruel sadistic joke on the viewers and play around with a different style for the characters during some parts of the episodes. That means that during my beloved Hiei's big fight he alternates between looking like his normal lovable demon self and some demented kewpie doll. It's horrid. I certainly hope that the animators don't make this style a habit in future episodes. Just thought I should warn others.

And Toguro finally going to 100% power, and seeing Yusuke power are both absolutely incredible. Also, the new ending theme is great and is actually my favorite song from the show.

That of course means that all of the sexual behavior reported in this book was illegal. This is presumably why Herdt disguised the identity of the tribe. He didn't want to set the men up for arrest. Several reviewers have justified this by saying that it is standard anthropological practice to protect the sources. But it seems to me that here we have a blatant double standard. The Catholic church has practiced extensive coverups with regard to priests having sex with boys. The officials at Penn State did the same thing with Sandusky. This has provoked universal outrage. How are anthropologists exempt from having to report such behavior? Who has exempted them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Expected","review":"The music is really good .

Frankly, I listened to a few of the cuts, reboxed it and sold it on Ebay the next day. Yuk. The quality isn't there. If I'm not mistaken, there are wrong notes played throughout, and Duane's soloing is embarrassing. Dangerous Dan tries but has done better-I suspect he was distracted (and has since left the band-I can understand why). The backup guys are fine but the usually capable Lombardi needs to nix the Elizabeth Reed wierd timing and get back to basics-it doesn't sound right and it's hard to follow. And Betts, like Eric Clapton who is revisiting Cream finally, needs a more challenging environment to be at his best. Is this the \\"End Of The Line\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drunk loser","review":"Dickey Betts used to be a good showman, and a huge part of the ABB sound. This effort, sadly, is a real let-down. He just sounds bad almost all the way through. The band is not well-rehearsed, and they all embarrass themselves here. The keyboard player is good, and towards the end of the show Dickey Betts sobers up enough to put together some quality licks, but if you're going to be a professional band, you really owe it to your audience to give them the best show you can.

I love the descriptions of what is on the other side, and the sense of life purpose that unfolds. This book, Searching for Home, does contain Laurelynn Martin's NDE description, but the rest is a diary of a journey to many healers - the modern medical model and the supernatural and everything in between. If I were searching for a book about faith healers, their successes and failures, this could be it. However, we don't even get a good description of these processes, just a written account of what she has tried. As far as the NDE category, this book just doesn't belong. The messages from her guides are also generalized new-age messages that can be found in any self-help book or even quotes on calendars we look to for inspiration.

Unfortunately, sometimes it corrupts files on my C: drive, and XP will read the device as being bad hardware, and goes into a death spiral of checking the C: drive, failing, rebooting, trying to check the C: drive.

Her Tiger Lady is one of the best caricatures of a shark-like corporate female ever, and her blossoming softness, courtesy of that adorable baby girl, is a joy to behold. The settings, from the hustle-bustle of a cheerfully skewed Manhattan office and environs, to the Christmas-card perfection (but don't be fooled!) of a Vermont farmhouse, pull you in, and add color to a predictable but funny plot.

He takes it in his mouth and goes to his rug and is in doggy ecstasy until he finishes it. As others have mentioned, these have no odor and don't make any mess on the carpet.

The reader is rapt by the circumstances 'Mr. Doe' meets at every turn, and Mr. Bakke has penned his words in a way that allows the reader to feel something of the feelings Mr. Doe must have experienced. The story told by the book is at once heartrending and hopeful; Mr. Doe is 'trapped' in 'the system,' but he is often shown mercy by compassionate people who even now deserve to be honored for their efforts.One question remained when I had finished the book: Why did no one---the police, a social worker, ANYBODY---allow Mr. Doe to take them back down the trail he had traveled? Let him be a passenger in a car, pointing his way back to his place of origin?Great book, though. I'd recommend it for almost anyone of any age. THANK YOU, MR.

My thoughts were that there has got to be SOMETHING redeeming in this story, so I labored to the end hoping to find a clue. As I thankfully closed the cover on that one, I asked myself, \\"How in the world did this ever get published??\\" Then I realized, Judy Blume is a well-known author of literature for adolescents and this is exactly the type of book a young girl would relate to, except for that power-thing which seemed to be thrown in for pure titilation.

I loved reading it and I couldn't put it down. A great start for Blume's first adult novel. I can't wait till she comes out with another one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No major intellectual feat here, just a really good read...","review":"Having grown up reading all of Blume's books, I was a bit skeptical at what she would be able to do with an adult novel. My skepticism proved unfounded. What we have here is a well-written, poignant story about best friends and the elaborate network of ties that bind them. Though this book certainly evokes a multitude of emotions as we follow the two women's very different approaches to life, \\"Summer Sisters\\" is not made of the same meaningful, straight-to-the-heart stuff that many of her young adult books are. But it is a great story and any woman who has had a best friend like Caitlyn - someone you love so fiercely that you can never hate them, regardless of how much they deserve it - will surely appreciate it as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was one step above pre-teen! Waste of my money","review":"This book was a fairy tale for one, and I never want to grow up for another...... The most real feeling in this book was when Nathan died, and his character which probably took 7 pages.

The characters were so realistic, and true to the heart. And never before have i been so captured by an ending. This book takes womanhood: discovering it, experiencing it, and holding it dear, puts it in a capsule for us all to admire. And even the stuff that some of us thought we were the only one's who ever had that piece... She lets us know that that isn't as true as we may have thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"When do we get to the meat of the story?","review":"This is the first story of Judy Blume's that I have read.

The Charlie's Angels, pink lipgloss, Shaun Cassidy and the Brady Bunch were such a big part of our lives. This book embelishes the love and friendship between two girls that lasts through their preadolesence into adulthood. It takes you back in time and reminds you how your first kiss felt and how you couldn't wait to share all your new experiences with your best friend. Judy Blume invites you to experience the 70's and 80's all over again through the words and feelings of two strong female characters.

They were engaging and not patronizing like some other novels written for those who were my age. However, Summer Sisters presents skeletal portraits of cliched characters. A garden with potential that has been overwatered. No fun. And Ms. Blume IS an excellent writer...so why such a shallow book this time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed","review":"I was glad that I borrowed this rather than buying it - what a total disappointment. I found the whole premise of Abby and Lamb not only bring Vix to the Vineyard every year - even without Caitlin strange, but to pay for private school tuition? Please! And Vix and Bru had pretty much NO relationship except during the summer - no phone calls, letters, etc? Vix running away to Trisha, Bru not talking about his mom - I don't know - I just found the whole thing pretty dumb! The writing itself also seemed very disjointed and juvenile, and SO cliche. A fast read, but I can't say I would recommend it to anyone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read but dissapointing","review":"I enjoyed the book and read it quickly but was left feeling dissapointed. It felt like a book for young readers. I never felt the love Vix felt for Caitlan -- just appreication for the opportunities her friendship gave her. I bought the fun they had as kids but lost it soon after. We never got to know Caitlan has anything but shallow and shelfish -- why would Vix love her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the love?","review":"I bought this one simply because I'm a Blume fan from way back; I can recall staying up way past my bedtime with a flashlight under the covers to find out if Margaret ever got her period, etc. What I've always loved most about her characters, male or female, was the fact that no matter who you were, you could identify with them and root for them in some way.Which is what I found so disappointing about this book. It's well-written and the characters are terrifically developed as always. . .but they're just completely unlikable! Yes, I had friends like Caitlin when I was growing up, but I grew up and for the most part, they never did. As for Vix, she just doesn't ring true to me; that's not a working-class kid talking, period. And I've never known anyone as mature and well adjusted as she sounds, who would pine for a high school crush like that, especially when he never really grows up either. Better luck next time, Judy."},{"rating":"1","title":"As much depth and relevance as an I-Can-Read Book!","review":"I gave this book to my mother for her birthday foolishly relying on the best seller list as a guarantee of a good read. While I experienced a fairly typical childhood, I failed to recognize Caitlin and Vix as realistic adolescents. After I read this childish (The Power?!!), melodramatic drivel, I shared my disappointment with my mom. She told me that she, too, thought the book was for teeny boppers. She hadn't shared her assessment with me before because she didn't want to hurt my feelings. I imagine this book will make its way through the seventh grade with the \\"appropriate\\" pages dog-eared and the \\"hot\\" sentences underlined just like Blume's novels Forever and Wifey did when I was 13 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a winner","review":"Generally, Judy Blume has a fine-tuned ear for the nuances of language and angst of young characters. I have been less impressed by her \\"grown-up\\" novels (i.e., Wifey). Here she succeeds with neither the teenaged characters nor the adults. I was very disappointed, as was my 15 year old daughter. We are both fans of Judy Blume, but not of this book. Summer Sisters lacks plot, character development or much interest. One of the characters describes herself as just selfish and spoiled--and indeed she is. Sorry, but that does not make for a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very shallow book with a tidy little ending","review":"Judy Blume should stick with the preteen set if this is as good as it gets. The story was pale and the ending was trite. With all of the great story tellers out there, how did this get on the best seller's list? I gave it a 2 star rating because it was easy to read...too easy. Shear drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was a big fan of Judy Blume while I was growing up, so I couldn't wait to read Summer Sisters. I found this book to be hard to follow without much plot. Although it is an easy read, I thought I would never get through it. I couldn't make myself get interested. If you really want to read it, save your money and wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable summer reading","review":"This is the story of Caitlin & Vix (Victoria), two young girls that met in Elementary school. Their friendship begins in 1977 when Caitlin invites Vix to spend the summer at her cottage by the ocean on Vineyard beach. Judy Blume takes us on their journey through teenage years right into adulthood. Friendships ; how often they can become bittersweet...to what length is Caitlin willing to go to find happiness ? Could she even betray her best friend ? Why can't she find contentment in her life? Why is it that even as adult we sometimes look for answers outside ourselves?It's all about choices and how they affect our lives and the choices these two girls make are very different yet through thick and thin their frienship remains.This book is about sisterly love and the real bound that exist when you have a true friend.This was a great summer read for my vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely well written","review":"Judy Blume has a way of expressing feelings most people want to keep to themselves. It's a very thought-provoking story...you can't help but compare your own feelings at that age to Vix's. Weren't we all insecure and hungry for attention then? Some areas are explicit, but no more so than many commercials and TV shows! Grow up people! This is almost the 21st century!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!!!!!","review":"I first read this book five summers ago.

This book is the book that all my future beach reads must live up to. Read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is really a Kids book","review":"This book was marketed as Judy Blume for adults but ir really isn't. I read all of Judy Blume's books when I was kid and enjoyed them, so when this came out in paperback I thought I'd try it.Sadly, this book reminded me of Are You There God it's me Margret, with more sex. If Judy Blume really wants to write an adult book she has to do more than just throw in some sex to make it adult. She needs to challange her readers, this book challanges teens not adults!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I actually read this book out of curiosity. Reading a book by Judy Blume had been a taboo growing up. I was never allowed to by my mother because she was supposedly too controversial. So, when I found an adult book by her, I was determined to rebelliously snatch it up. Aside from the sexual content, the book seemed pretty dull to me. I felt like I was reliving my teenage years through the characters: the best friend stealing my boyfriend, the boyfriend that I barely know other than physically, the pettiness of people, the misunderstandings and lack of communication between everybody, mothers that leave their children to be brought up by strangers. I just wasn't impressed. Yes, it's easy to read. But there's no suspense. The whole book is so surface-level. I supose it's realistic, but no award winner. The book seems to end just because it shouldn't possibly go on any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I'm not the intended audience for this book, but out of curiosity about the book I ordered it, and was pleasantly surprised! This is a fantastic book. Judy Blume keeps the characters seeming real, and you end up caring about them. I have to say that I ended up disliking Caitlin because of how she seemed to be - if there had been some parts of it from her perspective, maybe we would understand her better. Nonetheless, I definitely recommend this book. Vix is a great character, and you keep hoping her life will bring her to happiness. If you like Judy Blume ... buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Summer Read!","review":"A great book if you're looking for a book that you just can't put down. There are sex scenes that aren't appropriate for younger teens. A great book to read during the summer on the beach, on a plane or just curled up on the couch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever the same","review":"Just the same story at the beginning like some others. Just so simple. A \\"friendship\\". Why didn't she write about other things. You can read so much books and it's so often like the same story. It's not amazing that some people, which had read this book, are not so happy as some other times. I think that some readers will never read some books from Judy Blume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Blume's childrens books","review":"As an educator, I've always been a big fan of Blume's childrens literature. However, this adult novel fell short. I felt as thought I was reading a cheap romance complete with a predictable plot and shallow characters. I finshed the book but it was a chore. The characters were mildly interesting but I couldn't really relate to any of their trials and tribulations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read.","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's an easy read and a great escape. I gave it 5 stars, however, I would not read it twice. Once is enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"i first read this book when i first turned 16. i found it to be such a great book. my friend and i read it together every free second, we even gave up our lunch to read it. i became our *bible*. we compare ourselves to vix and cait and we r similar in many ways. we spent all last summer together, and she had basicly adopted me. now i am living with her and her family and we couldn't be any more similar to vix and cait. it is a great book and i highly recomend it to any best friends who wanna read a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read...","review":"This book is a goofy look at sex from I don't know whose perspective! No one could be as stupid as the characters in this book. Absolute trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"An \\"adult novel\\"????????","review":"Doesn't it say enough that many of these good reviews came from teenage girls? When I finished this book I felt as if someone had insulted my intelligence. Judy needs to stick to the young-adult genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"This book dissapointed me alot. I read many great reveiws of it, and the book was really dissapointing. It didn't have any depth to it, and I thought it should have been much more 'real.' All the sex was very dissapointing, I felt like that was what the book was about, instead of a story of friendship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could we get any more trivial and pathetic??","review":"I was so disappointed with this book due to its lack of depth and overabundance of trivial issues and teenage immaturity. One can't call it a childrens' book either (although that is how it reads) because of the explicit and annoyingly frequent sex-scenes. Then again, it is far from an adult piece because of its lack of maturity and significance. I think Blume is underestimating the intelligence of the average adult reader by thinking we would care about Vix and Caitlin and all of their raunchy and pathetic love adventures. If a picture of a loin-clothed Fabio was on the cover, it would give the reader more of an idea of what they were considering reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I could not wait to read this book because I absolutely loved and was captivated by July Blume's young adult novels when I was younger. But I'm sorry to have to say that I was nothing but greatly disappointed with this Judy Blume adult novel. For the first time, I was unable to relate to or comprehend any of the characters and was disappointed with such a poor storylines given to them.Blume fails to develop the characters with any real depth or personality, other than to develop them sexually. She also fails to develop personal storylines in this novel that are realistic or that keep your attention. It's hard to believe that the two main characters would be friends or remain friends.If you are looking for a book about real friendship, don't buy this book. If you are looking for a book about two females having sex with each other as teens, then with a bunch of guys, and eventually with each other's boyfriend, then buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Like the Book","review":"I did not like the book or the characters. The book had no plot. The characters had no compassion or morals. I did not care for Vix, but I despised Caitlin. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone who doesn't like this book has no soul","review":"I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews here. Have these reviewers never *been* children? Because Judy Blume does understand childhood, and she's not afraid to show it in its true colours. She writes from the heart, and that takes a lot of courage. This is a painfully realistic book that actually has *real* people in it, with real flaws and imperfections. It's disturbing at times, moving and tragic. It doesn't have a sentimentally happy ending, nor is it over-the-top sad. There are times in the novel when you think it can't get any worse for the characters, but it still manages to maintain a very positive feel. All in all, this is a beautiful story about friendship, growing up and the relationship between parents and children. Anyone who doesn't like it can't possibly have a heart or soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Young Adults","review":"Not at all what I expected from the reviews. This book is not for young adults and was offensive to me, an adult. Having been offended before the third chapter, this book went back to library unread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I cannot believe the reviews for this book. After reading almost half of the book, I just couldn't take it anymore. It wasn't boring, it was just pure trash (and that's just where it ended up). I certainly can't believe that there are \\"kid\\" reviews on this book. I would never let my teenager read this. Trashy sex does not make for a good book. I feel like my IQ has dropped tremendously. This woman writes like a teenager herself... so juvenile. What junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Sisters by Judy Blume","review":"It came in excellent condition. It took a little longer than I anticipated, but it is the holidays. It came in time for Christmas, that is all that mattered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I am an adolescent girl, and this book was really great. I loved how Judy Blume, whose books like Superfudge and Deenie I read when I was younger, has written a lovely story about the bond between two girls that happened over a summer and lasted for a lifetime. Throughout the betrayls and disappointments going on in the lives of the characters, this book stays interesting and doesn't disappoint. However, it wasn't absolutely fabulous (it seemed a bit long) but nonetheless a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book due in 2 weeks & Judy forgot she promised to write it.","review":"Sorry, Judy, stick with what you know. A six hour read with at least that many unnecessary characters. Most notably, Dinah Renko. (Sucks and chews her hair???) Next in line would be D'Nisha. Even Trisha was a stretch. All I could think of when Lamb was in the picture was \\"Mick Fleetwood\\". When I finished the book I kept turning pages thinking there was more. Vix didn't need closure for her break-up with Bru; I need it for reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I was on a vacation and looking for a good read when I picked up this book. I loved Judy Blume's charming books as a kid, (Fudge, Are you There God, etc.) and thought her writing style in Summer Sisters would be a grown-up equivalent. I was pretty darn disappointed. The book sort of reminds you of wanna-be, second-rate Danielle Steele. Judy Blume's trying hard to be racy, but the characters are totally two-dimensional and seem like ridiculous caricatures. The book is totally predictable: Vix, the solid, dependable friend meets Caitlin, the man-crazy bad girl. Ever read Sweet Valley High? That's the level of writing we're talking about here. The plot just kind of rambles, and the ending just seems lame. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever read 'Mademoiselle\\" magazine?","review":"Trite and bland, but it tries so hard to be hip. You can't help but despise all the characters. Vix is a doormat, Caitlin is selfish and vicious, her dad smoked too much pot and his brain is mush, Tawny is an iceberg, her husband is a pushover (wonder where Vix learned her ways)... I mean, what a collection of inadequate people. The author does not make anyone endearing. Just a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining summer fluff","review":"I'd actually give it 2 1/2 stars, but Amazon doesn't have an option for half stars, so two it is.It took me about 5 hours to read this book, it is definitely not challenging, but the main characters are engaging. I think one of the greatest appeals of this novel, for me, was the fact that it took place in the years of my own childhood, with characters that were just a few months older than I.If you are looking for an entertaining but simple read for your vacation, this is the book to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close, but not completely there...","review":"This book no doubt mesmerized me until I finished it (a day & a half later). It brought back a rush of feelings from my youth, the ones that make me appreciate being an adult... Although I did think this was a GREAT book, I just felt like the reason there were so many synapses on what the charachters were thinking was because Blume didn't really delve into who Vix & especially Caitlin really were. Definitely a light, fun summer read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read!","review":"I had seen this book around when it first came out, and I was a bit hesitant about buying it. I wasn't sure if it would hold my interest for 400 pages, but I was wrong. I recently borrowed the book from a friend, and read it within a week, which is very fast for me. It was really intriguing, with lots of juicy details. It was hard for me to put this book down. I really enjoyed it. I recommend it, it's a fast, and a very enjoyable book! When is Judy Blume's next adult novel coming out? Is there one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Judy Blume isn't just a kid's book author","review":"I was given this book by a friend who said she really loved it. I am the kind of person who won't read a book unless it's good from the very beginning, and Summer Sisters really caught my attention. It's one of those books that you just can't put down. I recommend it to any woman who likes to read \\"just plain good stories\\".And by the way- a more personal note: I still have your book, Dallas, and I miss you a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Judy Blume","review":"My generation grew up with the works of Judy Blume. We came of age with Are You There God, It's Me Margaret, Forever, and Blubber. It's nice to know that you can outgrow those books but not outgrow the author. I feel like many of my friendships have taken the same twists and turns of the frienship in this book. It's amazing how alike we can be when we are young and carefree, but that time and destiny send us each on our own path the older we get. Judy Blume does a great job of describing this and making it into an entertaining book. Even though I have outgrown some of her books, I am glad I haven't outgrown her as an author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick, predictable read","review":"If you'd like to read a story where you simply watch two not-so-exciting lives click by, this is the book for you! As for me I'm going to go reread \\"Are You There God...\\" and see who has changed more in the last 20 years- me or Judy Blume!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more from this author","review":"This was one of those books I kept reading thinking it had to get better, but it failed to do so. I could find little in the two main characters to relate or to care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quick read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Yes, it was a quick read, yes the characters were a little shallow and no, it didn't have any real \\"literary value\\". However, it was entertaining, and isn't that why we all read??"},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow fun- a quick fix","review":"I can't believe how many people have used the word \\"depth\\" in their reviews. You can't get much farther from depth than this book. The juicy scenes, for those who like them, are what makes this book at least somewhat readable and fun. Other than that, it is unrealistic and the story line seems to have sprung straight from \\"Days of our Lives\\", or worse. And please- it just reconfirms the \\"weak, overly obsessed with personal matters\\" type of female stereotype, that most of us have tried to escape from. If any man should be dumb enough to read this book- please remember, some of us are sane."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible and not worth your money","review":"I think this was the worst excuse for literature that I have read. The charecters are discusting and the book is filled with not a story but diffrent episodes of sexual occrences. There was no plot or story to trace if you're still interested check it out from a librarey and don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very cheap novel","review":"When I first had \\"Summer Sisters\\" in my hands, I couldn't wait to start reading it. But when I started reading it, little by little, I began to feel as if I was reading one of those cheap novels with Fabio hadlf naked on the cover. Summer Sisters has a lot of sex, lots, and lots of it, and the worst of all, is that it disgusts you. The two main characters, when they are 12, rub their private parts against each other to feel \\"the power\\", as it says in the book. - I wanted to vomit! It is a very cheap novel. Don't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer Sisters","review":"Was very disappointed with this book. First of all, it had MANY curse words including the F word which I HATE. It also had a continuous thread of sexual content. I was very surprised that Judy Blume would write a story like this. It was a very depressing story. Wish I had not spent my money on this book. Thumbs down!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good to put down!","review":"If you are looking for a book to read over a long period of time dont pick this book up. As soon as you begin the book you are rapped up in the story. It was the best book I have ever read! Judy Blume does an excellent job in giving clear and vivid details of each character. This is the type of book i will read again. I have recommended the book to friends and they all feel in love with it like I did. Don't wait, read it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay but needs to brush up ending","review":"summer sisters is a good book but the ending is rushed and it doesn't make sense to me. also, Judy blume doesn't tell what is happening in Caitlens point of view so the book is not complete. plus everyone knew that caitlen would disappear in the end. the only exciting bits was when they were kids. when they grow up, it get complicated with all the monologues and all. I would not suggest this to another person it is not all that good and does not deserve all the praise it got. Judy Blume should work on kid books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick, mindless read that is not particularly entertaining","review":"I am glad I borrowed this book and did not buy it. It is a mindless meander through a quagmire of repetative drivel. Take out the ultimate solution arrive at by Caitlin, and this book could easily have been a Harlequin Romance. Really- one minute they are living in semi-poverty amid filth during their summer visits, and the next they are wealthy people in sophisticated surroundings. The characters are poorly developed, the plot does not exist and the editors must have no long term memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for Young Adults.","review":"Someone somewhere has decided that because \\"Summer Sisters\\" follows the life of two women from the time they are twelve until they are thirty that this book crosses over into the Young Adult category. They couldn't be more wrong! The book contains vulgar language, graphic sex, and generally is not for the pre-college crowd. The story itself has been told too many times before by Danielle Steel, Judith Krantz, Sydney Sheldon, et al. If you fell compelled to read the top ten bestsellers, then go ahead and read the book. Otherwise, give it a 'Pass.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blume should stick with her stories of adolescent angst.","review":"I enjoyed \\"Wifey\\", her first adult novel, quite a bit more. I have read every single one of her young adult novels and loved them all; I'm encouraging my children to read them as well. I was disappointed in \\"Summer Sisters\\", I found it to be more similar to paperback romance novels than to the quality I'm used to from this author. A good beach read, but once read, soon forgotten. I found Caitlin annoying and Vix one-dimensional. Ellen Feldman, Elizabeth Berg, Beth Gutcheon do this genre so much better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summer, laying on the beach, can't put it down, book!","review":"I feel like I have grown up with Judy Blume. Read all of her books in junior high school, and now with this one, she has caught up with my present life. Caitlin and Vix and are great characters. Victoria is extremely well developed as a character. I couldn't put it down. I read it in 3 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was pointless.","review":"I could find nothing of particular interest in the characters or plot of this novel. Page after page of childish, empty actions by childish, empty people. Sex seemed to be the only motivation for any of the characters. The main character might have had some depth, but it was never developed to any extent. I don't even want to lend this book to anyone - why should they bother to read it? I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better parts than whole","review":"I found the story of Caitlin and Vix's friendship mesmerizing. Unlike some other readers, I admire Blume's bravery in writing about their discovery of the Power and their early sexual experimentation with each other, because it's not uncommon in real life. Blume's writing style is always fresh and reads quickly, almost like liquid.I also enjoyed the way she structured the book, giving other characters a voice and helping the reader to gain important perspectives that Vix wouldn't have been able to articulate (though the one perspective she excludes is Caitlin's). On the other hand, I don't think that her attempt at grouping eras with the names of different songs to be very successful. The only song that carries any real sentimental resonance throughout the book is \\"Dancing Queen.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not think it was a good book","review":"I would not read this book again. If you want to have your girls get into living with her friends and not worry about them, this book is for them. I would never let any of my girls read this book. I thought it was an awful story and I really felt bad someone took the time to write it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book!","review":"This was a terrible book. I wish I had the option of 0 stars. Usually I pass along books that I read to friends or family members. I had to throw this one in the garbage because I was too embarrassed to admit that I read it. There are so many great books out there and I'm kind of angry that I wasted my time reading this shallow account of \\"friendship.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"I read this book because I was told it was so wonderful by several people. Reading about the sexual escapades of two teenagers is not my idea of a good read. There were probably 25 pages in the entire book that didn't mention sex, their breasts, or a man's \\"package.\\" I would never recommend this book to anyone. I can't believe that I even bothered to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop! Don't read this book","review":"This book is trash. I can't believe it's still on bestseller lists and that I see people buying it all the time. It is neither well-written nor of good content. People should spend their time reading works of literature, not a novel of the third-grade level. I understand that sometimes readers want a book for entertainment only, but many others of better quality could just as easily fit the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled! This book is not for teenagers!","review":"I'm sorry, call me a prude, but the situations these girls get themselves into are inappropriate for teenagers. Can't we just let teens have a chance to grow up on their own without exposing them to the horrors of the adult world through their literature, too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeaming value","review":"This is the first book that I ever threw in the trash! There's no redeaming value to the story. I wouldn't want anyone (especially young impressional readers) to submit themselves to this mindless garbage. VERY disappointed!

Judy Blume never disappoints!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass it by!","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be a great story about Cape Cod (a favorite vacation spot of my family's) and found that it was merely trash. This book was a total disappointment. It was a book about teenage love and sex and, in my opinion, a total waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"trash for who? and not well written trash either!","review":"Who is this poor writing, character development, plot, written for?! After reading SUMMER SISTERS I (was dumb enough to) read SMART WOMEN and the same questions apply. These are not soap opera, not even good trash reading. They are a waste of natural resources and time.I will go back and read her children's books becasue I wonder what is wrong with HER or US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Judy Blume was one of my favorite authors growing up. I've read all her books, \\"Are You There God\\", \\"Forever\\", etc. so I high hopes for this one. I struggled through the first 100 hundred pages, finding the story incredibly boring, and almost gave up finishing it. I wish I did. The end was rushed, the characters were so-so and the constant point of views were extremely annoying! (Jodi Picoult can get away with something like that, not Blume) The only good thing was that I wasted an afternoon curled up with my dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless","review":"I loved Judy Blume books as a child--obviously I've grown up.

More than 5 stars!!","review":"Summer sisters was given to me by a friend. I was going on a road trip to Kentucky and needed something to do. I read it in 5 hours with few breaks. It was incredible! I couldn't put it down. We went out to dinner and I took it with me. I strained my eyes in the dark just to read the last few pages. Vix and Kateline became part of me and this book will stay with me forever! I highly recommend reading this and suggesting it to friends. It was the best book I have EVER read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was very emotional","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I laughed, I cried It was very good. It was very life like!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Sisters","review":"Judy Blume just has this knack for getting it right. She understands what it's like to be an awkward kid growing up and an over-hormoned kid growing up and she takes these two characters from puberty into teenagers into young adolescence to adulthood with the trials and tribulations that go with it. I think any female can relate to some aspect of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Beach read .....","review":"If you've ever read Blume growing up this is the book for you. It's an easy and engrossing read. You'll find yourself caught up in this book and it's characters.As Blume has always done you will find a part of you somewhere in this book. Whether it be a spoiled child, lost college student, the bond of a strong friendship or miss guided adult somewhere you will find a hint of you.I couldn't put this book down (at the time I had an infant, was working fulltime and had a house to tend to and very little sleep I found the time and read it w/in 3 days)Grab this for the beach and relax. You'll enjoy it if you'd ever read Blume before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could I give it ZERO stars??","review":"This is not Judy Blume quality. I was disappointed and expected more. Too sexual for teens, too immature for adults. I guess she was aiming at the soap opera audience. Aim higher, Judy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It(s) [no good].","review":"There is nothing interesting about this book. The story rambled on endlessly and ultimately went absolutely nowhere; the characters were boring, unlikeable and undeveloped (each character is virtually the exact same person at the beginning of the novel as at the end, even though over 20 years had elapsed - nobody learns from their past, no one evens tries). Plot? Don't bother looking - it's not there. Even the sex scenes, which were plentiful, were tepid. I only completed this idiotic book because I was on a plane and couldn't chuck it out the window. It consumed 3 hours of my life that I'll never get back. Don't let it happen to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"I recently picked up my copy of Summer Sisters and thought, I really should give this another go. So I read it again, hoping that my first opinion would change and I would have all the positive feelings that the other readers have had here. I tried really hard, I loved Judy Blume when I was young and have always admired her sense of humour and her ability to create \\"real characters.\\" Summer Sisters starts off really well with the girls meeting and forming a solid friendship but sadly begins to become silly, especially in the last third of the book when the betrayals of Vix and Caitlin become evident. If you need a book to fill in the hours on a long flight or just something that doesn't take much concentration then this is a good book I guess. For once it would be nice to see Blume write a novel for adults that doesn't revolve around sex, other authors manage it and if they do include it, they use more taste than she does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute banal tripe","review":"I cannot understand how anyone would rate this book with more than two stars. It's very immature and only for people who like to read trash romance. I expected more from Ms. Blume, as I was a big fan of her books as a child. This book is easily forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk","review":"I did finish it but barely. I've read some Judy Blume and liked her, but not this silly, trite, superficial nonsense. The two main characters travel all over the world, go to fabulous colleges and yet end up with the boys they met in junior high, just to further this silly plot. The characters are completely one dimensional, the very short (one page or less) \\"chapters\\" written from different points of view add nothing. THe characters' names even bothered me - Lamb, Vix, Bru, Von. Puhleeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"At first I wasn't sure I would enjoy this book, but after reading the first few pages I was hooked. Watching everyone in Vix's life grow up and seeing who these characters become had me fully engrossed in this truly fantastic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total trash and not that great","review":"I was hoping for something where the characters had even a shred of the depth and realism that they do in her books for teenagers.

This could have been a Cosmo mini-series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it and passed it along to all of my friends to read.","review":"This was a book that i flew through! i read it from cover to cover in two days- and was so sad when it was over! i liked both WIFEY and SMART WOMEN but this book was the best so far from the adult books by Judy - i just wanted to say that i highly recommend this book and cant wait till her next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Quick \\"Just O.K.\\" Read","review":"I have enjoyed Judy Blume's books since I was a kid. While I liked the style of the story-telling in Summer Sisters, I was left wanting more. More depth, more detail, more character development. I felt like a kid again reading this book, for the wrong reasons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable!!!!","review":"This is my first time ever reading a Judy Blume book. It took me less than 24 hours to finish. It was captivating and very real, I can definetly identify with many of the issues. In fact, I will be sending a copy of the book to my best girlfriend in Jamaica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, enlightening, heartwarming and charming","review":"I have read Judy Blume as a child and still enjoy her just as much now as I did then. This book makes you laugh and cry. Everyone needs a friend like Caitlin and everyone wants a friend like Victoria. Wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the kind of book you will want to read again!","review":"I enjoyed this book from the very beginning. For anyone who has ever had a \\"Summer Sister\\", this is the book to read. The characters were wonderful and you could identify with either Caitlan or Vix. I identified with Vix. If you read only one book this summer, this is the one to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page-turner","review":"Like many others I couldn't put this book down! I read many of her books as a preteen, including \\"Are You There...\\" so I am very familiar with Judy Blume's writing style. Summer Sisters lived up to my expectations. If you like the movie \\"Beaches\\" you will probably like Summer Sisters as well. It made me remember my own childhood best friend and makes me want to call her. I do agree with the others though that some of the minor characters weren't very well developed but I liked how, throughout the book we got to listen to the thoughts of each character. While this book is not perfect it is enjoyable, entertaining reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy, mindless rubbish","review":"Since I had to choose between one and five stars I gave it a one star. It doesn't even deserve that! I would not advise anyone to waste their time reading this book. Many of the characters never evolved in my mind. Even the main characters were not believable. There has got to more than just self gratifacation in most people's lives. I could never imagine why the two main characters even liked each other. I still can't believe I actually finished it. I thought there may be some fantastic story line. In the end it was all just nothing. Certainly no value as a book for anyone in my opinion. Very disappointing reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your time is very valuable.....don't waste it with this","review":"I'm 22 years old---maybe not even an adult yet--, and the situations in this book are even annoying to ME! You know what is cool?--if you have to name a baby soon, pick a name out of this book---very hip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad read on a 5-hr plane ride","review":"I would not call this book the most intellectually stimulating, but if you're sitting on a plane for 5 hours, it will keep you preoccupied and you'll probably finish it. The characters are a little shallow, but the story moves quickly enough. I finished it on the plane!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Judy disappointed me...","review":"I am a HUGE Judy Blume fan. I have read 11 of her books (children and teen) and was excited when I saw that she ventured over to the adult realm. Maybe my expectations were too high since I loved the others, but this book, even though for \\"adults\\", was very evidently written by a childrens' author. I read it all the way through because I'll never give up on a book, but it was torturous. I wasn't captivated at all, the characters were boring, the little blurbs about individual characters were annoying and poorly written, and the romance scenes left more to be desired. I also felt that the end was rushed. Too much time was spent on their childhood, and when the juicy adult-life was finally reached, it all happened so fast without detail. I'm willing to give her other two adult books a try, but after this, I am hesitant to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"so great i read it every summer","review":"I am a senior in high school and have read this book every summer since 7th grade. From other people, i hear that there is a lot of sexuality in this book, but i honestly do not think it includes anything a middle schooler should not hear. This book tells a great story of unconditional love and friendship. It does a great job of showing that best friends are more like family than perfect people.I would recomend this book to anyone who likes a tear-jerker that will make you laugh and remember your own childhood girlfriend"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fit for adults","review":"I'm sorry to say I bought this book based on the fact that it was on the best seller list and was suggestedto me through Amazon.com. I believe it's time to update my profile because there must be a rating that suggests I may have enjoyed this book. I'd be curious to find out what the average age of the readers of this book are. It was very immature. Not well written at all. As a matter of fact I didn't even finish the novel. I had maybe 50 pages to go and didn't give a rip how it ended. I donated it to the local thrift shop as I would have been too embarrassed to pass it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"My God what a story....","review":"Judy Blume has always been able to tap into that inner teenager we all still remember. Summer Sisters totally reminded me of myself and a relationship I had with a \\"2nd\\" family. This book touched me in so many ways I cried at the end because I knew my time with these characters were over. Unfortunately I was on the subway! Hey this is NYC no one is considered crazy here! Love the book it is worth it's weight in gold!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As a 13 year old, I loved every page of this \\"adult book\\".","review":"I couldn't put this book down because of the intriguing plot twists and the great character development. I've read many of Judy Blume's young adult books, but this one was much more entertaining and rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"I usually cannot \\"get into\\" fiction anymore...","review":"... opting for non fiction now as an adult, but the characters in this novel were compelling. Judy Blume has a knack for getting readers involved in the characters she creates. When I still had 100 pages left I couldn't help reading the last chapter to find out what would happen to them. That knowledge didn't make the last chapter the second time around any less emotional. I found it interesting that the choice Vix made at age 12, to spend the summer with Caitlin on Martha's Vineyard, changed her future completely. Also that the fate of a character I didn't care for left me profoundly touched, says something about the quality of the plot and characters. I am only ranking this story with four stars because I don't think I will read it again the way I repeatedly reread Judy Blume's children books when I was a child. I cannot put my finger on why I won't read it again though.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as others I have read by this author","review":"I was dissappointed in this novel. Sure the story development was fine and I like the way Ms. Blume showed each characters' thoughts, but it seemed to me that it wasn't much of a story. Who hasn't had a friend from the time they were young and gone through even more than the two main characters did? I had a best friend from third grade that slept with my boyfriend and she didn't run away for years and then come up missing.The only reason I finished this book is that it was the only thing I had to read on the plane."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read !!!!!","review":"I'm not much for \\"girlie books\\" but this is a book that suprised me. The certain twist to the book will keep you locked. It will take you only two days if not hours to read this book. Its a book you should treat yourself too. Judy Blume writes beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"I felt like a teenager again!","review":"Summer Sisters took me back to a time I had almost forgotten. I'm 33 years old and, like Vix, was just coming of age in the seventies. I couldn't put the book down and, like many of the other reader's who have posted reviews, finished it in less than two days. I look forward to reading Blume's next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of people think this is good?","review":"Now, come on. Surely American readers really don't think this novel is worth as many stars as I have seen posted. I thought the plot absolute drivel, the characters unbelievably sex obsessed (despite what Judy Blume thinks, not every teenager is obsessed with sex), the friendship phony, and the adults tiresome. I did not even want my 19 year old to read it. I threw the book away when finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!","review":"I was delighted to see a Judy Blume book on the shelves again, I grew up with Are you There God...? and Forever and loved Wifey and Smart Women. I loved this book, I read it in one sitting--just couldn't put it down. The characters, especially Caitlin, are so real (I have a \\"Caitlin\\" of my own and could relate with Vix!) and I couldn't rest until I knew how it would end. I found the end fulfilling and was not disappointed, maybe a little surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Sisters is a divine summer read!","review":"As I followed Vix and Caitlin's lives I felt as if I was reliving my young teen years, college years and ultimately adult years. The characters speak as though they are 12 when they are 12 and conversely when they are 30. I have already recommended this book to about 5 people. (They need to buy their own as it will be a double read for me.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"NBO","review":"Starring Sally J. Freedman as herself was my all time favorite. I read it several times as a child. Summer Sisters is the second best. I am an adult now, and this book couldn't have been any better. Judy, you are superb. Please give us more. PLEASE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put in Down","review":"I just couldn't put this book down. I loved her books as a child and I love this one even more now. I read it all in almost one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Judy's books, and this was one of my favorite.","review":"This book really moved me. It was about friends helping each other and making it through good times, better times, bad times, and the worst of times. Being from the country, I could relate to a lot that happened in Summer Sisters. I hope there is a sequal! I was glued to it, and didn't put it down. Anyone who doesn't find Judy Blume's work mesmerizing is out of thier mind. It took me all of two days to read the entire thing... bravo, Judy, bravo."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I Hadn't Bought the Audio, I Would Have Never Finished It","review":"The title of the book was the best part of the whole book. The sad thing is, the book had real portential. It's too bad that the writer went from interesting to smut real quick. I wouldn't recommend this book to any of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is GREAT!","review":"I thought this book was so good that I read the entire thing on a Saturday afternoon. Judy Bloom knows how to make her readers feel like they can connect with her characters so well. Anyone who has read ARE YOU THERE GOD; IT'S ME, MARGRET, will love SUMMER SISTERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judy Blume can always make you see yourself in her books.","review":"I haven't read a Blume book in years... boy does she still have it. This one was just as great as all her others. I finished it in two days and was awe-struck. Judy has a gift in her writing that makes you feel for her characters. Vix and Caitlan made me remember how special your first true friendship was. The exploration...the fun and mostly, the innocence. I now have a longing to go to the beach for the summer...or at least for the day. I look forward to her next book and have ordered some of her oldies to re-read from the bookstore. If this is your first time reading Blume's work, make sure you check into her previous books. Judy if your reading these... Thanks for making me feel normal and human."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of precious time!!","review":"I was totally disappointed with this book. My only hope was that the next page might be better, but it never came to pass. The reading level of Summer Sisters seems geared to young teens but yet the subject matter is trying to reach an older group. I am really surprised that so many people seemed to enjoy this mundane offering from Judy Blume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Unbelievably Bad","review":"I read Judy Blume's books as a girl and was looking forward to reading this book, a gift from my mother-in-law. I found the characters poorly developed and unsympathetic. There was nothing interesting, redeeming or romantic about this book filled with cliches and too much sex. I grew bored halfway through, skipped to the ending, skimmed what was in between, and put the book down in disgust. If you're an adult, don't bother. If you're a teenager, stick to Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret. I just could not believe that any serious reader would find this book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow reading, easy to tread.","review":"Buy this book for a quick easy read. This book does not deal with any issues at depth. I would recommend this book to lazy readers who don't like or want to think, and adolescent girls. It's a book I would have thoroughly enjoyed at the age of 12 or 13. It is the typical \\"teen trash\\" novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a trashy romance novel","review":"I loved Judy Blume books as a teenager and this book read like a teenage romance novel. I can't say it was a horrible book, but definitely not too interesting. It seems like the main characters' friendship was not too realistic and the events that occur were pretty dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick-read about friendship and family","review":"\\"Summer Sisters\\" is a fast-moving, simply written novel that won't take a summer to read. Unlike other novels, I didn't have to wait to be pulled into the plot-- in fact, the three-page first chapter was convincing enough. Although the characters are somewhat typical, bordering on shallow, I was always intrigued. A good novel for a college student taking a break from textbooks and John Locke. At the conclusion, I felt that there is still more to be told-- if Ms. Blume writes a sequel in the future, I'd love to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Reading At Its Finest","review":"Escape to the beach and meet Caitlin and Victoria; Martha's Vineyard Summer Sisters. This complicated and tumultuous friendship gives way to event filled summers that will have readers glued to their seats. The friendship that these two young ladies share will put you in a mindset of those summers you spent with your special friend. You'll search your mind to remember your \\"summer sister,\\" and feelings that you haven't felt in a long time begin to resurface. As usual Ms Blume entertains with a fast paced story that will have you laughing, crying and wondering why the story had to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"It leaves you wanting more","review":"this is my favorite book, the best book i've read to date, i highly recommend it, you really get attached to the characters! i want a sequal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book! - If your brain needs a vacation!","review":"I grew up reading books by Judy Blume so I just felt compelled to read this book! Summer Sisters is the kind of book when you are too stressed and you need some time out. All you have to do is read, you don't even need to think... A very easy read, sometimes slow, but worth reading atleast once- if you're a Judy Blume fan as I used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judy Blume should stick to writing children's books","review":"I've enjoyed some of JB's books for children and teenagers, but really she should stick to that market. I found 'Summer Sisters' fairly entertaining at the beginning but quickly began to loose interest as the book progressed from the characters' childhood to young adulthood and the characters failed to develop with it. The male characters in particular are shallow and exist only to provide a love interest for Vix/Caitlin.One of the strengths of JB's writing for children is the simplicity of her style but sadly translated to an adult novel this simply doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not boring, but too unrealistic and over the top","review":"I bought this book hoping for a light escape from the difficult reading for my English class. I succeeded. This book is interesting and keeps you reading, but it really does not have much substance. The two girls' friendship is very unrealistic, and their lives just seem too perfect. I mean come on, Caitlin doesn't study at all in school and she gets into Wellesley anyways? Vix gets into Harvard writing an essay on how great a friend Caitlin is? Vix lets Caitlin use and abuse her and comes back for more every summer? It's annoying reading about how two such imperfect people can have such perfect lives without hardly working at it. But all in all I would recommend this book if you want something to pass the time with. Don't expect anything great, though - it's definitely not in here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I was greatly anticipating reading this novel as I read all of Judy Blume's novels as a teenager, but I found the characters in this novel to be too one-dimensional. I found it difficult to become attached to the characters for this reason. Caitlin's character just became annoying, and I found it difficult to feel any sympathy for her. I also found the writing style to be very flittery and found myself skipping through the story unable to get attached to any of the characters. The storyline was also too soap-opera like and simplistic to feel any kind of depth in this book. You expect to come away from reading this book with a reminder of your close friendships as a teenager, but the storyline and characters were so shallow, I walked away empty. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"File this with \\"Bridges of Madision County\\"","review":"I chose this book for our bookclub based on my fond memories of Judy Blume and found it incredibly disappointing. The writing was irritatingly simplistic, the friendship made no sense to me and I could not believe the sudden marriage. WHAT?The one thing I did enjoy was remembering the thrill of my own \\"backseat of the car\\" escapades.More disillusioning to me than the book itself is that so many of my female peers rave about it. I put it in the same category of Bridges of Madison County which was also horribly written, stupid and much loved by otherwise sharp women."},{"rating":"1","title":"A preteen read with graphic sex","review":"So like everyone else I was hooked on Judy as a kid, now as a 33 year old woman I expected much more. Judy should give adults more depth to delve into. Sex isn't what seperates an adult novel from that of a prepubesant reader. Sorry Judy, but you found your place in the preteen market, that's where you should stay."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment.","review":"Like many others here, I remembered reading Blume as a child and teen, and loving her work. I picked up 'Summer Sisters' hoping to experience some sense of nostalgia yet at the same time read something new. The book was fair for about the first half, but somewhere down the line I stopped caring about the characters and what happened to them. It contains none of the great characterization or engrossing story and situations of her other novels.I'd also like to add that though there are adult situations in the book, it is a YA novel through and through. Adults may be put off by the style (I wouldn't have minded if the story had been good.) Teenage girls may enjoy it, but I'm sure they can find something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Adults!","review":"As a teenager I read all of Judy Blume's books and absolutely loved them! Thus, I was looking forward to reading Summer Sisters. The book may be a worthwhile read for young adults and teenagers but the notion that it is an adult book is a joke. The characters are all very superficial and the story is banal. In essence, it was a disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While I wasn't entirely unhappy with Summer Sisters, I was disappointed... All characters were not developed well at all. Moreover, the short vignettes of each character's thoughts were distracting to me and made me feel even more distanced from the characters. I guess I was expecting more from Blume's adult novels than I got with the adolescent ones (the last Blume novel I read was \\"Are You There God?\\" which was my absolute favorite book growing up. I read it 5 times). Summer Sisters felt to me like an adolescent novel with more explicit sexual scenes. It's a naughty teenager's dream, like Clan of the Cave Bear without having to skim to find all the racy parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I've read in a long, long time.","review":"Wow! No one in my book group enjoyed this book, despite being fans of Judy's work twenty years ago. What gives? We'd like to know. There are so many better novels out there. This one reads like a very bad sex chat between two dense chicks. And I do mean dense. We didn't like the characters at all, and why else do you read? Worst novel of the year, we say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach Blanket Book-o","review":"The cover, two wooden beach chairs in the sand, tells it like it is: a book about two girl friends who spent summers together. It's a corny tale about friendship between girls vs. love between a boy and a girl. If you expect (as I did) more of the biting wit found in the author's 1978 novel Wifey, you'll soon learn that Summer Sisters is not nearly as clever or as good. But it is a book you might take to the beach, to read in your chair in the sand."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bit shallow ...","review":"I bought this book because I was in the mood for an \\"easy read\\", something that didn't require much effort. This book was just that. But it fell short of my expectations in some ways. It seemed kind of shallow. I think younger readers might really enjoy this book -- it reads much like her books I read as a teenager!If you're looking for an easy read, try it out. Just don't expect too much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended!","review":"I picked this book up in the first place because I used to be a real fan of Judy Blume's when I was young. It did not disappoint me in the least. I really liked it and I hope it becomes a movie one day. My friend thought it was great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Sisters","review":"Summer Sisters is a coming of age story appropriate for more mature young adult readers. The dialogue is realistic and easy to read. The characters are rich and well developed and easy to relate to. The story is about the teenage friendship between two girls, one rich and one poor that spans from sixth grade to marriage and family . It not only addressed the good times of friendship but also the heartbreak that goes along with it. It was a book, I didn't want to put down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great read!","review":"The book is about friendship. Friendship between women. It is not the tainted or childish friendship. It is the friendships that take us through our lives. The friends that see us through the ups and downs, the ins and outs. This book proves that Ms. Blume still \\"has it.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is amazing!!!!!","review":"I absolutely adore this book! It is so well written and interesting that it just pulls you in and is impossible to put down. While reading, you feel like you're on Martha's Vineyard with Caitlin and Vix. The characters are so real and believable yet unlike anyone I know. I STRONGLY recommend this book to anyone who likes an interesting and engaging novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I love this book. I have now read it 4 times. It is like a good movie that you want to watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous! Terrific!","review":"Once I started reading the book, I simply couldn't put it down.Can't we all remember the feeling that our best friend supposedly always was on the greener side? Everything she had was better than what we had? Everything she did was supposedly so much cooler than what we did? That she supposedly looked sooo much better than we did? I believe that's all very familiar to us. However, the question remains who was really the coolest, the \\"baddest\\", smartest, sexiest and so on. Read this book and you will once again learn that things are not necessarily what they seem to be.And after reading it, you might be raving about it as well ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLEADING STORY DESCRIPTION!","review":"I was looking forward to reading a novel by the critically acclaimed author. But the story description is misleading. If want a book about friendships look else where. If you want to hear about little girls getting it on with each other then this is the book for you. I have lost all respect for Judy Blume."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read!","review":"I happened to love this book like no other... I loved the characters as if real... It was a wonderful story about friendship... although the ending broke my heart... anyone can read this book and be satisfied...and even immensely pleased :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book.....","review":"I loved this book, I couldn't put it down, and I was disappointed when it ended. I actually felt like I was part of the story, like I was friends with Vix and Caitlin. I must warn you that this book is not for people who get easily disturbed with the use of curse words and talk of sexuality. (The only reason I mention this is I know people who are bothered by this)but honestly it didn't bother me at all, it was a very humorous and emotional story that I enjoyed. I can't wait until she comes out with another book, as I love every single novel she's written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I could not put the book down, at times I could not believe what I was reading, the story line was a little crazy at times, which made it even more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Sisters","review":"It was an exciting story about two unlikely friends and the journey through their lives. Blume did a great job of adding imagery and detail. I hope there will be a sequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER!","review":"THIS BOOK WAS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE EVER READ! IT USUALLY TAKES ME A WHILE TO GET THROUGH A BOOK, BUT I READ THIS IN NO TIME I WOULD DEFINETLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANY GIRL OVER THE AGE OF 15, ITS VERY TRUE TO LIFE. YOU FEEL AS IF YOU BECOME ONE OF THE \\"SUMMER SISTERS\\" AND BY THE TIME YOU ARE FINISHED WITH THE BOOK, YOUR SAD BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT IT ALL TO END. THE ONLY THINK I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT IT, WAS I WISH THAT IT WAS A BIT LONGER SO THERE COULD BE MORE DETAIL DURING EACH YEAR.

It was so depressing and degrading to the sister called Vix. She was portrayed as a doormat and after loving a man for that many years, would not have been so forgiving to another person for wisking him away. Seemingly she was supposed to be lucky in finding a romance with Gus, but the author should have developed that more. It would have been a much better story if the author had Caitlin explain her self a little more. I keep trying to understand ...What was her problem?I would like to ask the auther to explain several parts in the book, as I will never understand them, and ask that she write a sequal, that would finally bring Bru and Vix together again.This book made me so disgusted and dissatisfied with the outcome that I would truly like to correspond with the author and find out some answers. Don't read it, if you expect to feel satisfied with a good story. It was a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a learning experience!","review":"This book was so awesome. I recommend it to young adults about 16 and above, adults will love it too. Usually I do not like reading books with peoples problems in it, but this was a good experience. I learned a lot from it, and it opened my eyes a lot on the out side world around me. If you have a problem with being pushed around by someone or feel like you are in the middle, then I suggest reading this book. It will help you a lot. So go check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Sisters: trash or class?","review":"I picked up Summer Sisters in a second-hand book shop the other day because I vaguely remembered having read Forever. And I sure was glad I did. Summer sisters could not be counted as 'great literature' due to its superficial handling of the main characters friendship, but it is an extremely good book and I enjoyed it very much. Edgy and exciting, its sex scenes are descriptive without being banal or pornographic, and the personalities and motives of most of the characters are explored via the use of sub-chapters. I consider this method to be extremely successful,as it adds depth and different perspectives to the situations and relationships in the book. This novel restored my faith in the possibilities of modern fiction to delight, entertain and provoke thought. Definitely a classy and worthwhile addition to the Blume's list of successful works."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lifetime Movie in a Book","review":"I did not feel that anything connected in \\"Summer Sisters\\"The characters were people I didn't really care about or identify with, no depth, to tell you the truth, no substance.I adore female bonding, relationships, gossip, confiding to one another about our deepest, darkest secrets, but ... nothing happened in \\"Summer Sisters\\" that held my interest.I didn't understand why they became friends to begin with, since they had nothing in common. And when they experimented with lesbian sex, calling it \\"The Power\\" I thought, is that the only power you have, baby?! Even the sex was bad!\\"Summer Sisters\\" is like a \\"Lifetime\\" movie that was thrown together at the spur of the moment...This despartely shows.Nothing in this book worked...except when I turned the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Enchanting!","review":"This book is definitely on my all-time favorites list.

I'm so glad she has started writing for adult readers. I really enjoyed \\"Summer Sisters.\\" I couldn't put it down. The book made me laugh and at times I wanted to cry.

I have never been so disappointed in an author! I read the book with half interest--Blume fails to develop her characters and any sort of plot, which is sad because there was so much potential. I got the feeling that she wrote the book with the hopes of being recommended by Oprah...I hope Oprah saves her money--or she can get mine at our garage sale next week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, needs more character development","review":"Summer Sisters is a book with heart and feeling. It evokes a gammut of emotions for the reader. However, I feel the characters weren't developed enough - we knew Caitlin and Vix on the surface - but not deeper than that- I finished the book wanting to know more. The first person \\"entries\\" from the characters helps address this point, but not thoroughly enough. Overall, this book is interesting, a fast read - and makes you think about your own friendships and relationships through the years. Definitly give this book a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrific","review":"I was so disappointed in this. As several other reviewers have mentioned, this is no adult novel. Perhaps if I had read this at 15 I may have enjoyed it... but I did not.

I read every one of her books during my preteen and teen years. \\"Forever\\" was the book that was passed around (hidden from parents) and read at slumber parties. This book was very disappointing. Does Judy have sex on the brain, or what? Not everyone enjoys reading about sex page after page. I didn't like either one of the characters. I read this book in 24 hours because I wanted to hurry up and finish it. To think I paid hardcover price for this makes me angry! If you want to enjoy the relationship of two \\"Summer Sisters\\" rent the movie \\"Beaches\\" - that'll tug at your heartstrings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book that I have ever read.","review":"I'm fifteen years old and think that this book is just as great for teenage girls as it is for adult women. I started reading this book the minute that I bought it and didn't put it down until I finished it, later that day."},{"rating":"2","title":"That same old magic","review":"I have been reading Judy Blume's books since elementary school and she continues to make me laugh and cry. I thought \\"Summer Sisters\\" was a great book--it moved quickly, while capturing the bittersweetness of best-friendship, the electricity of first loves, and the rollercoaster ride that is family life. It may be her first book in 4 years, but she still manages to sweep you away."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever picked up","review":"I don't understand the excellent reviews of this book.

I thought for sure that her adult novels would meet with my approval as well. Unfortunately, I found the constant physicality of her writing somewhat annoying. She has more depth than this as an author - I'm sure of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is excellent!!","review":"What an entertaining story! It only took me a day and a half to read it because I couldn't put it down! My best friend, Ann Marie was half way through it when she called me and told me I had to get it. She and I have already planned \\"Summer Sisters: The Movie\\". We are still trying to decide exactly who we want to play each of the characters! We are in agreement that Meg Ryan should play Caitlin but we can't decide who we want to be Victoria. Maybe when Ms. Blume is ready to sell the script, she could contact us for advice!! From the very beginning of the book, I was singing along with all the songs which took me back to those wonderful teenage years. She left me with such a good feeling but made me miss my best friend more than ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money.","review":"I bought this book as soon as I saw it and hurried home to read it from cover to cover. I loved Blume when I was younger and I really wanted to enjoy this book but I found myself laughing to myself too many times and not because it was full of humour. I was laughing at the sheer stupidity of it! Ok, this may seem harsh but please, the storyline went downhill almost straight away and most of the time it was too obvious. I really can't understand why so many people have given this book 4 or 5 stars when it's nothing more than a \\"deep\\" Mills & Boon story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone who grew up reading Judy Blume","review":"Another fun read from Judy Blume. A wonderful story about friendship, love and loss. A perfect book to read on the beach, on a rainy sunday or when you are stuck on the bus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judy Blume wrote this? Extremely disturbing ...","review":"There was something truly disturbing about this novel. I loved reading Judy Blume's books as a kid ... this just seems like \\"Are You There God,It's Me, Margaret?\\" with sex and suicide imposed on it to sell it to \\"adult readers.\\" Amen to the reader/reviewer who wrote that all she could think of when she read about Lamb was \\"Mick Fleetwood.\\" The characters don't think. I found at the end that I felt no attachment to the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Finish","review":"I ran across this title in a used book store and picked it up because I always meant to read Judy Blume's adult fiction. Had heard so many good things about her young adult books and, of course, admired her courage for writing realistically for that age group. I hope this is not representative of her other works, because it couldn't have been much worse. It's subtly preachy in a way that's off-putting. Maybe that's a good approach for YA fiction, but it's not appealing for this adult. The message seems to be if you have pre-marital sex you can redeem yourself by conforming and toeing the line. If not, you ruin your life and hurt your friends and family. The writing is oddly juvenile with some sex scattered throughout. The characters don't engage and the story is tiresome. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Definitely See This as a Movie","review":"Although some parts were a bit slow, I enjoyed the book. It took me through a great deal of emotions. I wish someone would make a movie out of it. I would definitely recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"This book is definitely a page turner. It is as if you know each of the characters personally and can see a little of yourself in each one of them. As you continue to be drawn into their troubled lives, you can truly empathise with them. A tear might even shed at some particularly sad points in the story. This should be a made into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, but typical Blume work","review":"I would have given it 5 but if you've read her other two adult novels, you won't be surprised with the book at all. Couldn't put it down though. Had enough suspense to keep me interested. And just when you're feeling disappointed in the turn of events, things work out better than expected. It would make a good \\"easy read\\" book for lazy days."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read but disappointing","review":"After reading the Ya, Ya's and the little altars I was really excited to read this book also about friends and their relationships. But I COULDN'T RELATE to them. I didn't like them very much or sympathize with them at all. I found myself reading it quickly and thoroughly in the hope of becoming connected to the characters as I have before in the before mentioned books. It was disapointing especially after reading the great reviews here at Amazon!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great display of the joy and heartache of friendship.","review":"This booked expresses a great display of friendship ..all the joy and heartache that goes along with it. The young adult 'coming of age' experiences are written so well. This book will bring back memories of how naive and curious you were growing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a story!","review":"This was an amazing story that flowed from chapter to chapter so nicely that it was hard to find a stopping place that allowed me to go on about my day without thinking about the next event within the book. This novel kept me interested from the beginning and I only put it down when absolutely necessary (i.e. to use the bathroom, go to work, etc.). This was a story so universal, with such diverse characters that I would be at a loss to find someone who can't relate to at least one of the characters. Blume is a writer who can appeal to people of all backgrounds. This is evident in her ability to write books aimed at both young and old with such elegance, charm and humor. The story was fun and uplifting and I recommend it for anyone who wants to spend a day in a soap opera type fantasy world. Like a soap opera, some of it is very predictable and unbelievable to people living in the real world, one puts its flaws aside to live in a fantasy world of forgiveness and unconditional love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Judy Blume has been a favorite of mine since I was a youngster in grade school. She's still got it, and what's even better, she's got it for adults, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only surface, no depth or insight","review":"My daughter gave me this book to read, tauting it as a good airplane book. My expectations weren't high but I'd read enough Judy Blume previously to know she has the capability of writing a good novel. This is not a good novel. The characters are so shallow that they're merely shadows, ideas of what characteristics a Barbie doll might have. There is 'rich girl with no conscience Barbie', 'smart, poor girl with no personality Barbie', 'Countess Barbie with a drinking problem and an upper class accent', ad nauseum. It was a true disasspointment and a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"You know it's good when the characters still linger with you","review":"I read this book over the weekend and totally fell in love with Vix & Caitlin. I truly adored their friendship as so many of us can relate to the strange bonds of young friendship.I can't wait for Judy Blume to introduce us to yet another adult book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. I hope they make a movie- maybe a sequel? I couldn't get enough of it. Marvellously written. I loved it. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I thought this book was great! I love Judy growing up and like her other books, I could not put it down, finished it in 2 days and I was sad when I did...I can't wait to pass it on to my friends..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining with no real literary value","review":"I enjoyed all of Judy blume's young adult books when I was younger. Now that I am older (and so are her characters) I have higher standards which this book doesn't necessarily fulfill them. Don't be mistaken, the book is an enjoyable light summer read but I wouldn't expect it to win any awards. A good summer time read if you don't want to think too much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating and addictive; but no less, a teenage book","review":"Yes, there is a ton of sex in this book and many other things, but minus all of that, and you've got a teen novel. It's as simple as that. The style that it was written in and the way the plot was laid out, you can tell that she might have been slipping into a \\"Dear God\\" moment. Maybe that is why the more mature audiences do not have wonderful things to say about this book! In short, if you expect to come out of a 400 page book with something to apply to your own life, don't waste your time because you won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Summer Sisters\\" is a wonderfully written book!","review":"This book depicts the wonderful concept of friendship between two girls in a wonderfully artistic and imaginitive way. I haven't read a book as exquisite as this one in a long time. I absolutely loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Sisters is an excellent read!!!","review":"I literally could not put this book down. The friendship shared between Vix and Caitlin brought me back to my own childhood. Judy Blume truly captures the ambience of adolescence. This is one I could read over and over again. Thank You, Judy Blume!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe in throwing books away, but....","review":"this one went into the trash. I was very disappointed. I read and loved all of Blume's books as a child and so when I was in need of a vacation book, and had no idea what I wanted, I picked up Summer Sisters. I was distracted by the poor quality of the writing, technically speaking, although it did improve as the book went on. More importantly, I found that the story line was weak, and Blume was stretching to entertain her audience rather than augment the story with her excessive, redundant sex scenes.Contrary to another reader's opinion, I was not impressed with Blume's description of the book's settings, or with her development of the characters.To sum it up, I don't recommend this book. Unless you are looking for a mindless and quick read, spend your literary dollars elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing....","review":"This was the first book I read by Judy Blume and I will never pick out a book written by her again. I am surprised that this book got such raving reviews....I was very disappointed with the story as well as the writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer Trash","review":"This is one of the worst books that I have ever read. The subject matter included in the book is more suitable for 10 year old girls. But there's no way that I'd let my daughter read this dribble. Please don't waste your money and buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare summer treasure","review":"Every year I have a summer reading assignment and I never enjoy the books. Finally, a year when I get to pick my book, I absolutely loved Summer Sisters. When I read the book I could not help thinking of the characters as my best friend and I. I could relate to the characters in my own way. I have begged my friends to read this book, I know they will enjoy it as much as I did. I highly recommend this book to everyone and hope they fall in love with it as much as I did. I grew up reading Judy Blume's books and once again she has won me over. I hope there is a sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This story was dissappointing","review":"Though I normally enjoy stories by Blume, I guess that I wasnot prepared for the content of Summer Sisters. It had a few funnymoments, and a few interesting characters, but overall, it was realtively boring. I don't know anyone who thinks of sex as much as the two girls in this story. The read was not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is her target audience?","review":"Is this book for adults or pre-teens? The plot is unoriginal and reads like it is written for 12-year-old girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best Judy Blume book but.....I liked it anyway","review":"This is a great summer read. I didn't enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed her books as a child. What I liked best was the memories it brought back. Vix and Caitlin were believable and I could somewhat relate to them. The power?????? Don't know about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Harrowing Coming of Age Story Many Women Can Relate To","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I read it in two days. I was unable to put it down. My obsession with the story is how it captures the bittersweet friendship between Caitlin and Vix which is such a typical experience for most women sometime in their lives. Everyone knows and loves a Caitlin, and everyone has a little bit of Vix in her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Page Turner!","review":"I devoured this book in 3 days. I found myself transported to the vineyard while I was riding the bus, at lunch, waiting for the elevator... I didn't want the journey to end, but when it did I remembered why I loved Fudge in grade school or Margaret as I got older. Her characters are unforgetable! Blume is an enchanting author and I can't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"sexy, fun and extremly flirtatious!!","review":"this book draws you in from the beginning . . . strong characters, intresting plots, and a whole lot of sex. intriguing and fun. i reccomend it for lazy summer days."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a 15-year-old's POV:","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I myself am a teenager and I found it very enjoyable to read about two teenagers who grew up in a completely different lifestyle from myself. Don't let the adults who have reviewed this poorly stop you from enjoying this book. Any mature 13-year-old would be fully prepared to read this novel... teenagers are much more educated in so-called \\"adult\\" topics than many adults... especially parents would like to realize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I expected.","review":"This book is suppose to gear towards adult women. As an adult woman, I find this book simplistically written, lacking detail, and poor narration style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journy into unforgetable summer fun","review":"Embark on an incredible journy of unforgetable summer fun with two amazing characters Victoria Lenord and Catlin Somers. Victoria is a shy girl who's world changes forever when Catlin invites her to spend the summer with her at Martha's Vineyard. There the two-girls become more than best friends, they become summer sisters. This is an incredible book that you just can't seem to put down. You feel as if you have become one of the main characters living the plot of the story. It will leave you laughing and crying at the same time. Judy Blume has written many great books, but this is one of her best. If your looking to embark on an incredible journey pick up a copy of Summer Sisters by Judy Blume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining Summer Fluff","review":"...It took me about 5 hours to read this book, it is definitelynot challenging, but the main characters are engaging. I think one ofthe greatest appeals of this novel, for me, was the fact that it took place in the years of my own childhood, with characters that were just a few months older than I.If you are looking for an entertaining but simple read for your vacation, this is the book to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome book","review":"As a teenager of 16, i related to this book very very well. i have a summer sister of my own and this actually reflected our childhood together. This story of 2 best friends, living two totally different lives, grow up together and find time for eachother once a year, at the Vinyard. They meet guyz, meet friends, and is basically the only time they ever talk. One is a popular snob at school, the other a \\"brain\\" of knowledge. If you enjoy novels with comedy, love, hardships and intense/sexual moments, then you will definately enjoy this book, \\"Summer Sisters\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very close friends with different outlooks on life","review":"What a terrific story!! It's about 2 young girls that befriend each other with Vix being envious of Caitlin's adventures. Vix spends her summer vacations with Vix and her family and minimal supervision. A lot of adolesent learning about boys, sex, partying and then moving into young adulthood with love, choosing a mate, and children. I loved this book, it was fun watching these 2 girls grow close than loose touch with each other and then start communicating again. I wish There were more adult books by Judy Blume. This story was SO REAL. If you grew up having a real close friendship and grew apart as you approached adulthood, you will adore this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, a touching story of friendship and betrayal","review":"I remember reading Judy Blume books as a kid (and enjoying them) so I had no hesitations about picking this one up at a friend's recommendation. The story elicited many emotions in me - I laughed, and even got a little teary in some parts. (I know, it sounds cliche..) It's a good story for anyone who's ever had a love-hate relationship with someone they grew up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"The PERFECT summer reading","review":"This book is so good. If you like books about women with humor this book is for you! I loved it so much I got Blume's other two adult books. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An All-Time Favorite","review":"There have been plenty of descriptive reviews written about the plot and details of this book, so I'll keep mine short - this book is a must-read. I read it for the first time when I was 14, sharing the pages with my very own \\"summer sister\\", and I've read it many, many times since. Heart-rending, sweet, sexy - this book is incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a young adult anymore","review":"I read on the Booklist review that this novel might have been marketed to appeal to Blume's young adult fans from the 70's, now all grown up. As of one those grown-up fans, I agree that the book is a young-adult book masqerading as a book for adults. Blume seems caught in a time warp of teenage mentality. She is a master at telling us what teenagers think and feel, but cannot seem to make the leap to give us similar insights for adults. I will never forget the joy Judy Blume gave me as a young girl, but this book proves once again that you can never go back."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unbelievable book!","review":"I didn't expect to like this book but after the first few pages how could I not? It was fantastically written, one of the best books I've ever read. It was the kind of book that you don't want to end. The stories about friendship and love really sought out your emotions. It was hard to put down. Judy Blume is an excellent writer and I recommend this book highly. If you've ever fallen in love or ever had a best friend, than this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not your daughter's Judy Blume","review":"I was hesitant to try this book because I'm not still the 13 year old who LOVED Are you There God, it's Me, Margaret? But I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the characters, how easily I was transported from scene to scene. It's a story of friendship, and the struggles two girls go through to stay Summer Sisters."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a tremendous waste of time!","review":"I was surprised and very disappointed that Judy Blume would write such a trashy novel. Her books for kids are so sensitive and heartfelt but \\"Summer Sisters\\" was utter garbage. The characters were unsympathetic or pathetic or both. Caitlin, especially, was just too self-indulgent to be anything but despicable. It was impossible to relate to or care about Vix or Caitlin. On a positive note, I did find that having the various characters jump in and out with one-page thoughts on events that had just taken place a very interesting way to give a new perspective to the scene. All in all, though, reading \\"Summer Sisters\\" was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for 12 year olds","review":"i was obsessed with judy blume's books from the ages of about 10-12, and was curious to see how she was at writing for adults. however, she has not accomplished that with this book. it has shallow, stereotypical characters, minimal plot, and tons of sex scenes which were exciting at age 11, but at 18 are just boring and unnecessary, and sometimes laughable. i gave this book 2 stars because i'm sure i would have loved it 6 years ago... skip it and give it to a younger sister or daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for \\"simpletons\\".","review":"This book is extremely overrated!! I don't understand its 4-star rating. The story was not original, the writing was shallow, and there was no explanation into Caitlin's psyche. It was not even a good book for mindless entertainment. I'm just happy that its price matched its quality. This book does not even qualify as good beach reading material considering its current competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judy's audience grew up but her stories didn't","review":"This book was advertised as being for adults - I think not. It's about a friendship between two girls coming of age. A book for teens, perhaps, but not grown women. The rags-to-riches luck of Vix & her happy-ever-after was too unrealistic. A fast beach read - if you're in the mood for something light, otherwise buy the book for your teen daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"beach book","review":"It's all in the expectations. If you're looking for a cute (but predictable) plot, quick (and unchallenging) read, this is enjoyable. If you're looking for a real book, forget it. This is a dressed-up version of a romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read but ultimately unsatisfying","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I enjoyed Judy Blume books when I was young, so I had great expectations for this one. I was really disappointed. I didn't find any of the characters likeable, or real. The relationship between the female characters was just weird. I don't know of anyone who acted that way with their friends when they were young. Blume is known for her HONEST approach to sexuality; The honesty was lacking. Granted, the older the two characters got, the better portrayed they were. But, overall, it was unrealistic. I couldn't identify with these two characters. The big secret in the plot turned out to be very mundane. I was hoping for something more intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book, couldn't put it down!","review":"What an interesting story. This book made me laugh, sad, and at the very end the unexpected made me cry. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you grew up with Judy Blume you will love this book.","review":"I read this book in a day. After the first couple of chapters I could not put it down! Reading Judy Blume was like catching up with an old friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever written.","review":"This book is great for adults and teens aalthough I wouldn't reccomend it for the 12 and under set. The story takes place on a magical setting which adds to the story. It is an awesome book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep 'em coming!","review":"Judy Blume's latest book reminded me of the one's I read growing up; those that helped me know I wasn't the only teenager growing up with problems. It was a book I didn't want to put down and I hope Judy plans on writing another adult novel soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointing book.","review":"Although I read this book in 2 days, it wasn't for the fact it was a real page turner. I did not consider this an adult read. It reminded me of the books I read in high school. Is Judy Blume now used to writing to the young adult audience? Makes me wonder if she'll come around in her next \\"adult\\" book. I hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving, Funny, Sexy and Sad Story All In One.","review":"Judy Blume does it again. This book is a great journey through a remarkable friendship. You grow with the characters, hurt and laugh with them too. It's a book that will make you remember happy childhood memories with a sad tune. Judy Blume remarkably reminds us that sometimes \\"family\\" is not defined through blood lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah...","review":"I loved Judy Blume's books when I was younger, and I was looking forward to reading one of her adult books. I was very disapointed! Summer Sisters just did not click with me. I couldn't relate to the characters, at any age; and I really did not care what happened to them. It was an easy read, but at the end of it I felt like I had wasted my time. Judy Blume is still a great writer, she just needs to stick to the pre-teen crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat entertaining but dissappointingly predictable","review":"As a long-standing childhood fan of Judy Blume, I was very dissappointed in Summer Sisters. Character development was lacking and I lost interest in the story at several points during the book. Caitlin's behavior was predictable at every turn and Vix was pathetically manipulated by Caitlin's every move from the beginning. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, Engaging, Enigmatic","review":"I came home from work, needed a book to read at the gym while I bicycled, and picked this one from the stack that I had just ordered online. I finished \\"Summer Sisters\\" that night. Everybody has had a Caitlin in their life at some point. It's interesting to note that if it had not been for Caitlin's family, then Vix would probably have turned out like her (Vix's) sister Lanie. This book was reminiscent of my young adulthood when I read everything by Judy Blume. \\"Summer Sisters\\" was the first adult novel that I have read by Blume, but it will certainly not be the last. She's wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could I have BEEN more disappointed?","review":"I was so psyched when a Judy Blume adult novel came out, I loved her pre-teen books when I was younger. When Summer Sisters finally came out in paperback I bought it and was so disappointed. I don't see the difference between this one and all her teen books. A bunch of teenagers obsessed with sex? I can go watch Dawson's Creek if I want that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash reading!","review":"I was embarrassed tp be seen reading this book. Cat has to be one of the dumbest, masochistic characters ever invented. She lets her best friend use her repeatedly and comes back for more, all the while waxing euphoric over what a great friendship they enjoy. I don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turning!!!!!!","review":"I Haven't picked up a Judy Blume novel since I was 11 years old. Big Mistake!! This book was truley wonderful. I am 27 years old with a nine month old son,and I finished this book in just two days. It brought back so many memories of those awkward but fun teenage years.This book will make you laugh and cry at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully Wonderful!!","review":"Judy Blume has never captured a more realistic plot than this book. I read the whole book in one day, it was too hard for me to put it down, I became too story hungry to find out what would happen next. I instantanously became a character in the book when I started reading. I wish my 'Summer Sister' days of not having a care in the world were not over. A diffferent twist in the end made the book more enjoyable, although I did wish it ended differently. I recommended this book to all my friends and now I recommend it to you. Enjoy it one rainy afternoon, believe me, you won't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does everyone like this book????","review":"I was looking for a quick, easy, entertaining read for the beach-- I couldn't wait for this book to end! It feels like I picked up one of those books I used to read when I was 10-- like the Baby-Sitter's Club. No characters were interesting or likable, the plot was boring; why is this marketed as an adult book? Especially as the characters get older, the book gets unbearably boring-- I definitely skimmed over Vix's conversations with her roommates at Harvard. The ending was just ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved Summer Sisters.","review":"I really only wanted something to read going back & forth to work everyday. One night I just couldn't wait till the next day to read this book. I read practically the whole book in one night, I just couldn't put it down. Vix & Caitlin experienced summers that girls dream about. I personally thought the book was great. The only disappointment to me was that it ended. Hope Judy has a sequel coming soon, a good pitch might be to do it from Caitlin's point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two friends become as close as sisters","review":"I was excited to read this book thinking it was an adult novel. I am in my thirties and I thought this novel would be ideal for 16-20 year olds. I think late adolescents would enjoy reading about first time sexual relations. But, I needed more. The characters were shallow. Although I did finish the book and did talk about it to others, so Judy did that much for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"What an exciting book. The characters come to life on the page. I couldn't put the book down! I love how all of the character's perspectives were given throughout the story. I would highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"must read for any Judy Blume fan","review":"I grew up reading Judy Blume and was surprised to find out that she was writing for adults now. I read the whole book in less than a day because I just couldn't put it down. Her characters are very well developed and you feel for them from the very beginning. Watching the two girls grow up together brought back fond memories for me and I would recommend this book to anyone. The relationship between the girls is very enduring. It is a must read for any Judy Blume fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book for a mature reader","review":"This exciting and detailed novel written about two best friends was one book that I enjoyed immensely. I wouldn't recommend this book for children under the age of 12 because some parts are for older people and there are some topics that are inappropriate. This book was recommended to me by a friend who said that it was good. I enjoyed it also. Even though Judy Blume isn't my favorite author, it seemed she spent time on this and I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time faves!","review":"I first read this book when I was twelve. I have since read it half a dozen times (I am 26 this year) and I never tire of it. Judy Blume's characters come alive on the page. This book showcases Judy's talent not just as an author but as an adult fiction author. I am re-reading it now and loving every page. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book and I'll tell you why...","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was fourteen. I was only a little bit older than the main characters, Vix and Caitlin, at the time, and I related well to the younger parts and really enjoyed as they grew up. Since then I ahve reread it so many time that I have lost count. I'm nineteen now and I have been able to relate many of my teenage experiences with those of Vix and Caitlin. My life is nothing like theirs. I did not grow up in the same era. But I believe that this book has the capacity to be relatable to ANYONE. Guy, girl, young, old. THis book is excellent, and I would like to meet someone who doesn't like this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I haven't read a book in a long time and a week ago I picked this up and LOVED it so much. I read it in just a few days even though i usually can't make time to read. The ending was great and left me wanting more. I strongly suggest this book to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer Garbage,Yuck!","review":"I could have written this worthless, horrible, book. None of the characters were endearing in any way. The story was your usual rich girl, poor girl, dysfunctional family fiasco.I have been reading Judy Blume since I was a little girl and she has grown up into adult novels. This book, however, was her absolute worst. Please try harder next time, Judy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, sister...","review":"Great book. Judy Blume's earthy language in some parts surprised and captivated -- and completely captured the essence of friendship between two young girls. Ah, sister ... my summer sister of so long ago ... where are you now? Has life been kind to you? This book brought back so many memories and a yearning for the friend of my youth. It transcends generations -- and in fact, was loaned to me by my daughter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Sisters is nostalgic for girls of all ages","review":"Judy Blume is one of the best story tellers of all time. \\"Summer Sisters\\", the story of an unlikely friendship developing between 2 very different people, is incredibly well told and can make the reader laugh and cry at the same time. Judy Blume effectively uses plot twists and foreshadowing to totally envelope the reader. The first time I read this, last summer, I read it in 3 hours while in my motel at the Jersey shore; I simply could not put it down. The friendship between Caitlin and Vix reminded me so much of my friendship with a girl named Jaclyn - I am just like Vix and Jaclyn was just like Caitlin. It brought back some of my very best memories, entertained me, and I got completely wrapped up in the characters as if they were people I knew. The book is one of the rare few that I can read to the very last page and then start over again right away. I definitely recommend \\"Summer Sisters\\" for anyone who has ever had a best friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Blume writing for adults or teenagers?","review":"I use to read her books when I was in highschool. They were good becuase she knows how to relate to young adults. But, this new adult book called \\"Summer Sisters\\", was a big disappointment. As I was reading, I kept waiting when will the characters grow-up? Have I bought a book for young adults? Get real! I personally think that she should stick to just writing teenager books because this new book is really intimidating for adults. Yes, Blume may have enchanted teenagers with her writing style but we, adults are not teeny-boppers intriged by words such as \\"the power\\". Give me a brake! Well, I am happy that she can gear her writing towards the teens but for adults, maybe she needs to grow up a bit and be more of an adult before she puts out her next \\"ADULT BOOK\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"For you and your best friend","review":"After I read Summer Sisters, I found myself missing my best friend more than ever and reminiscing about our childhood days. It was a real page-turner -- an easy read yet the plot moves along fairly quickly and keeps you intrigued. Judy Blume is an amazing writer who creates real characters with whom readers can identify."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest waste of my time of any book I have ever read","review":"I love to read. In my entire life I can't recall reading a book where my I would really like to get a refund, not on the price of the book, but on my time. The story was shallow, the multitude of characters discombobulated, characters with tiny roles would return to the story for no reason. I could have been equally entertained by reading 14 names of strangers with their date of birth, graduation, marriage, divorce, etc. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME"},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, read that","review":"I didn't find one original thought, one original character in the whole book. The book is like dozens I've read before and hope to never read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk! Retch! Whew!","review":"Blume should stick to adolescent-driven teen texts and leave soap opera where it belongs--daytime TV--and out of sight. Curiosity drove me to read it to the end where it really fell out of the realm of the even vaguely plausible. You'd have to be slathered in suntan oil and doped by the sun on a lonely beach (absolutely no distractions) to get much out of this one. Sorry, Judy, but foul mouthed cuties and single minded hunks just don't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book would be okay for a teenager.","review":"This is not an adult book.

I would have preferred a little more \\"substance\\" rather than just mindless \\"jabber.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - Reading this book may induce vomiting","review":"Summer Sisters is a poorly written novel, a waste of time, and an insult to one's intelligence. After getting through half the book, I felt I had to finish it, but the last 50 pages made me regret my decision. The ending is erratic, rushed, and illogical - what a mess! That's the last Judy Blume book I ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was really disappointed","review":"Before I picked up this book, I had read great things about it, including praises for its sentiment and women-bonding issues. But after I read Summer Sisters, I'm sorry to say that I felt a sick pit in my stomach from the totally unnecessary excess of sexual content and testosterone-laden fantasies. On top of that, the female characters were not strong role models or even women I could relate to - and their bonds together were as weak as their characters.Parents should be aware of the obscenity in this novel before allowing children under 15 to read it. I know the movies kids watch nowadays are horrid, but somehow reading about infidelity and adolescent sexuality through the minds of these characters can leave disturbing visions."},{"rating":"1","title":"summer sisrers","review":"a waste of time. a silly boring book. i found it easy to skip most of the second half and still understand the ending, which was no surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was really disappointed","review":"I was also amazed to know this book had made the NY Times best seller list. When my daughter was a little girl, we read a lot of Judy Blume's children's books together, I truly enjoyed reading them with her. When I saw that she was writing stories for adults, I quickly grabbed the first one I saw. Big mistake. Abby, Vix and a few others were wonderful characters with depth and personality..... It could have been a good book had Caity been left out. If I had to describe this book in one word, \\"Weird\\" comes to mind.Stick to children's books, Ms. Blume.... they, are enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This is a waste of time.

Guys shouldn't bother - this is definitely a chick book - but the ladies will enjoy it. I got annoyed by the ending - it was pretty abrupt and you never find out what happened to Caitlin. However, the Somers' were a good portrayal of a rich, eccentric family and Vix's family was dead-on realistic. And sometimes extraordinary girls like Vix do fall for shallow boys like Bru."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summe Sisters Lacks Substance","review":"Summer Sisters was my first Judy Blume book, and after reading it, I am happy that I avoided reading any of her work during my adolescence.This book was extremely disappointing! There was no beauty in the langauage; the plot was utterly predictable; the characters were cliches and thoroughly unlikable. I also found the many sex scenes superfluous and crassly written. As a middle school teacher, I certainly hope that Ms. Blume's young adult literature is of higher quality than her first \\"adult\\" novel, Summer Sisters."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than a trashy Danielle Steele novel","review":"If you're looking for a Danielle Steele-ish quick read, this is for you. I personally thought it was pure trash. Big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Sisters","review":"This is an absolutely amazing book that draws into the lives of two girls and their journey into adulthood, and how their friendship affects all aspects of their lives.Its the perfect story about the friend that almost everyone has had in their life at one point or another, Vix is absolutely enamored and in awe of Caitlen and even though Caitlen may not be the best person for Vix, she cannot help but love her anyway.This book is my absolute favourite book... I read it one summer after a friend raved how good it was, and now this is my 7th summer reading this book, its a tradition to me now that I must read this book every summer, and every summer it draws me in and relates to me and touches me in the same way that it did when I first read it 7 years ago. I have given it to all my close girlfriends to read and every one of them has also fallen in love with it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Good!","review":"Summer Sisters was a wonderfully entertaining book filled with fun, sorrow, frienship, love, and sex. It portrays a realistic friendship that makes you fall in love with all the characters. Blume portrays sexual experiences as young adolescents and when they get older, yet nothing about it is creepy or weird. There are some great sex scenes. I was hesitant about reading anything by Blume because I have always thought of her as a childrens writer, but I am 23 and I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile porn","review":"Judy Blume writes for 6th graders. If you were expecting a good \\"summer read\\", as I was\\" you'll be terribly disappointed. Characters are trite; action is non-existant; plot? No, there is no plot. Just a tedious plodding thru a decade or two of \\"dear diary\\" written by a youngster. Don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Not bad for trash, but really it is pure trash. The good brunette, the bad blond. Unlikely scenarios and characters. Soft porn sex scenes. I kind of enjoyed it while I was reading it. But, like junk food, you feel kind of gross afterwards for indulging."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you serious?","review":"This is a formulaic romance book, the term novel should certainly not be applied without a heavy dose of irony. It bothers me that there are 1100 rave reviews of this book, probably more than there are for classics like Gatsby, Brothers K, Portrait. My advice to prospective Blume readers is this: bring your TV out to the beach and watch soap operas while you tan. Don't buy trash like Summer Sisters, or you will ruin literature--publishers run from real literature now, since garbage like this is so profitable--and cripple Western Civilization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girls, women, sisters & everyone who wants2 believe in \\"NBO\\"","review":"I gave a copy to my best friend, my sister, my cousin and my other friends--all of them loved it and this is no surprise! Sure, this may not be 'literature' but it's a nostaligc, romantic memoir about two women, Vix and Caitlin, both so different who are both very close until Caitlin comes up with a manipulative ploy which has Vix wondering just who is this girl? Fast forward eight years and Caitlin is marrying Vix's 'man'...what's with this? Sad, funny and poignant, i enjoyed this book immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting.....and easy to read....","review":"I enjoyed this book throughout the entire story. The girls went through puberty together and came out of it okay....well, at least one of them did. I don't usually care for books that have a character \\"disappear\\" and then everyone tries to figure out why she left....but this story had a good circle of people in it that kept you interested. Have recommended to others.."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Story written by Judy Blume","review":"I love all the books that are written by Judy Blume, but my favourite one is this new one--Summer Sisters. It is a story filled with mixture of happiness and sadness, love and friendship. The story talks about two woman in the process of being a child, to a teenage, to young woman. Through the summers, love and friendship had gave the two woman hope and future. The end was quite sad, when one of them died. I definately reccomend Summer Sisters to ANOYONE who loves to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was terribly dissapoimted with Judy Blume on this one.","review":"This was chock-full of sex.

My opinion of her has sky-rocketed down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Time Reading About Wasted Lives","review":"I hate when I read a book that left me with nothing and I ask, \\"Why did I bother reading this?\\" This book is about two girls who escape their real lives. One escapes a so-so family life for an \\"adopted\\" family and one escapes her more stable family to waste herself in hot pursuit of excitement and men. No one seems to deal with what they have been dealt with in life, but look for substitutes. It is written from an immature teen perspective and no one seems to actually grow up even though they age in years. The sex began with the two young girls doing it with each other and then basically doing it with anyone else as they grew older. There were also too many characters to keep up with and I grew tired of trying to remember why someone was important to the story. I am disgusted that I let these characters occupy a part of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"find something else worthwhile!","review":"After reading this book over a year ago, I still remember what a waste of my time I felt it was!I am very disappointed to still see this with so many stars. And am also disappointed to see people list it on their lists of favorite books!I only hope that there are sane people out there who also will agree with me. Try Jubilee by Margaret Walker for a good example. I have shared this wonderful story with many relatives and friends. This is what good writing and reading is about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish i shouldn't buy it","review":"No character depth.Style in prose is totally plain.Deal with sex obsession a lot.If you want to read something like romance fiction, i reccomend you to go for this book.but if you want some thing more real and \\"growing-up\\" like the book seem to be, don't ever trade your falling eyesight with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a good book!","review":"The characters were so underdeveloped, and the plotline was unbelievable in several places. How did Caitlin make it to Harvard? Unless she was unbelievably intelligent (which was never brought out or mentioned), I doubt this would've happened. Also, some details were simply not correct -- for instance, Victoria's Secret had not even become a store yet in the early 80's, much less started putting out a catalog! The story seemed obsessed with sex, and I just got tired of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Could This Make the Bestsellers List?","review":"If you have nothing but time on your hands, and don't expect much from a book, I can see why you'd read this.

Overall, it's an easy, quick, entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Summer Reading for Dancing Queens","review":"I just saw Judy last night at a author reading in Portland, OR. She read from Summer Sisters and talked about the devleopment of the novel. The audience was filled with a variety of ages, but by far was dominated by young women in their 20's and 30's, like me, clutching the book and listening with rapt attention to the author who brought us up through adolescence. I can't give this book a 10 on literary merit, but I can give it an 8 as it was a completely enjoyable and relaxing reading experience. This book seems like a gift from Judy to my generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"This book went really fast when I read it but I really don't reccomend it.

Having had my fill of technical literature that I print from the Internet, I decided to purchase a \\"bus book\\". I had read Judy Blume's elementary school tales and enjoyed them. While I finished \\"Summer Sisters\\" in two days, I can't believe I actually read it. I'd have to place the book near Harold Robbins' works or \\"Mandigo\\". I may as well help my twelve-year-old work on dichotomous keys for his science class.

This was absolutely terrible -- from the sex to the money to the dingleberries -- trash! Kills me that I saw copies on a rack for summer reading displayed with books by Anne Tyler, Jane Smiley, and Joanna Trollope, as though all things are equal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer Sisters","review":"This is a post written by someone who adores Judy Blume and has read all her children's and teen novels. Having read her other books, I was really expecting a novel with actual substance, rather than just fluff fiction. The strange twisty drama I got was nowhere near my expectations. It seemed so juvenile for such a prolific writer, and this was supposed to be an adult novel! It was filled with...oh, for lack of a better phrase, trashy drama. The fact that it was slow paced and pretty dull, teeming with pointless filler, did not make a stronger case for this novel. Not to mention, whoever wrote the summary on the back of the book pretty obviously never bothered to actually read the book, so details on the ending were revealed before I even opened the book, and some of the material from the back summary never even occurred. Just do yourself a favor and stick with her more substantial teen books.Rating: 1/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't stop thinking about this book","review":"This book was a real page turner.

It just seemed too abrupt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Room For Improvement, Wake-Up!","review":"For some reason there remains a problem with the video quality of Thomas Crown Affair. What we are suppose to be seeing is a new transfer, ( I guess admitting that the prior version needed improvement) which in fact it did. This new transfer isn't quite what I was expecting, in fact it's uneven or should I say unbalanced which gives a uncomfortable viewing experience. Anyone who purchases this DVD version expecting the ultimate quality version is in for a big let-down. This DVD is offered with the wide screen/ full screen format. MGM appears to be looking in the rear view mirror. With Plasma/LCD quality, why is MGM wasting time with marginal quality standards. This Batch will end up in the bargin bin. Save your money and wait till next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"You kids could use a little '60's attitude.","review":"Reading the reviews of others here, I'm beginning to wonder where we children of the 60's went wrong. In the spirit of examining this movie, I ask: Have you kids no sprit of adventure, no instincts to rebellion? Thomas Crown exhibited in spades the exact opposite of the conformity and benign contentment that I sense with some of the reviewers of this flick. In short, this guy was ALIVE!! Sure, some of the dialogue, etc. is dated. So will that of 2005 be in thirty years, I assure you. But Mr. Crown was more alive in his Boston-Brahmin prime than, I suspect, many of the reviewers are in theirs. Or maybe its just the times--we seem to be living in the '50's, redux. Sad. Anyway, buy this movie already and learn. Better yet, make yourselves a nice cold martini [if you know how] and get into the spirit of this. If you have a nice, sexy-icy mistress available [Ms Dunaway, where are you?] then you're ready for the ultimate Tommy Crowne experience. Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"McQueen at his classiest, Dunaway looking very hot","review":"This movie was good when it came out and it has only gotten better. While the plot always seemed a bit of a stretch the remake with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo was even more so. And the ending of the original is so much better in my view. This 1968 gem is just short of a classic and has really stood the test of time. I have a 2 part test for whether or not I want to buy the DVD of a movie versus just rent. The first is that I want to watch the movie in its entirety more than once over time and second is that I want to cue up certain scenes from time to time. This movie passes both tests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent classic","review":"This movie is timeless. Steve Mc Queen at his best with a great supporting cast and wonderful sound track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Cool McQueen Delivers Again!","review":"I have been a fan of Steve McQueen since I saw The Great Escape, and this is one of the best caper films i ever saw. The split screen effect adds a new dimension to the film. And the romantic chess scene is now a classic(Mike Myers spoofed it in Austin Powers:The Spy Who Shagged Me). The combination of McQueen and Dunaway is perfect for this film. This is a must see for all McQueen fans. And the recent remake with Pirece Brosnan is as good as the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, exciting, one of best movies made.","review":"I saw the original in 1968 and the new movie playing now.

This has to one of the most idiotic movies ever made. It's not only that it's dated but the story makes no sense. That Dunaway looks at some pictures of men who've gone to Europe recently and picks out McQueen as the robber--can we really believe that? And with no evidence, nothing to tie him to the crime, McQueen goes along with it and returns the money. Because some dumb blond tells him he's guilty? Duh! This was even too dumb for the swinging 60s. I can't understand how people rave about this dumb movie. It lacks any real plot or suspense, and the chemistry between Dunaway and McQueen is about as enticing as two dead fish meeting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the first and last 15 minutes for the movie!","review":"I was really into this film right from the start. The first 15 minutes film, I forgot I was watching Thomas Crown and thought I was in the middle of a James Bond flick! But after the initial beginning, there was a BIG letdown and the story simmers into a tireless love story that seems like a ripoff from ENTRAPMENT! The last fifteen minutes of the film were first rate so if you get this DVD, watch the beginning and then skip to the end. Believe me the middle is something you can forget about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did We Really Call this Acting During the 60s?","review":"Steve McQueen can arch his eyebrow and smoke a cigarette very well. These are his main contributions to the film and his craft. Faye is a mannequin. Her primary contribution is pinpointing Crown as the suspect because he was not a \\"square\\".

Unfortunately, Amazon does not bother to link its customers, (no, not even loyal, longtime, Prime customers) to some type of customer service that can help with this kind of false product description, so I guess I'm just out of luck.

If you or someone you know is battling with alcoholism I highly recommend this book. The stories vary from person to person, and it's interesting to read all the different stories. If someone thinks they might have a problem with alcohol, this book will certainly shed some light on whether they may need more help with their problem.

I admire them for wanting to spread the light of Christ, but I feel that this is done in a dishonest way."},{"rating":"2","title":"By any means necessary","review":"I discusse this book with my wife. She asked me how were the Democrats ever able to get away with this stuff. The allegations in the book are so well documented with an exceptional attention to detail that can become, after a while a little burdensome. I however, thoroughly enjoyed it. The completeness of the text while weighing it down adds credibility.

While some of this information may appear partisan, the truth is the truth.

I guess I was expecting some sharp-tongued humor that would be expected from David's talk radio conservative icon brother Rush.If you are intrigued as I am with the issues surrounding the way Clinton abused his powers for political ends or personal gain then this is a must read. If you are looking for Limbaugh wit you will have to look to Rush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Required Reading","review":"This should be required reading for anyone who is concerned with corruption in government. This is not a book just for conservatives. Liberals and moderates should take no offense at this scathing review of the Clinton/Reno Justice Department. Anyone interested in good government needs to take time to review the facts that are known and decide for themselves if they are content with what has happened over the last eight years.Mr. Limbaugh has established himself as tireless researcher, a clear and critical thinker and someone who expects honesty and integrity in his government. This is not nor should not be a conservative or liberal position.I highly recommend this book. It will make you think and will, in all likelihood, raise your expectations of those who make and enforce our laws."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST READ EVER!","review":"This book is the poorest example of writing and reporting I have ever encountered.

That's not my trouble with this book, as I expect nothing less from Rush's little brother. What did depress me was how lazily thrown together it was, like maybe Rush had a few of his interns dig up some Washington Times articles for David to weave together into a partisan rant. Also a tad distressing was the lack of any sort of historical perspective, on say what Ed Meese got up to let alone Nixon's crook Mitchell. (Though again this is standard party trick of right wing hacks so no surprise.)

The Victoria section is quite short, and the only detailed street map focuses exclusively on the region around the Inner Harbor. Why is that bad, you ask? Because the author recommends that you get out of that area, and offers his best reviews of restaurants and other locations that aren't on the map. We also found those recommendations to be less than helpful -- restaurant reviews often told you very little about a place except that it exists -- not too helpful when you're trying to decide where to go. If you do get this book for a visit to Victoria, you're at least going to want to pick up another map. Better than that would be to get a book that focuses exclusively on that city."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the Basics.","review":"While Mr. Lucchesi is obviously a very talented sculpter of the human physique,I found this book to be somewhat simplistic in it's approach. Going through its pages was similar to watching the how-to-paint shows on PBS,a few little tricks here and there to get a quick effect,but no real exploration as to what makes a sculpture a real work of art or a true portrait. For someone who already posseses an understanding of anatomy,who knows the foundation of modeling the head,this book describes not much more than forming a maniken. There is no discussion of the relationships between parts of the face or how those relations change with different emotions. I can only recommend this book to beginners with no previous modeling experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I bought this book during some downtime after surgery and I was thoroughly impressed.

The book is very well designed and organized. The format includes plenty of black and white, clear close up photos of the artist's clay works in stages of progression. All the pages have useful, visual details of an art lesson in modeling the head. I recommend art teachers to buy this book to help students, including beginners or advanced art students, who have never done an modeling of the human head with clay. The artist is also one of the finest clay sculptors I have seen.

This Blu-Ray version was a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The quintessential psychological thriller","review":"This movie is a rare treat, and one worth the time to whoever gets the chance to check it out. Hitchcock at his best here, making the most of a story which was originally intended for the stage.

An absolute classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dial M for Murder","review":"Re-made several times, (most recently as \\"A Perfect Murder\\" with Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow), the original has never been surpassed. The casting is inspired, with Milland the essence of oily smugness as Tony, and Williams blandly British as Hubbard. Hunter and quarry thus play off each other perfectly. And then there's the lady who causes all the fuss: Grace Kelly, in her first of three roles for Hitchcock. She is beautiful as always, so that the very concept of doing away with her seems particularly outrageous."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last!!!","review":"I have been one of the many people who have sent in, demanding that this DVD be released and now it is!

Even though his plans get a wrench thrown in them every time, he rolls with the punches thinking up an answer for everything down to the last detail. I would recommend this movie to anyone for the intrigue factor. Alfred Hitchcock was the best, why someone thinks they could re-create one of his movies to make it better (Psycho) are out of their ever lovin' minds. He is the master.

Slippery, slimy and slow but like all of Hitch's films, this one dose have it's moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dial M for Murder","review":"This to me is one of Hitchcocks's lack luster movies.

Reportedly having an affair with Milland at the time, there is no chemistry to suggest they are aware each other is on the same soundstage. Robert Cummings, mega-dosing on vitamins, would have been better served by an anachronistic vial of Viagra. Sir Alfred is asleep at the wheel this time around, too.

During the first wash,the sheets shrank a little bit for a snug fit on the mattress. What was really disappointing was how SMALL the pillowcases became, short by a good 5 inches. They NEVER completely covered our standard pillows. During the second wash, the sheets shrank EVEN MORE. It took us a good 10 minutes to wiggle the fitted sheet onto our mattress. Don't even get me started on how small the pillow cases became after the second wash. Now, as far as pilling, it took a couple of months, but they have become extremely rough. They look extremely ratty and the sheets are only 2 months old. My OLD sheets were nicer, but no longer fit on the (new) thicker mattress. I will NEVER BUY WAMSUTTA sheets again. Don't waste your money. We are extremely disappointed customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor quality","review":"I have used Wamsutta for years and have always been pleased with their quality and softness. But I sincerely regret having bought these sheets. I purchased one set, and, after the 2nd wash, there was enough pilling that they were uncomfortable to sleep on (all the little \\"balls\\" felt scratchy). My husband asked me why we were using the \\"old\\" sheets instead of the new ones because they looked so worn! I was so suprised that I called Wamsutta directly, and the very nice lady there assured me that I must have gotten a defective set, because that simply \\"doesn't happen with their sheets\\". So I exchanged them with an identical pair. And the end of the story is that I am returning this set for a refund because it is doing the exact same thing. What a disappointment. Absolutely do not recommend, and am now very wary of all Wamsutta products."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sateen is a finish that washes out","review":"I purchased three sets of Wamasutta 300-Thread-Count Egyptian Sateen Sheets and thought I had made an investment that would last for years.

I consider myself a \\"laundry care queen\\" always carefully following the manufacturers care instructions: within two washes the \\"Sateen\\" look and feel of the sheets was completely gone (washed out).The sheets are very dull and very much wrinkled.

Why do so many studios insist on altering the creative content of their family films? A simple solution is to offer both versions of the film on the same DVD. It's a shame that a film like this - originally presented in Panavision - suffers from a poor DVD release.

I have to say, the movie version is a bit more fun than the original, and I hardly if ever hold such an opinion. I'm sort of a purist, in that I believe the original book is better than the movie, the reason being the book tells it like it \\"really\\" happened without the cinematic liscence(sp?) the movies invariably add. Be that as it may, I recommend both the book and the video with the added advantage that the book includes a recipe for fudge (pronouned \\"fooj\\") made by one of the book characters.

The minute he hit the screen, I remembered the nightmares he gave me. I'm back in therapy now (ha ha), but I'm not sure I can do that to my under 7 year old kids. Also, there's the whole the baron is trying to kill the baroness side plot, and the creepy people/toys.Also, what's the with the dance number with the baroness in her underwear.

The period setting (pre-WWI England), two young kids, Dick van Dyke, and super music by the Sherman Brothers make this seem like a Disney product.However, the somewhat overlong film seems to lack the charm found in Poppins. This may be the result of adult elements subtly worked in, such as the wife-hating Baron and double entendres (\\"You'll find a slight squeeze on the ... an excellent safety precaution...\\"). The hook-wielding child catcher character is likely to be downright scary for small children.On the plus side are terrific performances by the lead and supporting characters. You will keep humming the catchy tunes in your head for hours afterwards. The movie also has lots of visual goodies, including some beautiful automobiles.The DVD is disappointing, since widescreen is not available.

It resurfaced and presented all its glory: wacked-out gizmos, a single parent struggling to raise two kids and his dreams, and a cast of eclectic characters. Though this version is not the letter - box, widescreen, it hasn't lost its musical and visual appeal that has kept CHITTY CHITTY as a classic. Dick Van Dick is wonderful, rubbery, funny, swift.

Due to the switch to Widescreen all DVD's were released in their intended aspect ratio, in this case 2.20:1. Sure there was black bars on the top and bottom but that was because the 2.20:1 was too large to fit on a 16:9 display - and for Americans with their 4:3 displays letter boxing became an issue because most didn't like seeing the bars and would rather loose information rather than see the whole picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely buy this version of this film.","review":"I just watched Chitty Chitty Bang Bang on BD last night and the transfer is beautiful I mean really what I'd expected from BD all along.

The acting and the story (loosely based on the one by the late British writer Ian Fleming) are lousy.

I would not recommend this product if someone has the older DWL-514 wireless router.

So being the loyal fool that I am, I went out and purchased a d-Link 624 router. I have to say that I'm very pleased so far with the 624 but when the 710 wasn't recognizing the network, I was told that the 710 will only work with the 624 with a different firmware version.

I tried several times on my own to configure the unit and then broke down and called their tech support. After 2 hours on the phone, the tech support person informed me that the extender would not work with my router. She said the firmware was too recent on the router to work properly with the range extender. I asked for a refund and she refused.

When LAN is connected for the setup and the setting are finally perfected, it gives an IP conflict error. It does not seem like the folks at D Link really appraoched this from a regular person's perspective to make the installation and functioning simple and transparent.

This show is absolutely flawless. Perfect cast, perfect stories, perfect acting. Characters are so rich and interesting that you get involved and get caught up in their lives from the very beginning.Show is not however for everyone. It is very edgy, provocative, sexy and at times somewhat disgusting (watching plastic surgery in detail may not be everyone's idea of fun). But shows creators deserve recognition for pushing each episode that close to the line and never crossing it. It is perfectly executed. And another thing to mention is a soundtrack accompanying the show. It is just as good as the show itself. Unfortunately I missed few episodes of season 2 as well. Can not wait till its out on DVD.

However, even if you don't like that stuff, you'll be happy to know that the morally depraved characters,while abundant, rarely come out on top and all the characters are very real and complex if not neccesarily likeable.It has funny moments and sappy moments and serious moments and lots of irony.You should buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nip/Tuck","review":"I enjoyed recieving the first season!

It's pure fluff and enjoyable in a cheesy sort of way. But _Shogun_ it ain't. And I found the representations of the three women in the book extremely shallow and one-dimensional, and Francis' relations to them uproariously funny in their insubstantiality. Do yourself a favor and search out some more substantial fare about Ming/Qing China if you have the chance--the real story is every whit as gripping as this fictional account, and far more rewarding.

All Amazon reviews should begin this way, stating which seller the reviewer bought from. It's especially important for things that don't have a brand name stamped on them. Like cables, adapters, and aftermarket printer cartridges.

And maybe hope he'll sing in this. Instead of a good story, it's just stupid. If Ringo was not in it, then nobody would watch it. Even so, it's still a bad movie.

His then future wife Barbara Bach plays his love interest, Lana. Shelley Long, pre-Cheers plays Lana's rival. They all speak in a fake language that consists of grunts and 12-15 words and a few English words, such as one swear. The most famous line was \\"Atouk aloonda (sp) Lana,\\" which is loosely translated as \\"Atouk loves Lana.\\" Many people did not aloonda this lousy movie. If it wasn't for a Beatle, nobody would praise this film.The only reason people bothered with this movie is because Beatle Ringo was in it. The movie opens with the date October 9, 1 million B.C. October 9 was John Lennon's birthday. Not to offend Beatle fans, but this movie was on the same plane with the emperor's new clothes and nothing in the world could make it a good movie. The other one-STARR reviews say it well and one reviewer called it \\"stinkarooey,\\" which it is. Even the Beatle connection could not make this a good or funny movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Customer Satisfaction","review":"My family loves this funny movie and the service provided by Amazon was top rate!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"If you like the three stooges (and Ringo), you'll like this movie.

I have since purchased all the books written before Book 10. The detailed concepts about DNA, the shift in the veil, the ability to understand what happens in the spiritual realm as they interact with us here on earth is beyond facinating. I plan to reread this book many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whirlwind Journey","review":"This book attempted a Herculean feat, to present a synopsis of events occuring in 1688 globally and someone try to tie them all togther in a succint historical context. To some extent, the author succeeded. The reader is introduced to areas of the globe not commonly covered in college courses which emphasize Western History. The book is also well written and includes personal stories of people who lived at the time, in addition to the \\"big picture\\" of wars, famines, uprisings, discoveries, philosophies, and rulers. However, with any attempt this grand, the book is strained and overly dense, making it hard to digest. After a while, the whirlwind tour, rather than illuminate, feels like a bad case of jet lag. One is tired and whoozy, filled with scattered images, and a little curious to read more selective and in depth history dwelling on a portion of the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take A World Cruise!","review":"This absorbing world history of the year 1688 allows you, minus the book price, to traverse the globe for free. Professor E. Willis, jr. has done all the work for you. All you need is his book, an atlas and the internet to check out each exotic tale and locale. This is rivetting history at its best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this machine!","review":"I bought this karaoke machine (not through Amazon) and was dismayed at the low quality. The CD cover was very difficult to close, and would pop open at the slightest touch anywhere near it. The microphones did not work. The screen quality was poor. I ended up shipping it back to the place I bought it from (at my expense of $25!). My daughter (for whom it was a birthday gift) was very disappointed that her present had to be sent back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shampoo for Thinning Hair","review":"There is no better shampoo for thinning hair than Nexxus Biotin Shampoo. I have tried too many to quote, but this one actually increases the volume of my hair making it look like I have more than I actually do. When it does this it also makes it easier to manage because it improves the body of the hair so that it is not thin and fly away. And it does it with a shampoo that has a great fragrance to it. I have been using this product for years and have found nothing better. I buy it by the gallon because I am so afraid that they are going to stop making it. If you have thinning hair, you will love this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Best Album ever Made?

I will say, even at 11 Years Old, I had excellent Taste, this Album may be the best Recording EVER (Dorati's version of the Nutcracker is its only rival). So many emotions, great orchestration, powerful vocals, it's all here, every track is outstanding. Indeed, over the years I have grown to love the song \\"Who am I\\", that original flip side of \\"Love Train\\" more than \\"Love Train\\" itself..You must Buy this CD, absolutely and unwaveringly ESSENTIAL!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHEN PHILADELPHIA WAS HOT","review":"Remember 1972,when the PHILADELPHIA FLYERS were the most scared NHL hockey team with goons like SCHULTZ and SALESKI.O.K. maybe i anticipated a little,they won the cup in 1974 and 1975.Anyway,wherever you were in 1972,you could not escape the PHILLY sound of THE O'JAYS who literally stole soul and send it to PHILADELPHIA after years of DETROIT dominance.If THE O'JAYS were to put them on the map,GAMBLE and HUFF had emerged a few years before, writing and producing for JERRY BUTLER and WILSON PICKETT.The only negative side of this record, is that it spawned disco music(beurk!)until 1980....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 70's soul must-have","review":"This was the first album I ever bought, at the age of ten, and the songs stay with me to this day. Although I grew up in Detroit and with the Motown Sound, I came of age listening to \\"TSOP\\" (The Sound Of Philly). \\"992 Arguments\\" was an underrated single from this album, but the 45 disc doesn't do it justice. You have to hear the album track with the vocals and lush orchestral arrangements. If you were going to start a 70's soul collection, this is a must have disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philly At It's Best","review":"The Philly trio's first for Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's Philadelphia International - and what a debut ! Almost every song's a winner. Listen to \\"Time To Get Down\\". It didn't hit the heights of the other tracks culled as singles but it sneaks up on you. Even today the music has hidden secrets to uncover. Philly creativity at it's best. Essential for the soul fan. Own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neglected masterpiece","review":"This album has been blowing me away for over a quarter of a century now. The O'Jays expand on the early 70s paranoia that found its way into much of the soul music of the era. The album is perfectly programed.From the opening When The Worlds at Peace.To one of saddest, powerful and emotion break up songs ever, Who Am I. I bought this album for the two singles Love Train and Back Stabbers. Not in my wildest dreams did I know they would bury such wonderful gems as Shady Shiftless Jealous Kind of People and 922 Arguments into this soul classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album that put the O'Jays on the map.","review":"This album is indispensable for several resons--and it's also a timeless masterpiece. \\"Back Stabbers\\" effectively and single-handedly put Philadelphia International Records on the map as a force to be reckoned with in the R&B market while making The O'Jays true superstars. The music on this CD remains as relevant (and as impressive) today as it was back in 1972.

They were extremely comfortable the first time I wore them, for many hours on my feet.

The gold color is not at all too flashy, and they're actually quite neutral with almost any warm weather outfit. I have a small triangle shaped puncture/tear on the inside facing wall, but it's teeny-tiny and although I have no idea how it happened it has not gotten any worse. These shoes are perfectly comfortable right out of the box, and I needed no \\"breaking in\\" period. My feet are fairly wide across my toes, but because the strap is adjustable they have always fit perfectly. Great shoes for vacations, especially if you plan to do a lot of walking!I now dread winter simply because I have to shelve this shoe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Skechers - Sightsee","review":"These shoes are very comfortable.

Of course, Our Gang is better know nowadays as The Little Rascals. By 1942, the Our Gang comedies were on their last legs; the shorts stopped being produced in 1944, although the comic book continued until 1949. This book reprints the Our Gang stories from the first eight issues of the comic book. The comics are are by the great Walt Kelly, with the exception of issue #7.

Borrow this one if you must read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Even Get Through It","review":"Terrible. Couldn't even get through it. Plot had a lot of promise, and character development was good, but dialogue was lame and certain parts of the novel seemed too abrupt. SPOILER: The way Logan Marshall asked Rinna to be his lifemate seemed too abrupt and unbelievable. If Rinna was as cautious as she is portrayed, there is no way that she would have taken Logan's annoucement so well. She would have fled for sure. One plus would be the creative way York (aka Ruth Glick) describes our \\"modern\\" conveniences to Rinna. It is amazing how foreign some our everyday objects could seem to people who are not familiar with our world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not up to the usual level....","review":"Having read all of this author's work I jumped at the new book in the series and was a little disappointed. This book can be read as a stand-alone, but the author is leaning towards a \\"different\\" style of paranomaluniverse than in her previous books. This new style is a little weaker and harder to follow for story and characters. Parallel universes, etc., have been done to perfection in other series (such as the \\"Crimson City\\")and adding that component to change up this already strong series is not an improvement. Action, sensuality are done OK here, but Logan was always one of my favorite brothers and I think he deserved a stronger story. Let's make this 3.5 stars and wait to grab this one at the used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggled to finish it!","review":"I have never had to struggle so hard to complete a book.

I really don't remember ever hearing this myself, even being a fan of \\"Canned Heat\\"..it's very humorous though.

I first heard theese as a little kid and in fact theese were the first Christmas songs I heard and liked. There have been very few that I havent liked. You should give this cd a chance which I snached up when I finally found it as I had been looking for all 25 of theese songs on a cd for years. Merry Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 year old loves this","review":"I had Chipmunk records when I was a kid and remember really enjoying them. I picked this up recently for my 5 year old and she has not stopped listening to it. When she wakes in the morning, when she's playing, when she's taking a bath, when she lays down to go to sleep... And no, it really isn't that annoying - maybe because I grew up with it, I dont know, but it is cute and she's learning some Christmas songs and really having fun with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Back the Christmas Memories - Just not for my Son","review":"I LOVED this album as a child, and I still love it to this day. It's well worth having as an addition to your Christmas music collection. For me, the Chipmunks carry the fun through the entire album. Please note, on this album you are dealing with the classic Chipmunk and David Seville sound rather than the modern variation (which I find a bit annoying). It's fun and entertaining, and I listen to it at least once each Christmas season. However, this year when I put the album on, my son commented that, while he liked \\"The Chipmunk Song\\", 16 Chipmunk songs in a row might be a bit much. It's a generational thing I guess. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood memory","review":"I have this album still that I had as a child. Of course I don't have a record player so I decided to see if I could purchase this on a cd instead. When I received it in the mail, I noticed that this album had more songs on it than the original copy I have. The extras songs on them were alright but it wasn't the same as the original. Over all it was worth the money because I can play it whenever I want. I think I'll hunt for a record player to play the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas with the Chipmunks","review":"I am so happy to have been able to purchase this item, i have not been able to play it because its a christmas gift.

It has all the classical christmas songs that I enjoy listening during the holidays, including their classic hit - the Chipmunk Christmas song. However, the last track-the Chipmunk Song, i.e. an additional bonus track, does not really fit into the whole theme of the CD. The tune is kind of off key with the new add-ons and I was kind of disappointed. In comparison to the latest Chipmunk soundtrack of the 2007 movie however, they did a much better version of the Chipmunk song with a couple of remixes and they turned out to be very contemporary, upbeat; it truly shows the Chipmunks really have the groove and they continue to rock into the 21st century! Well, 24 songs out of 25 are good, so it is certainly worth it to get this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childs Apron?","review":"I ordered this for my husband who is avarage size for a man.

After 95 pages, I have yet to gain any 'nuggets' and am disappointed with the poor standard of writing. Not only does Mr Cooper fail to provide actual step by step examples where his process has been followed successfully, quoted statistics are unhelpful and are clearly provided solely to support his case.One extract from the book (page 16/17) tells all:\\"We find the average success rate of developed products to be about 67%. But averages often fail to tell the whole story: This success rate varies from a low of 0% to a high of 100%, depending on the company!\\"I don't think one has to read a book to know that statistic!Much of what Cooper writes is common sense and I believe of little value to a dynamic organisation wishing to promote the internal development of breakthrough products and their succesful launch thereafter.I cannot believe that there are not better books available on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Conair products as a rule, but this is a mess!","review":"WAY too heavy, takes too long to dry and doesn't seem to have the power of other Conair dryers I've owned.

Chris Lawrence is one of my favorite song writters which he proves why on this CD, he writes from songs about heart break to having a great time with your friends. My favorite song on the CD would have to be the song \\"Afraid To Say This\\" which you can hear the acoustic verson on the Pumpkineater Records Comp.

There was no such thing at that time. As far as the deeper stuff, I think the child was exposed to events by his rather selfish, permiscuous, unprotective mother that would have warped him severely forever. Face it, the director didn't think the kid really mattered. I suppose that would be a sign of his own parenting views. The husband's death has a strong tie to the wife's infidelity. To summarize, I didn't identify with or like any characters and ideas presented here, and I lost interest pretty early. I guess the movie makes a presumption that these characters who flirt with death are so interesting (smile) that we'll just want to wallow in their tragedy. Think about the war, occupied Russia, Polland, etc. Hello? This is a two star movie at best. It's just over-acting and emoting BS."},{"rating":"1","title":"A butchered classic","review":"I have read the book twice and it is just about the greatest ever, but the movie did it no justice. If you have only seen the movie, you probably have no idea who Godliman or Bloggs is because they were basically cut out of the movie. You can't just cut out 2 main characters. Plus, the movie spent way...WAY...to much time with the love triangle and not enough on the badass spy that is sneaking his way across the country. I wouldn't waste my time with the movie, just read the book.In the movie's defense though, I watched it with someone that had never read the book and she seemed to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why should we care about these characters?","review":"I think Eye of the Needle, at least as the film tells the story, suffers from a common problem I have seen in a lot of \\"action thrillers\\": poor character development. Why should we care about these characters one way or the other? Instead we have a modicum of action and violence, a dose of beautiful ocean scenery, and lovemaking. There was not much complexity or discernment in any of the characters. Donald Sutherland simply looks depressed, as a serious actor might be if he found himself wasting his time making a bad film.Alfred Hitchcock did a much better film along the same lines with \\"The 39 Steps\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WWII romantic thriller","review":"The Allies are preparing for the invasion of Normandy and are trying to produce false intelligence to confuse the Nazis. A spy, living in England, has discovered the falsehood and is trying to contact Hitler to let him know. In his attempt to escape to Germany, he becomes shipwrecked on a small island. There, he will meet a frustrated housewife.Set in WWII Britain, the movie sets a good pace for the viewer to follow. We will follow The Needle, Donald Sutherland, as he escapes numerous traps set for him as he tries to smuggle secret photos out of England. He will find himself on an island with a drunken lighthouse keeper, a crippled pilot (former), and the pilot's wife and son. Both the wife and The Needle are isolated; she on the island with a less than affectionate husband, and The Needle, a lone spy in enemy territory.

It is not convincing that it is a different voice (although the scenery has changed).I have to say that this one was even blander than the first book. At least Lucy's angst was more believable. Izzie really has no issues in this book (other than when will her guy call), so although longer than the first, it has less to the story.For laughter, stick with Rennison, as this one will not even crack a smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Knockoff of Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging","review":"This is nothing in comparison to Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging.

I'm so happy to have this film on DVD, I only wish there was more special features on the disc. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precursor to Schindler's List","review":"Christian Bale is magnificent and unforgettable in Steven Spielberg's memorable yet slightly flawed tale of lost innocence and maturity gained through tragedy. The raw coming of age tale of a aristocratic child growing into a somber and mature young man is a powerful denoucement of WWII and the attrocities committed during all wars. John Malkovich again plays a memeorable antagonist, and John Williams complements Spielberg's direction with a melancholic score. The film's searing first person perspective of the boy's instantanous losses and continuous attempts to stay alive add a forebodding intensity which is reminescent of Spielberg's best work. Though the film has some narrative and pacing issues, Empire of the Sun presents a dramatic flare that Spielberg eccentuates in later masterpieces Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. A very good film and a shining hint at thing to come. Watch this film for a good cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN INCREDIBLE MOVIE","review":"This movie is so well-done that every time I see it I forget it's just a movie. Christian Bale could not have done a better job of portraying this young boy. In fact, I first saw this movie because I love Christian Bale, but after I saw it, it became so much more to me. You get caught up in young Jim's life and you begin to really feel for him. Although this is a drama, you find some comedy in the personality of Jim. I could truly go on and on. Just PLEASE, if you haven't seen it, go rent it. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuine art, and from Spielberg no less...","review":"By far one of my favorite movies of all time, Empire of the Sun is simply brilliant. I wonder how many more movies like this we would have seen from Spielberg if the critics had paid closer attention to it. Every time I watch this movie I get teary at least twice (Jim singing to the Japanese pilots and \\"Cadillac of the Sky!\\"); much as Citizen Kane has shots that will always give me goosebumps, this movie has shots so powerful they will always affect me. Anyone who hasn't seen it and truly appreciates good cinema should see it as soon as possible. We see an innocent (if spoiled) young boy become the ultimate survivalist. Jim sheds his former life, eventually casting the last remains of it into the Yangtze River. Jim's dreams and illusions never cease to be fascinating to me, and I doubt they ever will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Film!","review":"Christian Bale stars in Steven Spielberg's ambitious film about a British boy, living a pampered life in Shanghai, who is separated from his parents when Japanese troops invade China at the beginning of WW II. The kid then has to fend for himself in a prison camp among adults. Talk about a coming-of-age story! This film is terrific, with wonderful music, acting, camera work, and images. Tom Stoppard adapted J. G. Ballard's autobiographical novel, and John Williams provided the music. This is how Hollywood used to make movies.--Diana Dell, author, \\"A Saigon Party: And Other Vietnam War Short Stories.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Beautiful Movies Ever Made!","review":"My intention is not to write a \\"helpful\\" review, but to reinforce the fact that this is one of the greatest movies ever made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing movie","review":"The actors act very well, but the boy's behaviors and lots of scenes are cnfusing in the movie. I do not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable Shallowness of Spielberg","review":"This movie is full of stereotypes against a serious topic. Spielberg appears to be in awe of the mighty empire of the sun, and despises the Chinese in every way. In parallel, there comes high class British rich people, and the usual greedy Americans. Apparently Mr Spielberg didn't do his history homework. In the end of the movie, the usual American ground troops marched to the empty prisoner camp. But the fact is, there were no American ground troops in China in the second world war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Poor quality of DVD. Very limited information on the length of the special features, and impossible to navigate inside the special features--no matter what one selects, it plays the entire \\"special features\\", which is almost 30 minutes. The script, even though written by Tom Stoppard, is fragmented and inconsistent, failing to bring out the theme of the story as told in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"This is an unbearably tedious movie, interesting only for the lavish recreation of pre-war Shanghai early in the film. It's classic Spielberg, where the children are the innocent visionaries and all adults are corrupt. Its visual devices (a beggar early in the movie who taps his begging bowl outside the mansion owned by the wealthy British is echoed later in the movie as interned British prisoners hold their food bowls) are obvious and repetitious. John Malkovitch plays a typically creepy character that, in real life, probably had a pedophile's interest in the young hero, but in the cleaned up version, is merely a sort of Fagin to the Oliver Twist-like young hero. So boring that we debated turning it off, and eventually used the glorious \\"fast forward\\" button to get to the end. Proof that even exciting real life stories can be made tedious and dull in the wrong hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Rat befriends a teenager","review":"Insipid, banal, trite--words to accurately describe this movie escape me. I did watch the entire movie--all 2 and a half hours--but it never really went anywhere. I honestly can't think of a thing to recommend this movie!(Perhaps the scene of the Kamikaze pilots being toasted before their take off--but even it is wasted) For a really good movie about the Japanese occupation of China I recommend \\"Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre\\"--a far superior and grittier movie than this nonsense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeper than one may expect","review":"If you'd like an entertainig WW2 movie - watch Pearl Harbor. Steven spielberg, who was successful at only entertaining movies, has made a multilayered movie which has you thinking about it long after watching it.The movie is based on the true life story of James Graham, a British boy who was stranded, parentless, in Shanghai when the Japanese took over the city, & managed to survive in a POW camp until the war was over, in crcumastances many of the grown ups had a hard time surviving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every boy can associate with Jim.","review":"The scene where Jim salutes the Japanese pilots with sparks flying in the background evokes the child in all of us. The line between friend and foe blurs just long enough for a child to salute his heroes to mark the end of his innocence. The scene still brings tears to my eyes.Overall, the movie is easily one of Spielberg&#65533;s best, putting it behind only &#65533;Saving Private Ryan,&#65533; and &#65533;Schindler&#65533;s List.&#65533; Just like &#65533;Always,&#65533; it deserves a lot more credit as both movies reach into the soul to evoke memories of more innocent times. I&#65533;ve never seen a child not fall in love with this movie, so it&#65533;s a great watch for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bale is extraordinary","review":"This is a beautiful, complicated, searing film, and as such can be difficult to watch. The movie doesn't address many of the larger issues surrounding the Japanese invasion of China, but rather focuses on a single boy's story, as seen through a child's memories. Christian Bale is simply extraordinary as Jamie - hands down the finest performance I've ever seen from a child actor, and one of the finest performances I've seen from any actor. He is so utterly vital and alive, and seems nearly to spring from the screen. (His performance, moreover, is no fluke; he would go on to light up the screen in Newsies and Little Women, and give compelling and charismatic performances in Swing Kids, American Psycho, and Batman Begins.) The film is worth seeing for Bale's performance alone, and the beautiful cinematography and score are a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies of all time!","review":"I'm an absolute movie junkie and have probably seen over 5,000 of them in my 30 year life. Whenever I'm asked \\"what my favorite movie is\\", I'll almost always put this in the top 5.This is a riveting and heartwrenching story of a spoiled and naive English boy caught in one of the most explosive and confusing frontlines in WWII (Shangai, China). It chronicles his \\"lightspeed\\" maturation as he's seperated by his parents and forced to be survive on sheer wit and will.I won't give more of the story away than that. I will say however that the cinematography, music, acting, and set design are some of the best I've ever seen. I just can't imagine someone not adoring this movie.Hope my opinion helps.Enjoy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN","review":"I had an Uncle who was taken prisoner in Shanghai and spent the entire war in an Internment Camp. From his tales to us after his return, in my imagination, I lived the war through with him.I think Christian Bale was one of the greatest child stars of our time, and John Williams provided Music to still the soul and heighten the movie to it's zenith. I actually bawled tears of joy as the Thunderbolt swooped down over the camp,and was as elated as Christian, heightened by the music. I would really rate Empire of the Sun as 10 stars, but the hightest they would afford me is 5 stars. As Teddy Roosevelt might have said, BULLY! BULLY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, good picture and audio quality","review":"One of Spielbergs best movies finally in HD in Blu ray. The picture quality is very good and the sound (DTS HD) dominated by John Williams brilliant score is also flawless. I can recommend this edition without hesitation. The Blu ray book also looks gereat and has some interesting facts and movie stills in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambitious and Engaging Work From Spielberg","review":"Empire Of the Sun is a different type of war epic that treats the Japanese occcupation of China as seen through the eyes of a young British schoolboy separated from his parents during the evacuation of Shanghai. Christian Bale gives a remarkable performance as a boy who goes from a priviledged existence to a struggle to survive the occupation. John Malkovich is convincing as a coldblooded, hustling American merchant caught up in the Japanese invasion who manipulates Bale's character for his own benefit.The scale and ambition of the film is huge and some of the scenes of the evacuation and bombing are incredibly well done- classic Spielberg.Overall a rewarding film about a part of WWII that has been explored less by Hollywood than the European war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked","review":"From a reviewer who cannot stand Steven Spielbergs'over sentimentalized trashing of history; His inability to tell a story without shoving it in your face; I loved this movie. From beginning to end it is moving and well told. A slice of history that needs telling. Incredible performances, especially by John Malkovich. It treats the Japanese with respect and yet does not in any way diminish their brutality in ww2. A inspiring film! The only other film Spielberg has ever come close to this one is Schindlers list. A must film to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie - slow internet connection...","review":"Not sure if it was a Comcast issue or an Amazon streaming issue, but we had so many problems (starts, stops, blurry screen, etc.) that we simply gave up watching it. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Empire of the Sun where are you?","review":"This is an incredible movie if you haven't already seen it.

I really hpoe this one's let out on DVD but must be wide screen enhanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empire of the Sun","review":"This movie is truly one of Mr. Spielberg's best. I may be a bit biased when it comes to a Spielberg's collaboration with John Williams, the composer, since I love all their works. I saw this movie first when I was in middle school and I still cannot forget it. I remember hearing the Exsultate Justi during the movie and getting chills down my back. As trite as it sounds, I was moved. Then, when I saw that the movie was released in DVD format, I HAD to get it. I highly recommand this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible adaption of a great novel","review":"The novel Empire of the Sun by J.G. Ballard is considered by some the best British novel ever made about WWII. Spielberg's film does not capture the heart of the novel whatsoever. The novel, which is about spritual decay, has been replaced by a trite coming of age story. The narration is sloppy and unengaging and the score makes me want to vomit. The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because the film looks wonderful. Spielberg proves that he can make any seen look beautiful, but the story is not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused with little continuity","review":"This is good filmmaking, but awful story-telling. At 90 minutes into this I was checking my watch, wondering when it would start getting to a point. Then it ended. I guess it had no point.The actor playing Jamie is the only thing holding this movie together. I hope he got a director's share and a producer's share in the profits, because without him this would have been \\"Reds\\" or \\"Ishtar\\" or the directors cut of \\"Brazil\\"-- an epically long movie without any epic story to tell..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Moving -","review":"\\"Empire of the Sun\\" stars a 13 year old Christian Bale in his big movie debut. He shows great talent at a young age and the story is admirable but seemed slow and tedious. The location is Shanghai, which had not changed much from the World War II scenario of the movie.Christian plays Jim, a British expatriate who is separated from his parents when the Japanese army invades Shanghai during World War II. He goes back to his beautiful home to wait for his mother, and after months (as shown by the swimming pool evaporating away) he is starving since most of the food in the house has been eaten.Jim eventually is interned in a civilian prison camp and becomes sort of a mascot. John Malkovich plays his prison buddy. The story is somewhat interesting, and Jim has a wild imagination that gives some interest. The \\"Empire of the Sun\\" is based on a real-life autobiography and Steven Spielberg directs."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing underrated film","review":"Being a Christian Bale fan, I had to watch it and I was realy surprised.

A must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent war movie","review":"Empire of the Sun is an underrated Steven Spielberg movie.

The music is unbelievable too! I've been humming the song Jim sings ever since last night. I cry whenever I see this (if ratings were tissues, this would be a 10 all the way!).

This kid has been in a Japanese concentration-camp( and lets not break PC-code presenting Japanese internment-camps as harsh uncomfortable places, or next-door Airbase Japanese fighter-pilots as not being inclined to befriend and help father young English boys in WW2)anyway, hes been in this friendly Japanese prisoner -camp since the Fall of Hongkong in 1941, and yet knows all about the P51 Mustang fighter, obviously from the well-equiped extensive Japanese internment-camp library, with all the necessary data and tales of derring-do about state of the art American enemy fighter aircraft in 1944 or so.How Spielberg went on to Private Ryan from 'Empire of the Sun' might make a startling movie in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor excuse for a movie","review":"I logged onto the amazon.com website the day after seeing this movie in hopes of finding that a majority of reviewers would share the sentiment as displayed in the title of my own review. Boy was I wrong, and I really can't figure out what I'm missing here. Maybe it's the fact that I can't relate to being a spoiled rich kid. Maybe it's the fact that I like my movies presented at slightly above a snail's pace. Maybe it's the fact that upon any sort of character development I like to become emotionally attached to the story and actually care what will happen next. It's a bad sign to me when I find myself wishing that the other characters in the movie would shoot/beat/abandon the lead character at every opportune moment. Oh well. My only suggestion is that if you're not like me, go ahead and buy/rent this one. However, if any one of the above facts apply, stay far, far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empire of the Sun","review":"One of the few DVD's I truly regret buying. This film is full of overacting, poorly integrated scenes that have little or no apparent connection to each other, and an annoying misty quality to the cinematography.

It is amazing to me that anyone would have invested money to make this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"not uplifting or enthralling","review":"Story of a rather pathetic, unprepared, and unrealistic family.

Christian Bale gives us a sneak peak at his extraordinary presence as an actor, something he did not really realize again until the release of \\"American Psycho\\" in 2000. \\"Empire\\" is a Hallmark Card to lost innocence and childhood, which few directors can do with the grace and style that Speilberg offers. The landscape is powerful, the tale of loss heart wrenching, but more than anything, the scenes where the boy Bale is separated from his parents will keep the viewer glued. Critics often lambasted this film for its length and violence, yet without these, it's less effective. In truth, \\"Empire of the Sun\\" deserves renewed respect. It's that good.

About 15 years passed since I initially watched the movie, yet the whole time, certain images stuck with me, in addition to the music. I would find the choir boy's song in my head, years after seeing the film. (get the soundtrack; also incredible). Now in my 20s, I watched the film for the first time again recently and found myself deeply moved. I am able to watch and appreciate the film from both an adult as well as a child's perspective, which gives it much more meaning than I thought possible.

The threads of the story have promise but seem to get mired down in detail, complicated by Talba's other life as a poetess, writing/reading as \\"Baroness de Pontalba\\". In all, I found this book to be a slow, rather stilted effort, in which the \\"mystery\\" almost is lost in all the attempts at portraying the idiocyncratic behavior of the multitude of characters, none of whom comes across with much force or depth.

Plus, I ordered 25-count gift box, but they sent 3 boxes of 10 which looks lousy as a gift. I had to send 2 emails to try to get a response. Finally given a phone call of someone to call, who told me \\"the candy comes from other countries and it takes a while to get here.\\" Then they place the burden of getting a refund on the customer. They emailed me a return label, but I have to purchase mailing labels or clear plastic tape, print out the label they sent me, pack it up, find a UPS store, and pay for parking so I can wait in line to return their expired candy. They could have easily looked up the lot number to verify that they had sent expired candy, but they intentionally place the burden on the consumer. I have not yet received my refund.

I ordered my first one from QVC, and it ran for a little over a year. Not as painful as you might expect but it's fast and efficient. Faster and cheaper than waxing, and you can do it in the privacy of your own home without sitting in a salon for the whole world to watch. Great size to carry in your purse for touch-ups on the go. The batteries seemed to last forever and actually held up longer than the device itself. You do have to make sure to keep it clean or it won't perform as well. Overall it's a great little device. I just wish they could improve the quality a little so it would last longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"will buy again!","review":"I bought this product for the underarms,and it works WONDERFULLY!!!

I definitely will buy again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Saver","review":"This product is a time saver. God blessed me with more than average facial hair. I have spent 30 minutes to an hour a day plucking for the last six years of my life. I started a job that requires me to work many hours so I needed to try another method than plain old tweezers. This saves me at least 20 minutes a day. It doesn't get every hair (thats why it only gets 4 stars). It actually seems to miss the bigger ones more than the small ones. As far as pain goes it hurts a little, but not enough for me to not want to use it. I would say it hurts less than waxing though. Its only $20 it is worth a try. I think once I get the hang of this one I might try one of the more expensive epilators in hopes of getting one that gets all the hairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"How cool is this?","review":"This product WORKS, WORKS, WORKS.

It is a little stronger than most, and you do have to be careful not to use too much pressure, but it really gets everything!

It was much to painful for my upper lip (more pain over a longer period of time and less effective than waxing). The pain for my chin area was much more tolerable and it worked great the first time but not when the hair grew back. I would see the hair in the mirror and try to get the epilator to grab them but it wouldn't. I finally gave up and used a tweezer.

It really only worked on long fine hair in non-sensitive places."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a tweezer.","review":"The size is pratical, but instead of pulling out the hair from the root, it just cuts them.

Which I can't do for at least 24 hours because I don't want to further irritate my skin.As for pain, I didn't have any pain with it. I have a large emjoi hair remover that I use occasionally on my face but prefer not to use the same thing on my face and body which is why I got this. This to me was a complete waste of money.

This little battery powered epilator works so much better than I even anticipated. I'm a guy and purchased this to use on my tummy/chest/arm pits and I tried it on my tummy hair today and it worked like a charm, albeit with quite a bit of pain. Epilators are not for the faint of heart, and if you have never witnessed plucking or waxing, I would stay away because it definitely hurts. I'm excited to keep using this product and see if it keeps the hair away longer. My skin is super soft on first use, which is exactly what I wanted. My advice is to use it little by little. By that I mean do little areas at a time, not the entire area (on the first go anyway). I love this product though, and would recommend it to anyone who wants an affordable alternative way of hair removal."},{"rating":"2","title":"great inexpensive hair removal tool!","review":"Just as it is described, this epilator is great for removing hair in small places. I've used it on my face and bikini line (cleaning it with rubbing alcohol in between uses). It's difficult to say how painful the process is because pain tolerance is so subjective. For me, it wasn't so bad. I'm used to waxing. It's so important to start with short hair! This will reduce the pain by quite a bit. Sometimes it can take several passes to grab all of the hair, which is annoying, but when I'm finished, my areas are neat and tidy. The hair doesn't grow back overnight as it does with shaving. If you want an epilator for your legs, I'd skip this one. It's just too small. But for small areas, it's perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless - removes nothing.","review":"I own the Braun Silk-epil Expressive Epilator and I'm happy with it. But, I wanted a small one for more delicate areas (i.e. under arms & bikini). Unfortunately, this one didn't remove a thing. The tweezer head is curved (vs. straight across) and unless you have long hairs to pluck, this won't do a thing for you. I'm familiar with epilating and tried every which way to get it to work, but to no avail. I printed out my return label & I'm heading to the post office today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality","review":"The first thing I noticed about this product after a little use was that rechargable batterys were a must. But overall I give it 4 stars. It is slim, light, and very manuverable in tight places such as underarms and the back of the knees. The overall design also allows for a light, pencil like grip which almost makes it fun to use. I would deffinatly recomend this product and have already to a couple of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emjoi Epi Slim Compact Epilator","review":"Excellent little product.

This one ripped my underarm hair out and left burning and red irritation marks that I had to hide for over a week until they healed. It runs poorly, which I think is part of the problem. If you're ripping hair out by the roots, you want the shaver to be powerful and do it quickly. This one is terrible. WARNING: do not use on delicate areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for small areas","review":"I hate shaving and sometimes wax. Waxing was so messy and irritating to my skin that I wanted to try something new.This product worked great for bikini-line and and underarms. Can be used 1-2 days after shaving (short hairs were less painful to remove for some reason). I got fewer ingrown hairs was happy with the ease of use and effectiveness. So far it has been easy to maintain--I touch up once a week. That way I never look hairy and since there is not much hair, it doesn't hurt at all.You would need a larger epilator to use on your legs, but this worked okay to pick up missed hairs from waxing, etc.It is much tinier than I expected--it would travel very well.I gave it 4 out of 5 because in some ways a larger epilator might be more practical and it uses batteries faster than I would like."},{"rating":"1","title":"OW!","review":"Received this item yesterday and I just tried it. I bought it specifically for my underarm hair. It's very thick and I was looking for an alternative to shaving as the black stubble is always still visible. I used it right after I showered thinking it would make the hair come out easier. That may be true but I'm telling you it hurts like crazy. The thing is loud and fast and reminded me of some sort of torture device. Although it hurt at first many reviews said that you get used to it. So I kept going. I didn't get used to it. You have to go over the same spots over and over and it takes a long time. I eventually had to give up. After the redness goes down and the bleeding stops I'll shave what I missed. I gave 2 stars because I do have some very nice clean patches...I may try it again with the hopes it get's easier but I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"travel size and easy to use!","review":"First time users will find any epilators painful so do expect that. On the other hand, the emoji epislim removes hairs very well and leaves the areas you've removed hair from smooth for a long time.

I tried on my bikini area and, on the top of the horrific pain, this thing pulls hair so hard that a blood is coming out of my skin along with the roots and tears from my eyes. Maybe I just have sensitive skin, but I never had such a problem while waxing.

Yes, I'm back to shaving or waxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It converted me to epilating","review":"I use this mainly for underarms. At first I had to get used to the angles at which it works. If you are a first time user, please be aware that it hurts, but over due time the pain lessens and you'd just feel a plucking sensation. I've been using this for a year now and I'm never going back to shaving. Since your hair grows at different rates, it takes about 3-4 times before you can go a week without epilating. Because the hair has to regrow from its roots, the tip of the hairs become finer and less noticeable unlike the regrowth after shaving. It only takes 2-3 minutes per underarm and I never have to worry about wearing sleeveless blouses if I had gone without shaving for a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Purchased on a whim & with curiousity.

Unfortunately, all the device does is make a lot of noise, but it didn't remove a single hair! No matter WHAT angle I held it at (the instructions say 90 degrees), the device buzzed along but just didn't grip. I am familiar with epliators and have an effective one for other body areas, but I wanted one for the face and finer hair. It wouldn't even remove the longer hairs from the back of my hand. This device was useless and I feel like I've been scammed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!!!","review":"I tried to use it for bikini area, and ouch!!! SOB... Maybe it works better on other area.

Why else would people start out saying things like, \\"It didn't hurt that much\\"?YES, IT DID.Before I put this anywhere near my tender skin, I looked around for a guinea p--I mean, my husband. I tried it out on his palm first and then the back of his hand. He didn't flinch. The man is a rock.If I had known better, I would have tried it out on my brother, the Marine. He would have jumped up and down for me. In fact, I may try it out on him later, just for fun.Anyway, picture this. Use a tweezer to pluck out one hair at a time from your forearm. Then do it again. Then do it again. Then do it again. Then do it again. Then do it again. Then do it again. Then do it again. Then do it again. Then do it again.Rinse and repeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"First of all, it misses a lot of tiny hairs. Second, it hurts!

First impression is it's LOUD and scary. Not something I want near me. Looks like a torture device! I decided to give it a shot anyways and not only did it not work very well (lots of breaking hairs rather than plucking them) but it feels like a torture device. I have waxed before and it doesn't hurt nearly as much as this thing. Not even close. Especially on my legs I'm not that sensitive to hair pulling pain, I have waxed and tweezed before and it wasn't an issue, but this thing made my eyes water. Never again. If you want to get rid of hair, try waxing. Much less painful than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tweeze is not Epi Slim","review":"When I ordered this \\"Epi Slim\\" for someone else the picture was different. The Tweeze is what she received.

The last few times I was able to use it, it was difficult to start up, and finally even with fresh batteries it no longer works. I really feel ripped off and just threw it in the trash... and I paid much less than these prices I'm seeing now -- yet it still was a ripoff at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"This product is horrible.

Read on for some tips on use and care.","review":"Exactly as advertised. Thank you! Small enough to take in my makeup bag. Not for use on large areas like legs (would take too long) but perfect for bikini line, tummy, toes, and underarms. Has been safe for me to use in sensitive areas, something I was concerned about. One thing to note- there is no place for the hair to go once its been removed, so I found it much cleaner to do in an area that could easily be cleaned up, like the bathroom. Also, I found that the hair lifted easier right after a shower, maybe b/c pores were opened. Lastly, I sprayed the 'blade' area with rubbing alcohol (just the tips of the 'blade', i don't mean soak the whole thing). I found that this killed bacteria that would make my skin sting after a use."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"This item is a piece of junk!

I purchased it for use in the bikini and under arm area. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to achieve results in the under arm area. I felt like I couldn't get the skin taught enough. I lacked the correct angle and needed more hands I think. As for the bikini area, it worked ok, but left me too irritated. I followed the instructions and exfoliated, but I was still left w/ some ingrown hairs. I had this problem before w/ waxing, so I think I am just not a good candidate for this kind of hair removal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture chamber","review":"I was so excited to finally receive my Emjo AP-9L Epi Slim hair remover, but OMG what a disappointment. I used it on my upper lip exactly how the instructions called for. Not only did it NOT remove the hair, but it ended up irritating my skin so bad that the next day I actually had little cuts which scabbed up over the following days. Not that that wasn't bad enough, then in one area I had a cold sore outbreak on my face. It was a cluster of 5 small cold sores which are still in the healing process! There should be a warning that if you are prone to cold sore outbreaks, this may happen! If I would have known that, I would never have pursued this product. If you are a cold sore sufferer, you know where I'm coming from! Needless to say, I returned this piece of garbage and would NEVER recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH...and a total breakout!","review":"Okay, I absolutely HATE this thing. I have PCOS and was hoping it would help with my unfortunate chin stubble. Not only does it HURT like a SOB and feels like I'm being sliced open by razor blades while I'm Epi-ing, but it left me with a HORRIBLE breakout. I took pics and will try to load. I have very dry skin so have never really had problems with acne - until I used this product. Partially my own fault though so please read and take heed - if you purchase and use this, be sure to put a COLD damp cloth on your face afterwards to close up all the pores that you just ripped hair follicles out of BEFORE you put on any lotion or makeup. I mistakenly used both after using this and all the gunk filled my pores and broke me out something wicked. I probably have 30+ pimples on my chin alone...all tiny ones and right next to each other so it looks like a huge strawberry on my chin. I do not like this product at all. I'll just keep shaving every other day... :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT for the face!","review":"I bought it for the face.

It took a couple of weeks for the scars to heal. That was probably my fault for using it right after a shower. I've never had any issues with it otherwise.It's not as powerful (of course, it's not as expensive!) as a Braun silk-epil that I sometimes use as well - that one grabs all the hair, ALL the time.

It was so gross and embarrassed. I'm not too sure what I did wrong.But what I did notice was that I had to go over the same area multiple times to get the majority of the hair out and never really did get it all. I think that causes the BUMP and CUT .I can't recommend this product because it seemed like it requires more power to get all of the hair cleanly and efficiently..

After the initial break in of 30 min of 2000RPM plus with moments of slight revving I finally let the engine return to normal idling and set the timing to 12*.

I figured in would last a few years and crack during the winter when struck by a shovel,however, not one of the units has ever moved, lifted or cracked in over 12 years of sevice, winter or summer. I am extremely pleased. When I wanted to extend the edging I could not find this product so I bought another product that uses plastic nails to hold it and they all lifted in 1 years time, a bad decision. I am so glad Amazon has these units back again. Nothing else works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Great! Easy to Install!","review":"This edging was a breeze to install. Pieces interlock making it even stronger and should stay in place. It does have a plastic look (up close) and feel but from a distance it looks great and keeps the mulch in the beds. You CAN create curves but have to be somewhat larger curves because the product is 12\\", just like any other non bending 12\\" edger. I put the borderstone type in my backyard but will be purchasing the red 'brick' look for my front yard replacing the outdated concrete stone edging.

If you can only purchase one gardening manual, this is the one to buy. It covers everything and because the methods are tried and true, you can feel confident following Ogdens' suggestions.

I found his step-by-step approach to be very well written and easy to duplicate. His previous books (The Cook's Garden for example) have been equally helpful.

This is the first word that came to my mind after finishing reading this screenplay. Now, everyone knows how good the movie is, but reading this takes it to a whole different level. Included in this screenplay is extra scenes not seen in the final cut of the movie, a scene-by-scene analysis of the film, storyboards of important sequences, character photos, and last but not least, 2 forewords - one by Stephen King and the other by Frank Darabont, both giving insightful comments on the making of the movie and the novella 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'.

If you really enjoyed the movie, and is fascinated by the art of filmaking, this book is for you.

The script is silly, the acting over the top, Dimitri Tiomkin's score unrelenting, yet...yet it does have a certain majesty and creates an atmosphere of early Egypt that is striking in its primitive starkness. Beautifully photographed and staged, this is a near miss but highly recommended to those who loved the great old spectacles from the Fifties.One complaint: It has been packaged a a \\"camp classic\\" with a lurid Joan Collins on the case cover.

Oh yes, and the sexy picture of Joan Collins on the cover. (She appears far less sexy in the film.) With a cast of thousands, Howard Hawks tried to recreate ancient Egypt, turning history into weak soap opera in the process. The crowd scenes are especially amusing; watch all 'dem Egyptians clap their hands in rhythm and make Nazi-like signs of allegiance to Jack Hawkins and his 1955 haircut. An absurd and boring film. And if you like this one, try The Egyptian.

I love the way that the denouement revolves around Jewish craftiness represented by James Robertson Justice. (He doesn't LOOK Jewish.)Enjoy! The scuttlebutt is that Joan and the actor who played her regicide, (or, more exactly, Pharoahcide), co-conspirator were having such vigorous amorous dalliances off-camera, and replenishing their energies with such gargantuan feasts, that they both become visibly fat and had to be put on diets."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The order is given!\\"","review":"It's here, it's gorgeous, it's beyond anything you ever imagined when you once-upon-a-time watched it on Million Dollar Movie.

The only thing I miss, is *more* of everything. More examples, more detail, more nasty examples of macros! (But don't get my wrong, the book is already quite substantial...) Thank you Paul Graham for an excellent introduction to Common Lisp, and for not making this book into an AI-textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and confusing","review":"This book is outdated and harder to understand than most programming books.

The author doesn't even acknowledge that comments exist in LISP."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is suitable for people who already know Lisp.","review":"Graham knows his Lisp, no question about it. But, like 90+ % of programming textbook writers he doesn't know the basics of paedogogy. Words are used long before their definitions. The concept of answers to questions isn't in the book. The proper way to write such a book is to deliver the material in the tiniest possible chunks and give review questions to make sure the reader really has mastered the point. There MUST be frequent quizzes with answers. An example of a book that does do this is Teach Yourself C by Schildt or Schildt's Teach Yourself C++ 3rd Edition. If you really need an INTRODUCTION to Lisp then in my opinion you should not buy this book. If you already know some Lisp Graham's book will be useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graham Understands Lisp","review":"Graham has a penetrating understanding of Lisp, so the text is lucid and easy to follow. Also, like Starr's report on Clinton, some of the best stuff is in the footnotes!The book is small and the topic large, so some coverage of things is a bit thin. So what -- the Hyperspec is free.The book is extremely practical, dealing with how to write programs and use the language. It is *extremely* handy to refer to while programming; this is not true of the Hyperspec. Hence this book is a must-have.Also strongly recommended (especially if you don't know why Lisp is so wonderful) is \\"On Lisp\\", by Paul Graham. He shows the completely unmatched power of Lisp.

I like to act out the animals for him when the piano says the animal name and also sing along with the songs.The piano says letters A-E, animal names for each of the keys, animal sounds, numbers 1-5 with corresponding tones, and songs.

Actually, now that she's old enough to understand the concept of a \\"button,\\" she keeps trying to push on the lights themselves, because they look more like buttons than the keys do.Also, the music's a little annoying.

We can maybe then switch it to the third mode, for something diffrent. All around its a great idea and the quality is good! Battery life seems to be good, its colorful and educational.

As I clean his room it gives him something to do while still hanging out with mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 month old little girl loves this toy","review":"(written by Mom)My 2 month old little girl loves this toy. She especially likes the play and learn mode on the number 2 setting. She can kick the image and it meows or barks etc... and plays a song and lights up wildly. She's been a kicker from day one and this is a perfect toy for a kicker. The only things I do not like is the volume - it is a little too loud. I put a cotton ball on the little speaker to muffle it. Also, on the number 1 setting for songs, it plays whether she kicks it or not. I wish it would only play if she kicked it. Other than that it is a GREAT toy and really keeps her attention and I highly recommend this for a young baby - there are not too many toys out there for such a young baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute Crib toy","review":"This toy is hooked to the base of my baby's crib. I think that it's a great crib toy, and buys me time in the morning, when the baby is up before I am. It just seems wierd to lay him down so close to the foot end of the crib. I like the fact that it's a linkadoo toy and is compatable with other linkadoo toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fun Fun","review":"The fact that our daughter could smack something and it responds with sounds and music just made her eyes open wide and she would laugh out loud! She loved it for a very long time and now our son will be able to enjoy it as well. Great idea and great for hand & eye coordination! Easy to clean as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for entertainment","review":"My daughter loved this! She didn't kick at the keys very much but she liked to listen to the music. As she got a little older, she would push the keys with her hands and had a blast!

The warning says that the toy must be removed from the crib when the child can sit up unassisted. Humm thats the age when they will have the most fun with it.... I think this was just one of those toys that eveyone jumped on the bandwagon on. My little girl seemed to wonder what what going on with this and why was she having to kick her legs, even when she did try she had to really kick supper hard to get the darn thing to even work. We had it all of one month and gave it to the Goodwill."},{"rating":"2","title":"helpful","review":"very helpful and well detailed book with good accomodation tips, although accomodation and attraction prices went up one year after publication significantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good guide","review":"I was traveling in Corsica summer 2001.

At the time of it's publication, INTERPOL denounced the text as a fake. In 2006, the author plead guilty to criminal impersonation in court. Fascinating that it's still the top listing in Amazon. If you're doing research on INTERPOL (as I was) leave this book out. The account of Bannon's confession is on the INTERPOL website: [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Validation","review":"David Bannon's book, Race Against Evil, is a validation of his decision to give up Interpol and seek a deeper bond with his family. He is one of those rare individuals who speaks to us always of responsibility, of the individual cultivation of an active and aware participation in life, be they those of raising a family, working for the good of oneself and one's neighbors, protecting innocents, redemption, loving. His straightforward search for a life connected to his daughter, for marriage as a sacrament and family life, for a peace with today that overcomes the horror of yesterday, affirms a style that is resonant with the authentic. For all his earthiness, Mr. Bannon is a sophisticated, philosophical writer whose prose shines with the wisdom of one who has thought deeply about the terror and wonder of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the investigation before the book","review":"This entire book, which is supposedly \\"non-fiction\\" is a fabrication by David Wayne Dilley.Before reading this book, one should read the following investigation, http://www.bullshido.net/forums/showthread.php?t=30325 , which outlines in great details the claims made by mister \\"Bannon\\". The article shows, with the exhaustive investigation and research of more than a dozen individuals, how all the claims made by mister Bannon are completely false and were merely created in order to write this book. Interpol has denied having any record of him working for them, and he has recently been indicted in Colorado for theft in relation to this book and seminars that he has taught concerning child pornography in Law Enforcement.The article is free to the public and the author does not have any monetary connection to the book or the investigation."},{"rating":"1","title":"does the author of this cartoon-like fantasy ever explain...","review":"...how it is is that he shares the name of a cartoon fantasy character from the 1960s tv show Johnny Quest?

I think this man's imagination is on a par of that other remarkably self-absorbed orientophile fantasist, Steven Seagal, albeit with a calculated dose of humility and phony soul-searching thrown in to \\"keep it real\\".

What a journey through the warren of tunnels and lies at Interpol. Def worth the read. The book inspired me to look up the net to follow up the story myself. There you can read the news reports that are summarized in the book and interviews with the men Bannon describes. Def worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and mysterious!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end and was gripped after a few pages! A lot of reviewers mention that the book is thrilling but they leave out the amazing detail and satisfying mystery of Bannon's writing. He lets us live the story with him, step by step. A surprising ending which nobody would suspect as well as a shocking twist. And there's no cheating. We experience it with Bannon and he leaves enough facts along the way that when real life takes it's bizarre turns, we slap our foreheads (probably as he did) and think, \\"Of course!\\" The book is packed wih entertainment and mystery making you want to stay up to finish it. Praise for this brave memoir!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Archangel unmasked.","review":"Astonishing, fascinating, these new revelations from Jacques Defferre and Race Bannon, drawn from the secret annals of the international police force, make Race Against Evil a sharp pleasure that pierces deeper than any other works on Interpol."},{"rating":"1","title":"FRAUD","review":"Readers should be aware that this author was convicted in NC this week on charges of impersonating a law officer. He has not done the things he wrote about in the book, and took the name \\"Race Bannon\\" from a cartoon charcter.It may be a gripping story... but it's all fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lively and involving work","review":"David Race Bannon's \\"Race Against Evil\\" captures the verve and mastery of exceptional true crime writing. It is a lively and involving work that has earned some of the best word of mouth--and every word of it is justified. As a penetrating character study it's nonpareil, with the dual \\"Race\\" of the title brilliantly realized.David Race Bannon is a missionary who gets caught up in smuggling, at which point he encounters the intrepid Jacques Defferre. He is recruited by Defferre into Interpol and taught to loathe terrorism and child pornography and all its offshoots--with lethal results. Bannon has transformed the espionage expose into something more than factual repetition and, if the author's own race against human sex traffic is sometimes foregrounded, he speaks from experience. This is still an author at his considerable best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody & Brilliant","review":"Right, how do I start? This is one of those books that lures you in like a french mouse trap. Then, following the same idea, captures you and keeps you in solitary for days. Once you've closed the cover and stowed it neatly away in you bookcase, ready to be read again the next week, you find that all the real-life characters remain engrained upon your subconscience, having conversations while you sleep. Jokes aside, it's a brilliant read and addictive. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author Arrested for Criminal Impersonation","review":"The author of this book made the whole thing up. He was arrested in 2006 for fabricating a background of experience in human trafficking and then attempting to charge consulting and speaking fees based on that experience. He pled guilty.All Interpol does is facilitate communication between police forces in different countries, it doesn't do any enforcement work of its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Real World versus Fantasyland","review":"Law enforcement offciers assigned to Interpol are chairborne warriors. They take paper from one side of the desk and move it to the other. They take papers from their desk and pass them on to other law enforcement officers, who MAY eventually atrrange for REAL law enforcement officers to do some REAL law enforcement work.The myth of an INTERPOL agent is about as real as that of a spy like James Bond."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misguided fantasy and absolute rubbish","review":"Mr. Bannon was recently arrested in Coloroda for impersonation. He was never affiliated with Interpol, a UN agency chartered to enhance international police cooperation. Interpol has no \\"agents,\\" only detailees from police agencies worldwide who do not activeley engage in investigations, but rather act as facilitators to assist in the issuance of international arrest warrants and pool worlwide police resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tour de force","review":"A work of deep humanity and insight, Race Against Evil is an extraordinary tour de force, though not for the faint-hearted. It is an important but deeply disturbing book that offers a terrifying, unflinching look at an organization of shame and glory: Interpol. Bannon's startlingly humble revelations are bold and chilling as they reveal a simple truth: men and women derive pleasure from officially sanctioned killing. The implications of Bannon's memoir are profound - we are forced to understand the intelligence officer as human rather than monster, victim and abuser. Intensely arresting and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duped the best","review":"Give Dilley aka Bannon the credit he deserves. He duped many. His name should stand next to that of Victor Lustig, the man who sold the Eiffel Tower - twice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent work","review":"This book is simply brilliant. It is truly deserving of the praise that it has been given. The story of David Race Bannon is a remarkable one. He is not a bigtime spy but rather a naive young man who got caught up with the wrong people in desperation. This book is one that all should read, especially students and travellers such as myself. Race, if you are reading this, your story has influenced far more people that one would ever believe. It has certainly changed my outlook on certain aspects of life. Truly magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute MUST read!","review":"Spectacular book! Incredibly insightful, well written and totally accessible. An amazing insight into Interpol and the minds of criminals. A book for both interested readers and the curious, I really recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This book concentrates a lot on Bannon's past training for Interpol, carrying on from early days. Essential readiong for all die hard crime fans, and recommended to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Race Against Evil","review":"I wish more people would bring this tragic occurance to light. As a mother and a youth leader, I had no idea how much of this was going on in the world. I knew about child abduction and child abuse and have tryed educating parents and teens about safety. I now bring up the Child sexual trade that happens. I feel good about making parents aware. Most don't have a clue and / or don't want to hear. I feel this is a very important issue and one that I will make time and effort to help combat.Thank you for writing such a compelling autobiography/memoir and sharing your knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human Trafficking Essential","review":"David Race Bannon fought human traffickers for his entire career with Interpol. His story is very personal. There is much pain here, and a bit of dark humor, but mostly it is honest. You feel Bannon's humanity. Many ex-law enforcement or ex-intelligence officer memoirs fall into two categories: sanitized bureaucratic anecdotes or ludicrous macho posturing. Bannon avoids both of these, and how well he does! The book is fast-paced, candid, and we get a true sense of Bannon's own failings and successes, the ache and valor of a very difficult job.This is the first book to read in understanding human trafficking, followed by three others available on Amazon: 'Illicit : How Smugglers, Traffickers and Copycats are Hijacking the Global Economy;' 'The Natashas : Inside the New Global Sex Trade;' and 'Woman, Child for Sale: The New Slave Trade in the 21st Century.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking","review":"It was difficult to tear myself away from this book. Even when I was at work, the author's humility and convictions stayed with me. I have seen the affects of child abuse and molestation in my career as an RN, but I've never read such a candid and real book about the personal sacrifices of the noble officers that investigate these cases. The book is chilling and sad, but at the same time so exciting that it was over too soon. The author offers hope through the most terrible conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud Lies and Bull","review":"It should interest readers to know, David \\"Race\\" Bannon is a fraud named David Wayne Dilley. Everything in the book was made up. In 2004, the Interpol General Secretariat issued the following statement about Bannon's book:\\"Interpol's General Secretariat in Lyon has no record of David Race Bannon having been employed and no knowledge of individuals mentioned in Mr Bannon's book. Interpol exists to facilitate the exchange of information between the world's law enforcement agencies and to provide analysis of criminal data and other services. Accordingly, the claims in Mr Bannon's book can only be seen as deceptive and irresponsible fantasy.The above disclaimer was distributed to US law enforcement agencies by the US National Central Bureau of Interpol and to other potentially interested parties by the General Secretariat.\\"He was indicted for and pled guilty to the charge of criminal impersonation.The book is dangerous fantasy and an insult to real victims of abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious hoax.","review":"I heard the author briefly interviewed on the radio when the book came out and thought he had an amazing story. When I got the book and started reading I soon realized it was only a story and he was a very bad fraud. Nearly all the claims were incredible and virtually every one seemed concocted to cover the author in cheap comic-book glory. I imagine it's easy enough to find out if he's fluent in Korean, but beyond that I don't believe one other claim he's made for himself. And now he's \\"Doctor\\" Bannon? Let me see the transcripts, otherwise I'd bet that's bull too. I'd believe the Gong Show guy was a CIA hitman before I'd believe this clown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Troubling, dark, compelling","review":"You might wonder how anyone could write publicly about such brutal murders. However, this memoir is an excellent explanation of why Bannon was compelled to delve further and further into his own history and attempt to tell about Interpol and child porno rings. He is refreshingly candid about his own failings, motives, and desires. Somehow he manages to maintain his very high standard of writing despite the upsetting material. I found the book gripping and throughly absorbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!","review":"What a horrible movie!!!

It's like she's not all there but when you listen to her music or watch her perform you see this brilliant woman who comes alive. My favorite is \\"Money Changes Everything\\" because that is such a great song with really powerful lyrics. And I love \\"Time After Time\\" very much, too. All of the other tracks on this CD are very enjoyable. On all of the songs, Cyndi is so incredibly eager and almost loud and overwhelming. Listening to this CD feels like entering a Coconuts store in 1987 (remember how they used to always have the music blasting?) Lately, I have been listening to Cyndi Lauper and many other classic 80's pop artists because popular music in the year 2008 sucks. With today's disposable singers and \\"artists\\" right this very second we are suffering through a cultural famine that has no end in sight. Cyndi Lauper offers nourishment in an otherwise dark, dry and evaporated existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goonies R Good Enough and Hole In My Heart not here, but...","review":"Well this compilation album is certainly a must-have for any Cyndi Lauper fan, and it's definitely a great place to start if you're a novice fan who wants to get a flavor of her music. While only one song from her highly overlooked A Night To Remember album is here, I suppose that can be forgiven. After all, this IS a collection of her most well-known songs.It would have been great if \\"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\\" had been included on this album, but you can find that song on the other greatest hits collections here at Amazon. Easy enough. And then there's \\"Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China).\\" Another classic song not included here. But it can be found as a bonus track on the Japanese version of A Night To Remember, as well as a 3\\" CD single (very rare but not impossible to obtain).You might also want to check out the VHS or DVD of \\"12 Deadly Cyns.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"what a bad joke","review":"she is a good singer now but no one cares.when she was on top her voice was horrible.girls just want to have fun was ok for the time and time after time is good.but what in the world was she thinking about doing what's going on? true colors is a good soft rock song.but aside from one album what has she really done to merit a greatest hits album? but then again cher had a number one song this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy-to-understand, extremely helpful book","review":"What a shame that this is out of print.

Curiously, however, others are omitted in favor of tales that, though quite good, simply don't seem to be part of the KIY cycle.

I saw a cheap HP Photosmart D5160, and considering that my previous Photosmart 7660 lasted me three years, I jumped on it. It was a false economy in terms of both the massive ink consumption and subpar quality. The blacks simply don't look right out of the standard cartridge- kind of a blueish middle gray, even when excluding the color cartridge. This isn't something you'll only see when printing B&W; photos- text looks kind of nasty too. Of course, HP would prefer that I purchase the Photo Black cartridge, which I'm sure would help.

I've had problems with it immediately, but I really can't complain much since it only cost me $40.00. Paper jams easily and when it does it's a huge pain to access the rollers and pull the paper out. The sensor is bad so if you ever open the cover and close it, the sensors will still say the cover is open.

Then Karl and Thelma Morris came into her life. Even with an overly organized father, and a mother caught up in her imaginary life of books and soap operas, Crystal's life finally begins to even out. I love how the plot unfolds and the story ends with a shocking conclusion. Though I have read better V.C. Andrews books, this one was well worth my time. I encourage teenagers and young adults to read it, as well as the other books in the V.C. Andrews Orpahn miniseries."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K.","review":"I did not like Crystal at all. I thought she was kind of snotty and had a big ego on her. The plot was good and stuff,but I did not like the character at all. I also didn't like how quickly it ended. up until the last few pages,Crystal finally said something about it finally feeling like a family. And then they go and die. I figured the author would go more into being a family for at least more then one paragraph. I think that way it would have been more sympathic if it would have gone into them feeling more like a family."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked the book, but I read it too fast!","review":"I really liked this book and I was very moved and toiched. The only thing is, I read it fast because I just could not put it down so now I'm stuck waiting for Brooke to come out and it seems to be taking forever!!! please have it come out soon!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm","review":"I thought this book was okay. It didn't exactly suck but I feel that if they made it longer it would have made a little more sense.

This book was wonderful compared to Butterfly, which was not as good. I think that they should have started the Orphans series with this book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Orphan","review":"Crystal is an intelligent girl, who is an orphan. She is adopted by a couple, Karl and Thelma Morris and quickly adapts to their lifestyle, even though her adoptive mother is living in a world of soap opera and romance novels. Crystal even has a boyfriend. But then, her chance for happiness is taken from her, and she is alone in the world again.This is the second book in the orphans series, and it's not very good. None of the books are, the writer uses poor metaphors, which try to be sophisticated, but fall flat. However, like Butterfly, some good scenes and good characters make up for all the shortcomings, and believe me, there are a lot. I read the Wildflowers series, also, but I didn't like those girls, the way I like the Orphans. They aren't as human, somehow. Try the series, at least once, and remember, VC Andrews is dead. This is just a ghost writer, and if you don't believe me, look at the small print in the front cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"Crystal was a good book, but not as good as Butterfly or Raven. I think that she wasn't adopted into a rich family made it more down to Earth. She struggles just like everyone else and overcomes some of the problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"Like Butterfly, Crystal is a interesting read in itself for a teenager audience, but is barely reminiscent of a true VCA book. When this first came back out way in 1999, I was a teenager and enjoyed this series (but not as much as I enjoyed the older ones, even the ones penned by Neiderman) Like Butterfly, Crystal is a orphan but with a different background and different talents. Her adoptive parents seem to be more normal than butterfly's adopted mom, but soon Crystal discovers that her adoptive mom has problems with perceiving reality. Still, life is pretty good, but Crystal's good luck can't last, and her parents die. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best book of the awful Orphans miniseries.","review":"The Orphans miniseries is easily the worst series written by Andrew Neiderman, writing under VC Andrews. I gave this book two stars for giving the heroine genuine brains rather than the usual \\"artistic talents\\" that VC Andrews heroines usually have (Practically all of VC Andrews Heroines are painters, singers, musicians or dancers-bearable the first time irritating when it occurs OVER AND OVER AGAIN) . I like how the heroine is shown to be rational and hardworking. It was also good to see that the guardians were nice-if flawed-people (as mostly guardians are portrayed as being Count Olaf in VC Andrews) . Everything else about the \\"Crystal\\" was trite, silly, badly written and I do not recommend reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystal has a new chance for a better life","review":"Intelligent Crystal has spent most of her life living in a not so nice orphanage. She watched others get adopted before her and tried to sever all ties off from people her age. But one day everything changes when she's adopted by two very nice people Thelma and Kurt. Kurt lives his life by a constant schedual and is very organized. Thelma lives her life through the soap operas she watches on TV and the Romance novels she reads. Crystal feels slighlty out of place in this world but finds a friend in the smart boy down the street, Bernie. But when one single act shatters all that she has. She finds herself back where she started.Like Raven and Butterfly, Crystal is a good read though a bit unrealistic. I'm looking foreward to read Brooke (the 3rd short book in the series) and Runaways (the full length novel staring all four girls.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good but could've been a little better.","review":"I have really enjoyed this one but I wish that Crystal could've had one last kiss with Bernie before she left.

At $12 for the whole series its a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flash from the Past","review":"I had watched a friend's copy of swasons 1 & 2, so when I could get this pretty inexpensively, I pounced. No problems at all with skipping/jumping/or anything, sound did tend to get loud or soft per DVD, but Oh Well...I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't have all the special features the individual seasons did. Season 1 had a SF regarding the color of his clothes. Don't remember details, though, that was 2-3 years ago. You'd think in a complete series collection they'd keep all the Features.Season 2 was intresting as he was a mentor to a Bounty Hunter wanna be, Oklahoma Boy Wright King. Then his character was dropped without a word. Too bad. Should've had some explanation.Season three's intro was different. I didn't care for his new hat, either.

But one good thing is the defective discs were not the same disc so I was able to watch the whole series.

As a great fan of Il Divo, I could hardly pass up anything remotely connected with them. I don't mean to bash the author, but I kept thinking throughout The Passionate Ones that it sounded like something I could have written when I was 10.Also included in this book are some pretty graphic sexual scenes. I was shocked-this book has already left my library. Yes, that's money down the drain (that, as a college student, I can't afford to do), but better that than a book that's not an edifying read in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Passionate Ones","review":"Being a fan of IL Divo and romances in general, I enjoyed reading this because it was so easy to picture Urs and Carlos as the main male characters.

And I have to confess, cynic that I am, I found myself with a lump in my throat by the final chapter. It probably won't lead me to seek out other novels about the trials of teenagers, but if I had to spend 300 pages with a couple of neurotic, troubled teenage girls, I'm glad it was *these* teenage girls, and I'm glad I had this author as my charming guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely loved this book","review":"There is great heart in this book, which I devoured pretty much in one sitting.

I could almost taste her. I also had the opportunity of seeing West Side Story on stage at the Moulon Rouge, soon-to-be-Aquaris Theater, with Chita Rivera. It was actually more exciting on stage. But the film does the play justice and captures much of the play's excitement. The score, by Leonard Bernstein, is by far his best. (On The Waterfront is right behind). Not to mention the lyrics. I love the opening, the overture, the lines on the giant screen that eventually become New York City.

So instead of noblemen, fighting because the whole humanity was constantly fighting that times, we have gangs of youngsters, fighting because they are just stupid.

Natalie wood plays Maria,(sung by the talented Marni Nixon) a beautiful and wise Puerto Rican girl. She falls in love with Tony,(played by Richard Beymer) the inactive member of her brother's rival gang. Trouble strikes when their secret romance is discovered. This movie shows the horrors violence can bring, and the tenderness of true love.

I've loved this movie since I was a kid.Recently I've seen this movie as a spiritual tug-of-war between Maria the peacemaker and Riff the warmonger, with Tony as their battleground. Within this story of gang warfare and star-crossed romance is a story of a sheltered young girl who learns to take her faith and love beyond the prayer closet and into the streets. Within the story Maria sends Tony, then Anita, to carry out her mission of peace, but Maria's mission has no chance until she's forced to carry it out herself--with great cost.Okay, enough philosophizing.

And as far as musicals-turned-movies go, this is one of the best examples of it. The choreography is amazing--and even though the idea of a dancing street gang is normally completely unbelieveable, we believe it in the musical setting.

The ending of the film is the most disappointing part; everything is left unresolved.

My first thought was \\"Oh, great, this is gonna be so stupid!\\" But after the first scene, it completely captured me. Natalie Wood was definitely the best choice for Maria. Her performance in \\"I Feel Pretty\\" is stunning. Richard Beymer's performance as Tony is truely heartbreaking, especially in his dying scene.The music is far better than any other musical movie. My favorite songs are \\"Maria\\", \\"Tonight\\", and \\"Somewhere\\". I was on the verge of bursting into tears in the last scene where Maria sings part of \\"Somewhere\\" as Tony dies in her arms.

But I soon grew tired of Shields' speculations about Austen's feelings, motivations, choices, etc. She spends a lot of time trying to tie Austen's novels and characters to events in Austen's own life and after a while, it just started to feel like amateur psychology --more like a HS or college paper on Jane Austen than a well-researched biography (especially since it seemed like Shields relied primarily on other biographies, as oppposed to digging around on her own.)I wouldn't recommend this one at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and Concise","review":"Jane Austen: A Life by Carol Shields is a brief yet comprehensive biography of Jane Austen's life. It is written in a simple and engaging style which few readers will find any difficulty in reading. Not unfamiliar with Jane Austen, I occasionally found myself in slight disagreement with some of the author's conclusions, but overall, I was surprised and pleased by the quantity of information presented in such a clear and concise manner. Carol Shields touches on the major events of Jane Austen's life and uses these events to shed a little light on each of Jane Austen's novels as well as her minor works and some of her juvenilia. I would recommend Jane Austen: A Life by Carol Shields to anyone looking for a non-intimidating introductory biography about Jane Austen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money if you are not using an alarm!!!","review":"Unless you are working with an alarm right now, or planning to in the very near future, don't bother with this book.

It's missing all the things that make the series enjoyable. It's as somber as \\"Memory,\\" but has none of the fun. There's little wise-cracking or sly and subversive social commentary. The plot isn't original or clever. The hero, Miles, doesn't even do anything clever or interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weakest of the series, but necessary as further setup","review":"I agree with the majority that this is the weakest of the Miles Vorkosigan series. However, a point I have not seen made before, I believe it is a necessary setup and bridge to whatever comes next (sort of the way Renegades of Pern was weak for McCaffrey but it covered a lot of necessary developments to set up the next book). Otherwise it was worth reading if you are a fan, but not for your first Bujold. The addict crowd is growing, though. When I bought two copies the first day (one for my son), the clerk said she had only put them out two hours earlier and now they were half gone. I finished it that night, which probably beats the fan who was proud of finishing it the next day. Even if this one was a little weak, I also wish Bujold could write as fast as I read. Having tried to write, I know it's not that easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read new addition to a growing Universe","review":"I read the first five chapters, and anticipated. I bought the book, and I devoured. There were so many wonderful bits, its hard to think of what to say without spoiling it for those who have not had the pleasure of reading it. Komarr manages to introduce new characters while referring back to old events for faithful readers. An excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a crime, but a blunder","review":"Lois Mcmaster Bujold is incapable of writing a truly bad book; her characterizations are too brilliant, her plots too involved, complete, and subtle. But Komarr is a blunder. It blunders not in its specifics (although it is one of Lois's weakest books) but in its direction: it takes the Miles Vorkosigan series from high adventure to low soap opera. Miles does not shine with his usual energy; his love interest is tepid and suggestive of a bad bounce from the formidable Elli Quinn; in this regard the catalog of Miles' lovers presented in the book takes on an air of self-parody. Overall, Lois seems tired and distracted in this attempt to redirect the series (much as she did in Memory, a good novella transparently padded into a feeble novel). Let us hope she either rediscovers her energy and her bearings, or lets the series go to a dignified rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great space opera","review":"Bujold's Vorkosigan series is just fun. It has noble lords, noble ladies, deepening mysteries, heroism, treachery, just a little romance, all bolted together by wildly improbable coincidences. The story starts at a walking pace, but works its way up to a full gallop by the end. The bad guys get theirs, the good guys get theirs, and just enough is left hanging to make the reader eager for a sequel.The writing is strong. It pulls the reader in early, and stays string to the end. This book doesn't have quite the frenetic pace or humor of some earlier books in this series. Still, it has plenty of excitement and good entertainment. Maybe it's not grand literature, but it never meant to be. It's a good read, and there's nothing wrong with that.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"Miles Finds a Woman, or maybe visa versa","review":"Miles has been sworn in as an Auditor and is on his first Case, on the planet his father conquerred: Komarr. This leads to some fun. I really can't say more without saying too much. Good book, read it even if you haven't seen previous Vorkosigan books, though it is always a Good Thing to understand What Has Gone Before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another delightful read for Lois","review":"I still find Miles one of the most delightful characters in science fiction.

There are some stupid things in the movie like the machine being able to helpothers see memories and dreams, and the locust swarms. The one thing that made the orginal exorcist so scary is that we thought Regan was posse by the devil, in this it says she was possed by a servant which really drops the magnificance of the orignial movie.

Linda Blair's scenes are unusually sensitive and the musical score by Ennio Morricone (who gave us The Untouchables and The Mission) is one of the high points. Both Richard Burton and James Earl Jones are wasted, but they attempt to lend some dignity to the overall nonsense. Approach it with an open mind as a sort of \\"prequel\\" and appreciate it for the back story it provides regarding Father Merrin and his earlier battle with the demon Pazzuzu; both of which are mentioned in the original novel.

Nobody's heart appeared to be in this, from the cast down to the lackeys. Blair is as ridiculous and unbelievable as she was convincing and compelling in The Exorcist. And I can only assume Burton was paid a HELL of a lot of money to lend his name to this garbage, or that the casting director had something on him.This movie is laughably bad.

The writing is bad, the acting is pretty non-existent, and the dialogue is horrendous. A previous reviewer claims that Exorcist 3 had nothing to do with the first. WRONG. Exorcist 2 was an attempt to cash in on the huge success of the first film. It is a waste of a great cast, a lot of money, and the audience's time. Exorcist 3, however, brings the return of William Peter Blatty who wrote the novel and the screenplay for the first film. Exorcist 3 incorporates many scenes from the novel (which were not used in the first film), along with the storyline from Legion, (another novel by Blatty). Anyway, I digress. In closing, this movie plain old sucks. I do recommend buying the complete Anthology set. You get both versions of the first film, 2, 3, and both versions of 4.

The African scenes, the locusts, etc. The performances of the actors are good, including the great Richard Burton.Unfortunately, the film dumps the Christian- theological themes of the original and instead delves into a netherworld of bizarre occultism. The Catholic priest is a weak wimp, needing Shamanistic witch doctor solutions.The film's conclusion just feels silly, not scary at all.But all in all, it deserves 2 stars for it's unique atmosphere and cinematography.Jeff Messenger, author of \\"The Shroud of Torrington.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Exorcist II: The Heretic","review":"Linda Blair reprises her role as Regan MacNeil, who this time is staying with her former nanny, Sharon, in New York, and is seeing Dr. Jean Tuskin, the owner of a hospital for gifted children.

Linda Blair is in it, so that's good, but it still is a tank...the film mainly deals with how Regan got possessed in the first film (my favorite movie ever), but it doesn't really make sense, becuase at the end of The Exorcist, Chris tells Father Dyer: \\"She doesn't remember any of it\\", (referring to the possession) but in this film, it's as if Regan remembers everything! All said, I consider The Exorcist 2 to be a spin-off rather than a sequel. A sequel to The Exorcist is completely unnecessary, first off because there is nothing more to be said - the story's over.

Richard Burton OVERacts and Louise Fletcher UNDERacts. It's clear that director John Boorman was more interested in the technical aspects of the film, such as the special effects, and therefore left the actors to their own devices. Ellen Burstyn wisely chose to skip this movie, and the Exorcist III actually ignores this film, picking up from the first one. This movie simply isn't scary, but the actors react as if they're in a thriller, which makes the movie slightly comical.

As of now, I have not seen it in 7 years, and I'm having an aching desire to watch it again just to bask in its incompetence. Anything with a screenplay this asinine, direction this lacking, performances from reliable actors this poor, and a music score by one of the greatest composers this ridiculous, will leave you unsure whether to laugh or cry.

However, there's so much going on that it still manages to entertain for some reason. I also like the part where Linda waves her hand around in the air like she's holding a lasso to kill some grasshoppers (locusts!).

As I was watching this it was hard to come to grips with how far askew a sequel could be. This movie seems little more than a reason to rehash the first movie and it seems the protaginists are simply 'looking for trouble.' Just about the only bright spots in this is the rather gritty, realistic areas that must have been filmed on location, seeing Regan again (not necessarily hearing her), and seeing Louise Fletcher (see Regan). The dialogue here is simply not any good, but the worst part is the story. I'm sorry... WAS there a point to this movie? No, I mean beyond the financial aspect. Didn't think so.

Even more than that The Exorcist had a great plot, fantastic direction and great acting. It goes above and beyond the typical horror movie.So why an Exorcist II? I'm still trying to answer that myself. It's really not that bad of a movie it's just that it's a definite let down from the original. You won't be satisfied with this film.

It's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unleash the demon in you!","review":"Regan MacNeil is back to fight the demon Pazuzu in this thriller sequel to the scariest film ever made, The Exorcist. Although \\"The Heretic\\" does not have any spiderwalks or blood in it, it still is pretty good. However, this film was unnecessary. The Exorcist had a pretty good ending, however, did not leave you feeling scared and astonished like in \\"The Others\\", \\"Hannibal\\" or \\"Sixth Sense\\". John Boorman (director of \\"Deliverance\\") brings us the story of what happens to Regan after her possession. However, it leads us through many African trips and wild dreams. After purchasing \\"The Exorcist: Version You've Never Seen\\" and \\"Exorcist III\\" on DVD, I just had to get this. But at the time, it was only on video. So I have the 1999 video release version. But, since Videos and VCRs will eventually become obsolite, all VHS tapes must be converted to DVD. I have never seen the alternate ending to this movie but I hope that if you get this DVD, it is really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil Made Them Do It","review":"(...) This is one of the all time worst horror films ever put on film. It is so god awful from beginning to end. I can only assume that Richard Burton needed the work. Bad. Very, very bad.

Linda Blair had blossomed from a little girl into a drop dead gorgeous woman(would get more attractive in later years) and she returns as Regan and this time is trying to stop Pazuzu(the demon that was un ID'd in the first film).

Done so different, yet so \\"in the spirit\\" (so to speak) of the original. And yet it picks up the story where the first one ended, and manages to convince and scare. What a movie!I guess, of course, one could say the same about \\"The Heretic\\" -because you really can't believe it before you see it. And it's all negative, nothing about this movie works!

Yet, after all these years all I can really praise aout this film is the score by Ennio Morricone (The Good, The Bad & The Ugly (Expanded),The Thing: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack). The score is magnificent, full of all the suspense and terror that the rest of this film is sorely lacking. Performances range from barely serviceable (Linda Blair) to outright hammy (Richard Burton). John Boorman was obviously striving to make an intellectual film, but the script is such a mess that any meaning the director hoped to convey is lost. I hate to say it, but this film is a ridiculous mess. One would be much better served watching the underratedThe Exorcist III. Now that film, despite problematic studio tampering, is a worthy follow-up to William Friedkin's masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Sequel....","review":"The Exorcist, the greatest horror film of all history, cannot be compared to this garbage. Exorcist 3 is more of a reputable sequel than this stupidity. James Earl Jones can screw-up even the best of films, but this didn't start as a 'best of films'. It's a bad movie from the get-go. Poor Linda Blair was straining to recapture what she had started in the original classic. Advice of this reviewer: Skip this and get Exorcist 3 if you already have the original Exorcist. If you don't, start with the classic Exorcist. It is the 'gold standard' of horror films, bringing religion, Satan, GOD, horror and actuality all in tune with a great story that is based on a true situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake special effects, boring, and dated","review":"This movie isn't scary at all.

Needless to say, there were no long lines in New York City in 1977 for this film and my wife and I were able to just walk in and sit down during a lightly attended showing.Every beautifully spoken word by Richard Burton sounded ridiculous and actually made the audience laugh. This film had some very decent cast members who just couldn't pull off the job of delivering the bad script. The only cast members who did not sound ridiculous were Max Von Sydow and James Earl Jones. While the speaking voice of Richard Burton is as magnificent as those of James Earl Jones and Max Von Sydow, his lines were just too much for us to suspend the necessary degree of disbelief and his narrative was the bad luck of the draw."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awful Sequel!!!","review":"Seriously, the first one was awesome, then they say it wasn't the devil in the original, but was some demon named Pazuzu.

The second part of this book is the STORY and, for me, in order to have the nose candy safely delivered, drug dealers would try any innovative transportation means, anything is possible.

It was neither. If anything, it was a weak attempt at the latter. Carcaterra, like so many others, thinks that writing hardboiled fiction is easy - just write about some big guys with guns and villians that perform unspeakable evils. You don't need a tight plot, just action, baby! Wrong. Good hardboiled fiction has flavor, substance, and mood. J.L. Burke writes such poetic narrative, I can smell New Orleans as I read. J. Ellroy's narrative echoes the yellow journalism of the 40's and 50's, and transports me to that time.

Apaches has some potential, but Carcaterra is too sloppy or simply stopped caring after a while to take advantage of a couple of good ideas. Unfortunately, most of the good ideas get cancelled out by some rather ludicrous ones. Most of the main characters are just plain shallow, and they are often hard to distinguish, filled with stereotypes. While reading this novel I kept thinking that it felt like Carcaterra wrote it expressly to be turned into a film, namely with some big stars and lots of gunshots. The ending belongs in a Rambo film, and even the idea of setting it in the early 80's loses any relevence after a while.

The plot was intense and emotional. Once you start reading you can't put it down. I felt like I knew Boomer and his disabled friends, and loved them all the more for their unselfish and heroic deeds.

She tried it before and ran out of it, so she requested another bottle for Christmas. I found a great deal here on Amazon- $36.00 ( including everything) for a 3.3 oz. bottle. I love the design of the bottle too. The perfume smells very feminine and sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and long lasting","review":"I just got this perfume for Valentine's Day. I love it! Yes, it is sweet smelling, as another reviewer mentions, but it's a pleasant sweetness. Cotton candy does describe it, actually. But who says grownups don't like smelling yummy?? There's a hint of vanilla as well and overall, I think the combo is fantastic!I love Curious, and now I love Fantasy, too! They are two very different perfumes, so it's easy to understand why a person can like one and not the other. I will say, though, that Fantasy lasts far longer than Curious. You can apply it in the morning and still smell it when you go to sleep! Which, I don't mind at all...I recommend this, of course, but I recommend you sample it before you buy. Just because you liked Curious doesn't mean you will like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"exelente compra y me la mandaron hasta ecuador... muy buena la tienda muy seria.. el perfume muy bueno .. personas serias"},{"rating":"1","title":"the bottle is nice. the perfume, not so great.","review":"I first smelled this perfume on a strip in a magazine. I fell in love with both the bottle, and the scent instantaneously. I decided when I had some extra cash I would buy it or hopefully drop enough hints to get it for Christmas. Christmas came and went and no Fantasy, instead I recieved Celine Dion's fragrance. I liked the smell of the Dion but was still sad that I didn't get what I wanted. I decided to buy the fantasy for myself. Upon finding it at a makeup counter I became rather thankful I got the other. I think Fantasy smells a lot like this cotton candy spray I had in elementary school. mmmm to smell like a 4th grader again. The bottle is elegant, but the scent is juvenile. It'd be appropriate for preteens, but not grown women, then again, should I be surprised? I suppose the scent caters well to Spears' followers, 12 year olds."},{"rating":"2","title":"ulio","review":"excelente, era el producto que se quería tal cual como lo indica el producto 100% recomendable muy bueno cumplen y a tiempo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I am such a huge fan of Curious! and was by far, looking forward to Fantasy. But after having went to a local Sephora, I was highly displeased!! One, it was far too sweet, and secondly, it smelt quite bad. It started off smelling like Mangos, but then turned into an awful stench. Kind of like cotton candy gone bad (if that's even possible); except nothing near perfect to that delicious candy. I had actually planned on buying this perfume even before testing it, for I was so pleased with Curious. Thank god I didn't!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like rancid candy!!!","review":"I sampled this fragrance at my local store and took a wiff out of morbid curiosity. This stuff smells AWFUL. It smells as if you have been sweating while covered in cotton candy. Or maybe it smells like sweaty people chewing bubble gum while smoking in the trailer park. AVOID at all costs!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this scent!!","review":"I absolutely love this perfume! It's very romantic and seductive. It's not \\"stuffy\\" at all, very soft and sweet.

Get ready for your Fantasy to unfold","review":"I'm Britney's #1 fan, a guy, and not gay. But I still bought Fantasy and Curious because I get everything she puts out. This really is VERY sexy smelling and I plan on buying it for my girlfriend someday. It smells like a forest, then cupcakes, musk, and is extremely sexy. Girls: buy this and your boyfriends will love you. I was in a lunch line and I smelled the girl next to me wearing it's distinct scent. I was drawn to her. Get my drift? It works! Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What IS IT about this perfume???? EVERYONE asks what I'm wearing!!","review":"This perfume is almost embarrassing. I love the smell, because it smells sweet like marshmellows (that's what my 10 year old says when I spray it \\"Yummy, burned marshmellow!!\\". It smells so good that EVERYONE asks \\"what perfume are you wearing you smell so good?\\" then I have to say \\"Fantasy\\" & hope they don't ask who makes it. I'm 37 years old & it's a tad embarrassing to say \\"Britney Spears\\" lol IDK why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"Great price on this perfume and it came pretty quickly but I can't help but notice that this one is not as strong as the one I bought in Macy's and it didn't stay on my skin as long as the store bought one either. If you don't mind applying throughout the day it is fine but there is something about it different than previous ones I purchased through the store but for the price it is definitely worth it.

The fragance is dull vanilla."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly what I would expect from Britney Spears","review":"Fantasy is all vanilla on me. Granted, it's a creamy, sweet vanilla frosting that's has decent longevity & isn't sickly, almost like buttercream ... but sweeter, creamer, wetter. Still, Fantasy is vanilla frosting, from top to bottom. Weird because vanilla isn't even a listed note. Apparently my body chemistry just loves vanilla or this scent triggers vanilla frosting in my brain. Don't know.Some have said that Fantasy is similar to Escada Magnetism. On that we agree. However, I think Escada Magnetism is much better. Magnetism is an oriental vanilla for a sexy woman, whereas Fantasy is sweet vanilla for a coy girl.Based on reviews and on basenotes, I was expecting something less infantile & more mature from Fantasy. However, This is one of those celebrity fragrances that fit the personality to a T. For that, it is very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its pretty good!!","review":"and it lasts! unlike some perfumes, it lasts for hours (ideal for teens to wear to school!!). The only problem is that its a little to sweet and gives me a stomach ache sometimes.

Each example has several variations and each shrine has an easy to understand material list. The instructions were even easy enough for a man to follow. LOL!If you love collage, you'll love this book. It's a wonderful way to take collaging a step further to a 3 dimensional, inexpensive medium that can become a collector's item or family heirloom.I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad instructions","review":"The book has 7 shrine projects. The instructions repeatedly send you back to the beginning of the book to repeat steps. The dimensions are different so you have to adapt. Pretty much a pain. Also, the dimensions given in shrine 6 are flat out wrong. Tried to find an addendum on the author's or publisher's website but none given. Cool photos of some finished shrines but be prepared for extra work trying to figure things out for yourself from the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another deceptive Christian missionary work","review":"By cherry-picking some stories, the author has done a great favor to the western and Christian readers. We need to ask ourselves when we are going to stop dishonest portrayal of Muslim societies. I can also list all the ills in the Western society and blame it on Christianity like rape, teenage pregnancy, high rate of divorce, infidelity, adultery, AIDS and other STDs, promiscuity, birth out of wedlock, domestic abuse etc. Caner brothers have become the frontmen for Christian missionary style lies, deceptions and distortions.The freedom of women in the western world has nothing to with Christianity. The progress and enlightenment in the Western world evolved from anti-religious secular ideas. Democracy, freedom, and liberty all originated from non-Christian thoughts which are certainly not un-Christian or un-Islamic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating account of what really goes on in Islam","review":"This book was easy to read and very informative. Particularly useful for women who are in a position to reach out to Muslim women and assist them find relief from the tragic ordeal they face under the oppresion of Islam. Muslim culture clearly prohibit any non muslim man from approaching muslim women , so it befalls on non-muslim women to make the approach. Very good book and highly recommended for those who would like to help out those unfortunate veiled muslim women find their way to freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unashamed and Full of Compassion","review":"It is interesting to read reviews that have aparrently not read the text but race to measure its merit. I wonder, has the above Canadian educator taken just one step into the middle east?I have found this work to be compassionate and full of Christian love for Muslim women. If you wish to understand the plight of Muslim women and thier lack of human rights do a study for yourself and start with this text. It is unashamed of its Christian worldview but accurate and, especially in the case of chapter 2 by Ms. Naser, quite poignant. Read it and judge for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well intentioned, poorly written","review":"Dr. Caner has set out on a noble cause to present a view of the Islamic world through the eyes of women, but he fails at effectively reporting on this. Specifically, the case studies used are rather vague and not only that, but built largely on assumptions. The actual narratives from the women are ignored in the analysis, where superflous information is added in order to give the womens testimonies whatever bent Caner intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus is my huggie-bear?","review":"The case stories are really interesting, but none of the Christian women telling the stories in this anthology knows enough about their own faith to make the book really captivating. It is not enough to say things like \\"Jesus loves me and He wants to love you too!\\" This does not work in the real world, and is probably also why Moslems in general have a hard time taking the popularized and Westernized version of Christianity seriously. To argue against Islam from an emotionalistic point of view and to do the \\"Jesus loves you\\" chant is to portray Christianity in a distorted way. And it is not convincing to portray God as a spiritual huggie-bear. On the contrary, Christianity is reality, it is the Truth - a Person. We need comparative publications done by people who not only care for mission - which is something this book does emphasise - but who also know Christian Theology, and is able to investigate the issues of Islam a little deeper than this book does."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mind of a Liberal","review":"For some reason, I was reminded of the Goetz case recently and picked up this book.

For those whose sexual morals are down the tubes you will love the main character Pigeon Kara and may even want to sleep with her. For those with conservative sexual morals they are repulsed by her. All and all this book is about a slut and her daily sexcapades in a small town, which will either make you love or hate Kara. There is no in-between. See where you stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well I loved this book!","review":"I was not sure what to think at first, but after reading this book I was shocked at her exotic and slutty behavior. I mean Kara stopped at nothing to get her sex. I like the way the author tells the story in seperate short stories [sagas]. Because you can read one saga and jump around to another one and still know what's going on. As for Kara the only thing that I can respect her for is that she is consistant with her slutty ways. If you haven't read this book, then it is a must read because I have never read a book which kept me laughing out loud from begininng to end. What a dumb girl Kara is LOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do iUniverse and Amazon.com cooperate with this spammer?","review":"The book is low-quality porn, but that isn't even the biggest problem with it. The real issue is that the author insists on spamming various non-commercial message boards to promote his book with ads that aren't even relevant to the message boards. He reposts these unwanted ads repeatedly, despite complaints, and even after administrators remove them. He is truly an incorrigible abuser of the Internet with no regard for others and no conception of the inappropriateness of inserting commercial messages where they do not belong. It's a free country and the author certainly has a constitutional right to write garbage like this book. He has no constitutional right to spam readers of other sites to get them to buy it. Amazon.com should be free not to carry books by authors who promote them through abuse and deceit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful.","review":"This is without doubt the single most facile and awful book it has ever been my misfortune to read. Its literary style is that of a dysfunctional four-year-old with learning difficulties. The paper-thin vapid plot is as empty as the excruciating dialog between the characters. It is actually physically painful to read much more than the first few hundred words. If you do preserver and complete this monstrosity you may agree with me that the old theory, that if you put an infinite number of monkeys in a room with an infinite number of typewriters they would eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare, has some truth to it.

I read the entire Karrine Steffans book and I actually enjoyed it, because even if the stories were exzagerated at least I knew the people were actually real characters. Pigeon Saga is completely fiction. The characters are stereotypical, and I don't even think they exist. I've seen picture of the girl who the stories is suppose to be about, and that the only good thing I can say; At least the girl is hot, but this is not a magazine, it a book.I read the whole book expecting it to get better, but it didn't. it was just a long and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I didn't even buy this book.

It seems to be slapped together without a real plot - a series of unexciting events with huge gaps, almost as if the author lost interest too. I loved the books in the series which portrayed Hornblower as a young, clever junior officer. In \\"Commodore\\", he shows little of the \\"McGuyver-like\\" ability to get out of a tight spot that I always enjoyed most. In fact, as a senior officer, HH doesn't even take part in most of the exciting parts of the book, but oversees them from his God-like perch above the battlefield or even worse, he hears the information second-hand from the mast head.

I found the \\"set up\\" quite simple to perform-- boil water, drop in the guard, wait 30 seconds, rinse, insert, and let it form around your teeth. I tried it a few times (without reboiling water) to try to get as tight a fit as I could, and I was able to get a fit that would stay in place with ease. After 3 nights of use, I have had no issues with it coming loose. It does, however, feel a bit bulky in my mouth. Perhaps they are all like this, at least, those that are less expensive and sold over the counter. But, it is big enough that it basically forces my mouth to remain slightly open. I can purse my lips with some effort, but during the night when everything relaxes, they do not remain closed. Consequently, my lips seem to dry out a bit. Chapstick will be the beneficiary..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely thick","review":"I was really surprised at how thick both of these guards were. It would be impossible for me to sleep with either one in, and honestly I would be afraid they would cause more jaw damage than not using them at all.

I am a 5'11', 150 lb. man that wears size medium, so not bigger than average.One guard was too bulky to be comfortable.

I stopped wearing it because I was afraid it would move my teeth and I had slight pain in my teeth in the morning.I got a custom one from a dentist in Tijuana, Mexico for $100. It is excellent. ( My 83 year old mom got $2,500 worth of work done for $650.) Much like the whitening trays I got from my dentist a few years ago. Very thin and flexible.

I finally bought theguard from the dentist, and it is great. Thedentist took molds of my teeth, determined thespacing between upper and lower teeth, and grindeddown the guard to make sure that all my lower teethhit it at the same time when I bit down.

After three weeks, I filed a complaint with PayPal, and the seller claimed he had not received the order or any e-mails. I guess he thought the PayPal payment was a gift to him.

Won't buy it again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big/Too small","review":"I've worn mouthguards for a long time. I've had custom made high dollar items from a dentist and I've used cheap sport guards as well.This unit comes with 2 guards and neither of them fit me very well. The large size is gigantic and the small one is, well, small.I may reboil and try refitting but I don't think that will help. The molding seam on the mouth guard can feel sharp on the tongue and should probably be trimmed off.It's better than grinding my teeth but the soft squishy feel of it actually seems to make me chomp more at night.I'll wear it for now until I can get back to the Dentist for a custom fit guard."},{"rating":"1","title":"way huge...","review":"Maybe it's because i've never gotten one fitted at the doc's, but this seems enormous to me? I don't have a small mouth i don't think, but this sticks out of my mouth like i'm going for a gorilla costume. incredibly uncomfortable, and i started drooling within a min of having it in...nevermind trying to sleep in it!so for those who never had one fitted at the doc's before and have no clue what to expect, know that this is pretty big even using the one that's meant for smaller mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy if you like waking up several times at night.","review":"The mouthpiece is way to big. I went as far as using regular scissors like said in the instructions. Waking up several times at night because of discomfort is not for me. I originally bought this because there were some good reviews. Now you've heard it from the horse's mouth (no pun intended). Also, the 100% money back is flawed. It's Amazon's return policy which notes that the product must be \\"unopened\\". This isn't possible if you use the product for a couple weeks to test the \\"comfort\\" and then want to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Fit","review":"My dentist said I should get a night mouth guard as I probably clench my teeth while sleeping. I tried this mouth guard and it did not fit. It was huge even though I used the smaller size! I followed the directions (boil and bite) to get the right fit. However, the rubbery plastic that goes across the front teeth made my upper lip stick way out! And the whole thing kept falling out of my mouth. Then I tried the SleepRight Night Guard and that didn't work either, even when I adjusted it to different sizes. And that one made my lower lip stick way out. I showed both to my dentist and she saw how both were a very poor fit. She took an impression for a custom-made mouth guard and it came in 2 days. And as my insurance didn't cover this ($286) she only charged me $99. The custom-made mouth guard fits perfectly and I was able to sleep with it. It's best to have a custom mouth guard made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Upper lip sticks out; lips don't close","review":"Being a procrastinator, I took 3 months to finally go through the motions of reading the directions, boiling the water, and trying to fit the small guard in my mouth. I look truly ridiculous with this in my mouth. As others have mentioned, the front part is very thick and pushes upper lip out, so my lips don't close when the guard is in my mouth. I have nothing to compare this to, but I feel that this guard is sooo thick that it's going to mess up my teeth an give me an overbite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protected Teeth","review":"I purchased this for my husband when he started to grind his teeth like crazy in his sleep. Compared to other similar products, this one is the best. I love that it comes with two to ensure the best/most comfortable fit. I'll also note that it was very easy to fit to his mouth.Another nice feature is that the red case stands out on the nightstand, which is a good reminder before bed that it needs to be put in. It does take awhile to get used to wearing the guard if you haven't worn one before, but that is probably the case with all night guards. There is still some tooth/jaw soreness in the morning, but it's great knowing that his teeth are still protected. There are no more horrid grinding sounds coming from his mouth anymore. The only reason for four stars instead of five is the price. However, this was worth buying, even if it is a tad more expensive than other night guards out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I have gone through a few night guards. Mainly I have gotten them for the dentist for a couple hundred dollars--good, but very expensive. I have tried the do it yourself ones too--too bulky to use. But this one is great, especially if you are willing to put in a little extra time and effort to trim and adjust with hot water or sheers.Very happy. Plan to get another one for travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Don't waste your money. This product is nothing more than a simple mouth guard that you can get at any sporting goods store for $10 of less.Very bulky feel in the mouth. I struggled through 4 restless nights of sleep before I finally gave up on it. In the instructions it says that it may take 2 weeks to get used to the product, but I feel that is a little unreasonable. I am not convinced that I would be any happier with the product after two weeks of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"was hopeful...","review":"I followed the instructions carefully, but even using the smaller size I had to reheat the mouthpiece twice trying to get it to fit my mouth. Each time it was way too thick and off center. When I tried wearing it at night, the next a.m. I would find it laying somewhere in my bedding or near my pillow. I finally just gave up. I feel that I just threw away the money down the drain. Could someone offer me a solution, please? Thank you.

The large was too big and the small was too small (WAY too small). When I wear it at night, I can feel my teeth shift, and it's uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and Effective Night Guard","review":"I had a $300 custom night guard from my dentist which was hard plastic and not very comfortable due to saliva collecting in the guard behind my front teeth. I tried this inexpensive guard and was able to use the smaller size which is effective even though it doesn't cover all the way to the back teeth. Still it is snug and effective in keeping my teeth apart and it is soft and comfortable. Try this and try the smaller size first. I thought it may be too small for me but I was wrong and the smaller size is definitely more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once again let down by good Amazon reviews","review":"This comes with two different sizes. One that's too big and one that's too small. If you happen to get a good fit consider yourself lucky. The big one I tried to trim down as much as possible but it was still way too bulky. The small one doesn't extend far enough back to cover my teeth. One thing you should be weary of is that these are so bulky that the material will extend far past your teeth onto your gums. This will cause your gums to recede over time. It also doesn't extend up into the roof of your mouth very well which results in a thick plastic edge which your tongue will use to push it out. Trimming the material didn't make much difference since it's basically too thick to wear. I guess everyone else had better luck than me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DENTAL HYGEINCE PREFERRED MOUTH GUARD","review":"Bought this guard and another guard that cost only around 5 bucks and the 5 buck guard was much better than this one that I paid over $20 bucks for. I followed the instructions on the boiling to get the proper fit but the guard did not take the correct shape and ended up like a big mess of stuck together plastic. Tried to heat and shape again but it was like working with hot plastic. This guard is in the trash and I am using the less costly guard which works great. The other guard is called The Grind Guard and is also sold on amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable, pushes out your lips","review":"You would be better off spending the money to get a custom one fitted by your dentist. It will be a lot more comfortable and won't have all the excess plastic like this one does. It pushes out your lips and is not comfortable. I guess it's better than nothing but it's worth the $150-$200. to get a custom one from your dentist, especially if your dental insurance will cover it. Even if not, I would still perfer a custom one over this product.The custom one from my dentist is like night and day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit","review":"This dental gaurd is the perfect fit. Much much better than the athletic mouth gaurd I was using. When I opened the package & saw the small clear dental gaurd, I thought there was no way that thing is even going to fit in my mouth. After heating & fitting the larger gaurd I thought I would give the smaller one a try as long as I already had the water heated. Well that little one is a perfect fit, I don't even really notice it in my mouth. The biggest problem with my old gaurd was I hardly wore it because it felt like I had a hockey puck in my mouth. This new one I have worn every night, it's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dental Hygiene Complete Night Guard Kit","review":"This is a great product. I did not want to spend another $400 for a night guard from my dentist so I tried this. It's just as good or better. You can shape it to your teeth and mouth and trim it down to size. I have an average sized mouth and I used the smaller guard. Another reviewer mentioned sucking the water out of the guard when sizing it and that helped me shape the guard better. I hope you'll give this a try, for the money the quality is excellent.Update -- it's now one year later and I'm still using this guard. The price has gone up, I think I paid $12 for it in January of 2008 but it's working fine. Am going to order another one since I'm starting to wear through the current one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dentist wants $220 for the same thing","review":"Why pay your dentist a couple hundred bucks when you can do this on your own at home?Have been grinding teeth a bit due to financial times, this will help for sure"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value!","review":"Yeah right, I'm no sucker and I'd never pay hundreds of dollars for a mouth guard. This one is very comfortable and I highly recommend it. I'm actually on my second one because the first one got wore out from my crazy grinding.

It comes with two and I still have the second one saved in a plastic bag for future use. It has definitely seen better days, but it continues to prevent me from grinding my teeth. Sure, some nights if I'm super-restless it'll come out, but in general it does a great job. The one thing I'm curious about is why they made it from two separate pieces of plastic (at least the version I got in 2006). It seems like they're just destined to separate, especially given that the whole purpose is to stop my teeth from grinding each other by taking the bullet itself. So the top layer is pretty much worn away by now, but as I said, the thing still does its job. If I ever need another one, I'm definitely gonna order this one again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I had a bite guard from my dentist which I ground down to pieces. They are pretty pricey to replace (around $300) so I figured I should try a more economical replacement...a complete waste of my money.

If you are a serious teeth grinder, save your money and go to your dentist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I had another that was perfect but my dog got to it and thus had to find a replacement. (I know... enter joke here. :) ) This one works fine, but the thickness keeps my lips open and not the most beautiful if you are not sleeping by yourself.

I tried molding both of the plastics to conform to my mouth with the retainer in it, and they don't work. I tried it again without the retainer, and it seemed fine. A big cumbersome either way, but I suppose someone could get used to that. But in any case, if I have to choose between my retainer and a night guard, then I clearly have a problem.

I must say that like all beautiful things there comes a time when they need to be protected from further use and possible destruction. I believe that time has come for Ms. Streisand. The over dubbing and voice overs are tedious and not her style. It points out weakness and does nothing to strengthen her work.I think now would be an excellent time for Barbra to explore her character acting gifts. Golda would be an excellent role for her to tackle for example...leave the singing behind as painful as that would be for all of us...a new world of true acting is still before her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary, dull, dreadful!","review":"This one should have been titled \\"Lower Ground\\".

Well, this is now. This album is lifeless, void of interesting melodies, and unimaginative. Some songs are so forgettable and unforgivable for a great artist like Streisand.

Over produced (as all her albums are of late) and with a collection of material that runs from the sublime to the silly (the Celine Dion duet comes to mind) and is heavily weighted towards the unmemorable, the only thing it inspired me to do was to get out the earlier, simpler, more exciting albums. As one critic said of this album, if you're going to sing inspirational music, at least sound inspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found the c.d. quite frankly boring!","review":"This is one of the worst c.d.s I have ever reviewed. We appeciate Barbra's new-found spirituality, but it just doesn't come across in the delivery. She sounds tired and straining in most of the songs and the background choir over-powers her voice. The one saving grace is the collaboration with Celine Dion, with Dion's enormous popularity putting the album on the charts.Be it known that Barbra's decision to include the song \\"Tell Him\\" was based on potential sales of the Celine Dion name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ole Babs is over the hill now","review":"Babs, its time to retire and let Celine take over the reigns, She already has anyway.

What do you expect?","review":"As a student of music, and particularly of the female voice, I own a wide range of music that I study, simply to understand the appeal of various styles and sounds. This is one that was recommended, and I bought it (cheap & used, thank God) to study.Personally, Barbara's voice drives me up the wall. Her forced, unnatural vibrato that is produced in the back of her throat, her melodramatic emphasis of every stinking line, and her miserable attempt at Sinatra-esque phrasing (hesitating a moment before coming in on the phrase). She has some of the most predictable phrasing and ornaments ever known to womankind.I actually love several of these songs, including \\"On Holy Ground\\", and I am annoyed that she tried to recreate this track. Barbara, only the \\"alternative\\" lifestyles like you! And those who like fake, contrived emotions.YUCK! She only avoided a \\"1\\" because she has somehow managed to make a name for herself, and that deserves some credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...not one of my favorites.","review":"I'm sorry, and no offense to \\"that voice,\\" but Barbra Streisand is not one of my favorite singers.

There are no popular tunes here, nothing worth noting, and the entire album is completely forgettable like yesterday's rag sheets. The song Higher Ground, is especially offensive to atheists and other intelligent and rational people, who are smart enough not to believe its mystically-oriented, subjectivist, presumptuous mediocrity. One line in the song goes \\"we are standing on holy ground...\\" Oh really? It's a shame that an artist of Barbra's caliber should sing such nonsense.

Repeated listening, however, has moved me in the other direction and it is quickly becoming a favorite disk for the CD player. \\"Higher Ground\\" (the title track) is lovely and sweet, as is \\"On Holy Ground,\\" which belts into some fantastic gospel-style work. Streisand displays her facile vocal talent throughout, but is particularly fine on these two numbers. The 9th, 10th, and 11th tracks (\\"Leading with Your Heart,\\" \\"Lessons to Be Learned,\\" and \\"Everything Must Change\\") are fantastic and could be played as a medley of loving lessons, although the final piece is a little depressing (to a point) -- mostly this is due to the \\"minor\\" tonality of it. \\"Avinu Malkeinu\\" makes me hope to see more Hebraic music on future albums. It is beautifully sung and fantastically performed by chorus and orchestra. A very fitting finale to this highly spiritual album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I grew up learning of YANK","review":"There is not much more I can add because so much has already been covered in the current reviews.

Well worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Return of Lord Harold!","review":"Barron turns in another fine mystery with a good imitation of the Austen style and voice. I especially enjoyed this installment because I had recently seen a discussion of \\"lover's eyes\\" on Antiques Roadshow and knew a fair amount about them. Barron's use of the theatre set in this book is also quite entertaining. I do think that some of the elements of Barron's mystery writing could be sharper and more cunningly crafted, but the fine characters and the excellent handling of nineteenth-century English culture keep the novel interesting from start to finish. Of course, the return of Lord Harold Trowbridge is the highlight of the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but NOT Jane Austen","review":"I agree with Ms. Hurdle that the books are not up to the Austen standard in terms of irony.

Quite simply put, this book is about some hippy-type on a spiritual quest, and not a study into the ancients listed in the book's title.If you've seen the Simpsons episode where Homer attends the local chilli-cook-off, then ends up having to search out his soul mate, you'll already have a pretty good idea about the contents of this book. I jest not!However, if you spend time on the other side of one of Huxley's doors, you may just get through the book without experiencing the nausea associated with the realisation that you've just wasted a portion of your hard earned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Inspiration Music","review":"A tremendous and inspiring collection of songs. YOU RAISE ME UP is the best version of the song and sure to inspire and lift anyone to live stronger. THROUGH IT ALL teaches one how to depend of the highest power and to depend on His Word. BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD ABOVe reminds us of the perfect grace. Wonderful combination of words, male and female vocals and outstanding music."},{"rating":"2","title":"cd purchase","review":"very happy with the whole process, cd was new in pkg and came very quickly with no problems"},{"rating":"2","title":"Selah, Hiding Place","review":"This is a very uplifting CD with the best rendition of You Life Me Up of any I've ever heard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest CD.","review":"I think this is one of the best CDs around and the best CD that Selah has put out. It it a truly anointed CD. It is very inspirational and moving. If you need something truly anointed, this is the CD to get. There are few other comparisons out there in the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Selah Rocks","review":"I have been to 3 Selah concerts and I have every cd they have produced. I am never disappointed with their ministry of music, I have been blessed by their dedication to their missionary roots and every song they sing has their own special interpretation that has brought new awareness of \\"old\\" christian songs. Hiding Place has some awesome worship songs and it calls to the heart of our struggles as christians to be closer to God and to listen to His voice. I love their version of You Lift Me Up because you feel that this is from your heart to God's. My very favorite is Bless you name the words are so beautiful and so true. I recommend this cd to anyone who wants to experience what it feels like to speak to God through all the stress and frustration of life and know that He is with us through it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and God-centered","review":"I am 18 years old and a devout christian. I lead youth worship at my church, and this is not the kind of cd you would think a contemporary worship leader would like. But Selah's awesome voices, smooth harmonies, and most of all, their passion for God make this CD incredible. I have loved all of their efforts. My favorite on this CD is \\"All of Me\\", it just sums up everything we need to do...surrender everything to Jesus. I don't care too much for the African-themed songs, but everyone has their own thing! I would recommend to people of all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is a blessing","review":"I truly love this album. It is a blessing to hear old songs performed in new ways and the original songs sound great too. The ministry Selah has had is anointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-Off","review":"I absolutely hate this CD. Mainly because they tryed to redo \\"You Raise Me Up\\" just because Josh Groban had a huge success with the song they think they can too. They're such a disgrace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Worship/Uplifting Songs","review":"I love the whole CD. The worship is very upbeat and the messages are powerful. Whenever I listen to songs #1 and #2 I cry just to think of how powerful and merciful God is. Song #3 makes me realize how much strenght and power we can find in God...even in our darkest moments. Selah Rocks!!! and God is Awesome!!!:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Power of God","review":"The first time I heard Selah was on the radio, with \\"You Raise Me Up.\\" I thought, WOW, that was so powerful. It moved my spirit like nothing has since \\"I Can Only Imagine.\\" Then, when I heard the whole album, I thought this has got the most Awesome Power of God all over it. Selah is great, and I can't wait until their next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Primer on Leadership","review":"I bought this book from Amazon, my favorite cyberspace mall! Alex Lee gives a good accounting on what it takes to accomplish objectives despite obstacles that are inherent in the command and control structure of the military organization. It's been that way since Caesar took on the Senate and lost. As Lee describes it, he and the 3rd Force Recon prevailed through the hardship and agony of a jungle war by carrying on the tradition of \\"The Old Breed.\\" This should be one of the books for junior officers to read to inspire them on what it takes to adapt and overcome. Solid historical record of one period of time in I Corps with the 3rd Force Recon, United States Marine Corps. Semper Fi."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CRITICAL REVIEW OF A MARINE RECON COMPANY","review":"A WELL WRITTEN BOOK. PROVIDES GREAT INSIGHT AS TO THE PROBLEMS OF COMMAND WITH A HIGHLY SPECIALIZED MARINE UNIT. LEE SERVED WITH MAJOR DOC NORTON, WHO HAS WRITTEN FOUR BOOKS ON SIMILAR SUBJECTS. THEY ARE BOTH FINE WRITTERS. A GOOD HISTORY FOR VIETNAM READERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Percussion as it should be","review":"This is a truly inspired album. Leon Parker, unlike many of his contemporaries, does not buy into the Dennis Chambers school of drumming (aka showing off). Parker, on the set, is a minimalist in that he has stripped his set to the bare essentials. On top of that, his actual playing on the set is drumming as it should be - he lays down a funky riff to support some fantastic side musicians. On top of this, Parker explores different modes of expression through percussion, such as his body and voice. The CD contains inspired playing by Parker and all musicians, but also contains amazing ensemble work. I highly reccommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Percussion To Another Level","review":"Leon has an interesting approach to the use of percussion, especially African based percussion, to produce some original and very tasty music.On Celebration and Caravan his percussive explorations are, to say the least, mesmerizing. David Sanchez fits, hand in glove, to complement the theme on Caravan.Paper Moon is done in a calypso, a la Sonny Rollins, with Jacky Terrasson introducing the opening solo followed by Joshua Redmans distinctive and rich statements.This is definitely someone to listen to repeatedly to hear the direction hell be going."},{"rating":"2","title":"plastic started cracking","review":"These were really good for a few months but after about a year the plastic fake leather got all cracked and they started completely falling apart. We live in the desert so the dry air may have caused this to occur quicker than it might in other climates. They looked great for a while but just didn't last as long as I thought they should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiff, with a plastic odor","review":"Very disappointed with this item. The product was made of a stiff plastic, and it had an unpleasant plastic odor. Not what I wanted for making my seat-belt more comfortable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and Incorrect","review":"I puchased this book, in addition to many other telecom books and found this to be one of the worst ones. Not only is the information useless it is written in a diffucult to understand fashion. I recommend that you do not waste corporate money of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grade A Content, C for Delivery","review":"I'm new to telecom and bought this book to get up to speed. I must say first and foremost that I am getting up to speed.But right after that I have to say that I can't read more than 10 pages in a row without finding a glaring error. For example, the term \\"jitter\\" is defined twice in two pages. Why? Plenty of typos, some of the illustrations look like the postscript monster ate them, and the 1,000 pages could easily be condensed to 500-600 by getting rid of redundancy.For example, the difference between analog amplifiers and digital repeaters is defined around 5 times in the first 300 pages (with more or less the same illustration at least two of those times). So, yeah, I get the concept now and couldn't forget it if I wanted to, but I didn't need to be told so many times.All that said, if I would recommend this book to anyone new to telecom, but advise them to be gentle critics or keep their red pens handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding reference work","review":"This technical reference guide is an excellent tool for those data communications folks who have progressed to a level requiring a more intimate understanding of voice and classical telecommunication world. It also helps bridge the chasm for Telco engineers being forced into the Data world. Well written, easily understood examples, and thorough in its treatment of each subject category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, full of redundant silly and unrealistic examples!!","review":"This was simply a waste of 65.0 plus tax. The book is so boring that I could not even read materials I was so eager to know about. In trying to explain concepts, the authors resort to one of the most boring approaches I have ever encountered. Is there a way to get my money back ?!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs editing","review":"Good dry military history. Crowl is as readable as any in the US Army history series.However, this looks like it was auto scanned and some of the double column original pages have gotten mixed into one page, with all the short sentences jumbled.Luckily the original scanned pages are included so you can figure out what is written.In short, writing good, this kindle version scanned with errors. Please spend 15 minutes to proof and correct! I did cost money."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only others had Kevin's courage...","review":"I must admit that my review is a little biased because have I known the author for more than 12 years and he has some nice things to say about me in the book. Nonetheless, his inspirational message rings true.Kevin's story is about how one man can make a difference. Whether he was working with gang members during his days as an El Cajon police officer or helping victimized consumers as the director of Special Investigations Agency, Kevin has stood alone to make a difference in the lives of the people around him.After reading this book, you too will be inspired to make a difference in your community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Beanie Baby","review":"My niece loves my 4 dogs, and tends to think they're actually her dogs. So when she visits she's always sad to leave my dogs behind. I thought for her birthday I would get her 4 little Beanie Babies that look like each of my 4 pups. All arrived quickly, and all look precisely like the pics. I have a long hair chihuahua, and none of the chihuahua beanies looked like her. So I opted for Poofie. She really is Poofie!! She's so fluffy you can't see her eyes! But she is a very very cute Beanie. All 4 beanies I purchased are the quality you'd expect with Ty, and the ear tags were in perfect condition (though I'll remove them since my niece will be playing with these). And they are small enough for my neice to hold in her hand and take to bed. Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MD recommended!","review":"Green tea is an antioxident recommended by my MD, so I have 2 cups every day. It's a great soother just before bed. The other flavors are good too, but PEACH Green Tea is my favorite. There are many brands to choose from -- Bigelow is individually foil wrapped -- I can take it with me and it's always fresh and flavorful. Not every grocery carries every flavor, so I order on line through Amazon to make certain I never run out. How smart of me . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont know why i read this since i hated the first one so much","review":"I dont understand....whos the daughter of the shaman? I read the whole book and there is no shaman with a daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute shoe, hard to wear","review":"This shoe is great in theory but it's nearly impossible for me to wear. I can't seem to balance my weight on the teensy heel and my toes go poking through the little straps. As I have previously stated, the ankle straps make this shoe a lot more wearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but too long and pointy","review":"They looked cute on the web, great heel and strap, but the front of the shoe is too long and pointy. The straps at the front show the toes with about an inch in front of them left of shoe. So they look too big even though the size of the shoe was correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to look for a used one","review":"I bought a new Brother cassette daisy wheel number 411 Brougham.

The performance is fantastic and helps keep the word processing machine as if you bought it yesterday.
