Like Alien, the bugs have infiltrated.I watched Starship Troopers 2 only once; Starship Troopers half a dozen times.Good performances:Brenda Strong as Sgt. Dede Rake is a real D.I.J.P.

The writers, production crew and even some of the actors should be sent to Abu Ghraib prison! The plot had potential but never realized it fully. I could spend hours listing the many faults of this movie but here are just a few: (1). The psychics are always having flashbacks that make them appear so melodramatic that you wonder why the Federation even let them live; (2). The respect for the chain of command was lacking in this futuristic society run by the military; (3). Brenda Strong, the female captain of the Rodger Young in ST #1, plays an insubordinate seargent in ST #2; and, (4). It mimicked the first film's propaganda alerts so poorly that you're disappointed within the first 5 minutes.Save your money... that's a couple of hours of my life that I won't be getting back."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN ABOMINATION TO THE STARSHIP TROOPER NAME","review":"Other than the super hot nude blond chick, this movie is below made-for-scifi channel trash. if the movie couldnt even come close to the original (one of the most entertaining action movies ever made), why was it even made?? who ever wrote this movie has seen \\"Aliens\\" about 5000 times, every cliche has been ripped from that movie. finish it off with a cast of tired has-been tv actors, and you have a complete pile of sewage. oh yeah, the machine gun fire effect is a flashlight flashing on and off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Bottom line...No cool new bugs, just tiny ones that live in humans.

This sequel has absolutely sod-all to do with the original. When I read \\"Starship Troopers\\" in the title, I expected at least a certain amount of the action to be set in/on/around a starship. I loved the corny \\"go get 'em\\" action of the first movie. What percent of this movie was set in/on/around a starship?! ZERO! It began with NO character building, and went immediately into a claustrophobic dust storm, and moved straight into your typical generic \\"kill off the marines one-by-one in an industrial-military building\\". This movie was yet another uninspired \\"bugs in the cerebro-cortex\\" Aliens-style ripoff, and could have been set on a ship, in a mine shaft, a space craft, or in a submarine. BO-HO-HO-RING! And I'm feeling very ripped off there was no space action at ALL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Comments","review":"This is one of my favorites movies, resolution is very good, and quality of product is excellent (Zero Damage).The bad point is that in Amazon.com there's not info of languages for this item, so I'm from El Salvador and it doesn't have Spanish Subtitles.In overview this was a great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a very good movie","review":"The effects look great.

What was once a nice little sci fi story with a fun plot, is now just a god awful \\"horror film\\" in StarShip Troopers 2.Yes, it's a god awful \\"horror film\\". One hour into the movie I was really thinking of shutting it off......... because it was so horrible. I waited to the end, just to see if it was some joke, or if they was something really diffrent in the end........ but it was'nt... that was the actual story line behind it.Too bad to, because I enjoyed the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blast it!","review":"I just finish watching it and I am very disapointed! If we give the first movie a 5 then this is at most a 2. I would have thought that given how good the first movie was that they would stick with what worked. This movie just uses the bug conflict as a background to a 'B+' rated script."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film stinks","review":"To say that this film stinks is the highest form of charity that it deserves. The hideous script combined with the utterly artless cinematography and totally gratuitous sexual and violent content make this film an absolute bore to watch. It would best be viewed by those under heavy sedation or from behind the protection of a concrete bunker. This film is not appropriate for children, and everyone else should approach it with the lowest possible expectations.The film cannot seem to decide if it's going to be an action adventure or psychological murder mystery. The characters are largely one dimensional and not developed. With two notable exceptions the acting is poor. The special effects are not bad and a noble attempt is made to keep the film somewhat within the lines established by Heinlein's book and the first film, but these alone cannot recommend this picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Since","review":"Most people did not like the sequal to Starship Troopers but i think it really makes sense, i mean, the bugs fight on the frontlines but that leaves no room for sabitage or spies therefore a new type of bug had to be invented. The story would get boring with nothing but mindless bugs working for a few movement deficiant bugs and the humans having advanced technology . sure the first one rocked but wouldnet they try to creat spies it only makes since and besides the writter of the first also wrote this pone there for its officialy tied in to the upcoming third film. I also like the new guns. weapons change after years of war and advanced therefore projectile weapones give way to energy rifles of more caliber.

I enjoyed the humor of ST 1, and there's only a nod in that direction here - so lame, it only serves to draw attention to its absence.Also, this turns into a slasher flick - a systematic knock-off of each of the characters and an exploration of how gruesome the special effects can be. Now, I'm not necessarily against this, though I don't really care for slasher flicks, other than to say that it becomes super BO-RING! And I do mean boringThere's not even really a \\"B\\" movie quality here that provides something memorable. Nope - nothing redeeming here.

A renegade human who is on charges for murdering his former commander, saves the day.Good special effects and photography. Poor acting, and even poorer story line.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fiasco","review":"A BIG disappointment. This ultra-low budget, direct-to-video sequel to Paul Verhoeven's classic sci-fi action satire is inferior in just about every way possible. A lousy script (surprising, because it was penned by Ed Neumaier, the same guy who penned the original, as well as co-authored yet another razor-sharp Verhoeven classic, \\"Robocop\\"), terrible effects and cinematography and sluggish direction sink this one from the get-go. Most of the proceedings (especially the action scenes) are filmed in near-total darkness (probably to mask the cheapjack special effects), making it a real headache to watch. Not even some gratuitous nudity from the luscious Kelly Carlson (\\"Nip/Tuck\\") makes this worth the effort. Stick with the first one and don't waste your time here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the original Starship Trooper flick","review":"Yuk. Over-the-top gore, gratuitous nudity, Verhoeven-flavored Leftist politics, typical Hollywierd corruption.

This is a true mainstream novel that happens to be about lesbians. Wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-researched, but falls flat","review":"This is an important story which needs to be heard, which means it also deserves to be written well. Unfortunately, Beyond the Pale is over written, and the main romance unsatisfying. In the last half of the book, the frequent point of view shifts are distracting-- the hodge-podge seams of the book show through. Although the author captures Yiddish inflections in the dialogue very well, the dialogue itself is often unnatural, reading like a summary of political arguments in a classroom, rather than revealing innuendos of character and mood. The character of Gutke the midwife is the most interesting aspect of the book, but too little a part of it to be a reason to recommend it. I became quickly impatient with its sentimentality and wooden politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read !!!!","review":"Wow, what a great book. The story is quite captivating. It was interesting to me how the main character's lives ended up inter-twining. Not only was the story interesting but it gave you a peek at the atrocities that went on in Russia in the late 1800's and in America in the early 1900's. It makes you think, well it made me think, how far we have come as a nation and how far we have yet to go. I think the author focused not only on lesbian relationships but also on women as a whole. The relationships between Mothers and daughters, between Fathers and daughters, the relationships between women in general and the lot in life that women seem to perpetually get, each of these things added up to make the book as interesting and as appealing as it was. I cannot recomend this book enough. Whether you are a lesbian or not or whether you are Jewish or not, if you are a woman - this book is a MUST read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than bad","review":"Although you may be tempted to pick this up as a gag gift for a \\"Millionaire\\" or Regis fan, don't!

Nothing else like it.","review":"Both these artists have done excellent work elsewhere and both have had great respect for each other. This is their only collaboration, and it is a high point for both of them. Coltraine is relaxed, mellow and intellegently restrained in his phrasing. Where he is not restrained is in the depth of the emotion he puts into his playing. Nowhere is he more romantic and soulful than here. The same can be said for Hartman. His phraing is so subtle and his tone is so smooth that it is impossible not to fall in love with his sound. Mccoy Tyner backs them up on the piano with an equal amount of skill and intellegence. It is seldom that artists of this stature meet, and it is even more seldom that they work together so well. This is not a Coltraine CD or a Hartman CD or a Tyner CD. It is just a great CD, one that has no peer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable early sound film","review":"This movie dates from the sometimes rocky transition period between pure silents and the talkies, when studios still were not sure of themselves. Thus, it has an enjoyable period musical score (comprised largely of popular songs of the day) and racing car sound effects, but is still \\"silent\\", with dialogue presented on the usual intertitles. It is most enjoyable, and showcases the comedic and dramatic talents of William Haines, one of my favorite actors from this era (and extremely popular in his day). Some others of his movies to watch out for (until recently very obscure, but also released by Warner Archives) are \\"West Point\\" (a pure silent) and \\"Navy Blues\\" (an early all-talkie, and not nearly as creaky as some of these could be, in large part because of Billy Haines's wonderful acting). One thing, though: these are all much cheaper when purchased directly from WB Archives website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a better fact checker","review":"While randomly reading sections of this book for about 30 minutes, I found several quotes and song lyrics which just weren't correct (e.g. lyrics for \\"We're An American Band\\".)

My daughter loved how when she layed in the bag, SHE looked like she was wearing Snow White's dress! Although there is a \\"Pillow\\" Padding at the top, she found it was uncomfortable as Snow White's Bow is 3-Dimensional and was right in her cheek as she slept. She preferred to use her own bed pillow on top. It is my opinion that this is great for girls Ages 4-5. Older girls may find it smaller in size. The measurements are 37 1/2\\" inside the sleeping bag, 49 1/2\\" from the top of the pillow to the bottom of the bag.

I thought if there is no one else on that beach that something is wrong and it was time to leave, but oh no they stayed and argued and this is what made it even more scarier, now they are separate and arguing and strange things are happening on this beach, nature is not what it seems and is very angry and starts killing any living being.

The director needs to spell it out more clearly for idiots like me, because this one doesn't make a lick of sense.There was plenty of tension in the movie to keep you interested in what was going to happen but ultimatly it goes nowhere.

Having difficulty getting an expert to repair my system, I decided to try using an inexpensive manual sprinkler instead. This Melnor 300 looked like a good choice.The Melnor 300 Oscillating Sprinkler\\" works perfectly for my back yard. It is designed to cover up to 70' by 45' which is bigger than the yard. I can cover the entire space using only three fourth of my usual water pressure. I can simply set in the middle of the yard, turn the hose to about medium high pressure and water the space in one setting.I like the \\"Melnor 300\\" it solves my watering problem and saves me the cost of repair of my sprinkler system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as you'd expect it to","review":"It's a simple sprinkler, not too much to say here, it works just as I expected.A couple things I didn't consider:1 - you can probably find cheaper ones in actual stores like Target and Walmart2 - the coverage area is a lot greater than I needed, had I known I would have researched this more and gone with something smaller"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissatisfied","review":"Difficult to adjust.

But it's a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performance and Long lasting","review":"I have owned one for 15+ years and have found this unit to be excellent. Better than competitive products I have used over previous 15 years. The brass nozzles are what makes this product so great, despite its plastic body (to keep it price sensitive). However, A couple of cautionary notes:1. The nozzles do get clogged with dirt. I cleaned mine annually in the spring with an ordinary pin2. Except for the watering arm and nozzles, it IS of plastic. So yo gotta treat this with care. Do not drag this with the watering hose as it puts pressure on the hose fitting. The hose fitting is \\"glued on\\" to the direction control mechanism, as I found out. My sprinkler FINALLY got caught while I was dragging it (being lazy) and a couple of tugs on the hose broke it.I am replacing the broken unit with another one (Unfortuntaely the price has gone up, but I'd rather deal with a reliable product)Good luck!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last one season","review":"These are very poorly constructed.

Covers a lot of area. Bad Qualities: 1. Gets stuck on one side often 2. Nozzle gets clogged. 3. Found it difficult to put hose in place. 4.

Personal Difficulties: I had carried by the sprinkler and did not grab the hose to move it and the plastic nozzle part snapped so easily. Very Cheap in my opinion. Overall did not like this product had more bad and difficult problems then good. Would not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"went through two. got to treat it delicate","review":"The point where the hose connects to the device snapped twice.

An implacable malcontent has stolen the highly-classified plans for a Super Stealth fighter from the skunk works in Groom Lake, Nevada and has delivered them into the evil hands of The People's Republic Of China. In a desperate attempt to prevent an all-out war with Taiwan, Maxwell's mission is to defuse an imminent holocaust by slipping behind the enemy lines with a beautiful Chinese defector to search, seize and destroy. A bit far-fetched, perhaps, but nonetheless a well-told story by a master of intrigue. I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to Gandt's next episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Versions of the book ?","review":"Agree with some of the derogatory comments.... stereotypical character development and implausible scenarios (am not too keen on this new stealth \\"functionality\\").

It was worth the wait. This is the third in the series of Brick Maxwell novels, and it just gets better! Each new adventure takes on another layer of complexity and character.

If this saw is not found on construction sites, it certainly isn't because it lacks the power. The laser has turned out to be a much bigger help than I thought it would because, since it projects well out onto the stock, it shows the slightest tendency of your hand to turn the saw. Since this can be corrected early, the cuts are straighter and the saw runs with less friction on the sides of the kerf, thus more blade speed and less chance of kickback generally. The general weight and balance of this saw, in addition the the locations and configuration of the grips, are excellent. It is a pleasure to use it. I can't imagine why I would pay more for a saw when this is available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Circular saw","review":"I used this Black & Decker circular saw for four days.

At first I thought it had gotten loose and fell off. When I picked it up I realized that it had actually broken off, the other half was still in the saw. Of course the saw was useless at this point.

Anyway, when I saw this double DVD I was thrilled; just think, Ms. Bullock reprising her character. So, I ordered it. Well, the original was great, typical Bullock, fun plot, and I enjoy it very much. However, #2 was not so great. The plot was predictable, slow-going and, in general, boring. Ms. Bullock, however, did the best she could with what she was given. I applaud her efforts. If you're a Bullock fan, she won't disappoint you so this double DVD is worth having just to confirm that Ms. Bullock's talent can rise above a lousy script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Congeniality","review":"I love Sandra Bullock and this movie is very funny.

One shirt I actually washed--it was ruined anyway--and the stuff flaked off in the washer. Same thing happens to HP transfers, according to the reviews.

I'm quite glad that I used a bedsheet to test this product out on, instead of my yellow t-shirts!!!Not all of the lettering did not stick, and had white in between the letters. It would be a pain to cut around each letter if I were to make the 14 t-shirts for my Relay for Life team, and even then, there would be no guarantee that all of the letters would stick.Unfortunately, I will have to use fabric paint to make my t-shirts.

Well, I ended up printing on the wrong side and when I placed my iron down on the transfer paper, I started to smell burning. It was the glue side! So that iron is completely ruined (has burnt glue crusted on it.)Advice: print on the white ridged side. NOT the smooth blue side! (I am no transfer pro so it was not clear to me. It really wasn't.)

I accidentaly sent the package to the wrong address, one email and it got fixed. Second, it worked just as advertised. Plugged in, put on music, and listened right away. I didn't test out battery life, but I use it at work, and it lasts me a long while, so I wouldn't be surprised if it were at least the 13 hours advertised.

As far as the second DVD, it's almost like NBC or whoever felt like playing a practical joke on the buying audience. None of Will's popular recurring characters showed up, and in the rare instance that they were included (Janet Reno, the lover, Actor's Studio), it was like the worst sketch was chosen.

You will see Will \\"azzcheeks\\" in an earlier one from the beginning.He also impersonates Janet Reno another great skit. I like the first one better. I was suprised no Celebrity Jeopardy in this one. He also plays a 37 year old baby in another skit comming out of a womb another funny one.

After watching it, I not only wanted to rip the disk from the player, but I wanted to go boot the DVD out the door. I had been expecting his BEST of and all I recieved was extensions of the first volume. On the first volume, they had cute little snippets of skits that obviously didn't deserve to waste space with a joke that dragged on. I can only describe the decision of whomever picks the segments on these \\"Best of\\" DVDs as having inside jokes with their friends that derived from certain skits.

Nonstop sketches of beatings, yellings and references to genitals gets a little old, especially when they aren't funny either. As a \\"best of\\" dvd, I recognized only a few of these skits at all.

However, this batch of skits made me wonder just how in the world SNL chooses their skit writers.This is the worst collection of skits I have ever seen in one of their \\"Best Of\\" DVDs. The first skit of George W. Bush is fine, and there are a few here that will incite a few mild chuckles, but the majority of these are painfully unfunny. Most of them resort to cheap pleas for laughs with Farrell resorting to some sort of comic violence, and even then, it's still not funny.I was about halfway on the first set. Loved Harry Caray, George W. Bush, Celebrity Jeopardy, and such. But this is utterly worthless, and pales in comparison. Honestly, I am angered that I spent fifteen bucks on this, and I am selling it immediately to a second hand store. Don't waste your money.

I have never been moved to write a review like this before, but I cannot believe what I just saw. This is supposed to be funny? SNL is still on the air? (shakes head) Unbelievable.Please do not waste your money on this disc. Will Ferrell and the various nonentities who appear with him are pathetic, but what is far, far more pathetic is the so called \\"writing.\\" These skits are sad, unfunny, and quite probably an embarrassment to the writers' parents.I rate this 1 star only because I cannot post a zero, or better yet, a negative number."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"If you liked the first volume, but didn't think it was Ferrell's best work, then do NOT waste your time or money on this one. There was maybe three sketchs on the whole DVD that were above mediocre (the Bush intro, the teleprompter skit, and the Janet Reno skit), the rest I am at a loss for words for how they could even be considered the \\"best of\\" this incredible comedic talent. Some of the skits were ones that were shown on the first volume, albeit briefly. Just a really horrible, horrible job on this one. The first one missed some great skits, but this one was far worse. It is becoming pretty obvious that SNL is using these \\"Best of\\" DVD's not to pay tribute to some of the best comedic talent our society has ever turned out (like Ferrell, Hartman, Sandler, Farley, etc...), but just a way to make a quick buck off the fans of these comedians without having to do any work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I actually thought the first volume was pretty funny, even though they didn't include some of his best, namely anything neil diamond. I rented this one thinking I'd be laughing my butt off again, but it was a MAJOR letdown. I laughed maybe 3 times total. The choices of skits was horrible, including extended scenes from the first one. Remember that Janet Reno fighting Rudy Guliani skit from the first volume? Well thats back in entirety, but without merit, because the only funny part was that dirty fighting line, and now its old news. What the producers of these SNL best-of's need to do is set up an online poll with the skits he does, and have the true fans pick the best. What I'm guessing they did is put together another DVD really quick, hoping to capitalize on Will's recent popularity.All in all, don't even think about buying this, even if you liked the first volume. This second one isn't the real Will Ferrell, its just plain bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a few laughs","review":"This volume is definitely not as good as the first.

They left out Will's more brilliant work, for some of his rather lackluster performances. They doubled up on sketches from the first DVD, so it wasn't as if they were trying to explore his whole body of work.No more of the classic Celebrity Jeprodies? No Outtakes? 2 Interviews with Conan O'Brian? WHY!?Just a plain let down. Don't buy it if you haven't already."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was dissapointed","review":"I loved the first Will Ferrell dvd. The only problem with it is that there were still so many more skits that I wanted to see. I was very happy when I heard they were making a second volume. The problem, though, is that this DVD doesn't have any of the skits I was hoping for. How can you have a \\"Best of Will Ferrell\\" DVD without showing his Neil Diamond? (Except for that 2 seconds in the outtakes of the first volume) I was also hoping that I can see some Ted Kaczynski, but none on this DVD either. I was surprised to see that a few of the sketches on the second volumes were ones that were in the first volume, only in smaller pieces. What about his John Rocker sketch? What about the \\"Get off the shed\\" sketch? (The real one, not the one in his audition). I was also surprised that there wasn't any \\"Spartans\\", \\"Celebrity Jeopardy\\", or \\"Morning Latte\\" clips in this volume. Overall, Will is a comedic genius.

I can't believe it wasn't in the first Best of, although the first was worth the price just for the Goulet gig on Conan...

Really Annoying.","review":"This is sort of the worst possible version of Rounders, which was likeable film about one man's journey of self-discovery, which is spurred on by his pain-in-the-neck best friend. In Rounders, it works because the best friend, although impossible, has depth. You understand him, his priciples (such as they are), and you know that a guy who won't compromise makes for an explosive combination in the environment we find ourselves in Rounders. But in Made, the best friend has no depth. He's just a jerk. He's a jerk through the whole movie, and he annoys the audidence as much as anyone else, so much so that you have a hard time following the story, and hardly even notice the main character's progress. Perhaps the jerk was supposed to be funny, and if so, maybe that could have carried the film. But he's not funny. He's not compelling. He's not interesting. He's a jerk, and living with him for two hours is two hours too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made","review":"To me this movie \\"Made\\" is better than the Swingers movie at least Vaughn is funnier and not as awkwardly skinny.The Comedy is in bits here and there,it is not Completely funny.I don't care for Sean Combs nor the Cuban Flag being displayed when there are no Cubans involved(they probably got their Puerto Ricans and Cubans mixed up.). The movie might try to hard but in the end I believe it succeeds.The movie is not for everyone,but for me it'll do and That Trans-Am surely helps and some Sportbikes,I wouldn't go too far though and label it a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, solid movie.","review":"I don't think this is as good as Swingers, but it would be hard for vaughn and favreau to be together in a movie and it to be really bad - I think :)This is the same sort of thing as swingers. Different plot, sure, but the two guys carrying on and favreau trying to play things down as vaughn is his typical outgoing, irritating self. In swingers, however, he was more or less a guy you'd want to hang out with once a month, just for the heck of it. In Made he's more of a jerk. He's incredibly self-centered, totatlly unaware of how to deal with people, and I kind of wanted him to die at the end (whether he did or not I won't say here).In any case there are plenty of good scenes with vaughn (since he makes the movie) with his passive aggressive personality. All in all a movie worth watching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny, Not Good.","review":"I don't understand what everyone on this review page is talking about. I thought the movie was one of the worst movie's I've seen in quite a while. I love this genre, and I loved Swingers, but Made was terrible. The plot was stupid, the jokes were not funny. I read in one review that one of the funny things was the references it made to Swingers. I'm sorry, but a licsense plate is not funny. Neither is the fact that Vince Vaughn used the word \\"honey.\\" I refuse to laugh at a movie just because I think I'm supposed to. It has to actually be funny, and this one was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried to like it, and failed...","review":"I tried very hard to like this movie because I enjoyed Swingers so much. Regrettably, I just couldn't sit through it.Even though the production value of the film looks surprisingly high for it's budget, the plot moves at a slow pace and the hand-held camera work is jittery and disorienting.As bad as the above mentioned factors are, the true reason for this film's failure is the constant annoyance of Vince Vaughn's character. In fact, this character is so grating that it reminded me of \\"Jar Jar Binks\\" from \\"Star Wars Episode 1\\": Hapless, dim-witted, and the cause of a lot of trouble for his loyal friends. By the middle of the movie, I was so irritated by this character that I just couldn't stomach the film anymore.In the end, I would characterize this movie as a true disappointment for any Favreau fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Vince Vaughn's character was extremely annoying, at one point I just wanted him to get whacked so that he would shut up for once. Jon Favreau was alright, at least he didn't talk so much. Famke is very pretty and her acting is good, but whoever wrote her two-scene-role (Favreau, I suppose) did a lousy job. First she's that normal girl stuck with the wrong job, next thing she's a crackhead. What in the world happened? The two stars go for Puffy, very impressed with his appearence, even though I don't like his music. I was pretty much bored the whole time watching this movie, lacked any sense at all, I'd rather be watching the News at 11, if you know what I mean. Just my 2 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid film, looks like it was written by 12 year olds.","review":"DOn't bother with this one. Though I am a HUGE fan of Swingers and the Sopranos. (Some of the cast is used in this film) I cannot recommend you watch this moive. It's about 2 incompetant, small time thugs. One who wants out of the Mob and to settle down with his stripper girlfriend and her daughter. The other wanting to be a bigger part of the Mob, but with the brain power of a gnat. It's more annnoying than funny. Like a bad imitation of Dumb and Dumber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note to Favreau...","review":"Obnoxious and annoying is not the same as funny. Vince's Ricky character was not one bit funny and pretty much ruined it for me. I was hoping time and time again he would just get killed off. Unfortunately he wasn't. I only wish I had rented this instead of bought it. Not a good follow up to Swingers at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good comedy","review":"Made is a good comedy. Vince Vaughn's great, John Favreau is great as always. More laugh out loud funny than swingers but not as witty."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Vince or Not Vince......","review":"How well you like this movie may depend on how well you take to the character played by Vince Vaughn. He is deliberately boorish, obnoxious, obtuse and irritating. Now, this can work in a movie at times, but for me, Vaughn's character was like fingernails on a blackboard and I was praying half way through the movie that, comedy or no, somebody would kill this jerk! Since I couldn't stand this lout after awhile, and since he is onscreen virtually the entire film, I couldn't wait for this exercise in irritation to end.If, however, you don't mind this character the movie is a none-to-exceptional, but okay urban/gangster comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This...Show Was...really...Worthless","review":"Not only was the shallow plot poorly acted there would have been only three (3) lines of dialog in this movie if the F-word was eliminated from the script, assuming there was a script...Not much thought seemed to have gone into the script so there's not much to get out of it. If this movie had a humorous plot it certainly got lost in the lack of coherence that permeated each scene, if there were scenes. It wasn't worth the effort to try to follow or care where the plot, or lack thereof, was going. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high expectations, very disappointed!","review":"I am a huge Swingers fan and was looking forward to seeing Made on DVD. Luckily I rented it before buying. Vince Vaughn's character is one of the worst characters I've seen in any movie. He is way to annoying. And what was all of the hype with Puff Daddy. He didn't impress me. This is not a mob movie. Do not see it. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did others watch the same movie???","review":"Boring and stupid. Do not waste your money. I wanted to rent this from NetFlix but they didn't have it. Now I know why. Instead we bought it and would now like to take it back. There were four of us watching it and 2 of them fell asleep. The rest of us watched Spy Kids after watching Made and it was better.While the one character was somewhat funny for awhile, his attitude and stupidity grew old quickly. The acting was good maybe even great but the plot was limp. It could have been a great storyline had they added more content.We watched the Outtakes hoping to see something funnier. WRONG! These were the worst outtakes I have ever seen and believe me, I watch a ton of movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You will wish you had never seen this movie..","review":"This movie left me sick to my stomach. Prior comments on this movie are obviously tounge-in-cheek, but folks, c'mon, this was garbage- plain and simple. For the length of the movie, we follow two friends, who have a running gag of always engaging in petty pushing contests, and act boorishly for the sake of a few laughs.P Diddy's role in the film is diminutive, and Vincent Pastore is used sparingly - playing a limo driver, what a shame..This movie never really blossomed into a sophisticated and enthralling crime escapade movie, however conversely sunk deep into the lethargic torpor of bad jokes and poor acting. This movie was not ha ha funny, and the plot certainly didn't grab hold of you, it was just marginal..Please, don't waste your time. If you like this genre of movie, stick to Snatch or LSTSM, which are both masterpieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"F.... this","review":"This basically sums up the movie's vocabulary.Vince Vaughn's character Ricky uses F... in every sentence. This movie blows, don't even waste the 5 bucks to rent it and 2 hours of your life. Vince Vaugn's character is even more annoying than his character in Swingers... If you want to see him in a decent acting performance watch RETURN to PARADISE.Jon Favreau's career has gone down the drain after he starred in RUDY and lost weight. Cameos from P Diddy and Sopranos stars add nothing to make the movie any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"cool average film","review":"this film was a Cool Average film.it didn't last long&that was a plus.some funny stuff in spots but you can tell it was very 2nd-tier in alot of spots.it was thin on overall story substance but it was a Average film worth peeking out for a few laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch.","review":"As much as I have enjoyed John's work in the past, I was sorely disappointed with this movie.Having read other reviewer's opinions, I know that it was made on a very small budget. I realize that John wrote, directed, produced and starred in the movie. Let's face it. The man had a lot going on.Unfortunately, I think that the writing for this movie got away from John. I really really wanted to enjoy this movie, and was hoping that I had found a hidden treasure. Unfortunately, in hindsight, I don't feel like this was the case.The character Vince Vaugh plays is polar opposite from the character he played in swingers. It's the same guy, but instead of being hip and sheek, he's geeky ... John's character just never really develops.I am looking forward to his next effort, and will buy whatever he makes, but I do feel a little bit let down by this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Ever","review":"The two main characters are so irritating that you never get to identify with them.They never shut up and run off about their bosses \\"business\\" in settings that would get them popped post haste in anything approximating reality. Huge suspension of disbelief needed for this one. Not enjoyable at all. It is actually irratating. The DVD case is worth more than the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing like the swingers","review":"For those of you considering this movie because you loved The Swingers, I strongly discourage you to buy this movie.It's nothing like The Swingers, it doesn't have the smart dialogue, good charicter interaction and it definitely lacks humor. Throughout the whole movie not only did I not laugh but this movie failed to get any kind of response from me. So don't make the same mistake I did by purchasing this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very funny but a little too much","review":"i am a huge swingers fan. but, this film was a lot different. it was extremely funny and i liked the ways they made me laugh. but, i could have done without all the strong language. it seemed like they dropped f-bombs in their just to get an R rating. otherwise a well made film and a funny one at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get rid of Spanish subtitles","review":"Can't get rid of Spanish subtitles - very distracting. All other DVD's work fine in my player, so it's the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this movie","review":"An alleged comedy with 2 characters you quickly hate so bad the only reason to keep watching is you hope to see them die a painful death. The plot (was there one?) is slow moving. The dialog consists of the f???ing word 92000 times with a few nouns thrown in. Peter Faulk has an okay performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Problems & Lousy movie","review":"Couldn't get spanish subtitles to go away...but 20 minutes in decided it would be a much better movie if there were only spanish [or Chinese] subtitles. This movie was so bad that 3 of us [2 males, 1 female; ages 20 - 54] voted unanimously not to watch the rest of it. A main character is an embarrassment to the species."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jon Favreau MADE garbage","review":"Wow, in my life I have never been so wrong about a movie. After seeing Swingers I couldn't imagine that Favreau would bomb so badly in a movie. I figured the movie would at least be decent.The characters have no character, the plot has no plot. Just two hours of annoying, pointless conversations.And then at the end they hit us with a big politically correct ending, it turns out the tension between the two main characters is resolved when they established a suspiciously homosexual-like relationship.I now own a worthless DVD that I will never ever watch again. Save your money, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"After the greatness of Swingers we get this tripe ?","review":"Vince Vaughn's character was so overdone as to make this film impossible to watch. My wife stopped 15 minutes into it, I made it a little over 45 minutes. This is what we got from the guys who made swingers ? It's just plain awful.The plot could have worked out to be funny, but instead of being funny, it just got tired. Vince Vaughn plays a clueless slacker who uses his friend to get work and wants badly to be a gangster like he's seen in movies such as \\"Casino\\". Now, if the part had been played properly, it would have come off funny, instead, it just gets more and more grating by the minute. I really wished his character would have been killed off early.The plot was pretty good, but VV's character was , as I've said, so overdone and annoying, you just can't take it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it....hated it.","review":"I am really mad at Vince Vaughn and his buddy, Favreau. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, and I try to be selective about my choices. Sean Combs is an absolute embarrassment to the field of acting. There were some Sopranos cameos which served as a distraction for this sad piece of celluloid. Terrible. Awful. I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"made a bad movie","review":"Although I liked swingers, and favreau and vaughn have great chemistry, this movie just did not come together at all. This suprised me though, because I really enjoyed swingers and expected great things from this flick. The plot also had great potential, but it just never did develop at all. Vaughn was hilarious in swingers, despite his relentless \\"force feeding\\" of his style.In made, he just came across as a pointless, obnoxious, never has been and never will be kind of character.I own over 200 dvd's and I only buy great movies.I forgive him and favreau though, because I liked swingers so much, and Im sure they will produce some good materieal in the future, but please take my word for it, this movie was a bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"great service","review":"Book arrived very quickly and was in excellent condition.

Bramwell and the other stuffed animals decide to get him back.What follows is a series of failed attempts to reach the attic until finally one succeeds and the toys are united.I like this story because it does show the process of thinking through a problem as well as perseverance (even when Duck thinks there is no hope).

Now I'm stuck with this horrible neck rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate all sprinklers","review":"The problem I've had with lawn sprinklers of any price is that they don't work very well, and then they break. True to form, this Melnor from the start oscillated unevenly, rotating much more drastically to the left than to the right, necessitating multiple trips out into the drenched and swampy lawn to try to fine-tune the placement. Eventually, if this one behaves like its predecessors, it'll stop oscillating entirely and water fixedly to the left only. The reason I like this sprinkler a little more than the others is simply that I paid a lot less for it, so when I finally lose what's left of my patience and rip it to pieces it won't bother me so much (though I will of course bemoan the needless waste of our precious natural resources). Gilmours are even worse than Melnors, if that helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started ok, broke after 6 usses","review":"Price was right, and it started out okay. After 2-3 uses though, I noticed the oscillator left large puddles on either end of its reach along with where it sat on the lawn. Everything in between was slightly wet. After 6 uses, I accidentally dropped it from waist level on the lawn and the connector nozzle(made of plastic) broke off making it useless. If the nozzle had not broken off, I would have given it 2 stars. It wasn't worth the money for less than a week's use. I don't recommend this one to anyone. I'd look for something without a plastic nozzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor durability","review":"I liked this sprinkler at first. As another reviewer said, the dial to control how far this sprinkler sprays in either direction actually works rather well.Unfortunately, it didn't hold up well at all. After about 10 uses, one of he nozzles only sprayed about half as high as the others, which meant that the evenness of the water distribution was diminished. Over the next month, another nozzle would suffer this same problem each week, so that now the sprinkler is only about half functional.I'm guessing that the nozzles are getting clogged. It wouldn't cost very much for the manufacturer to include a metal screen to minimize this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hose connector broke - flimsy plastic","review":"I was rolling my hose up and forgot to disconnect the sprinkler first. Just dragging it across the yard was enough to snap off the plastic part that connects the black hose connector to the body of the unit.This is unfortunate, as otherwise it seemed to work well. The knob to control how far the sprinkler would go in each direction worked well and was convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next Volume Please","review":"I would like to encourage the author to write more volumes on the Illinois Central.

It's not memorable for rousing melodies or sexy grooves. Rather, it's unforgettable simply for evoking an uneasy sense of other-worldliness. It transports you to a somewhat eerie place, where your vulnerabilities surface. But it's through this awakening of your weaker side that you come to know yourself with greater understanding. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, just buy the album. It's unlike anything, and it's magical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critical Analysis of Teilhard","review":"I was surprised that there were no reviews of this book. It deserves at least one. I disagree with the author, but I'll try to be positive anyway. The author states that his \\"analysis of Teilhard's work is highly critical.\\" That it definitely is. The author dislikes the \\"New Age\\" movement, declares that Darwinism is not a scientific fact, and links Teilhard to both. But this book contains detailed research, footnotes (not end notes, hurray!), a pair of indexes, and was published by an academic press, presumably with peer review. The foreword was from the dean of the Southern Evangelical Seminary in North Carolina. So, if you share the author's opinions, then you should find this book quite valuable. And if you prefer Teilhard's theories, this book is at least worth taking a look at just to read some objections.

I did not see any price advantage of the 3 pack (however I used to buy the 3 pack, because it was cheaper).I get one each 6 months, and that will remind be to replace.Tip for those who dont know this - pull off the front lower grill on your fridge to make it vastly easier to grip and twist the old filter out. I found that it made it a good time to clean out the dust bunnies, gross, and they hamper the effeciency of your fridge. I also find it easier to reinstall if the fridge doors are open, you can see the clips that the grill snaps into, much easier.Good filtering.I typically rate 4 stars for quality products, reserving 5 stars from outstanding products.

Since I got my side by side ten years ago, I drink nothing but water and love the taste of good, clean water with all the chemicals and harmful junk filtered out. These filters are easy to install and ease my mind when I think of all the crap that is in the tap water. It is scary what is acceptable as far as water quality standards.

Now I understand why there are some many factory \\"Kitchen Aid\\" refurbished mixers and blenders - the product does not last very long and the warrenty is only for one year, it seems to expire right after the motor burns out.

No matter how many times you boil driftwood before you put it in the tank, you can never get all the color out. Purigen takes it out of the fishwater. I prefer not to regenerate the Purigen as I have followed the directions carefully but somehow get a little trace of chlorine that puts my fish over the edge - it's happen to me multiple times. Instead I buy Purigen in bulk and just empty out the bags and refill and tie off with a plastic tie.

They are too hard to make, too hard to maintain, too hard to make small and maintain.

Unfortunately, I was left with nothing more than a bland metalcore band. And the singing in the chorus'! It's off key and off beat, and sounds completely awful! The other instruments are nothing new, just bland riffs and drop-d power chords. The vocals in the song verses aren't anything exciting either.

The problem is, it's a poor impersonation, because NO ONE can compare to Danzig. The best thing I can compare this album to is Fear Factory with the same breakdown spliced in and awful power metal vocals. If that's your thing give this album a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harder Than Hell","review":"Sinai beach- Immersed is the best cd of '05....no doubt in my mind. Immersed carries a common theme throughout the album, how corrupted the human race is and how we don't deserve the grace that God has given us, it's also centered around the apacalypse(in the book of Revalation). Through Immersed, Sinai Beach has unleashed a surge of anger and surprisingly, praise with its christian based themes...

I was surprised to receive a package so light for a toy I thought was all wood. I would have preferred the shapes to be made of wood because the foam shapes bend and thus stick to the pegs when my child tries to pull them off. Since the pegs are not attached to the base, which is also very light, they easily come out when a piece is being removed and your child might not be able to put them back securely to continue playing. On the positive side, it is safer to have foam pieces scattered around a toddler who will inadvertently step all over them. My daughter is just as preoccupied with this sorter as she was with the wooden version at my friend's house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hazardous! Great toy, but doesn't stand up to being chewed","review":"The package did not mention that it was a choking hazard for children under 3!!! I plan to complain to the manufacturer. Its definitely a hazard if your child is still teething -- my 19 mo son who still likes to chew up stuff decimated a piece. I luckily fished out the red star in four pieces from his mouth before he could swallow and get into any trouble.So while I no longer give the toy to him, I plan to once he is over the chewing stage since he loved fitting the pegs back, and stacking and sorting and it definitely kept him educationally engaged. 3 stars on the durability since while he can chew it up, its an engaging toy, and my friends 3 yr olds enjoy the toy too. Also, Lauri replaces pieces for [a nominal fee.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent play value and educational too!","review":"I purchased this toy for my 15 month old daughter. She plays with it every day, placing the shapes on the pegs. She is learning to match colors on the pegs, but will also use the pieces as \\"food\\" for her dolls and stuffed animals. She also likes to remove and replace the wooden pegs themselves. The foam rubber base and shape pieces seem very durable, although my daugher is past the 'put everything in your mouth' phase so I don't know how they would hold up to being chewed. All in all, she seems to be having alot of fun with this toy, is hopefully learning color and shape recognition and gaining fine motor skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great educational fun!","review":"Love this product!

My son loved it, and by some fluke I still have all the pieces now for my 1.5 year old daughter. She enjoys it, though I think it might be a better toy for her when she's a little older. At present, she takes the pieces and spreads them all over the living room. Then she's mostly done with it.It's a durable toy, and it's an attention absorbing toy at the right age."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating","review":"I bought this toy for my 18 mo old to help with learning shapes and colors. The toy is frustrating for him to use on his own. The pegs do not stay in the foam base and are a little challenging for him to get back in on his own. Any time he tries to pull the pieces off, the whole peg comes out of the base. Okay toy with adult assistance, but definately not what I expectd. Great idea, but not well thought out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional but not fun for all","review":"I use this item for doing developmental evaluations of children up to 3 years old. It is very useful for that purpose but I find that only about 25% of the kids are interestesd in it. The ones who like it seem to like it a lot but the high energy kids don't really like it much.

At first it seemed like there was more tape than I needed so I cut some off, only to find that toward the end of wrapping it around my handlebars, that I almost came up short, which would really suck. These things aren't cheap. I think some instructions or visual diagrams would be a nice to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tapers cut wrong?","review":"I don't know if I got a bad box, but the tapered ends on both rolls of tape I got were cut the same direction. Typically you wrap one bar clockwise, and the other counter-clockwise. I didn't realize that the second roll was cut wrong until I had finished the first bar. I had to recut the tapers and waste about 4-6 inches. The tape came up shorter on the bars than I would have liked it as a result.But aside from that.It takes some patience to wrap, since the leather is quite tough, but it does stretch when you put a little muscle into it. The antique brown color was alarmingly light when I first got it, but once the tape was on I applied a tiny bit of proofide and it darkened to match my saddle perfectly. Not very much padding at all, which can be good or bad depending on your preference.If not for the taper issue I would've given it four stars. I hope every box doesn't come like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get it wet","review":"Bought this tape to match my black Brooks B17 saddle. First off, it's not a very good match. Second, it lasted all of about 3 days. I got this in black and I got caught in a rainstorm shortly after this tape was installed. When wet, the black dye from the tape bled all over my hands, the ground, my bike, and whatever else my hands came in contact with. It was a huge mess. The dye ruined everything it contacted. To make matters worse, after all of this I was left with an ugly dark green looking handlebar tape. Immediately threw in the trash and went back to my $20 tape.I know you are supposed to prevent Brooks saddles from getting wet but how can they release a handlebar tape and expect it to be covered from the elements?This is overprice garbage. Brooks should stick to making saddles.

It would be nice if you could absorb new programming languages through osmosis, but it doesn't work that way. Some people will tell you to buy the K&R; book, but that's pretty old! This book covers the C99 standard, which is the latest. I've read my share of awful programming books and can tell the difference.C Primer Plus, 5th edition provides clear and detailed explanations of all concepts covered, as well as review questions and programming excercises at the end of each chapter. As any serious programmer knows, you can't learn just by reading. You have to DO the excercises. I regard the excercises a book has to offer as just as important as the material covered. The excercises in the Big Blue Book are varied and just challenging enough to really get you to remember what you read in each chapter. If you follow through with this book you WILL have a solid foundation in the C programming language."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Place to Start","review":"Great book, and it assumes pretty much no programming knowledge; starts with the basics (variables, types, numering and so on) and moves, gradually and methodically, into the thornier aspects of the language. Takes its time, too -- perhaps to a fault; if you're a programmer with some experience (as I am), you might find it a little too slow, but then again, C's a rather unforgiving language, and Prata knows this well enough to spend ample amounts of time explaining the details and subtleties of the language's behavior that sometimes take years to learn on one's own. Lots and lots of problems and exercises, too, and highly readable at that.

Maybe the last one was a little extreme, but it is somewhat true. This book gives you all you need to know about C minus the real-world personal experience.In its fifth edition, Stephen Prata has given the computer society an exceptional gift.

His sexism, etc., is all on the surface. The heroine isn't terribly interesting either--she could pass for the heroine of several other romances without trouble.

It is super easy to use and makes paper items that you want to last so much more durable. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I found that sometimes it didn't cut real smoothly and I would have to go back and re-trim the edges, but that may be the paper cutter I was using. Also, it has a split back to make peeling the paper off easy, but it is only in one place, so if you are using it for smaller items, it can be hard to get the backing off.

It is NOT double sided like the 3M brand laminates, but I don't need it to be. It trims very easily by simply sliding the scissors down the edge of whatever you laminated, and despite directions to the contrary, it doesn't need to be folded around the edges of the sheet you're laminating in order to stay bonded.

The material itself is complex enough. However, the text forever will state something that talks about another disease process or physiological system discussed 20 chapters ahead (literally). I found myself using an excellent A&P book to get my A in this class at this point; nothing to do with this book. The diagrams of the brain etc. are amateurish.

It's also not cool if you've got more than one cage in use and little space to put them. It's big and awkward.Please note: I'm speaking from experience with a used, donated cage and using it with shelter pets, who are less sociable and more prone to be nervous b/c of their surroundings. So, I will admit that its entirely possible that I could be griping about it simply being old; however, since the plastic appeared to be gently used (meaning, no critter had time to scratch it/bite it much) I'm guessing it was donated to the shelter b/c the purchaser didn't like it either!

There are spelling mistakes and the paragraphs are not indented (giving it copy/paste appeal with no formatting). Even the table of contents is incorrect. The table of contents.At 8 1/2\\" x 11\\", it feels inelegant, more like a textbook than a classic adventure novel.

The actual downloaded Kindle Edition is the 4th edition, 2007. Needless to say, I had to request a refund on the purchase and am now waiting for the correct edition to be available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random bits of information","review":"This book reminds me of the ramblings of a conspiracy theorist. Mr Thomas has a terrible tendancy of starting stories showing operatives in the present (which is totally uninteresting) then flashing back to the past. Often the flashbacks never revert to the present, or have another flashback within a flashback.I am no expert on Israeli intelligence activities, but when an author falsly reports a simple fact \\"Israel has developed its own over-the-horizon accuracy for three German-build nuclear-powered submarines it had bought\\" (Germany doesn't have nuclear powered submarines, and Israel certainly doesn't have them) I begin to question his more controvertial theories and \\"facts.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramble on...","review":"While reading this book I found that I was rolling my eyes every page. The author rambles on relating tidbits of information that don't seem to fit together at all and are, at best, poorly organized with no discernable order (chronological, by topic, context, etc). I have no way of verifying the authenticity of most of the information (it is after all a book on secret intelligence), but I know that some of the stories are so inconsistent as to make all the information in the book suspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly inaccurate","review":"I started to read this book with great interest. It is generally well written. Stories and facts come up that I had not seen in other similar books. However gradually I became concerned about the inclusion of information that seemed strange, inaccurate or worse without any explanation about the truthfulness of that information.Allegations on Edmond Safra, supposed assassination of Robert Maxwell by the Mossad, and many other similar allegations appear in the book without any explanation or justification.I stopped reading the book about two thirds into it, as I had just lost confidence in the author. I don't know what motivations that author had to turn a perfectly interesting topic with lots of potentially controversial events into a mixture of facts and opinionated fiction. While the book may serve the traditional anti-Israel propaganda, it is really not worth the paper (or Kindle space) it is written on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gideon's Spies by Gordon Thomas","review":"You may be able to put down Gideon's Spies and spread your reading over several days, but I couldn't. I picked up the book on Friday, and started...but when I picked it up on Saturday I couldn't stop. It was very late into Sunday morning when I fonished. Do you want to know what really happened and not what the biased and uninformed media put out? Your view of the world and especially the intelligence services will never be the same. You will want to question what you see and hear. You will be shocked at the duplicity of politicians and governments, if you now aren't. Be prepared for your education about the real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent in all regards. The book is captivating, hard to put down. Loved all of it. Would recommend it to anyone with such interests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gideons Spies","review":"Very insightful, and lots of details about world events that I was completely unaware that Israel has been so completely involved. It is very much like a James Bond novel only it is not fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"But is it accurate?","review":"Mr. Gordon makes many shocking claims in this book. The Mossad supposedly knew that a truck bomb was going to be used against the marines in Lebanon, but didn't tell them. The Israeli Prime Minister (Shamir) supposedly gave Pollard's spy material to the Russians because he hated America. The Mossad supposedly didn't lift a finger to save William Buckley, who was tortured and killed in Lebanon. The famous Mr. Maxwell, who looted his employee's pension funds, supposedly gave those funds to the Mossad. I admit, I don't want to believe this stuff, but if the evidence was better, I would swallow hard and believe it. Its not enough to rely on an occassional disaffected spy like Ostrovsky. Lots of allegations in this book could be true, but on the other hand, they could be false."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much space between the covers.","review":"I can only second the opinions of a couple of the other reviewers. This book is an utter waste of time. It merely serves to confuse a subject already shrouded in mystery.The book lacks footnotes. It is poorly organized. The disjointed storied are arranged neither chronologically nor thematically.If you are looking to learn more about Israel's intelligence community, a far better place to start would be \\"Every Spy A Prince\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"International Intrigue - NonFiction","review":"Combine equal parts of Frederick Forsyth, Alex Berenson, David Hagberg, Daniel Silva and Brad Thor...and you still haven't quite matched the creativity or cajones of the Mossad. It's \\"in you face\\" history. Compelling behind-the-scenes activity revealed about a major force in the Middle East. Only wish the author could have included pictures of the key players as well as a flow chart showing all individuals involved in a given incident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Worlds","review":"GIDEON'S SPIES is probably the most interesting, fascinating, well researched and documented history of the Mossad and its associated intelligence networks around the world. The secret world of international spies and their activities opens up an entirely new universe of world wide governmental relationships, intrigues and machinations that changed history in many countries in many ways. Assassinations, failed plots and real life characters holds the reader in page-turning suspense. The existence of these subcultures in their mysterious underworlds is a real eye opener. It makes the average person begin to look around and wonder if the person next to him/her in line could be a spy.30"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for the Tabloids","review":"The story line is fragmented...oh what am i saying,there is no story line. It appears that this book, is more of a collection of tabloid stories. The information sources do not appear credible. There is a tendency to blame this intelligence service for number of assassinations and military blunders, without justification. Poorly written,waste of paper"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just gets silly","review":"At first I was very intrigued by the book. Although the author does not cite sources, I still found it entertaining and at least plausible. Then it just started to get plain silly. The final straws were when the author writes of an Israeli helicopter that uses \\"silent mode\\" to enter enemy territory. As a helicopter pilot, I can assure you that is laughable, and I could no longer take the book seriously after that. A few pages later he references Pope Air Force Base in Georgia. A simple internet search would show you that Pope Air Force Base is not located in Georgia, but North Carolina. These are just a few of the numerous silly and down right wrong \\"facts\\" in this book. Move on to something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors for me to know what to believe","review":"First, I agree with others that the author begins a thread and then drifts off topic. He also repeats himself to the extent that he could have deducted a hundred pages from this rambling book.The author credits the North Koreans with having SSN-6 nuclear submarines. No, they have diesel submarines. They have SSN-6 missiles. Later he credits the Israeli navy of having nuclear submarines---again, wrong. They have diesel submarines built by Germany. How many other errors are contained here? I, for one, do not believe any real Mossad insider or ex employe would give this author the time of day. I will look elsewhere for information on Mossad"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gideon's Spies","review":"This is a well written and entertaining view inside of what has always been seen as the supreme espionage agency in the world. This books confirms the dedication and professionalism of the people of Mossad as well as showing that the staff is human and susceptible to the errors of judgement and bad luck that affect all human endeavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Spy book!","review":"If you admire the secret forces of the world's governments, then you ought to read this book and you'll find a new admiration towards the Israelies.The book is a series of stories that act as well planned adventures and it tells you the way the Mossad operates. You do need a good amount of history knowledge to understand the book but all in all it is a greatly described spy book. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gordon Thomas misses point","review":"Ok book, author forgets espionage is inherently a dirty business that capitalizes on human lying, deceit, weaknesses and fear. Author doesn't miss a chance to malign the Mossad while painting known terrorists and \\"family men\\" and men of cause in addition to their terrorist work. He paints the European, Russian and Asian intelligence agencies as caught in Israel's relentless assault against terrorists and missing a opportunity to list the successful relationship between the CIA & Mossad combating international terrorism and Communism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"Other readers have commented on blatant translation errors or chronological discrepancies. Given my limited knowledge of the subject matter, I cannot offer any insight here. Most salint for me, though, are the shortcomings in Thomas' writing style. I found it utterly unengaging in its blandness. The disjointed chronology and Thomas' lack of credible support for his yarns also did him no favors. Surely there are better works on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pan","review":"I've never been a cheesecake baker, or much of any kind of baker, but with this pan, my cheesecakes come out looking like they came from a bakery or the Cheesecake Factory.

This is a fantastic pan, well worth the money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor quality","review":"I think the glass bottom is a great idea, but the first time I used it, the caramel sauce I poured in quickly leaked through onto the countertop. I thought I had not put the bottom in evenly, but on closer inspection I found that the ring does not close tightly around the glass bottom; it is not even snug. This may be a manufacturing flaw in the pan I bought, since others have not reported the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drip drip drip... not what you want from a springform!","review":"I have used one of these for a long time-- I like the glass bottom, though it was never a particularly tight seal. After living for a while with a cheapo IKEA pan in my other kitchen (I commute 1100 miles and unfortunately have two of many things), I finally decided to \\"spring\\" for a nicer pan, so to speak. The first one arrived and was all scratched up, so I returned it and got a second one. Filled that one up with water, and indeed, drip drip drip drip. It's from where the collar joins, since indeed, the outer side of the ring has to be looser than the inner side. Batter won't drip through it or anything, but butter in a crust, or juice from baking fruit might. It's not actually worse than the cheaper pan, so I decided not to return yet another one. But I'm quite disappointed, since I was hoping that by shelling out the cash for a fancier pan, I might get a relatively drip-proof one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dented when it arrived...twice","review":"I was eager to use the new pan for a Thanksgiving dessert. On the recommendation from Cook's Illustrated, I ordered one from Amazon. It arrived with a couple small dents around the bottom edge, which I was concerned would affect the pan's ability to seal.Amazon quickly sent me a replacement, which arrived with an even larger dent than on the first one I returned. I am getting a refund this time, and will buy this from a local retailer, where I can inspect it before I leave the store.To Amazon's credit, I've learned how easy it is to get replacements and refunds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frieling Glass Bottom Pan","review":"I bought this pan with high expectations. Handwashed it in warm water, baked one cake in it. The glass bottom was amazing. No fear of damaging the pan.Then I tryed to attach the glass bottom to the ring again after we were done with the cake and it would not attach. It kept missing the grove made for the glass. Then I noticed that the ring was not even on the bottom so the glass could not sit into the grove properlly. Not sure if that was the way it came or the pan ring metal is really cheap and once it was used in the oven, it kind of made it's own wobbly shape after it cooled without the glass. Could not use after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"glass bottom browns nicely and shows results","review":"the frieling glass bottom spring form pan was the highest recommended on cook's illustrated website. they do extensive research in all types of kitchen equipment before they recommend anything. you can buy with confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Leaks","review":"It's a very nice pan, and I like the fact that it has a glass bottom. However, when I took it out of the box and put water in it to test the seal, it leaked very badly - like a waterfall. It appeared to have a few slight dents near the spring/catch. I suppose it will be OK to contain a cheesecake and crust with foil layered underneath, but for this price it should be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look at the other side","review":"This dubbed originally French documentary about the \\"news\\" arm of Hezbollah is fascinating viewing. The producers give Al Manar's journalists, proponents and a few opponents the chance to share their opinions about the work of the news agency. The professionals aren't insane zealots, but partisan journalists who are trying to put deliberate spin on an organization they feel is fighting for freedom, not terrorism. This is the first in-depth look I've seen of Al Manar. Given the recent war between Israel and Hezbollah in south Lebanon, this documentary couldn't be more timely. Everyone should take an hour out of their day and see how the other side spins the news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but flat","review":"This movie is extremely interesting for the fact that it shows the agenda of a news channel, and it makes you think of what kind of agenda is behind our news broadcasting.

At the end of last season I removed the unit opened the valve manually and flushed it with air from my air compressor. Then I gave it a few shots of LPS-1, while cycling it on and off between shots. Put it in a zippy bag and on a shelf till this spring. And I thought I was so cunning. Got It off the shelf 3 weeks ago, Put in a new battery and 'VIOLA' the valve was frozen again.

One flooded internally causing the battery to corrode and fail. The other two would leak water at the faucet side of the connection when the internal valve was closed.

Don't buy this model. They leak and break very easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and not worth it","review":"This timer has very limited settings and those don't work. A week after installing it I tried to change the settings. The start time went crazy and kept cycling through the hours. And, of course, to take the battery out and force a reset requires dismounting the timer. Spend more on a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of money.","review":"I have owned 3 of these and each one has failed. This morning, I discovered the water still running 2 hours after the timer had come on . It was supposed to run for 10 minutes!

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"I have had this timer for only 2 seasons now. All of the sudden, it keeps showing that the battery is bad, when I have already changed the battery. It worked great during the first year, but only lasted for about one year. I will spend the extra money on a better product this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Timer!","review":"I bought 3 of these timers at Home Depot under the Vigoro brand, but they are the same POS. I installed 2 on parts of my mountain cabin's drip watering system. 1 failed after a week and stuck open, costing me $290.00 in wasted water (water is expensive there). The other failed while I was there and also stuck open. I replaced DIG 90001d timers that died after 5 years with this junk, trying to save money. Big mistake! At least the DIG timers fail in the closed position."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 of 3 unusable","review":"Of the three I bought last year one still works but the lcd is unreadable, making them all unusable. Eight of the eight Gilmores are still working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Waterproof","review":"Water built up inside the unit till the screen was obscured and then damaged, electronics eventually failed also causing it to cycle on its own. Happened slow enough that warranty expired before it was noticeable. Who builds a watering timer that isn't waterproof?."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Monwy","review":"This timer is just not worth the money. The plastic conntector to the hosepipe breaks easily. It consumes batteries quickly; one 9v battery does not contain that much eneregy. I came home to a flood because the plastic connector decided to break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent If Not Used In Wet Conditions","review":"I bought four of these timers at the beginning of the 2008 season and two were dead by mid-May. The reason: water enters them through the keypad. If your timer is located completely away from any rain or sprinkling activity, I suppose this unit would work fine. But don't expect it to last more than a few weeks if it is actually exposed to wetness. I have used two other models of timer before this-- one cheaper and one more expensive-- and neither ever failed over two to four seasons of use as a result of flooding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to use, if only it worked","review":"The unit is very easy to program, and with all the possible cycles is very flexible and adaptable to most any need. The problem is it only worked for about a month. After that, it tried to kick in as programmed, but immediately shut off -- useless. It's an aweful lot of money to spend for such a short period of operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product has been recalled by Melnor","review":"I bought three of these this spring. Two failed by July. Went to my local Ace Hardware to return them, and was told the product has been recalled as defective.

There was a pile of them in the manager's office that had been returned after breaking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design","review":"I should have read here before buying. I've had each problem. Blowout of inlet connection (pressing back together with PVC glue fixed this), erratic time keeping, turns on and will not turn off and water in the battery compartment (added pipe thread sealer to o-ring). Very bad unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate time","review":"I purchased one of these, set the time and settings, and hooked it up to my sprinklers. It fired three hours early. Interesting. I noticed the time had drifted by three hours, so I set the current time again. Same deal. It fired three hours early. On one other day, it just picked a time at random.Returned it, as the unit I had was defective.The replacement did the same thing. The time drifted, and it started watering my lawn three hours early.That's enough of that. These units would be fine, if they worked right, but they don't. Additionally, the buttons don't work right, and require repeated presses to make any change. The user interface is actually pretty good, but the unit itself is poorly engineered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd read these reviews","review":"I wish I'd read these reviews before purchasing the Melnor 3015. I've returned 2 purchased this week from Home Depot. Neither one would prevent water from moving through the device while out of the programmed \\"on\\" time. Home Depot is great about taking them back, but what a waste of time and gas. After first fail, I called customer service and operator listened to about 2 sentences and said, \\"it's defective, take it back\\". Based on reviews here, I'm guessing that they get lots of complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great design with a fatal weakness","review":"This is a great timer with a weak plastic female connection on the top.

If the timer had a metal connection, it would be the perfect garden timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for one day","review":"I installed this timer and it worked great - for all of one day. The second day it started watering at a completely different time and didn't turn off on its own. The third day it didn't turn on automatically at all and had to be manually started. The fourth day it stopped working completely. Replaced the battery - still didn't work. The fifth day we threw it in the trash and bought one from Orbit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Only worked for a limited time before reading the battery was low.

It worked like a charm until I connected it to the spigot. So off to Home Depot to foolishly exchange it. Got home and did a quick program and could hear the until switch on, so I figured I was good to go. Wrong! Put it on the spigot and it didn't do anything. Messed with it for a while longer trying to see if was me that just didn't understand how to program it, but it wasn't me. It was this worthless piece of junk. It's going back to the store tomorrow for a refund. I'll get something better. Vigoro should be ashamed of making / selling something this bad. I should have read reviews before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"I bought mine under the \\"Vigoro\\" brand name at a hardware store, not thru Amazon (the design is identical, down to the programming). This lasted for about 10 months before it stopped working. I opened up the battery compartment and it was flooded with water. I let it dry for a good three days before putting in a fresh battery. The numbers came on, I programmed it, hooked it up, but no dice. The valve never worked again under automatic mode, only manual mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inlet broke","review":"After a year of use the inlet broke off- luckily while I was screwing the hose in. Bad news if it breaks while you are not there! I couldn't return it to home depot because of the time so I decided to check it out... the part that \\"broke off\\" seemed to be a press fit... there was no broken plastic, little indication of glue. The press fit just seemed to come out- not good at all.I decided to use some epoxy and repair the unit... something that melnor should use in the first place!Also it's a bit funky selecting the program on/off... I have to press the button multiple times to get it to respond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after one season","review":"This model seemed to work fine for the first year, but when I tried it out for this summer, everything works except the valve-- ie, it doesn't turn the water off at all. Manual override makes a clicking sound inside the body, but the water doesn't turn off. Moving on to a different brand. And I can't find any way to open it up to see if it's fixable. NOT recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutly the worst","review":"These timers would last a season and I figured one a year isn't all that bad for the price. As I set up my watering needs using more of them I found either they filled with water, ate batteries weekly, or didn't work. Buying locally they are the only game in town. The last straw was 10 days ago I left on vacation. I came home to find my back yard now a pond. Somehow, the thing stayed on long enough to water my yard with according to the water company 37,000 gallons of water!NEVER AGAIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another 1-star","review":"It worked great for about 3 months, then it flooded our back yard. The body leaked like a sieve, irreparable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible timer","review":"Purchased the same item from Home Depot under the Vigoro name. Left it on for a summer and assumed that it was battery failure when it stopped working. This summer tried it out earlier. The timer just does not work! No flooding like others have experienced. It just does not go on and off at the programmed time.A complete waste of money. Melnor should have recalled these long ago! Do not buy under any circumstances!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mine works great","review":"I see lots of negative reviews, but mine works great. It doesn't have a lot of features, but if you don't want to water more than once a day it's fine. I like that it's simple to program. I went through a couple other timers that didn't work so well. This one has been pretty robust so far. Not sure if I just got a good one or what. I use mine for a micro-sprinkler system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well until it broke","review":"It worked great for about 8 months. Easy to set, worked at the right times.

But I just got my water bill for the period covered when I was using it and it was FOUR TIMES what I normally pay. I've had bad water timers before but never had this problem.

I looked through several of the negative review's comments and they were mostly made by people who had never made any other comment or review before. That just seems suspicious to me.Bottom line, maybe people did enjoy this book- not everyone has the same tastes, but I for one did not find it funny. I saw it trying to be, but it never made me laugh once. I gave up half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of unoriginal cliches","review":"I read a lot of parenting books, and was hoping this book would be a light-hearted take on motherhood. I found it to be tasteless and not worth the time to read. For the most part it was full of over-used old cliches on parenthood. However, there were some things that were also offensive (joking about extreme postpartum depression)....save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the blog is better","review":"I enjoyed the author's blog so much that I went out and got her book. Sad to say it was not as genuine, funny, touching, or engaging as her on-line writing. too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I got this book as a gift after I had my daughter and didn't even finish it, although it's a fast-read book because the tone was pretentious. I may have smirked once or twice, but it's definitely not the book you need as a new mom. If your a new mom trying to embrace your new role, and you don't happen to share the author's very specific philosophies, it comes across as just plain ANNOYING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defensiveness thinly disguised as no-nonsense","review":"I admit there were some parts that were funny, but overall, this book is pretty much worthless. First of all, it's alienating to moms who choose to make different choices than the author, such as making baby food yourself, or even buying organic! The funny thing is, she complains about women making their own baby food and then complains that baby food is \\"too expensive,\\" not even acknowledging that making your own is a fraction of the cost and is in fact the reason why most women opt to do just that.She can be witty at times, but most of the time she comes across as being harshly judgmental and defensive. A good friend of mine gave it to me as a gift, because she thought it \\"seemed funny\\" from the parts she read. I didn't tell her how much I hated it, but I really thought it was awful. And the references to celebrity gossip are totally annoying and shallow. On the upside, I guess it will make the book dated before too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it so much I ordered copies for my new mom friends!","review":"Stefanie, thank you for this refreshingly candid and hilarious book! I don't have children yet, but I can definitely see myself returning to it again to help me navigate the maze of new parenthood. Reading this book is like listening to your funniest friend give you the real scoop on life after baby. So glad to have a heads-up on things I can expect when I become a mom. Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harsh look at motherhood","review":"I really this book would make me laugh, but it certainly did not. It makes me said that the author feels this way about motherhood. I was going to give this book to a friend who is expecting but instead, I threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not finish this book","review":"This book made me chuckle at best...it came up empty! It could have had better shock value for me to read this book before my daughter was two..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"The title is catchy, and a lot of the anecdotes are funny, but overall I find this to be a rather dangerous book. I feel sorry for Stephanie Wilder-Taylor because of the mismanagement of breastfeeding, bonding, and new mama care following her baby's birth. Then, rather than get angry at the hospital for their lack of support, she writes a book to advocate for other parents to not breastfeed?I understand that some women need to supplement with formula or are unable to breastfeed at all. That doesn't make formula feeding \\"just as good\\" as breastfeeding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mothering is not for sissies","review":"I hate to see so many good reviews on a book as harmful as this one. It may seem like just a funny book to some, but new moms need all the support that they can get. This book encourages bad parenting, in my opinion. Sure, some things are tough at first (breastfeeding, for example), but being a mom isn't for sissies. You need to do what is best for your baby- not what is easiest. I think this book encourages the easy way out by making it seem ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone actually published this woman?","review":"Is it just me or is this woman an extreme alchoholic? There was rarely a page that went by that alchohol was not mentioned. That must be the REAL reason she didn't breastfeed. I found this book frightening because she wrote everything matter-of-fact and made anyone not like her sound stupid-people are going to read this book and believe it! I fell in love with my babies before they were born, I breastfed, I co-sleep, and yes, I'm going to homeschool. I normally like books like this but I'll takes Jenny McCarthy's book any day of the week- that's pee-in-your-pants humor. Sorry, no recommendations from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SHOWER GIFT EVER!!","review":"I have to say this book is an honest and hilarious look at being a new parent. The author writes in a style that makes you feel like you are having a conversation with a friend....a cool friend that isn't going to b.s. you about anything. It is not only a good read for someone who hasn't had a kid yet but it is also the most perfect gift to give to any expectant parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jessica Kaminsky","review":"From now on, I am going to insist that \\"Sippy Cups...\\" be mandatory reading for all of my new mother friends. Finally someone has vocalized what I've been feeling all along about the cult of mommy hood... that everyone has a degree in \\"I know what's best for your baby\\" but you. Stefanie Wilder-Taylor has done a hillarious job, breathing life to such baby milestones as his or her first trip to the doctor, sleep training, and your little one's first birthday. Seriously, this book is fantastic and I don't even need to have a baby in your life to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it I was so annoyed","review":"I had to put this one down before I finished it because I was so annoyed at the way the author continued to tell us she's all for anyone doing things differently than she, but then calling them bad names and insulting them for their choices. A hypocrit and a potty-mouth and I wouldn't keep her as a friend. It would be excusable if it made me laugh, but I didn't crack a smile the whole time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst book on mothering. Ever.","review":"An unbelievably depressing and simplistic memoir of sorts by a woman who evidently finds her ineptitude as a mother hilarious, this book manages to make babies sound like a cross between cancer and the IRS. The constant references to drug use are sickening, and her aversion to natural processes disturbing. Note to the author: motherhood can be a blast, and not just because of the hormones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unoriginal","review":"The author isn't nearly as funny as she thinks she is. There is nothing new or original in this book. It's obvious that she just asked her friends to write rave reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you care about your child, choose another book!!!!!","review":"I cannot believe books like this are published!! If you want to be a great mom--DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!! Please check out the parenting books by Dr Sears or Our Babies, Ourselves by Meredith Small for good quality parenting advice and leave this book for your recycling!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"The truth is that I had higher expectations for this book considering the ratings that the book has gotten.Unfortunately,I was dissapointed. The writer is extremely informal.This was so distracting that I couldn't read any longer.I didn't think that she was funny I found her to be offensive and malinformed. Her writing style assumes that the reader is uneducated. Or a poor reader.There is a part on the book where she explains that not every woman bonds with her child immediately.And this is what happened to her.When she went to the doctor she was diagnosed with postpartum depression.But she never realized that the reason why she did not bond with the baby was because of the baby blues.New mommies when your baby is born there should be an immediate bond.It should only get stronger with time.I do not think that this is the best memoir out there for new moms."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it 0 stars if I could","review":"This book is a HUGE step backward in the promotion of breastfeeding. Honestly, I don't even want to waste my time reviewing it, it was such swill. The author states that if you decide to breastfeed and have difficulty, do not call La Leche League. As a proud LLL member, I could not imagine life without them. LLL is for nursing mothers, whether they have problems or not. It is mother-to-mother support. What new mother wouldn't want to be supported?Instead of showing breastfeeding mother the other side of the spectrum, the author makes us stand proud and realize how clear it is that she, herself, was formula-fed and that's why she has no brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest book ever","review":"This book had me laughing the entire time... I wouldn't say that this is a reference guide of any sort. It's just a funny book that says most things we are thinking but just prob won't say outloud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"laugh out loud funny. The worst part about this book is that it had to end. A must-read for any new or expectant mommy. Wish I'd read it earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to keep it for myself!","review":"I just received this book. Its for my sister, a new mommy to be. I read through it a bit and enjoy the sense of humor. I want to keep it to read first, lol. I think she's really going to enjoy it. I had to scour the internet to find a book for her that wasn't one of those typical preachy \\"do or die\\" baby books, which I'm sure she'll receive plenty off. This should be a nice reprieve in the midst of her upcoming (happy)madness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! Great seller!","review":"great seller! great book- beyond funny and light hearted for new moms to be. I laughed so hard out loud several times!fast shipping too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and entertaining","review":"I bought this book wanting something funny and entertaining while I wait for the arrival of my baby. I laughed and laughed throughout the whole book. The author is funny and she takes you through situations that come up in every moms life. I also bought her other book \\"Nap time is the new happy hour\\". And fell in love with it too. I definitely recommend this to mom's who want a fun easy read with lots of laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"Stefanie Wilder-Taylor's book \\"Sippy Cups are Not for Chardonnay\\" is a refreshing find in the world of baby texts and parenting narrative. Straightforward, modern, and completely human, Wilder-Taylor's take on motherhood is a great find for first-time-moms and veterans alike. You won't agree with everything she has to say, but the beauty of the narrative is that you don't have to - one woman offers her experience as a new mother, and shows that not everything has to be \\"by the book.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"This book is a fast read and I did chuckle here and there. But I don't understand why Wilder-Taylor is so disparaging towards mothers who had births they feel great about, enjoyed breastfeeding and co-sleeping, choose to homeschool, use cloth diapers or make their own babyfood.I was looking forward to reading this knowing she has a large following and I usually enjoy \\"Mama lit,\\" but the writing is flat and uninspiring. She certainly does not foster any sense of inclusion within mothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical!!!","review":"I laughed so hard reading this book that tears came to my eyes and my stomach hurt the next day. Witty, irreverant and down-to-earth. Having just gotten through the first year as a new mother, and finding that raising a baby \\"ain't all that\\" at times, this book was the perfect remedy. It's great reassurance that yes, you are normal if you don't always enjoying every aspect of raising your child and no, it doesn't mean you don't love your kid or are a bad mom. I highly recommend this book, especially for moms with kids around a year, as they will inevitably relate to what the author is going through. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, someone understands!!","review":"I'm so glad that Stephanie wrote this book...it's the best laugh I've had in the five months since my baby was born. I was rolling around on the floor--well, practically--my husband was so happy to see me laugh again that ppl would have thought he was high (kidding, he wasn't). Though I didn't care for all the language and humor, I still fully recommend this book because it's so hilarious and REAL. When was the last time a book was written about motherhood that was REAL?? Huh??? One that admits that breastfeeding doesn't work for everyone and that the parenting philosophy books are NUTS? I loved this book!! Go buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"new mom\\" book - honesty, humor","review":"Any \\"New Mom\\" book that is written with humor and honesty is OK is my book! Ms Wilder's book is refreshing, honest, and funny on many topics \\"new mom\\" related. She discusses many issues a \\"new mom\\" will encounter. She starts with the issue of \\"instant bonding\\" - what a relief to know that I was not only one to take a few weeks to fall in love. From there she discusses other biggie \\"new mom\\" topics - the realities of breastfeeding, bottle feeding, baby-blues, feeding solid foods, babysitters, venturing out with your newborn, other new mothers, handling friends without children, sex after baby, A-type mommies, and different parenting styles, and much more. This is a book you can read at one sitting or one topic at a time. The author's honest, witty style is engaging and entertaining, and I suspect will give many \\"New Moms\\" a peaceful night's sleep.It Gets Easier!: And Other Lies We Tell New Mothers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny & Informative","review":"This book is laugh out loud funny because it's so true! The chapter about the author's first Mommy & Me encounter is priceless. No book has better expressed the mixture of joy, dread, happiness and horror felt by new parents. It's like Kubler-Ross for the Kebbler Elves set. I raise my sippy cup to Ms. Wilder-Taylor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The strangest \\"what to expect\\" book ever written","review":"This is perhaps the strangest \\"what to expect\\" book ever written. A funny and irreverent look at new parenthood, combined with some practical advice. Along the way she skews übermoms, parenting fads, crazed \\"lactivists\\" (the kind of folks who think kids should be breast fed until college) and her own attempts at parenthood. If you are expecting, have kids, vaguely remember having children at some point, or just thinking about it, this is a book for you.And do not be put off by the title; fathers will enjoy the book too.Be warned, however, that it is a bit on the raunchy side, so if you are squeamish about those things, find another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very choppy and kind of angry","review":"I picked this up after reading It Sucked and Then I Cried because I'm a new mom and I've been enjoying the \\"Mommy Books.\\" This book wasn't really worth it for more than $5 though. It's basically a collection of short essays almost all of which I feel was the author complaining about being a Mom and it was a very choppy read. There were some parts that were mildly funny but for the most part, you could hear this stuff if you just went out with a fellow Mommy girlfriend and had a glass of wine (or whine). I also felt that some of her text was polarizing. Moms come in many forms and while one Mom might not do something that another Mom would, I don't really care for any Mom passing judgment on another or making jokes at their expense. This author talked about being a Mom like being back in high school and the way she wrote the book was exactly like that: childish."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is offensive!","review":"Yes, Ms. Wilder-Taylor does point out the more amusing aspects of pregnancy and motherhood, however her approach is not impressive. She needs to take her vulgar language and drinking habits back to the trailer park and leave the writing to someone with a lot more tact."},{"rating":"1","title":"You lost me at: there's no such thing as love at first sight...","review":"I was very excited to read this book after reading the great reviews. However, I couldn't even finish the second chapter about how there is no such thing as love at first sight, even with your baby. I absolutely fell in love at first sight with my baby, and I didn't care to read on as she claims that moms who say they fall in love at first sight are either high or lying to themselves. I'm not saying there is a problem if you don't fall in love at first sight, but she's pretty adamant that it's impossible. She's too opinionated for me. I returned it before I even finished the 2nd chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potty Mouths Are Not for Authors","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, but after reading a few pages of gratuitous cursing, I closed the book. I admit that Wilder-Taylor is funny, but I personally got distracted by the foul language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desparately needed this therapeutic book","review":"I so want to hang out on a play date with this author. She so gets what it takes to be a good mother and how to realistically deal with issues while enjoying the short time that one has with their children. Thanks for the laughs! This mother of twins desparately needed this book for therapeutic relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny!","review":"Hilarious! A tell-all book for real moms. If you are a mother, plan to be a mother, know a mother, or just need a good laugh, read it! With perfectly written, short chapters, its the type of book you can throw in your bag for a spur of the moment read. If you are the type of mother who wears T-shirt's that say \\"Taylor's mom\\" and drive a mini van with those family stick-figure stickers on the back..you may want to skip it...on the other hand...I take that back...you should read it! Do us all a favor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did I write this book?","review":"I bought this book hoping to hear a different spin on first-time parenting and I wasn't disappointed. I really really enjoyed this book -- she wrote about things that pop up in my brain all of the time. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really laugh out loud funny - if you are open minded....","review":"I just finished this book and it literally made me laugh out loud through out the entire book. Wilder-Taylor is absolutely hilarious and reminds me of some of the girls I hang out with. I didn't agree w/ everything she said, but even then, I didn't take offense - it was too funny to take offense.. Definitely a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Voice!","review":"Stefanie Wilder-Taylor is a great new voice in parenting that is honest, funny, & refreshing. I'd love to have a playdate with her family.PS I am no relation even though we are both Wilder than average."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe she got paid to write this!","review":"I just have to say, I barely review anything but had to comment on this book..that's how strongly I felt about it.First of all, this is better than 'Dirty Little Secrets,' which was something more suitable for a website than a book! Second, this author just loves to complain about baby products that didn't work for her (as if they would never work for anyone else) and only wants to promote her way. I might have found her funny if she was a bit humble about her opinions. Her husband must be a publisher because she doesn't even write well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will make you laugh on the worst days!!","review":"I received this book when I was 5 months pregnant, and I loved it then, but now that my daughter is 6 months old, it takes on a whole new meaning. The author is one of the few brave enough to write about the good bad and the ugly of being a new mom. Some of her expierences are a lot worse than mine, but that just makes me laugh (and feel really lucky). I've given this book to 3 of my \\"new mommy\\" friends. They all love it. ALSO, my husband, who is a physician, read parts of the book, too (the parts I just had to share with him) and he loved it, too. THIS BOOK IS A GREAT GIFT FOR NEW MOMMY'S, OLD MOMMY'S, NEW DADDY'S, OLD DADDY'S, AND EVEN GRANDPARENTS WHO NEVER HAD BOOKS LIKE THIS WHEN THEY WERE NEW PARENTS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good laugh for mommies","review":"This book made me remember that its ok to laugh at the way I used to think about things before I became a mommy. The things we obsess about are insane and unrealistic at best. Motherhood is not easy and any fun we can find even if it is laughing at ourselves is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sippy cups...","review":"Simply put, this book is just hilarious!! I love that her opinions aren't sugar coated like other books I've read.

Good read for those of us who question our parenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple and Overdone","review":"This book takes all the normal cliches and overplays the jokes - it's dumbed down \\"entertainment\\" that's not all that entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful","review":"I am not a fan of this book, and I definitely do not recommend it.I think this has got to be one of the most negative books I've ever suffered through ... the only reason I finished it was so I could legitimately review it.I love the big Motherhood Reveal that some authors do so well (Celia Rivenbark, for example) where they let you know that it's not all kittens and sunshine. No one's trying to be June Cleaver, but this author is just so awful. Her writing is so bland and stupid - same safe \\"funny\\" motherhood jokes that we hear from the likes of Ben Mulroney and Billy Bush, where it's just so ubiquitous, you feel like she's just a writer on Access Hollywood or something.I'm not going to be tagging it as \\"humor\\" because you know ... it isn't funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Stefanie Wilder-Taylor is a breath of fresh air with her brutal honesty of what new Mom's face. She is funny, funny, funny!

As others have mentioned, her breastfeeding section is just sad. If the author wants to use formula, that's fine. No reason to bash moms who nurse.Can't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive? Yes. Funny? No","review":"This book was not funny at all. I consider myself an open person. If a mother wants to breastfeed, then she should breastfeed. If she prefers formula, then use formula. There can even be a happy medium (I used both). This book made breastfeeding mothers sound like selfish, nosey, busybodies who have nothing better to do than dish out unwanted advice. It implied that mothers who chose to use formula were victims. I found the material and language to be offensive and insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk","review":"Like many others who have reviewed this sprinkler, I hold the opinion that it is junk. I paid extra because of the claim of \\"all metal\\" and the lifetime warranty. Within the first few uses, it stopped oscillating. Will work for a couple of hours and then gets stuck. I'd avoid this one. In fact, I doubt I'll be inclined to buy anything from this company. If this is their top of the line model, how good can the cheap stuff be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No dam good Sprinkler","review":"I bought this sprinkler at Home Depot and used it a few times last year (2011).

It is very frustrating to start watering an area and then return to find that your sprinkler is stuck in one position and has failed at its intended job.

Reliability counts so avoid these products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Good, Doesn't Hold Up","review":"I am a bit disappointed, and my grass is brown. I bought this sprinkler a few years ago. It worked well for the first 2 or 3 seasons, but wasn't oscillating properly last summer. I called Melnor and they were very kind. Because of the warranty, they offered to send me a new gear or replace my sprinkler. I chose to have my sprinkler replaced. I hope that this newer version holds up for more than 3 summer seasons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked once - dropped on lawn - then didn't work","review":"Spent a little more at HD for this American assembled product. First use was impressed - I liked the coverage and adjustability. But second use - the oscillating feature stopped working. I had dropped the product on the lawn as I was screwing it onto the hose. Very dissappointed. Called MELNOR customer service - left phone number on voicemail, but no callback. Based on these other reviews - I'm returning it.

I assumed that the motor would be as well built, but I was seriously mistaken. As other reviewers have written, the motor ceased oscillating and began to \\"stick\\" less than a month after purchase. Talk about annoying! Needless to say, I returned this sprinkler for a refund, and bought a cheaper, yet more reliable oscillating sprinkler at a fraction of the cost. This is the second Melnor product that I've owned that has performed poorly, and after this experience I will certainly avoid purchasing any more of their \\"junk\\". I would recommend the same to all others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I bought two of these and neither works properly.

After a room addition last summer, my yard was a disaster. At one point, I had all four sprinklers going (not at the same time), utilizing timers for them. Yes, my water bill hurt. Still, because these sprinklers are reliable and easy to adjust, I have a beautiful bluegrass lawn again. You do have to keep the nozzles clean, using the tool provided, a very easy and effective device. Most oscillating sprinklers from other manufacturers last a few weeks at best. I have never had a problem with a Melnor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great if it actually oscillated","review":"What a piece of junk. I bought this sprinkler from Home Depot. It was one of the most expensive ones they had, and it looked like it was well built. After a few uses, however, it gets stuck and you have to shake it to get it to start oscillating again.

Wrong. I purchased this in May 2012, today is July 15, 2012 and it won't oscillate anymore. If water pressure is the issue as stated in another review, why did it work for 2ish months and then suddenly stop working? Yes, I made sure the screen at the hose connection was clean.

I thought when it did not rotate that it might have something hanging it up so, I bought a water filter and added it to the line. That was a waste of money also! The sprinkler would rotate back and forth very well for a few rotations and then it would hang up, I then would pick it up and bump it a time or two and it would work fine for a few rotations and hang up again, then I would start over again. Finally I got tired of staying outside just so the lawn could get watered.

Get into an accident and you'll see a cool replay of the indicent and be shown an insurance estimate for the damage :)The courses are reasonably long, but the game itself can be completed pretty quickly (just a few days in my experience).

He lives in terrible poverty in a very wet, dieseased, dirty Ireland, and loses siblings left and right. This book will dry up every ounce of water in your body and make you laugh terribly hard at the same time. The sorrow Frank McCourt goes through is unimaginable, but still seems to include humor into his book. The sing songy way of writing and the run on sentences have a poetic way about them.

I am sure Frank McCourt is enjoying his success. The presentation of dialogues has been done in a very peculiar fashion - an unorthodox way for sure.

I think a lot of people didn't like the book, either because they were expecting a delicate, sugar-coated tale of his childhood or simply because the story forced them to evaluate how many things they took for granted in their own childhood. Guilt can be a terrible thing...Also, how can anyone say that there was too much sadness? This is an ACTUAL account of someone's life.

There were too many victims and too much sickness in this book for me to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving downer of a book","review":"Very slow read. I found it hard to get into because the same things kept happening to Frank, (hunger, drunk father, poor home life)but the only thing that changed was his age. Read it in my book club and none of us really liked it. We watched the movie and it was okay, but it skipped a lot of the story and the order of things that occurred in the book were not the same as in the movie. The movie gave the mother more of a voice and made the viewer want to feel sorry for the father-the book did the opposite. My opinion: don't bother with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ma's drunk and pa's crying","review":"chapter 1 pa's drunk and ma's crying and the little wee ones have soiled themselves. it's raining here in limerick. i.chapter 2 ma is sitting by the fireplace crying. so i go down to the pub and there is pa. he is drunk.chapter 3 so we go to america. tis a wonderful place. it might rain in limerick but it gets godawful cold in new york. and by the way, pa is drunk and ma is crying by the fire and the little wee ones have bees knees and thrushes ankles before them on the supper plate. i."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, some mistakes made by McCourt","review":"Angela's Ashes is definately a worthwhile book to read. He takes us through his childhood, good or bad, both perspectives are shown. (Although hardly anything good had happened to him) Sharing his life with us was truly an experience and I admire him for doing so.On the flip side, this book lacked an ending. \\"I'm in america\\"- The end. I think he should have also focused a bit more on his mother Angela as he did entitle the book after her. I also think he was constantly repititive in every chapter, \\"Oh my dad drank all his dole money away\\", \\"We are poor\\", \\"excitement\\"I still give this book a 4 star rating because it was a good book, just some flaws that I personally think McCourt could have worked on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Effort! :-)","review":"I knew about this book long before I received it in my Christmas stocking late last month. This was a highly enjoyable, sometimes depressing/sad, book to read. I had to invent time to read this book. On the way to work, during lunch, between meetings, late in the evening. Well worth it! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and honest...","review":"I really truly didn't wish to read this book at first, wondering if i would find it to be both inspiring and entertaining in one package. I eventually picked it up off my \\"i'm going to read that later\\" shelf and just read it, finding it to be thought prevoking and beautiful. What surprised me greatly though...was it was also very amusing at times...it made me laugh. That was unexpected to say the least and it made the book more enjoyable and interesting to read. This book is beautiful and touching, and sometimes, when it makes you sad, you have to remind yourself that this is about a man's life...and it touches your heart even more. Worth the money...worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best you can get in written words.","review":"I laughed and cried at the same time, and after reading the last word I turned over to the first page and started reading all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare book that makes you laugh and cry at the same times.","review":"Frank McCourt's story of growing up in beyond povertyin Ireland catches the reader's attention and heartalmost immediately.

This is a true story, and during that time life washard, very hard. His descriptions from a child'sviewpoint never cease to amaze the reader -- how many of uscould write from the perception of a child, and do it sowell.

I first heard of the book during an interview McCourt did on television; my reading of the book was an echo of his voice telling his story. I loved this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank McCourt in Boston","review":"I went to a reading at the Boston Public Library last night, where I had the pleasure of hearing Mr. McCourt read aloud several passages from his unforgettable book. I was struck, not only by his gracious, almost shy manner as he addressed the crowd, but also by the awesome intellect he obviously possesses.During a brief question and answer session, he revealed that he is, indeed, writing another book. He also explained that \\"Angela's Ashes\\" was a title he came up with when he intended the book to extend through his adult years. The reference is to his mother's cremation and his subsequent trip to Ireland where he scattered her ashes.Mr. McCourt is a genius with words, \\"like jewels in my mouth\\" and I can only thank him for having the courage to expose his desperate past for our enlightenment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly one of the best books I have ever read!!!!!","review":"I could not put this book down. My entire book club adored it and we had our most in depth discussion about poverty, childhood, and parenthood."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Poverty Survival Guide","review":"Via his childhood memories, Frank McCourt offers a poignant, unflinching view of a poverty so grinding and oppressive as to certainly be almost unimaginable by most readers. Indeed, I had to frequently remind myself that the years described were endured not in some pestilential Victorian-era slum, but in the mid-1900's. My only criticism is the lack of an epilogue to the story. What ever happened to the elder Malachy McCourt, Frank's father, a devastating example of a life wasted by alcohol abuse and a peculiar melancholy which is endemic, I suspect, to the Irish? And Angela, Frank's mother, a sure candidate for sainthood if measured by her daily struggles to keep her children fed and alive? I hope God blessed Angela's ashes and rewarded her with riches in heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down.","review":"Makes me glad my ancestors got the hell out of Ireland. I couldn't put this book down. When I woke up in the morning, I had to find out more. Disappointing at the end. Whatever happened to his father, mother? After reading this book, I can't stand the thought of wasting food. It made me much more grateful for what I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless","review":"Several members of my family have been after me for two years to read this book. I am an avid reader and had so many great literary works (and a few trashy novels) on my list that it took me this long to get to it (despite near tears, threats and bribes; they were desperate for me to read it.) Well, I picked up and devoured it in its entirety the same day. Yup, it was indeed everything they had promised it would be and more. I think I'll go read it again. Best piece of writing I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing! Thanks to you all for keeping after me about it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"If you enjoyed Angela's Ashes, the next book you read would have to be My First Cousin Once Removed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"Don't let the title fool you. This is no chick book. It's the gritty biographical story of a boy growing up in the desparately poor conditions of WWII Ireland. The writing style is unsual, but the story is compelling. This is real history, not fiction. I will admit the title put me off from reading for years, but a recent NPR review at the time of the author's death changed my mind. I'm glad it did. I'll never see Ireland (or England) in quite the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my opinion I thought the book was Great!","review":"My Great Grand Mother came over from Ireland. I've heard stories and could never really imagine what the environment was like. This book is a true memoir which is:1. A memorial account; a history composed from personal experience and memory; an account of transactions or events (usually written in familiar style) as they are remembered by the writer. 2. A memorial of any individual; a biography; often, a biography written without special regard to method and completeness. 3. An account of something deemed noteworthy; an essay; a record of investigations of any subject; the journals and proceedings of a society."},{"rating":"2","title":"A childhood that many of us share","review":"I was amazed to learn that Mr. MCourt and I shared so many childhood memories even though we grew up in different countries and in a different generation. It was comforting to now be able to laugh at some of the situations that used to make me cry. And to know that it is possible to succeed no matter what our past bestows on us is inspiring. Thank you, Mr. McCourt, for making it clear that humor can be found even in the worst childhoods."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very Special View on Ireland","review":"I liked McCourt's book for its realism and humor. I have to admit, that I've never been to Ireland. But maybe because of that I hold a certain perspective of how paradiselike a life on the \\"Green Island\\" may be, of people mainly happy, drinking their guinnes making good music like the Corrs or Clannad. McCourt robs you any illusion of that kind, and shows you a different life in poverty and misery, where even a supposed nationalistic heroism has no place as it doesn't provide any food or human housing either. Written from the perspective of a growing up teenager, who wonders about things happening around, the book never gets into severe a mood but always plays with a fine and sublime sense of humor. This may be nothing for those who cannot stand description of human misery less for those who cannot stand smiling at it. It may even disturbing for those who still want to hold an ideal picture of Ireland. I rather smiled and was delighted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie","review":"This book is humorous and sad at the same time. Oh and watch the movie too...it's really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I am amazed that Frank is still alive after suffering through all of the consequences of extreme poverty -- but he definitely takes the easy road at the end of the book. I got so sick of hearing about his self-indulging habits. I don't care if this is an integral part of the male species, I don't want to hear about it over and over again -- that's not why I started reading the book. How did this poverty affect the rest of his life? How did this poverty affect his family relationships later in life? I hoped there was so much more to this story but I was very disappointed. I can't believe that this won a Pulitzer Price. It just goes to shows how the standards have changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good, the bad and the ugly; mostly ugly!!!","review":"This could have been a fascinating story if the prose had been cleaned up a bit. Also when refencing family members in general and his mother in particular, Mr.McCourt was quite indelicate and defamatory in his discription of certain actions which should not have been included in the narrative. His own sins of the flesh were of no interest to me and he should feel shame and dishonor for disclosing them to the world. I am aware of the poverty during the depression and I had known many Irish American families during that trying time having become buddies with their sons and I can definitely say,no matter their poverty, personal hygien, in so far as the times and circumstances would allow, was never wanting. Mr. McCourt should have been more circumspect. He will make millions from this book but he should also feel quite uneasy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous!","review":"What a wonderful book; rich, colorful and spirited.

Yet in the face of daily struggles to fulfill this most basic need, Frank McCourt writes with a nakedness to the soul where independence, pride and interpersonal struggles abound. In the spirit of striving for a better life, Frank Mccourt struggles with his father's dependence on alcohol and his mother's co-dependency in a time much changed than our own. The story's end comes quickly, but fortunately, there is more in his next tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"exellent praise","review":"i thought frank mc court's book anglea's ashes was outstanding. he wrote the book in such a way that it made you feel as if you were experiencing his childhood with him. it goes into great detail, and this book is also very emotionally strong. it deals with poverty, starvation and death. i highly recommend this book to those who like autobiographys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it and didn't want it to end!","review":"a very interesting book!

I find Irish people interesting, and therefore concluded that this book would be also. As soon as I began reading \\"Angela's Ashes\\" I could not put it down. This book is moving, touching, and as I said in the title of my review, humbling. I read the second book, \\"Tis, A Memoir\\", and I have the upmost regard for Frank McCourt. I will steadfastly wait for another novel from Mr. McCourt. I thank him for sharing his past with us, and now feel more appreciative for my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better heard than read.","review":"I bought Angela's Ashes after hearing Frank McCourt read from it on the radio. Over the radio, it was like the bedtime story you hoped would never end. This is because McCourt is the consummate Irish story teller.Unfortunately, in print, the same story is bleak and largely devoid of the magic Frank McCourt brings to it in the telling. So, if you haven't read Angela's Ashes yet, see if it is available on tape. If so, buy it and save yourself the unpleasantness of encountering this trying story without Frank McCourt as your personal guide. It's like the difference between canned asparagus and fresh."},{"rating":"1","title":"as engaging as a debutante's hangnail","review":"A Pulitzer???! Was the prize committee out getting pie-eyed with Frank's father when they came up with this one?This book was readable, but it sure took a lot of effort.

I look forward to learning more about Frank and his family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of misery overcome by innocent hope.","review":"The woe of a childhood so incredibly dysfunctional yet expertly brought to life by McCourt makes Angela's Ashes a compelling read. I can't wait for \\"'Tis\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing life, led by an amazing man.","review":"If you didn't think someone could live as poorly as the McCourts did and survive past childhood, this book would be a real revelation. A fatalist would read this remarkable story as a great, depressing tragedy. An optimist, on the other hand, would recognise the wonderful humor and love of life that kept these little boys going. They are true survivors, in spite of and as a result of their incredible beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Memoir of Faith and Hope","review":"McCourt's hellish surroundings and bright spirit continually play off each other in a tension that keeps you turning the pages. Will his childlike faith in God carry him through his next defeat? Will he succumb to the misery? It is certainly not a book for the weak in spirit. I was tempted to lay it down because of the sheer multitude of extreme situations, especially in regard to his father, but I kept reading - out of my own sense of hope I guess. I found most of the book to be believable, except for his sexual experiences. These seemed to be more personally redemptive and fantasy oriented than realistic. It made me question his character and pity him somewhat; Whereas before I strongly admired him and applauded his painstaking honesty and depth. Because of this incongruence, I gave the book a 4 rather than a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Tis a Marvelous Book!","review":"Angela's Ashes portrays the events of a young boy, Frank McCourt, from his early childhood through age nineteen. It tells of the family's hardships and heartbreak, and although the novel could be incredibly depressing, the author's insight makes the book universal, and makes the particular relavent to all. I enjoyed the details about Irish life during the depression, and the ways that people survived, and tried to keep their dignity even on the precipice of despair and death. The prose is imaginative and the dialogue quite memorable. I read this book in a day because it was so intriguing, and I bet that you'll enjoy it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply perfect.","review":"A stunning piece of work. I laughed and cried throughout, and I would recommend this to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing but I'm not Irish","review":"I really wanted to enjoy this book based on the high praise it has, almost universally, received. But I found it difficult to read, given both the subject and, more importantly, the narrative voice. That voice might have appealed to me in a short story but wore thin over 60 pages, when I gave up. That's the point at which I realised the style wasn't going to change as Frank grew up--he wasn't just speaking in the voice of a child. I skimmed forward over the rest, which seemed to drone on.But then, I've never appreciated Ulysses either"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best without a doubt","review":"I really thought this book was excellent. The way Frank managed to change his tone and style as he grew older in the book was great. It's hard enough to get one style right!I really enjoyed his sense of humour too, particularly when God was all over his grandmother's backyard!Hopefully, this is the end of whatever hardship he came across. Fair play te ya Frank!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Haven't Cried And Laughed This Much In So Long...","review":"I first read this book when it first came out. Since then, I have read it like five times. The first time I read it, it left a lasting impression on my mind that has not left since then and it still does it for me. I found his life fascinating. The fact that he had such a complicated childhood and still managed to find so much humor in all of it, is somewhat bizarre, but human. I did not know if I was supposed to laugh or to cry at certain times, but what captivated me the most was his sincerity. A sincerity that I had not found in a book since J.D. Salinger. Completely different authors, but both very honest about life. I wish everyone in the world would get a chance to read this book, it is truly special."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK IVE EVER READ","review":"Simply, an irresistable book you can not stand to put down for one moment.

A MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"WOW! That just about sums it up. This book was incredible, everyone should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpeice To The End","review":"Frank McCourt displayed the truths of harsh poverty through a child's eyes. I didn't know when to laugh or to cry! He satirizes many things because he doesn't know better being a child. The McCourt family were very poor and many times, their childrens' hunger was so much that they died from it. I am still amazed that four children lasted through that childhood. This book is a realistic depiction of life in Ireland in the time of war and it kept me very amused. I never wanted to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"This memoir left me with a greater understanding of humanity","review":"Frank McCourt's story of growing up in poverty touched me deeply. I read this book through and later sat back and thought about how hard his life was. Yet, McCourt never makes the reader \\"feel his pain\\". Instead, a reader comes away laughing and crying at the unbelievable situations the McCourts found themselves in. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Firstly: we already know how the story ends, though we may not know how the book ends. He grows up, writes a boo-hoo story, and gets rich. It may be too late since it's been out for a long time and made into a movie and all that, but if it's not too late: DON'T READ THIS BOOK. Secondly: I don't know how it won the Pulitzer. It was not well written. Thirdly :It was so boring I couldn't finish it. Granted, great books are often boring. Moby Dick, for example. Took me weeks to read that, but at least it was WELL WRITTEN. My dad said \\"give it time, it gets better.\\" I said, You mean sadder? \\"yeah, that's what I mean.\\" Give me a break. Let's all feel sorry for rich Frank McCourt who has more money than we've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand?","review":"I was so disappointed by this book, especially the ending. I don't understand why people rave about this book. In my opinion it was poorly written, and exaggerated. I'm not doubting he had a tough life, but come on! I was anxious to finish the book so I could see the movie.. but now I don't even want to see it.Don't waste your time reading this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Reader","review":"I am only giving this book one star as I was so disappointed in its content. It starts out slow and I would have put it down had I known the ending at the beginning. The author makes one feel something with real meaning is coming, but it never does. He does do an excellent job of describing the poor and the hard times they had which makes one want to cry and weep over the misery of that period. However, he puts so much sexual content in it that I don't think is necessary. Over half of the book I would say involves sexual overtones, and I am just don't think all that vivid description is necessary. I think the author has never really gotten over that aspect, and that is probably why it comes out so much in the book. Maybe this was his cartharsis, and if so, then I understand and hope it brought healing. I am glad so many enjoyed it, maybe I am the oddball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abject misery.... and that's just the reader!!","review":"If I could give this book a minus-5 star rating, I would. I absolutely HATED it!! and I didn't even get past the 6th disk... with 6 more to go, no less!! After listening to hour after hour of pain, poverty, hunger, filth, and misery, to say \\"I'm enjoying the experience\\" would be a lie. In my opinion, some books just should not be written, like Stephen King's _Misery_, for example, or Nevada Barr's _Hard Truth, and I think this is one of those. Based on this book alone, I'll never read or listen to another Frank McCourt book as long as I live."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so happy to find out it was not true.","review":"McCourt is a brilliant writer and on that basis alone this is a worthwhile read even though I always felt it was biased against Irish-Catholicism. Oh, well that's fair game in a memoir. So why one star? The book pretends to be a biography. There is now an overwhelming amount of evidence that Ashes is a fictional novel loosely based on boyhood anxieties. McCourt may have intended this as a literary device but I'm sorry a lie is a lie is a lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad.","review":"This book offers no real story except that the author grew up poor and did terrible things while he was young. It is a waste of time and money. My son had to read it in an English class and I was sorry that he did. It is not a book for young people or anyone else.What is really sad is that it has won any awards at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Baffled at All the Praise","review":"After 52 pages, I had to stop reading. My free time is too precious. And I feel terrible about the money spent -- I now have a renewed commitment to use the library.If you want to read an intelligent, compelling memoir I'd highly recommend Jill Ker Conway's \\"The Road from Coorain.\\" And an absolutely incredible book about diaries and memoirs is Alexandra Johnson's \\"The Hidden Writer.\\" Another great memoir is Kathleen Norris's \\"The Cloister Walk.\\" These are just a few that come to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but boring","review":"I found this to be a well written book but hopelessly boring. Just when you think his life couldn't have been any worse as a child, things got worse. There was no end to it. I pushed through to the end and was dissatisified with the hollow feeling this book left me with.Again, if a depressing book with little plot variation interests you I would recommend this one because McCourt turned out a quality product. I just need a little more variety in the plot to satisfy me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrical and beautiful, NOT","review":"An alcoholic father drinks all his familiy's welfare money and causes the deaths of the majority of his children through malnutrition-related diseases. The mother doesn't object to this; in fact, she does nothing except smoke and have more kids. This is the entire story.It is not lyrical and beautiful; it is simply squalor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about the Irish I know","review":"I did not like this book at all and I cannot believe that so few people share my opinion. Mr Mc Court's description of the Irish people does not fit at all with those I have been acquainted with since I married into an Irish family 40 years ago. The Irish I know are all very dignified people, they respect themselves and others, they are sincerely religious, albeit somewhat parochial, they raise their children with a great sense of morality, and I must say Irish women especially are strong, hard working and very honest. There was not one person in this book who had any redeeming value whatsoever. I have to admit that it was extremely well written, the description of poverty was well rendered in all it's abject truth. So maybe this book was Mr. Mc.Court very personal experience, it does not represent the Irish as a whole. What are Angelas'ashes ? What fell from her many cigarettes? Why did this book get such a high prize?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time.","review":"The rave reviews are a joke, right? How about turning a monkey loose with a word processor."},{"rating":"1","title":"So why all the fuss?","review":"After reading this book, I am at a complete loss as to why this book has won the awards, critical praise, and popular attention that it has. I found it unrelentingly grim, with little in the writing style, characters, or plot to make it worthwhile. The descriptions of events were telegraphic and concrete, with little psychological nuance or depth. Normally, a book about such dismal topics would leave one sad and moved; this book left me cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick!

I forced myself to read the entire thing eventhough I found I could only read a few pages at a time before I fell asleep entirely.

He transports us into a painful story written in the voice of a young man as he grows up. The quality, the beauty of the words evolve as he becomes older and wiser. That is the sheer beauty of this book. McCourt's genius is that he is able to change the voice with the passing of time.I recently had dinner with a bunch of Irish folks who were in the US and some were very defensive and critical of the book. Saying that \\"such poverty never existed.\\" Yeah right! More reason to get this book.Do yourself a favor. Read it! And, give it as a present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thi is an amazing book!","review":"\\"Angela's Ashes\\" presents a kind of poverty which is almost unfathomable in modern times. Yet, it never dwells on the misery. This story is told by a child who never loses heart, hope, or the ability to survive, despite seemly insurmountable odds.

I bought the book because it was The Strand's (bookstore in Manhattan) number one seller, plus a Pulitzer winner, so I figured I'd give it a try. I still don't undertand what all the hype was about. I guess if you were dirt poor and Irish at one time, then you could relate-but I got NOTHING from this book-not even an entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? How Did that End?","review":"This book was great right up until the last few pages and then...WHAT? After that horrible childhood of poverty, he did WHAT? He steals money from a dead woman and gets HIMSELF out of poverty, leaving everyone else behind without so much as a fare-thee-well, has a tawdry fling with some low-lifes and decides that he has finally arrived? Didn't he learn anything at all from his mother's struggles?

I'd recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and heartfelt","review":"Frank McCourt's memories of his early childhood in NY and then eventually moving and growing up in Limerick, Ireland was something I truly enjoyed reading. The movie which I saw after reading this book did not have the heart the book had. Although McCourt grew up very poor, with an alcholic father who eventually abandoned the family, and a mother who tried her best, it was written and told very honestly and to the point without an ounce of self-pity, with such heart, nostalgia and care that even the nastiest of characters didn't seem all that nasty. I don't really know how to explain it but it was clear to me that though McCourt certainly had a miserable childhood you know he would never ever trade those experiences and those times with his family for a much better one if he was given the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am so indebted to Frank McCourt for writing this book.","review":"I really didn't need to write another review as there are already over 1200 here, but I couldn't help it. I have to make sure everyone knows that this book touched me more than anything else I have ever read.I was a little nervous about reading Angela's Ashes at first because I thought it might be a little too depressing and harsh. Well, I was right, but I never counted on the incredible humor that this author is able to intertwine into the most miserable circumstances. So just as I feared, I cried out loud for these poor little children, but I also laughed out loud many times. What a talent to be able to write about such tragedy and sorrow and yet still manage to convey a sense of hope and redemption. I'm still wishing I could give that little boy and his brothers everything that I took for granted as a child - most of all, I just want to reach through the book and hug them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story so tragic it's funny.","review":"I finished Angela's Ashes yesterday but I didn't want to be done with it. I miss it already. Rarely do I find a story that stretches the lunch break (\\"Just one more page--then I'll go back.\\") and keeps me up late.

I particularly enjoyed the youthful Frank's perspective on faith and the Roman Catholic church in general as well as his naivete about many things in his young life. There were times where his degree of poverty exceeded what can be conceived by most and absorbed by many. Great ending, but a bit repetitive throughout in regards to the father's irresponsibility and the fixation on the unsanitary conditions, etc. A tragic yet envigorating tale, overall a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angela's Ashes","review":"I read the book. It is moving and sad, but I don't understand how the author won a Pulitzer Prize for it. It was difficult to wade through the first four chapters. It got easier, but only because I made up what I thought the dialog meant. You can't look in the dictionary for the meaning of many words used in the text. If I were Irish, born in the 1930's, I could probably appreciate the book much more. It is a rambling account of a poor Irish family... very sad... but??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but Funny","review":"Although angela's ashes is a really sad book, the author writes everything with a light sense of humor. And as much as he tells us about the hardships of his childhood and how tough life at home was, he doesnt fail to stick in a good anecdote or two about school or him and his brothers. I really enjoyed this book, and i think that the author did a really good job of getting a not so bright story across without making the book a total sob-fest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"When narrative style like this starts earning the Pulitzer Prize, I think I may begin to submit some of my high school students' creative writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as everyone says","review":"I read this book for my book club and it was a difficult and slow book to get through.

I never felt like their was a light at the end of the tunnel for him or this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT READ!!!!!! DO NOT READ!!!!!!","review":"This is a horrible book. And that is an understatement. It is more boring than watching paint dry. It is more depressing than a funeral. It is very repetitive. The entire book is the author complaining about his poor Irish childhood. Like anyone cares that he was poor as a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 out of 5 stars","review":"Looking at the endless series of 5 out of 5 star reviews makes me think this world is doomed.Everyone deserves a chance to earn a few dollars....Now the author of this book has had his, let's leave it at that. The man has passed the hat and wants for nothing; in fact, he still has his day job.A hollow echo of Irish life that harkens back more to Darby O Gill and the Little People than to anything real. The dialog is hollow and inane, the story line serves up one cliched scene after another. A thorough waste of time. No stars, not even a barren asteroid.Forget this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mc Courts book - the final word","review":"Anyone from Limerick who was listening to the local station last night or anybody listening to it on the internet would have heard Richard Harris, a contemporary of Frank Mc Court point out the inaccuracies in this book. Harris says that there was no misery because of the sense of community that surrounded and still surrounds the city of Limerick. Also it appears that Angela's ashes were lost by Malchy Mc Court on an Icelandic flight and are still probably in the lost luggage department of Kennedy airport. As to the book itself, I believe along with most of Limerick, Richard Harris and even Brian Friel has said that this book lacks any literary merit whatsoever.Angela Mc Court was often described as the angel of the lanes and was a big heavy woman and not a waif like Emily Watson thogh Frank Mc Court himself said it brought a tear to his eye how much she reminded him of his mother.Don't buy this book if you want a good read. Buy it if you want a good fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I expected a great read...but was truly disappointed. Perhaps it is just me, but life is hard enough, I read for entertainment and this book was NOT entertaining. It was truly depressing and not inspirationsal. Do we all need to write about the sad times of our childhood to get a Pulitzer? Although I have read other stories of sad childhoods that have inspired me (such as \\"Alicia\\"), this one did not. Sorry..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Story, terrible writing style","review":"Angela's Ashes was a wonderful read for those of us who care little about long run on sentenses and poor punctuation. At the start of the book one empathises with the young Frank, but as one gets to know him a little better, one grows to dislike the selfish boy. The need to find out what happens next just about encourages the reader to keep reading despite the awful style. The need to keep reading was mainly due to interest in what happened in Limerick having heard first-hand stories from other parts of my home elsewhere in Ireland at that time. I wonder why he ever got a prize for this book! Don't hold this book as your only sample of \\"Irish\\" writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves a bad taste in my mouth","review":"Yuck, yuck and double yuck. After having seen the movie trailer while in the middle of reading Angela's Ashes, I stand amazed that this book has drawn such an avid audience (and no doubt the movie will too). The author spends so much time with graphic descriptions of hunger, poverty, disease and filth, but character development, growth, or even self-reflection barely surfaces in this book. I kept reading just to see who was going to die next. As for humor, maybe McCourt's reading on audio makes it funny, but the droll tongue-in-cheek humor that is often based on mockery and ignorance didn't even make me smile. At the end, turning to thievery and adultery could have even been a bit ironic, but in the drab context of his endless laundry list of \\"this happened, then this happened\\", it barely registers in this novel. Save your money. Save your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and depressing and not the Irish families I know!","review":"To say that Frank Mc Court's Ireland or that his Irish family are in any way a definition of the Irish is absurd! The McCourt tragedy was that they were poor, not that they were Irish or Catholic! To equate the McCourt's, their struggle,and vacuuous existience with THE Irish is a huge mistake.(One reviewer mentioned that her college class was given this as required reading...disturbing if this is going to be that student's ONLY link to the Irish!) It diminishes the many thousands of devoted, loving, religious, non alcoholic Irish who came to this country to raise their children in hope, dignity and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone deserves a chance to earn a few dollars....","review":"Now the author of this book has had his, let's leave it at that.A hollow echo of Irish life that harkens back more to Darby O Gill and the Little People than to anything real.

I'd heard how wonderful the book was and I actually enjoy slower, touching novels, but this one just didn't even seem worth the time I spent reading it. I didn't think the writing was very good. It was more like an endless, detailed list of all the tragedies that happened to these helpless kids and how no humane person ever tried to help them, especially their own parents and family. It was excrutiating reading it, with no redeeming value anywhere in sight."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Overrated Experience","review":"I dont know if it is just the current trend for all things Irish to be lapped up by an over-eager public but this book is hugely disappointing.My main complaint is the huge lack of charcterisation of the parents and also the saccharine sentimentalisation of the \\"emerald isle\\".No wonder people in Limerick were up in arms about it.

The book Angela's Ashes is an autobiographical assessment of the obstacles Frank went through as a boy growing up with an alcoholic father, strict family and religious values, and a never ending hunger for food and money. The value in this story is not through the tragedy but rather in the lessons taught through determination, hope, and love. This book is an inspiration to us all, proving anything is possible. It is well worth recognition and praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good","review":"This book gives an incredible depiction of what it was like to live during the Depression in both the US and in Ireland. It engages the reader from the beginning and pulls at their heartstrings as the story is told from the point of view of a young child who knows nothing else but poverty. I picked it up and never put it down. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why you should read Angela's Ashes","review":"I believe Angela's Ashes is a great story and very worthwhile to read. Frank McCourt's dreams of growing out of poverty and making a better life for himself sends the story on a whirlwind of tragedies and hilarious happenings. He is such a strong character for supporting his family, his dreams, and himself. Without Frank, I do not believe the McCourt's would have survived the way they did. His story is truly inspirational and proves that anything is possible as long as you keep your dreams alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is hope, after all","review":"So many people wrote already about this book! But, for me, a Brazilian working with children in a very similar family environment, it meant more than just of one of the best books that I have ever read.Ireland was once a very poor country, with little boys and girls struggling to succeed in a violent and difficult world. I wonder how many have succeeded indeed.Also I wonder how many Franks are out there, today, turning the pages of their every day lives without knowing what the end will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, Evocative, Poignant","review":"I resisted this book at first but soon was totally captivated by it. I think what I liked best was the fact that it is language, literacy and literature that rescues Frank from this abject poverty. I read it while preparing for an imminent trip to Ireland, and right on the heels of reading How the Irish Saved Civilization, so I feel steeped in Irish lore and life. For anyone who has turned to literature in order to deal with a life less than ideal, this book is a marvelous revelation"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Shipping!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I could not believe how fast I received this book.

I really appreciate and love the style of writing that mccourt used to tell his story. There was a lot of sadness to it, but great humor as well. After reading this, i realize my own upbringing wasn't so terrible. Certain members of his family were definitely not very caring or nice to him. but i think it was the way they showed they cared. mccourt has really had quite a life, and i thank him for sharing! for those who want to see the film, be sure to read the book first! it is so much better and reads more into everything the movie doesn't touch. but the movie is worth watching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Helps if You're Irish","review":"Angela's Ashes dragged me through the poorest streets of Ireland and I laughed through my tears the entire trip. I found the book very hard to read at first as I've never experienced Frank McCourt's writing style before. But I heard his distinct brogue and it comforted me and made me continue trekking through his often times difficult dialouge. In the end I was tortured that the book had ended but the story hadn't.Angela's Ashes is unlike any other story I've read, fiction or non-fiction. It's hard at times to believe it is an autobiography. Surely no one could have survived such a childhood.This book is a must read for anyone even remotely Irish - and all who wonder just how poverty affects our youngest citizens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"I finally bought this book after much deliberation.

Next day: He's hungry, mom isn't much help, dad spends the food money on booze. Next day: He's hungry, mom isn't much help, dad spends the food money on booze.

Yes, McCourt writes relatively well and his descriptions of his childhood experiences help the reader to vicariously experience 1/10 of his childhood sorrows. But Please,why oh why, did he have to drone on for almost 400 pages about snotty noses,his drunken father's alcoholic debauchery,yellow crude in his eyes, eating pigs heads.........A synopsis of his book should state, \\"today was miserable, tomorrow was miserable, and hey,guess what ?, the next day was miserable too!&quot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to give one and one-half stars","review":"This book is overrated and makes me wonder how McCourt got all those glowing reviews. My book club read this and most of us gave it less than one star. \\"Disappointing\\" was the word I heard the most as we discussed it. It was very hard to get through as far as I am concerned.

This book made my heart ache for the suffering little ones all over this world. A humbling experience to read and live this mans life. A story so real it will put you there and haunt you when you have finished. There were parts where I was in tears yet Mr. McCourt would somehow ease the readers pain, and I'm sure his own while writing, with a humor that made me laugh at loud. A story that will touch every emotion and stay in your heart and soul long after the books end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Experice of Poverty","review":"I enjoyed reading this book because it was a good example of growing up. McCourt does a good job of using a child-like voice and then transitioning as his character approaches adolescence. Even though his story was depressing at times, he has a way of keeping interest up through his clever and at times, sarcastic style. I also like how he used food as a motif to represent what kind of poverty he was experiencing. While I was reading it, I felt the hunger that he was describing with great detail. Overall, this book was a real view on a normal person's experiences of growing up and living with poverty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angela's Ashes is a saga of survival of the innocent..","review":"If writing is the art of manipulating the readers emotions then Frank McCourt has done a superb job in Angela's Ashes. The book had me crying and rolling with laughter - on the same page!! Nothing in my serene contemporary life has prepared me for the stark drama of this Irish family. However, the fact of not just survival but lives of excellence give credence to the theory that love conquers all. Any childhood spent in the throes of the helpless poverty of the McCourt family will either breed a contempt for civilized existence or a strong commitment for change. Angela and Frank made the difference - molding the strengths of their children into a determination to live, to love and help one another. Angela's Ashes is a lovely book - a great book altogether.

As ever the book wins hands down. Not a light read but enjoyable none the less.It is the writers memoirs of a poor upbringing mainly in Limerick. Does it really rain there contantly? The downstairs of the family is permanently flooded. The loss of siblings is described in a matter of fact way which emphasises its inevitability.It is not all gloom. There are moments of real humour - particularly the first communion where 'The Lord Jesus' becomes stuck in his throat and is subsequently vomited into the back-yard.As this is a memoir it is unclear how much is historically accurate. but it isn't a history book.I would have given it 5 stars but it was depressing in places.

We owned a pub in Limerick called the Windmill just directly opposite Windmill Street, and yes there was a family called the Keatings living in Windmill St, but I hasten to add this was the eighties. The stories of the Vincent De Paul are all true as I remember my times doing charity work for them, and helping people like Mrs. Mc Court. The pubs, the labour exchange, the school are all so life like, as if I could reach out and it was there, but my memories are of the eighties. Very little had changed since the 40's and I still remember the story of the women who picked up the coal from the dock road.

It focused on the mother's struggle and the father's carelessness, for the mother worked hard to feed her kids while the father got drunk and wasted the money. Frank Mccourt painted a vivid image of a restless childhood.It showed the creativity of the writer's knowledge on the subject. The book sums up the life of a typical immigrant who migrated in the year 1940."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and hart-breaking","review":"This book was a wonderfully written memoir. I truly enjoyed reading about Frank's life. I could NOT put the book down because I wanted to know what would happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful tale of a miserable life.","review":"I read one review in which the reader said it flat out stunk. I ask why, because it was a tale of misery or because you actually thought it was bad? This was a wonderfully written book about the life of an Irish Catholic boy. If you thought it stunk simply because it's true, than you must not know a marvelous read when you see one. Another reviewer said the sexual exploit at the end lost them. This was a story of his life and Frank McCourt can't simply leave instances of his life out because it may offend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous read!!","review":"I hindered my reading of Angela's ashes as I genrally enjoy books I relate well too. As I have never Had to deal with alcoholism around me, have never been to Ireland and am an only child, I felt this was going to be one impossible for me to relate too. I was wrong. I found that in enjoying this novel, i did not have to have been through the experiences he did, nor seen poverty so clearly. At no point did Frank want symapathy, he just told a harrowing and sad tale in a humorous and excellent way. He produced a beautiful novel from what was a shocking situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"In one word: BRILLIANT","review":"It's ultimately thrilling to read. An insightful, moving, humorous account of the early life of an Irish boy. It's beautifully written even in the parts where the subject matter is not-so-beautiful.This is the type of book you'd buy a copy for your boyfriend, your mom, your boss... but keep a copy for yourself to read and reread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angela's ashes","review":"Angela's Ashes is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a very fantastic novel about Frank McCourt's childhood in Ireland. Frank McCourt writes as if he's still a child. The reader feels with the little Frank. Sometimes the reader laughs about a funny scene and two minutes later he cries about the poor circumstances Frank lives in. So the novel evokes strong emotional feelings at the reader. To sum up : It's a must to read the book.You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"the product is pretty good as the description, well, it looks pretty new as well...

If you're a bit of Irish and/or Catholic, you will find a bit of yourself among McCourt's writing. I was moved to anger, compassion, and tears while reading this book. In spite of the McCourt's abject poverty, Frank McCourt manages to survive and tell his tale with warmth and humor. I had to keep looking at his picture on the jacket cover and saying to myself: \\"How did this man survive?\\" Required reading!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Angela's Ashes","review":"I ordered this amazing book and received it within just a few days and in EVEN in better condition than promised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. Even though McCourts life seemed like a never ending hell, the way he writes, he just doesn't seem to be mad at the world. I also liked how he never made himself out to be the \\"hero\\" of the story and included all of his flaws in his story telling. I must say the story is rather depressing, but McCourts wit and sarcasm relieves some of the empathy one would feel for the family. The book also made me realize how much I have and that I should be thankful for my gifts. It truly is a heart warming tale, in which you not only learn about a family's plight, but you also get to watch and learn how a boy grows up inspite of all his hardships and becomes a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"not yet read","review":"I haven't read this book yet but since it appears that most people liked it I'm going to give it a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And the point of this book is what?","review":"I couldn't even finish this boring, repetitive book. Yes, Frank McCourt had a horrible childhood, but that does not excuse his inability to write. His father was a drunk, his family was poor, his live was miserable...I got that from the first 20 pages, and then heard it over and over and over and over, etc... Not only is this book not worthy of any awards, it is not even worthy of being read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this cliche-ridden memoir written or published?","review":"I was raised by Irish Catholic parents, aunts, uncles, and nuns. Very few of the gripes or laments McCourt uses were new to me. His memoir is pure blarney. He may have had a rough childhood, but now he's trashing it for the filthy lucre. Can you imagine a book about a stingy Jew, a lazy African-American, or a stupid-but-libidinous Italian? Yet this slumming through Irish life has been a best-seller for two years. And it's not even the truth. McCourt should donate the proceeds to charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have another beer Frank","review":"I got through halfway the book and gave up. Where is the the NY Times number 1 bestseller? It was boring and the chapters were redundant. Dad loses his job. Dad comes home blammo. Dad makes us sing. Another sibling croaks. Come on did he have such a precise memory of his childhood? I don't even know what I did an hour ago. The only thing good about this book is Pop's taste in his brewskies. But then again, you probably can't get anything other than Guinness in Ireland. And Frank, you ever hear of \\"QUOTATION MARKS!?!?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have read a different book","review":"Sorry Mr. McCourt but I found your book unbearable. After 120 pages of Irish misery, (and those were a struggle) I finally admitted defeat. I understood about 10 pages in that McCourt Sr. was a chronically unemployed drunk who sired more children than he should have. Mrs. McCourt and children were left begging and searching for survival. But an interesting tale it did not make. Being of Irish anscestry, I tried very hard to like this book, but the endless repitition of stuggles against poverty proved too boring, despite my admiration that the author overcame his background to find success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here goes my top 500 rating...","review":"... It is a chronicle of a tragic childhood with a good dose of the macabre - the scene with the dead baby made me shiver. Though, having known a number of people from Ireland, I am aware that the Celts do tend to have a rather morbid side to their religious beliefs, most are not in the situation where ... their parents were anything like this pair. Don't read this one for humour - it is appealing only for those who are relieved to find that they could have done worse than they did with their own dysfunctional families."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very depressing account of childhood.","review":"I found this story very depressing, and in fact, did not finish the book. I figured if it was on the best seller list, it had to be good, right? Wrong.It was a little to raw for me to enjoy reading - disturbing actually. The writing itself is great, the subject matter was just rather dismal."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good.","review":"i have heard about this book for years and decided to pick it up at my paperback exchange store. i can't finish it. am a third of the way through, and it's all the same- poverty, starving children, abusive catholic teachers, alcoholic father, dead tired mother. it's just events. no character, nothing to grab onto. it's heartbreaking that this is life in so many places for so many people. but i already know that and see it. and contribute to help. i don't think it's worthy of a prize, it just seems a rambling narrative and nothing more. conditions like this need action, not reporting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"After reading Angela's Ashes, I consulted with an Irish bloke friend who said, \\"I grew up as a poor child in Ireland as well, but remember he wrote this book to make money\\". True!!! While I understood and respected his underprivileged childhood, and admire his recent success, he displayed poor taste when he finished the book up with his sexual exploits. It was so out of place in the world of a child trying to cope with survival. He totally lost it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not worth all the time that it takes to read!","review":"I would not recommend this book.

You will feel what a young Frank was feeling and will feel an overwhelming urge to help him. Frank McCourt is a magnificent author who will instantly grab you. He is honest (sometimes brutally) about how he is feeling and the situation he is in. The innocence of a child is shown in this memoir. You will laugh, cry, and even get angry. This is a wonderful story that will leave you hoping that things will turn out O.K. It will also show you that your life may not be as bad as you previously thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tis' Not a Limerick","review":"This book brought out some of the best emotional writing I have ever had the emotional pleasure to read. I simply could not put it down, finishing it in two days. I have since read it again and it still brought out the extreme pleasure of the first time. Although I was a little dissapointed with the sequel TIS', I read it just the same to find out what had happened to that wonderfully living Frank. I think the hospital scene in ANGELA'S ASHES rivals any heart-wrenching words I have ever had the pleasure to read. This is living poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Grab your heart and hold on! What a wonderful, wonderfulbook!

Even if you have read the book, you will find fresh enjoyment and an incomparable entertainment experience through listening to Angela's Ashes on audio. McCourt breathes warmth, humor and personality into his reading in such a way that is is more like having a cup a tea -- or at times, a pint of Guiness -- with the author in person as he recalls both the humor and tragedy in his life with neither guile nor bitterness. Anything more I can add to this review will be superfluous after this caveat. Do not deny yourself this (albiet onesided) conversation with a truly admirable man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Frank McCourt's writing style is unique. The book is funny and sad, stays with you for days after. I had to get the next two books and am now trying to stretch out the 3rd book because I don't want it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pub tales","review":"As I began to read this memoir I was immediately struck by Frank McCourt's unusual writing style. It occured to me that it resembles the narrative style encountered in Irish pubs. Mr. McCourt's inclusion of Irish speech patterns and patois further added to my reading. This in conjunction with Mr. McCourt's detailed accounting of his formative years lends one the sights and sounds of Limerick at the early part of this century. While life was indeed hard, Mr. McCourt conveys the wonderful sense of humor that has seen Ireland through its troubles."},{"rating":"2","title":"If it makes you cry, then is it a masterpiece?","review":"A lot of people have reviewed this book on shere impulse, stating clearly this is \\"the best book I have ever read\\". This opinion is, however, not shared by me.Don't get me wrong, the right of passage story of Frank McCourt is definetely uplifting, but is it for this reason a masterpiece? It is a terrific read for all readers, but the actual storyline is not so significant or impressive that one must be dumbfounded by it!

Can we please return to using quotation marks! A compelling story of poverty, but not a page-turner. A good book for those with lots of free time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the acclaim to blame?...","review":"Frank McCourt's relentless catalogue of the horrors of hisupbringing, while accurate in his case, were not typical ofthe vast majority of Irish poor of that time. His familylife was an extreme - his father was an extreme - the deathof three siblings was an extreme. McCourt does a wonderfuljob portraying his mother's courage and in showing thepsychic baggage the Irish Catholic poor are lumbered with.But this is a mightily flawed book and the acclaim it isreceiving astounds me. The child's point of view is finallytedious and wears us down; the pathos is well-worn andtired; the book lacks any lyricism. This is a still-bornbook and McCourt should try again to give us the book thatall the critics are raving about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ending deliberately left you hanging","review":"I enjoyed reading Angela's Ashes, however, I was rather annoyed by the ending. Never have I seen such a blatant attempt to \\"force\\" a sequel! I mean, Frank is on the boat, he's coming to America, and then....that's it! What sort of a denouement is that! None! It's as if Frank McCourt said, \\"OK, now you have to buy my next book!\\"Two other comments/questions: 1) How in the world was Angela able to afford Frank's dancing lessons when her children were dying of starvation/malnutrition? 2) Why is the book called Angela's Ashes? (Does anyone know? Has the author ever said?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest book ever written...","review":"Angelas Ashes is not an easy book to read. It doesn't get bogged down in complicated storytelling or jargon or any such hinderance that would make the reader UNABLE to read it, it's just EMOTIONALLY tough to get through. McCourt, through his fine, emotive storytelling takes the reader on an emotional journey through his formative years growing up in the poor, despair ridden ghettos of depression era Ireland. Told with a warmth and humor that only he can muster in the face of so much tragedy and personal hardship. This is the only book I've ever read where the the tough circumstances of the characters lives, as bitter a pill as they are, are offset by the warmth, faith and humor in the storytellers voice. Do yourself a favor and pick this book up, you may find yourself laughing along with it on more than one occasion, and certaily shedding a tear over it, but you will not be dissapointed! \\"I do believe, induced by potent circumstances, that thou art mine enemy!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is good for the Soul","review":"The heart of this book is the character of McCourt's longsuffering mother, Angela. I love her response to her sons when they whine (often with good reason, given the extent of their poverty): \\"I'm sorry for your troubles,\\" Angela says. She teaches her sons to weather the storms of life, for she has certainly weathered a few of her own- an alcoholic husband who cannot pay the bills, the deaths of her young children, the humiliation of begging the Catholic Church for charity to sustain her family. Angela was a saint, and McCourt has written this loving story in honor of his mother.I had heard so many good things about this book that I was actually reluctant to read it. I thought that it could not measure up to the reviews- but it did. McCourt's prose reads like poetry. I encourage the reader to first listen to the CD of McCourt reading Angela's Ashes with his Irish tongue. Also, the movie is NOT a disappointment, and is a \\"must see\\" for those who loved the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book very depressing and redundant.","review":"I realize that life of the Irish Catholic boy was difficult but how many times can you talk about the abusive alocholic father. After awhile every chapter sounded exactly the same. It was hard to even care what happened next.The Color of Water was much better. It achieved what this book could not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay already!","review":"Just one example of why there are so many different books in the world and so many different people. Someone is bound to like each particular book but I am not one of them for Angela's Ashes.Yes, I know Frank's family was poor. Yes, I know Frank's dad was a drunk. Did I have to read it on every single page?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After having heard so much about the book, I was disappointed when I read it. Although I empathize with the characters, I did not feel that the writing in a literary sense was anything remarkable - I am surprised it won the Pulitzer! I felt sorry for the suffering of the author and the family but having grown up in a third-world country in Asia, I could not help but think of countless similar children and families who experience the same suffering but have not even a hope or dream of ever being able to go to America to improve their lot in life. A tolerable book but too much hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and all too accurate view of the Irish","review":"Found the book an all too accurate portrayal of a certain kind of all too prevalent type of craven, selfish Irishman....terribly depressing because of this. And now, with McCord shilling for Barnes & Noble and showing arrogant contempt for the independent booksellers of America, who helped push the book to superstardom, I can see that he is not a lot different, despite making his way in the United States.....he plans to \\"throw their letter in the trash unopened.\\" Not a book, or a man, that, if you are honest about your Irish background, you are proud to read or know.

His death was reported on NBC Nightly News, and something about him intrigued me. I picked up the book from Amazon and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of Mr. McCourt's memoir of his childhood.

I could only stomach 40 pages before I realized that the ENTIRE book was going to be like an extended, nightmarish trip to the dentist.

This book takes you back to your own childhood and our mentality that was once innocent, but somehow becomes enhanced with impurity and self-righteousness.

This story will touch the heart and experience of all who have shared any one of these.

The writing style from a child's perspective is tremendously honesty giving it a unique freshness and dignity. His childhood experience was one of extreme poverty which is something most of us cannot relate to but it reminds us that regardless of socioeconomic status, we all can relate to the basic things in life - relationships with siblings, parental embarrassments, learning life's lessons through whispered conversations with friends etc. This book has something to offer any intelligent reader.

Can't believe anyone could actually survive such terrible living conditions! But Frank McCourt writes in such a way that even though I feel sorry for the family, I also feel a whole lot of respect for their resilience. I like the way Frank McCourt writes- as if he is talking to you as a child. He manages to describe his living environment so as to enable us to have a clear and vivid picture of his hometown, but at the same time he doesn't bore us with complicated details and long-winded \\"talk\\". I also really enjoyed the innocence and humour which seems to have been an important part of the writer's life. I think this keeps the tone from turning into one of self-pity. I think Frank McCourt is a great writer and I hope there's a sequel to this wonderful memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put this one down","review":"After seeing Frank McCourt on 60 minutes and the Today show I was curious about this book.

This impacts the family in such a very harsh way. Franks mother Angela just sit back and bascially does absoloutlly nothing except complain about her husbands problem. Frank is the only bright light in his family it is intresting how he overcomes hardships and grows up to become a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably splendid memoir!","review":"The events that occured in Frank's childhood life is just unfathomable that it makes me cry every time I read Angela's Ashes. I imagine myself living his life of immense poverty and suffering and I know I'll never be able to go through what he has gone through in his childhood life. Frank writes with such uniqueness and passion about his childhood that not one single soul who reads his memoir will be left dry-eyed. This book deserves 10 stars instead of 5!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Should Be On Everyone's Required Reading List","review":"That Frank McCourt was so intuitively and lucidly able to set forth his experiences through the eyes of changing youth is nothing short of genius. Evocative and entertaining every step of the way through the visissitudes of a struggling childhood, culminating with his triumph for survival (and terrific ending), this book should be required reading for everyone! Truely deserves six stars. Cannot wait for 'Tis."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favourite memoir, and book of all time","review":"This is the most touching, real, and beautiful book ever written. I've read it while laughing, crying and sighing, with the childhood of Frank McCourt in Limerick playing vividly in my imagination. If you enjoy the Diary of Anne Frank, this book is definitely for you. A very similar read, it has the same feeling of childhood innocence versus the destruction of that innocence.I was so intrigued that I had to read his follow-up, 'Tis.The movie is no comparison to the actual story, though worth a viewing. The settings in the movie are as realistic as the ones McCourt painted in my mind while I was reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book I have ever read","review":"I have read many many books but Angela's Ashes is without a doubt the most enjoyable. It is wonderfully written: you hear the child's Irish voice almost as though he was in the same room having a conversation with you. I was laughing , then crying all the way through the book. The honesty is the most touching thing of all. I was so moved by this book that I don't actually have adequate words to express my feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, eloquent, emotional","review":"Frank McCourt writes in simple, straight-forward voice that both lulls the reader into his world yet effectively moves him through McCourt's story. The strength of the book is that it is written through the eyes of a child, and all of the memories that just 'are' to him are powerful and moving to an adult who can only imagine the difficult childhood McCourt faced. He tells one person's story and, in effect, tells the story of a generation. It will be a classic and should be required reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!","review":"I read this book a several years ago and didn't want to finish it, it was so good. So imagine my delight listening to the author, \\"Frankie,\\" telling the story, singing the songs, changing his voice to suit the character and not saying, \\"Chapter Three . . . etc.\\"!!! The CDs just continue, one into the next, and it's almost like having access to a controlled substance! Wonderful stuff!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TRULY MOVING AND IT WILL LEAVE YOU DRAINED EMOTIONALLY.","review":"ALL THROUGH THIS BOOK YOU FIND YOURSELF WANTING TO HOLD, NURTURE AND PROTECT THIS SWEET CHILD. I KNOW THAT TO FORGIVE IS DEVINE BUT I DON'T THINK I COULD FORGIVE FRANK'S FATHER FOR HIS \\"WEAKNESS.\\" THE PAIN HE CAUSED IS SO GREAT THAT YOU ARE AMAZED THAT YOUNG FRANK EMERGED DETERMINED, STRONG AND VERY ENDEARING WHILE HE DEVELOPES HIS SURVIVAL SKILLS. JUST PUT MY ORDER IN FOR 'TIS AND CAN HARDLY WAIT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a masterpiece, best seller & unworthy of big screen","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I could not wait to finish reading it and quickly donating it to our local library. I have never started reading a book without completing it, but I did contemplate not finishing this one. The book is too repetitious. Each chapter echoed the previous."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET INTO A CHILD'S MIND!","review":"Born into a poor Irish Catholic family, Frank grows up in the slums of Manhattan and Limerick facing problems such as a drunk father, family tragedies, consumption and poverty.Although this book gets a little boring sometimes, it is quite exciting cause at any time one wants to know what happens next to Frank and his family.The author Frank McCourt did an excellent job on writing about his childhood and how he went through it.JUST LIVE THE LIFE OF A CHILD THAT FACED PROBLEMS EVERY SINGLE DAY YOURSELF."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Very few times you find a book that you can qualify as brilliant and this is one of them. Beautifully written, sad in many aspects, without becoming depressing. At the end you can appreciate so many things that you take for granted and just admire people who can thrive despite incredible adversities."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.U.!!","review":"Stinkaroo! Thank god I borrowed this work of maudlin stereotypical crap from the library so I didn't actually fork over any cash for it. Jeez, if I was Irish I would be completely insulted by the authors' ludicrous, stereotypical portrayal of the anguished poor Irish Catholic family. \\"Aw no da's drunk agin! Aw no, ma's bein' shagged! Aw, I wish ere lived in Ameriki!\\" Blah blah blah! These characters aren't even as well developed as the guy on the Lucky Charms box. Has McCourt ever been to Ireland?I couldn't even finish it. It just plodded and sobbed and whined on and on and on. In fact, before I took it back to the library I inscribed in one of the early chapters, \\"WARNING: MORE CRAP AHEAD\\". I didn't consider that defacing library property, I considered it a public service."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Like a Little Fiction with Your Hyperbole....","review":"Mr McCourt was the unfortunate victim of a disease - his father's alcoholism - and not that fate worse than death, an Irish Catholic childhood.His story strains credibility;moreover, he perpetuates negative stereotypes. I loved his verbal agility and hated his manipulation of the reader"},{"rating":"2","title":"Angela's Ashes","review":"From the ashes of his mother's dream, Frank McCourt's spirit rises in fiery glory that even the River Shannon cannot dampen. Readers will be privileged to take this journey of the soul with McCourt for he will affirm the true meaning of humanity and offer a richer understanding of simple acts of love and greater acts of forgiveness. You will be profoundly touched by the narrative voice and be inspired as well as humbled by his faith. Angela's family is her monument to world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Captivating Story of Irish Immigration","review":"In this book none of the characters have quoted dialogue. I thought this would make the story boring, maybe a little dry. I was wrong. Mr. McCourt's tragic tale is compelling and heartbreaking. He never gives up, through it all he keeps on going.It's a good story and an interesting look into history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart breaking work of staggering genius..","review":"If that title had not already been taken it would have fit this book perfectly. I resisted and resisted and resisted this book, but sometimes the masses are absolutely correct. This was a brilliant read and totally absorbing. I read it in two days time. At moments, I was in tears, the scene where the surviving twin searches the house for his brother is burned into my brain forever and at other moments I found myself laughing. This is the single best memoir I have ever read. Pick it up, now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!!!!","review":"I thought this was an amazing memoir that really shows the reader that there are so many things in our present day lives that we take for granted, while there are so many people all around us that barely have enough to survive. Frank McCourt tells the reader about his own very scarce childhood in Ireland. He retells how he lived as a little child and eventually grew up into a man by making sure that his family was provided for as best he could provide as a teenager. As he grows into a man he begins to realize how important his contributions are to his starving family.In this very personal recollection Frank McCourt shows the reader true pain and suffering. He really brings you into the situation and makes you feel the cold and the damp. Although this is such a heart-wrenching story this is by far one of the best books I have read recently."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STORY.....","review":"Delightfully rich memoir of Ireland......I just read a memoir called PERAMBULATIONS by CS BACK which reminded me of this book,,,,except PERAMBULATIONS is more descriptive and I could identify with it as an American male."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful and Sad Story","review":"This book kept me up all night. I could not let this book go. It made me realize that other parts of the world have similar problems to the ones we see in our part of the world. This book hit home right on the dot. His carefully picked words, his details, his politeness, his innocence, his ambition, all made me want more. I can't wait to read the second part of his memoir. This is an excellent story teller. And, I hope that his writing days are just beginning.Tis'"},{"rating":"2","title":"McCourt's Masterpiece","review":"As a high school teacher and a published novelist (my debut book is in its initial release), I understandably found myself attracted to ANGELA'S ASHES by Frank McCourt, himself an educator and an author. In ANGELA'S ASHES, Mr. McCourt recounts the struggles of his youth in Ireland, his battles against poverty, and his desires for a better life. ANGELA'S ASHES is an inspiring book that is beautifully written. I recommend it highly to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight,","review":"I really loved this book, except the last chapter when it turned when it lost it's rich literacy and turned 'cheap'. I won't go into particulars, as to not ruin the ending for you, but you'll know what I mean when you get close to the end. Otherwise, this author is wonderful and provides a depth of feeling of what it was like to grow up Catholic and poor in Ireland. Thanks Frank."},{"rating":"1","title":"How awful","review":"I was so sick and tired of the \\"can't do,\\" \\"oh woe is me\\" attitude of Angela and her drunken husband that I wanted to shake them both. How could anyone call him/herself a parent and neglect those poor children so badly. I found it depressing in the extreme and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miserably Good Book","review":"McCourt's method of recalling events and his total avoidance of quotation marks to set off dialogue makes Ashes a refreshing and delightful book to read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a well-crafted piece of literature that tells of a very real childhood. However, I must admit the only reason why I rate the novel an 8 instead of a 10 is the \\"depressing\\" facture;the subject matter of the novel tends to weigh heavy on the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET INTO A CHILD'S MIND!","review":"Born into a poor Irish Catholic family, Frank grows up in the slums of Manhattan and Limerick facing problems such as a drunk father, family tragedies, consumption and poverty. Although this book gets a little boring sometimes, it is quite exciting cause at any time one wants to know what happens next to Frank and his family.The author Frank McCourt did an excellent job on writing about his childhood and how he went through it.JUST LIVE THE LIFE OF A CHILD THAT FACED PROBLEMS EVERY SINGLE DAY YOURSELF."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant, touching, ghastly, funny, sad....and more!","review":"Well, a fairy story this ain't, but it's a fantastic book nonetheless. It makes us all realise that most of our day-to-day problems are nothing compared to what Frank McCourt went though as a child. That he survived his childhood and succeeded in life is nothing short of a miracle. Having been brought up Catholic, I loved that aspect of the book. I also love the lyrical and imaginative ways of the Irish, ie: to get rid of the fleas in his bed, young Frank is told to turn the mattress \\"upsoide down\\" and that will confuse the little beggars!!! Frank McCourt writes his story in the voice of his young self, a curious, sweet and oft times unintentionally funny little boy and this is a most endearing feature of the book. Angela's Ashes not always an easy book to read, but persist - you will come away enriched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take me home to Ireland, but bury me in Butte . . .","review":"Being born and raised Irish Catholic and a graduate of Notre Dame, I've been sufficiently and happily showered in the proud lore of the Irish people. Anglea's Ashes offers a necessary dose of the reality of Ireland and an explanation for why our Irish predecessors left what we think is \\"heaven on earth\\" to came to America. As the old-timers say in Butte, Montana, one of the most Irish cities in America, \\"Take me home to the green hills of Ireland, but when I die, bury me in Butte.\\" All Irish people must read this book if simply to witness the strength of an Irish family. It is truly a great memoir written with the unsinkable wit of the Irish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Overrated, Bordering on the Ridiculous","review":"Here's a book which, if it wasn't claimed to be a memoir, would be universally put down as a collection of all the usual trite stereotypes of Irish people and Irish-Americans -- the drunken, maudlin father who spouts off at the drop of a hat about the IRA, the long-suffering mother with multiple children who beats her breast at her husband's drinking, the religious and overbearing aunts, etc. etc. Then there is a supporting cast of stereotypical Jewish mothers, and Italian grocers, and, well you get the picture.The author shows a wee a bit of humor (which is why 2 stars rather than one), but spends most of his time wallowing in self-pity. The writing is an example of mawkish excess. No memorable images to speak of -- Irish men get drunk at funerals, women act catty toward each other, bureaucrats show indifference.You will read this book, and then not remember a thing about it a week later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing through tears.","review":"My 16 year old daughter and I are both reading this wonderful book and often fight over whose turn it is to read. I just finished it and loved every minute of it. I am so glad by daughter is also reading it!! I look at her and think of Angela and what suffering she went through and am just glad that I never knew the horrible ordeals Angela did. And as a mother I can only hope my children will turn out as well as Angela's children did."},{"rating":"2","title":"An involving read","review":"This book was an odd read for me. I was initially unaware that it was an autobiography, which made the horror of McCourt's childhood even more intense. Being Irish-Catholic, it brought back a lot of memories of my childhood and I was thankful that mine wasn't as bad as his! :-) Not for the faint hearted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it two Pulitzers!","review":"Laughter and sobbing quickly blend to together to give the reader a splendid tale, true at that, of an innocent child surviving the most cruel poverty. The book is remarkably uplifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every sentence held my attention.","review":"Mr. McCourt's style of writing is unique; it's not traditional, but honest. He describes the characters in the book briefly, because their dialogues, moreso than their appearances, say a lot about their personalities. I learned about what life was like for the middle-lower class people of Ireland, about their struggles, ways of adapting, and beliefs. This book truly is a gem. I'd like to thank Frank for sharing his adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointed by the seemingly fictitious characters","review":"Having grown up in a fiercely Irish Catholic family, I could hardly wait to read the gift my husband gave to me for St. Patrick's day. Although amused by some of the antics of the main characters, I could not associate any with the characters my parents spoke so lovingly about in their years in poor Catholic familys in two different counties in Ireland. Unlike Mc Court's account, the characters my parents knew were hard working, even though sometimes hard drinking, and all had much more pride and were much more responsible about their families. I grew more and more suspicious about the so-called true accounts of life in a poor Irish family. I could hardly call this book literature. It seemed more like an attempt by Mc Court to create a best-seller rather than an attempt to truly interpret life in Ireland."},{"rating":"2","title":"My, my!","review":"I just read the previously written reviews and am amazed that many people rate it 9 or 10 and then someone comes along and says it's the worst book they ever read and couldn't finish it! The lattergroup of people just didn't get it...The mode ofFrank McCourt's writing was ingenious becuase it was put down in the vernacular of the age he was writing about. It was very subtle in it's progress, so much so that you didn't realize it was happening.To know that such poverty and sadness was survived and overcome is the reason one MUST read this book. I would recommend buying the book if only to contribute to Mr. McCourt's pocketbook!!I only wish I knew what happened to Mam and the rest of the family. Definitely a sequel scenerio!I LOVED the quote about Shakespeare and mashedpotatoes. I have used it numerous times...it'spriceless...To y'all who dissed this book...shame on ya!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly written, amazing story","review":"As horrible as much of the circumstances in McCourt's novel are, this book was incredible. This was one book that when I sat down to read it, I didn't do anything else until I had finished it.The words and descriptions within this novel are so amazing that you can see, hear, smell, and taste the situations that McCourt and his family were enduring.To go through the life that they had, and for Frank McCourt to make so much of himself, should be a lesson to everyone that feels as if life is unfair or treated them unkindly. Just because you come from poverty and unimaginable agonies, does not mean that you cannot proper and achieve your goals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart wrenching!","review":"I have a great deal of mixed feelings about this book. It had been recommended to me several times so I decided to buy it and read it. I was bowled over by the tremendous poverty of the Irish people and many times near tears. Surprised by the discrimination within their own country against each other based upon wealth, religion or birthplace. There are great moments of humor within this book that at times are hard to laugh at but one has to see them through the eyes of the child. This is a book you love to hate or hate to love. Hard to put it down but hard to pick it up as well. If nothing else, read it for the insight into the Irish people and their history."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH IT!","review":"OK, usually I'm too poor to buy hardbacks, but this was an excellent investment. I won't rehash all the same compliments posted by others, but I must say one thing about this book: the biggest complaint people have about it is that McCourt's life was too poverty-stricken/ depressing/ repetitive /whatever. LOOK. This isn't some kitschy happy-ending novel. It's a PERSON'S TRUE LIFE STORY. If you wanted an exciting, glamorous life, go read some dumb Danielle Steel. McCourt spent 20 years living the life portrayed in this book. If you want to enjoy it for what it is, the mere hours you will spend entwined in his story will put a lump in your throat, but it is probably nothing compared to what McCourt went through in his own mind putting it on paper. The amazing thing is that it makes you laugh, and makes you think as well. Congratulations go out to him on such a perfectly told story of stories... believable from the childlike voice on the first page"},{"rating":"2","title":"Misery and humor in lyric prose","review":"Simply, wonderfully, lyrically well-written. Eminently readable. I'll take McCourt over Joyce any day.As for those who complain about the undercurrent of seemingly endless misery that runs throughout the book: If you don't see the humor in \\"Angela's Ashes\\" as well as the sorrow, you're missing the point.Highly deserving of the Pulitzer."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty surprising...that he survived","review":"It was somewhat difficult to read, this is the \\"crushing proverty\\" people talk about - just awful. Having grown up in an alcoholic home I could certainly understand the insanity, but was continually surprised at how the Father could be actually kind and equally surprised that the Mother didn't rage against him and they at each other all the time! Interesting. Sure doesn't make one a great fan of the \\"church\\". They were a big help...not"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read","review":"It has been quite a while since I've read such a fascinating memoir. The life and times of the McCourt family on the lanes of Limerick are wrought with sorrow, yet somehow McCourt has the wherewithall to hold the reader entranced with subtle humor throughout. The follow-up, 'Tis', picks up the story in America, but fails to be as interesting as the first book. Angela's Ashes is a \\"must read\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I love Frank McCourt's writing style. He does not use quotations, just tells it like it is.....I could hardly put this one down! Excellent reading! Some parts were hilarious, and at other times very depressing, but the book is unforgettable. It will definitely leave you with more compassion for those who suffer through poverty and lack of hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only read one book, this one should be it.","review":"I found this book to be one of the most beautiful and painful books I have ever read. I was amazed at Mr. McCourt's ability to portray such a devastating childhood without any malice or bitterness. I want to personally thank Mr. McCourt for giving me a perspective on how much bounty we take for granted in this country. The book took me longer to read than most because I kept getting up and going into my childrens' rooms and thanking God that I can feed and clothe them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I've Read So Far!","review":"This memoir is very moving. I love biographies and I have to say that this is the best one I've read so far. The story being told through the voice of a young child really brings it to life! I think that this book should be read by everyone who has a spot in their heart for a child in need. It has challenged me to make the life of at least one child better so that they don't have to live like the McCourts did."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"I read the book because my friends told me that it was a fantastic book. I was very disappointed. This is the reason why I am spending a few minutes typing this review. Warning: you have to be mentally and emotionally prepared to read this book. While I do agree with the view that some parts are well-written, it is just too dragging. It took me weeks to finish it.There are also inconsistencies in the way the writer talks about his surroundings from a child's point of view. In some parts of the book, Frank talks about Catholic practices that I thought were too esoteric for a kid. Manage your expectations well so you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but written for Americans","review":"Simply put, this book was written for Americans. It does not convey the hardships the Irish endured as they happened. The authors storytelling is repetitive babble, but the storyline was okay. However, if you want to read a good Irish book choose something written by an author who still lives and always has live in Ireland. There are many other great Irish literature works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Break out the violins","review":"There's a lot of morbid fascination going on here. Maudlin, depressing. Abject bleakness and no hope gets hard to take with little humour or light shinning in. A sob story. The reason why people read it is so they can say \\"at least that's not me.\\" That's what I thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant until the end...forced transition into a sequel?","review":"Entertaining and lively...but the end was anti-climactic. The last 10% of the book felt out of place, didn't seem like the same writer and seems to be an ackward transition into a sequel...which I found out is in the works."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated. dull. ponderous.","review":"i feel like the only person who didn't like this book. instead of describing a compelling situation, i found myself bogged down in a cycle of alcoholism, poverty and despair that can be found in virtually every inner city in America. but without any pertinent lesson, without any point. i read the book without expectations, and got what i expected: nothing. i could not recommend this book, nor suggest it has anything of value to add to the literary community."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pulitzer Prize for This?","review":"Rarely do I stop reading a book before I finish, but after I had read about a third of Angela's Ashes, I couldn't take it any more.Up to that point, I thought, \\"This Frank McCourt fellow must be the smartest man who ever lived\\" because of his detailed descriptions of what happened to him when he was two, three or five years old.But when I got to the part about his carrying a hog head around for about 10 pages, I stoppped.If the man had said in the introduction that he embellished some and relied on what others told him, that would have been fine; instead he presents everything as fact. Think about your childhood. Can you remember 1/100th of the details that McCourt apparently has at the tip of his tongue -- or fingers?Give me a break. If this book is worthy of the Pulitzer Prize, we all are in trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after so much hype.","review":"I wasted one of my Chrismas wishes on this book, which my husband paid full price hardback for! McCourt had a miserable life, no doubt about it, and it was amazing that he, his brothers and mother could still hold out hope every time Dad reappeared. For the life of me I cannot recall anything humorous in this book, despite the reviews of others citing this. It was the most depressing book I have ever read, and I several times had the misfortune to be reading during a meal (that'll teach me!) when I would come upon graphic descriptions of the chamber pot and its contents or the lavatory. The most moving parts of the story to me were the deaths of his siblings and when the horse went down. It did show how poverty is literally \\"grinding\\", and I cringe to realize there may be similar situations going on today in this country. Bottom line: If you must read this book, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"I waited until the book was in paperback to buy and only bought it then because I was going to Ireland and thought it might be interesting. Not much here. The family was poor, the father was a drunk and the mother had little inclination to better the situation. Once you have this figured out the book repeats it over and over. Its one redeeming feature: The narrative flows easily and one does not need to concentrate very hard to read it, so it doesn't take long to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, disgusting, but not because of McCourt","review":"I had to read this for my book club and it turns out I'm glad they were all checked out at the library and all I could get was the audio tape. That way, I listened to McCourt drone and whine while I sat in traffic and I didn't have to waste valuable time reading it. I'm not Irish, but I was raised Catholic and he used jokes and bromides most of us had heard by the time we were ten. As a society, we deplore poverty, alcoholism, wife and child abuse, yet what voyeurs we become when some opportunist writes about any of the above! McCourt should be applauded for so adeptly using the American reading market to make money off his misery, but as a writer, he offers no more wisdom, insight or inspiration than Joan Crawford, Roseanne Barr or any other come-out-of-the-closet-dysfunctional-family-member who ever wrote a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it over yet?","review":"I really must be missing something. I am so bored and just want the book to be finished. Nothing draws me. I was expecting the lifestyle of an Irish child like stories my grandma tells. This is a story of a poor boy with worthless parents. It has little to do with being Irish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and goes nowhere, slowly.","review":"My husband listened to the book-on-tape, read by the author, and raved about it. He insisted I listen as well. I'd heard all the ecstatic reviews and was planning to be in the car for several hours, so I agreed. What a mistake. Not only do I find it incredible that someone can \\"remember\\" so much minutae from early childhood, but I kept waiting for the story to develop along the lines of actual literature. I suppose that in a memoir you can't expect to follow every guideline to plot and character development. But if you can't follow any of them, is it really worth publishing? Essentially, it read like this: \\"We were poor and dad drank. Then something bad happened to me. Then we were still poor and dad drank more. Another bad thing happened to me. We were still poor, and dad was still drinking. And more bad things happened. Then I did bad things too. The end.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of time and mind","review":"This book is without any redeeming value that I can find. It is a disgusting walk down memory lane of what must have been the most dismal, sad and wretched childhood one WOULD NOT WANT TO RECOUNT IN VIVID PRINT."},{"rating":"1","title":"sigh...","review":"Ireland is very badly represented on the international stage. I used to wonder why this was so. Then I realised it was because of people like Frank McCourt. Never mind what McCourt writes. This book has nothing to do with Ireland. If all you Americans would read the GOOD Irish writers - Patrick McCabe, John McGahern, Frank McGuinness, Brian Friel, Tom Murphy, and the cultural analyses of Declan Kiberd (who, along with McGuinness, lectures at my college, University College Dublin) - you might know what the world is about. It all stems from the complete inability of Americans everywhere to think about anything except themselves. Think about the rest of us - who are forced to live and breathe American culture from the day we're born. Now who's pondering?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I EVER READ","review":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! This is one of the most depressing, filthy, repetitive, boring books ever to be published. The people are well aware of their situation of being in poverty yet do nothing to try to better themseves. They are ignorant, crude, rude and obnoxious - a very poor example of the true Irish spirit and an insult to anyone from Ireland. Please -SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T BUT THIS BOOK! It isn't even worth one star and I am sorry I ever read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Reminder of how good we have it in America.","review":"Worthy of the Pulitzer, Frank McCourt's account of growing up poor in Ireland was a good read.

I also want to know if he is married as i am desperate to know if he has complete hapiness now.my advice to you is -READ IT WHAT EVER YOU AGE YOU ARE!!!!!!AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN SEE IT AS AN EXPERIANCE,BUT IT'S WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!!!!! HONEST!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH EVERY PENNY AND MORE.","review":"First off let me say that I wish you good luck if your ordering this book through Amazon. But, if they are somehow REALLY able to get it, you'll be amazed at its content. T-KID is a legendary style master, and if you didn't know that, you're a toy.The stories are so vivid that you can smell the paint, and sometimes, the gun powder. And of course the art is fantastic.

I have seen a lot of Tkid pieces and thought this book was going to be a great compilation, but it was only pretty good.

I thought maybe the Gamecube was at fault but I got to the same point over and over again with beating the game and the same glitch - cube would freeze up. Then I thought I had a bad copy of Zoo Cube so I bought a brand new one and the same thing happens. Nothing like this has ever happened with my other 15+ Gamecube games. Too bad.... this is old fashioned fun, not a lot of thought required. Having good periferal vision is a plus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"This is not what i thought it was going to be.

No need to go into detail, it's just a bad game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large blue book, lots of words","review":"I'm using this large blue book to teach myself the language and so far I think it is a good resource. The author assumes that you have no prior knowledge of programming. It has lots of examples with good step by step documentation describing what the example program is doing. There are also tons of nerd-friendly jokes. The learning is a bit slow if you read straight through without skipping around, but that's because the author gives you details such as when to use a particular function as opposed to another, potential pitfalls you can encounter and the differing ways you can do the same task. In short, using this book will take you longer to learn the language than it would if you used a shorter book, but it will make you a more knowledgeable programmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to begin...","review":"C++ Primer Plus is a very good manual with an easy language. It is recommended for a first approach to C++ and also for more experienced programmers.There are a lot of illuminating examples and all the details are explained.Not only the language, but also the philosophy of C++ is described in a very comprehensible way.It is both a useful fellow when you are programming and an entertaining book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thick book, but worth reading every page","review":"Even if you know (nearly) everything about C/C++, read this book carefully!

(i.e. for the last 15 years)There is no mention of buttons, forms, windows, or text boxes at all in this book.There are roughly 1200 pages in this book and it seems that all of these pages deal with an output function called \\"cout\\" which puts text on the screen.I don't need to \\"put text on the screen\\" I need to put \\"buttons on the screen\\". That, unbelievably, is not in the book.No reference to graphics, bitmaps, transparency, drawing -> nothing.It seems to be a 1200 page c++ syntax reference.I have about 30 years of in-depth programming experience and my only question is \\"how can I send it back\\".It's not only a waste of money, it was a real waste of time.

Some are great for pure beginners while others are only useful to the advanced users. This book is a little of both. The approach is geared toward an absolute programming novice, but the information is in depth and complete. I wouldn't recommend this to be the sole reference book for someone cutting their teech on programming, but it would make a great companion text. And to someone who is trying to give themselves a refresher course in C++, this book is perfect. The author comes from an science/astronomy background so many of the excersises are geared in that direction. He has a good sense of humor and keeps the discussion lively. C++ is a highly technical field of study and this book covers just about everything while keeping an eye on the basic nuts and bolts."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad packaging","review":"There were stickers all over this when I got it.

It is under my impression that his aim for the much poppier, smoother Happy People was to cheer people up in a time of sorrow (right after the 9-11 tragedy), hence Standard of Language was released a year later than Happy People.If you want feel-good jazz performed by a brilliant jazz musician, pick up a copy of Happy People.If you want that vintage Kenny Garrett jazz sound at all its intense and sizzling goodness, look into his other albums such as Songbook, Standard of Language, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL jazz musicians stretch out...","review":"I love this CD, it's a testament to the fact that there are still real jazz musicians out there who can get together and create something magical and moving.

Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe or not, this CD is actually good.....","review":"It took me a while to get use to this cd at first, I let my friend borrow it for 2 months. I started to miss it so I got it back. He might not be playing some ridiculous solos (although track 8, i think thats the one with the -7 chord in wholesteps, he's playing some \\"explitive deleted\\") but they mean something. People need to realize is that is not how many licks you can play but how effectively you can make statement that means something. I slowly came to that conclusion a while ago when I heard Kenny Garret play live at blues alley (DC). He was on it that night. Anyway this is a great cd, not his best cd (SongBook), but its definitely worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tunes","review":"I hesitated about buying this CD because some of the reviews seemed to suggest that it was smooth jazz. However, it is a very enjoyable album, with some great tunes. The problem is that Kenny does not really allow himself to stretch out the way he did on \\"Songbook\\". How about a live album?"},{"rating":"2","title":"KennyGarrett-HappyPeople","review":"Thisis a really good cd, full of emotion, and feelings.

I was hoping to hear some fancy \\"young lion jazz\\" -my first mistake- and instead got fusion. Only 2 1/2 tunes on the CD swing. The rest are all funk vamps. These are good musicians but I heard this music the first time around and don't have much desire to here a more commercial, less adventurous version than what came before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ageless","review":"Excellent jazz CD. Balanced if you love the saxaphone as lead. Both old school and modern jazz with eastern accents. This is consistent with the \\"voice\\" of Kenny Garrett which normally is in a minor scale. Would recommend as good album for anyone including one new to jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is the target audience?","review":"It's a shame that such a talented player gets caught up in this mishmosh of material. There were two cuts I really enjoyed: \\"Tango in 6\\" and \\"Song #8\\". The former featured a nice interesting and original tune with a beautiful and intense solo from Bobby Hutcherson. The latter features Some nice up tempo playing from Kenny which I wish we could here more of on this album. A couple of cuts feature a mixed bag of vocal heads along with Fender twang from Miller and too many tunes start out with a rhythm vamp that launches into predictable and shall we say, less than challanging chord changes all taken at tempos that border on sleepwalking."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Find!","review":"Great cd, shows the tremendous versatillity of Mose, and Van Morrison.

Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, poor design","review":"We bought this in preference to the Tupperware ball that - while definitely a fond memory of mine and my wife's - has become incredibly expensive! When the ball arrived it looked great (although the lack of a square is a little puzzling as a fundamental shape) and our little guy loved it. The problem arrived when trying to insert the circle/round piece. One way around it fit just fine; the other, no dice. Taking a closer look we found rough edges on the inside that were snagging against the - poorly - fitted shape. The seams were raised on one side just enough to prevent it dropping in. This is not the kind of negative reinforcement we wanted in this toy as at 15 months old our son's not getting the \\"yes that's the right shape, in the right hole but you need to flip it over, jiggle it and then pound it in\\" message. Such a slacker ;)Overall, it would have been a great product if the quality control on the line that produced it was up to standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Shape Sorter","review":"My 22-month-old twins love this sorter. I had it out for them as infants and they would enjoy holding the shapes and hearing them rattle. At around 18 months they started to put the shapes in with help.

The women in this movie should all try getting on \\"What not to wear\\". The first thing they would be told not to wear is a bikini, a one piece swimsuit with a ribbed corset underneath may give them the appearance of having a figure, as opposed to looking like bloated jellyfish. One women however did not quite fit into this generalization, if she were to be in profile as opposed to seeing her head on, you would justifiably think you were looking at a drag queen.In short even if you were to buy the cheapest previously viewed version of this movie you would still be paying too much. This is definitely the reason FF button was invented. The only burning question in my mind at the end of this movie was - how much did these women have to pay to be in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smith in NM","review":"I would very much like a copy of this book and wondering where I might find one or how to contact the author. I have searched, but so far can not find a copy anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable for What It Is","review":"I found this book to be fairly enjoyable with some thought provoking ideas. I would not recommend it as the first book to read about Tolkien's works (such as Shippey or Humphrey), but as an adjunct to primary sources. Others have compared it to Harvey's Origins of Tolkien's Middle-Earth for Dummies, but I found that strewn with errors which detracted from the experience. Not so with this book.

And even luckier to have a signed copy!! It is an easy read for those who are Tolkien fans, but by no means scholars. And for those who want a more in-depth discussion, it's there. This book is well written, well thought, and does not condescend or speak above it's readers. It's just right!!The impressive views from the various writers provide a nice blend of perspectives; culturally and educationally. Once, I started reading it, I found myself reading \\"just one more article,' then one more, then one more, until I read the whole book in one sitting. And I still pick it up and reference it time and time again because it is so well done.If their is a Tolkien fan on your gift giving list this is the book to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"People's Guide a must for Tolkien fans","review":"If you are a fan at all of Tolkien's works and those inspired by him, this book is one of the best collections of thoughtful, artistic writers expressing the impact of the Professor's influence I've ever read. Their perspective on Tolkien's world come first-hand from those who were fans long before the films made Middle-earth so popular. It's a bonus that they are closely connected to the filmmakers; which only adds to their insight. Their moving entries span from humorous to emotional. There's something for everyone here. A must for Tolkien-lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"bring your timer to quiddler","review":"I have been playing quddler with literate older people in a retirement community.

Someone suggested it to me as a gift for them to share."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite card game","review":"We have been playing Quiddler for years and are always introducing friends and family to this fun game. I purchased 4 to give out for Christmas gifts. Even sent one to Italy this year. It's a nice balance of luck and skill. If you like scrabble, you'll like Quiddler. It's a shorter, less intense game and helps everyone work on word skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted to Quiddler","review":"My cousin introduced me to Quiddler two months ago, and I've been hooked ever since.

It is a fast but fun game that you can play with any number of people. I enjoy it becuase kids and adults alike can enjoy and learn from this game. It involves arranging your cards (with letters on them) into words. You get points based on the length of the word and the letters that you use. It helps get kids interested in spelling and vocabulary, but it is still a lot of fun for adults to play. My husband went to a bed and breakfast where they had this game, and we spent several hours of our anniversary playing Quiddler. It is very fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family game!","review":"Our boys, ages 12,9 & 5 received this card game for Christmas! We as a whole family have had lots of fun playing it.

I highly recommend this for your family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"simple to learn, easy to play .....a fun spelling game?","review":"this game is very easy to pick up and play right out of the box. A total of eight hands are dealt which makes the game short and sweet. We play without a dictionary which is more fun. The players vote on whether we think a word is valid and majority rules. The game really bogs down with players constantly looking up words. The first person to be able to play their whole hand, with one card as a discard, goes out and the rest of the players have one turn to put down as many words as possible. Points are scored based on letter value and some cards have more than one letter such as \\"qu\\" or \\"cl\\". You lose points for letters that can't be played. You cant play your cards on another players word. Highest score after 8 hands is the winner. Spelling and game usually don't go well together but this is a fun game for any age. I personally like Five crowns better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational game that can be enjoyed anywhere by almost one","review":"\\"Quiddler,\\" not exactly a household word, but guaranteed, five years from now it will roll off tongues as easily as \\"Scrabble.\\" Like Scrabble, Quiddler is a word game where points are scored by letters used in spelling words; unlike Scrabble, it's played with cards in a sequence of eight hands, which makes it a quicker game. The deck is portable, great to throw in the suitcase for a trip. Playing in the car or on a plane is no problem. A couple of hands of Quiddler while your child waits to see a doctor or dentist provide a distraction as well as entertain. Quiddler challenges every age group from age 8 and can be played by just adults, just kids, or a mixture without losing its appeal. I could go on about Quiddler's educational value, vocabulary building, but the bottom line in playing games is the question, \\"Will I have Fun?\\" For Quiddler, the answer a simple \\"Indeed.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissent from the positive reviews...","review":"Reading all the positive reviews, I'm wondering if we all played the same game. In a nutshell, this game is far too easy, far too short, and not very interesting. The winner is more determined by who goes first than anything else, and frankly, the letter distribution is such that it is near impossible not to make a word immediately. My wife and I played this game two or three times before we were utterly bored. This is contrast to \\"Word Thief\\", also a Scrabble like word card game. That game, however, is far more challenging, much more involved, and will last more than 5 minutes, and can be played with as little as two players.

This is a fun word game that my kids describe as Scrabble with cards. Now everyone in our extended family plays, teenagers and their friends, our married kids have passed it on to their families, and I've passed it on to other friends and their families as well. There is enough friendly competition to keep it interesting as you work through levels, forming words with from 3 to 10 cards. You can play with as few as 2 and as many as ???. A few months ago we had a tournament with 8 people playing in 2 sets of 4. Our cards have almost worn out from all of the use they get. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys word games and a little friendly rivalry."},{"rating":"2","title":"true family fun","review":"Our 10-year-old son enjoys this game and that is a true testament to this games value. It leads to interesting discussions about words, their meaning, history, derivations, slang, etc. that can be both informative and fun.

Our family and extended family really enjoy playing this game. Our children's vocabulary has grown as they have tried to make new words and used the dictionary. Our extended family plays on holidays, college Enlgish majors make the game really interesting. Intellectuals love it and make the game even more challenging. The smarter you are the more interesting the game. To begin with we did play with our cards in view for the kids to really get a handle on it.

You have to use all your letter cards to make words, beware if someone else completes this task first, as the cards you can't put into a word are subtracted from your score. Luck is as much a friend as strategy, so can be frustrating when someone picks up 10 cards which can be put into words in the first round... and you have a hand full of consonants...

Quiddler is certain to entertain you for hours. This game will help sharpen your vocabulary skills in a short period of time.The game progresses from 3 card hands to 10 card hands, and point increase accordingly. You have to constantly be thinking of words and new words as the play continues. Once you start playing you start thinking, a refreshing change in a game.Quiddler is a true family game game that will certainly challenge even the smartest. You can take this game on the road, camping or even flying and have a great time. For those on a price consciuos budget, this game fits right in.About the only drawback is the fact that once you discard the card is gone. I think adding a \\"rummy\\" like rule of taking all the cards might add for more competition and higher scores. overall this game is sure be a party favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Scrabble!","review":"Get this game--agree on the house rules regarding use of dictionary--and HAVE FUN! Currently our favorite game."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun cross between Gin and Scrabble","review":"This is a fun game. The rules are similar to Gin -- get each card in your hand into a straight before your opponent does and you win. But instead of suits and numbers each card has a letter or pair of letters, and the goal is to make words. The first hand is 3 cards, the second hand is 4 cards, etc...on up to 13 cards.I like this game because unlike Scrabble, the person with the amazing vocabulary doesn't always win, because several short words are just as effective in using up your cards as one long word. (In fact, you get a 10 point bonus for either longest word OR most words). So my 8 year olds aren't outgunned by their word-loving elders.As a nice plus, the art work on the cards themselves is well done.The only minus is that the deck is double sized (110 cards) and so shuffling is a bear. Would also have been nice if they included a container that held the whole deck (instead it comes with a tray that has slots for 2 half decks.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but I recommend a time limit on turns","review":"This game really is wonderful. Those of you who love Scrabble will take to this like nobody's business. It can feel a bit like you're watching a chess tournament though if you aren't setting time limits on player's turns. I've seen plays take up to 20 minutes in the past. Rushing them actually improves the feel of the game though. Either way, a fun game that you should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divina blue cheese stuffed olives","review":"This is a FANTASTIC product.

It was quite a let down after \\"Country Life\\".I wish I had seen the review by Ira Robbins in The Trouser Press first before buying it on spec.

The heart and soul of the band were really explored in these first five: Roxy Music, For your Pleasure, Country Life, Stranded and Siren. Bryan Ferry was at his best with most of the original band members. That's because they helped his natural tendancies towards softness become more firm in a way that was lacking in later albums, when most of the original members were no longer around. Beyond that you can debate the fine points if you would care to. For me I'm just too busy listening and enjoying as I have for years and Roxy continues to please."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Outer Space...","review":"Roxy Music's debut album is one of THE glam albums to have. With a great fashion sense (due to Anthony Price), and avaunt style songs Roxy Music is something different amongst otherwise bland \\"rock\\" music. The debut album is only one of the two albums Brian Eno remains with Roxy. Most of the songs have a samples either in the beginning of the track or at the end, I supppose this is due to primative technology, but it still sounds great! With Roxy fans this album is one of the more popular ones because it is one of the better Roxy Music records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Their Best!","review":"This is one incredible debut album. The band is filled with energy and have creative juices flowing all over their bodies; they were never able to match the greatness they achieved with this album. Eno is in top form on this album, adding blips and squeaks all over the album, and overall a great atmosphere to most of the songs, with the first half of the album being the highlight. The remaster greatly improves the sound, with Eno's contributions coming through much more clearly than on previous issues. Manzanera's playing was never more powerful than on this album, and Ferry's singing, although it can be quite strange sometimes, is just as powerful as well. This is highly innovative music, lacking in pretention that somewhat marred their later albums. Plus it contains a song with \\"CPL593H\\" as the chorus. If you want to know what Roxy Music was all about, start with this one, not Avalon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Es bueno","review":"Es un CD interesante, no tiene nada que ver con los CD posteriores, el primero es más eclectico, interesante en la propuesta de la conjución de varios estilos de música que posee cada uno de los integrantes, Brian Eno es excelente en la inclusión de ruidos combinados con música"},{"rating":"1","title":"gotta have it if y're a Roxy Music fan; otherwise, no...","review":"One great song, perhaps one additional good song.

This album is dominated by Eno's soundscapes and it sounds like nothing else in music. The perfect combination of glam rock and 1950s space rock. This one will grow on you and needs to be listened to as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best effort","review":"This is a very different Roxy Music from their Avalon days. Here they possess a sort of manic energy not seen in any of their other albums, including the follow-up, For Your Pleasure. A lot of this can be attributed to Brian Eno's noisy keyboard manipulations, but really the whole band contributes. Manzanera's guitar flirts with different styles, from Velvet Underground sloppiness to country-rock, and Mackay's saxophone can go from 50s-rock to avant-garde in a heartbeat. And of course there's Bryan Ferry, whose vibratto voice here is a lot more ragged and impashioned than later(The song \\"If There's Something\\" demonstrates this). Simply put, the band is at the top of its power. I can't really think of any other band at the time (early 70s) who mixed together art-rock with kitschy nostalgia, with a glam fashion sense to boot. Too bad Roxy Music turned into a vehicle for Ferry's crooning."},{"rating":"2","title":"and Roxy music came to save the world, and all I got was this snazzy T-shirt","review":"I never get tired of this album.

Good dog. ruff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Debut","review":"One of the most powerful and important debut albums of all time,along with The Velvet Underground And Nico,The Stooges, and Beefheart's Safe As Milk. Roxy Music brings an edge with sophistication to the music. Part progressive,part early rock n' roll,part experimental, this material is almost unclassifiable.\\"If There Is Something\\" is powerful and hypnotic.\\"Virginia Plain\\" is like quirky new wave pop that brings to mind XTC,Devo,and The Cars, 5 years before such a thing existed. Phil Manzanera shows he can make some ear splitting noise on guitar, equivalent to Robert Fripp, though with his own trademark on cuts like \\"Chance Meeting\\" and \\"Ladytron\\". Andy Mackay may well be the coolest rock n' roll sax man of all time. Paul Thompson's drumming is powerful and solid throughout. Your 80's loving yuppie friends that think Roxy Music is about smooth product like Avalon need to hear this one instead; it will probably clear the room!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ecco","review":"This game is very different.

However I went through the book within 30 minutes and did not find anything new or quite interesting. It's a very basic book in understanding the importance of ISO, shutter speed, and aperture and how they work together. Not really much past that. I would definitely recommend this to beginner's, but if you want to save a few bucks you can learn all the information provided in this book via online resources, just use your favorite search engine ;)Was also kind of upset that they mentioned anything about digital cameras seeing as how there was maybe 4 pages at the end of the book that talked about irrelevant fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful for a newbie","review":"I am new to DSLR, having only owned point and shoots in the past.

Alas the years go by and the book is seriously out of date. The concepts are still correct and somewhat useful. However, the book was written before the advent of serious digital cameras and before Photoshop and other programs were available to improve images.

I read the bulliten boards and forums, which were a great help. But most of them recommended this book. Now I recommend this book with them to all new photographers of both dSLR and Point and Shoot cameras. It gives wonderful easy to read and in \\"plain english\\" the do's and dont's of shooting.

I expected a lot of information in this book and hints on how I could best use certain camera settings in certain situations. And although this book does give some very nice beginners information, it nowhere nearly gives me all the answers I expected. The writer makes some errors in what aperture he used and he makes some very strange analogies to explain things. He compares ISO values with bees carrying waterbuckets.. what the...!?I'm also not very sure for whom this book is written. It's definitely not for the pro, and as a matter of fact I believe that beginners will only get confused by reading this book. I think I'll sell it as soon as I can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"I like Bryan Peterson's presentation style. He presents information on a subject.

If you are like me, you read for hours online about photography; you know Digital Photography Schools inside and out, and have read countless tutorials.

The example pictures are wonderful and there are so many of them. This is a excellent book for new and intermediate photographers, it clears up some of the confusion on getting the right exposure with straight forward techniques. I like the light humor and witty explanations that the author uses. The only draw back I found is that the author doesn't show the exact focal point where he meters his shots.

I can already tell a difference in my photographs. I bought a Nikon D200 and hadn't had to use any manual settings for so long cause I was using all the auto settings on my old camera. After reading this book, all that stuff came flooding back to me and then some. I learned some neat tricks to getting the right exposure for tricky situations.

I have a great camera and have been using it like a point and shoot. I knew that I needed to learn how to use the manual settings if I was going to have great pictures, but I haven't had time to take a class. I purchased this book, along with \\"Learning To See Creatively\\" and couldn't be more pleased. These books are like having a teacher in my home.

But for me it has been a fantastic find!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I read the first edition and the second; the person that says \\"the author relies strickly on his camera's automatic exposure system\\" is SO WRONG it isn't funny.

Since reading it I have not hardly set my camera to anything but MANUAL mode! For everything from outdoor shooting to indoor weddings, manual is the way to go!My dream is to find a similar book to help with the harsh over exposing or heart breaking under exposing of external flash (i.e. speedlite) photography. Anyone have any recs? This book won't really help with flash photography, Bryan is mostly into natural lighting, which is great. But sometimes (a lot of times) you just have to power up the old flash unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginner's book","review":"Having just made the jump from digital P&S; to a dSLR, I bought this book on a friend's recommendation.The author does a good job of explaining the basics of photography, something most of us using P&S; cameras have little clue about.The book was very informative and helpful. The pictures in the book are stunning (especially Bryon's smoking hot wife!), as should be expected in a book about photography.If you're already knowledgeable about exposure, shutter speed, f-stops, etc, then this probably isn't the book for you.However, if you're just getting started in real photography, I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"This book explains Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO in a very simple matter.

I am so impressed I have ordered two more of his books and will be ordering more again. Don't hesitate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I understand aperture, shutter speed and ISO now","review":"This book is excellent. I give it 4 stars because it didn't cover ISO THAT well for my understanding. Granted, it's a lot simpler than aperture and shutter speed, but I finished not really being sure when to use which ISO. Other than that the book is a must have. Highly recommended. The quality is incredible like others have said. I'm going to try Exposure and Lighting for Digital Photographers Only by Meadhra and Lowrie next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After all the praise I'd read about this book, I bought a copy (and quickly resold it).Nominally this is a 160 page book, but many of those pages are filled with the author's photos, and like a copy of Byte there's relatively little actual text. What text there is belies the 2004 date or the claim that it's updated: despite the occasional token reference to digital photography, this is a book about shooting film with 1980's technology, and is additionally biased toward landscapes. The author is big on focus-then-recompose shooting, which is much less feasible when shooting, say, humans than it is for mountains and distant tree silhouettes. The techniques advocated range from being inefficient with today's (or even 2004's) modern cameras to being inappropriate for modern dense digital sensors.There is a modest to moderate amount of common-knowledge content, but an hour spent with a web browser will give the reader that and more without all the anachronisms."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good information for all levels","review":"This is a great book for someone just getting serious about photography or as a reference book for more advanced photographers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Read, Inspiring, Highly Recommended","review":"Bryan Peterson's easy to understand, often humorous explanations and suggestions and his beautiful photographs have greatly inspired me. I find myself getting up early to take pictures of the dew or running out to take shots of the moon. I'm amazed at how my photography has improved. Even my 10-year old daughter was mesmerized by his photographs. I have read several of Bryan Peterson's books and they are all wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with Great shots!!","review":"I photograf for a while but in this book I found everything I needed for good shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"I liked this book a lot. It has a very systematic explanation of the range of creative exposures from story telling shots, to isolated subject, to freezing motion, and blurring motion. It really covers the basics.The big learning for me is that before I take a shot now, I think which creative exposure do I want to create. And the second thing I learned how to increase my chances of getting a correct exposure.I have read similar information elsewhere but it's the step by step that makes it really useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but product description is wrong!","review":"This is a great book for beginners like myself. That's why I think the product description on Amazon is for the wrong book: \\"For serious amateur photographers who already shoot perfectly focused, accurately exposed images but want to be more creative with a camera, here's the book to consult.\\"This is the book for anyone BUT the person who can \\"already shoot perfectly focused, accurately exposed images.\\" In fact, the book starts out explaining basics, like what is aperture, don't be afraid of \\"M\\" manual mode, etc. So, IGNORE Amazon's description and know that this is a useful book to teach the basics, help you to get to know your camera, and learn some tricks and tips to take better photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"I'm in the market for a new camera and have been trying to decide on which kind. I decided that before I invest in yet another camera, I should probably know exactly what it is I want to do with it! So, I bought this book to help me get a grasp on the basics of photography.

This book gives insight to exposure but it is basic, really basic. BUT the biggest issue that I had was that it seemed that in every situation, I should setup a tripod, adjust aperature and shutter speed manually. That may work for advanced or professional photographers but not someone that doesn't have a half an hour to take a picture. I also needed a book that gave me quick insights to how to set up a picture for taking pictures in dark environments. I found that I prefered John Hedgecoe's new manual of photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the Beginner...","review":"This book provides an excellent survey of the topic for any beginner. All aspects of exposure, from shutter speed and aperture to filters and the relative benefits of film vs. digital are discussed. The book is very well and succinctly written. The photographs accompanying the text vividly illustrate the concepts discussed (i.e., the photographs discussing aperture and depth of field very well illustrate the impact of larger apertures on depth of field). An excellent introduction for the beginner. For those beyond the novice stage, however, the book would provide almost no information that they would not know. This book was clearly written for the beginner in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understand Exposure","review":"I think this book is wonderful. I haven't even finished reading it yet and I already have learned so much. I am a self taught photographer and love how easy it makes shooting in manual mode.

I love the creative approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding survey for any basic photography collection!","review":"The revised edition of UNDERSTANDING EXPOSURE is outstanding, using the author's professional photography as examples for explaining the basics of light, shutter speed, and results. Tips on great shooting using either film or digital camera supplement photo examples and make this an outstanding survey for any basic photography collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information, but a little dry...","review":"This book has good information for the novice to intermediate photographer abouut exposure, but it reads a little dry. I have tended to skip through the chapters looking for certain topics rather than reading from beginning to end, as it does not lend itself to sitting down and reading that way.The information presented in the book is very helpful, however, and I have gained a lot from the lessons I have learned so far..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed! The concept of exposure should NOT BE LIMITED to outdoor photography. NO mention of flash concepts!","review":"I was very disappointed in the book and will be returning it. My book had a copyright date of 2004 and was a \\"revised edition\\". The author talks about taking a \\"creative correct exposure\\" but he severely limits the concept to outdoor photography. Aperture, shutter speed and ISO are only the beginning. The book DOES NOT address flash photography. The word \\"flash\\" does not even appear in the index. Understanding how and when to use a flash, indoor or outdoor, is a very important concept in taking creative correct exposures. I was left with many unanswered questions after reading this book. To summarize the book; take pictures in manual mode and learn how to use the camera's exposure meter. Search the internet for more information and save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and You will understand exposure.","review":"This is an excellent book. It has enhance my knowledge about exposure greatly.

After my first class I realized that photography is much more scientific than I thought! I decided to get this book hoping that it facilitate my learning. It totally did! Peterson's writing style is consistent, clear and easy to read without comprimising his obvious expertise. He writes as if he is teaching you verbally in a real class. The ordering of the material feels a natural flow. Not to mention the fabulous examples he provides with his own images. (I especially love how he provides the actual metadata for EVERY image which is very helpful for future reference). Great book...highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book out there:)","review":"I am a photo enthusiast trying to learn photography. Purchased Nikon's high powered DSLR camera, then purchased 5 books on photography. This was one of the five I stumbled upon by accident. It surpassed the rest and is worth its weight in GOLD!!

You will NEVER look at a picture the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photography made simple","review":"This book was definitely worth the money. The author simplifies complicated concepts and through innumerable examples, he makes the reader understand when andd where to use which modes. It wont make you a pro overnight, but it will definitely give you insight into becoming a better photographer.The examples he uses are very simple in terms of analogy so it makes the concepts very easy to understand. His pictures also give you ideas of what you can photograph and does make you a bit more creative. Overall I couldnt be happier with the purchase, the pictures are very good quality in full color and there are pictures on pretty much every page and take up quite a bit of the page thus you can see the results of his expertise. If you have an SLR and are a biggener or want a little bit more insight, this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Err .. is that it?","review":"I ordered this book based on the rave reviews it gets here, and elsewhere. I was looking forward to reading it, thinking it was going to help me improve my photography, master difficult lighting etc. So, when it arrived, I eagerly unpacked it, sat down to read and ... err, is that it?Essentially it is a very basic beginners book. Probably for beginners its fine, but once you've figured out the elements of depth of field, and the idea that metering will not provide the optimum exposure in all cases, there's not much else.If you're new to photography, take a look. If you've read any other books, or taken a few rolls of film, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I got the book ontime without any damage.The package and condition of the book is great.A good book to learn better photograpghy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes","review":"I really had high hopes for this book...

I have been taking pictures for years but never really understood \\"photography.\\" I bought this book hoping that it would help me understand what correct exposure means and how to do it myself without relying on the cameras auto mode. It is a great book, really did help me figure it all out. Doesn't mean I am an expert now but its a great stepping stone from just taking pictures to really capturing a moment and making pictures that I think are beautiful to look at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review: \\"Understanding Exposure\\" (Revised Edition)","review":"After a long break in amateur FILM SLR photography, I purchased this book because I thought it may offer some good advice for the DIGITAL SLR amateur photographer--- and does it ever! Bryan Peterson offers some really great advice for attaining exposures which transform normal photographs into really dramatic photographs. Whether you are into film OR digital photography, this book is worth your time and money. The author manages to use great examples of dramatically exposed photographs, then he very briefly explains how he shot it. If you enjoy taking pictures, this book fires you up; Peterson motivates you to pack up the camera and use his easy-to-understand advice to capture his visions in your own pictures. An easy, enjoyable, and enlightening read. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is a keeper!","review":"This is a very good book to explain exposure.

The second copy is because 1) you won't be happy loaning your only copy or 2) at some point you will want to give this as a gift to a close friend who is on his/her first steps of serious photography.The secret of this book lies on its simplicity and straight to the point talk. Its like a close friend teaching you with all the patience a human can give."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid information for the beginner, and then some","review":"I bought this book with an already full understanding of the basics of exposure, so I didn't need it for what the title claims it is, but I expected some additional insight into the nuance of exposure, and how to handle tricky lighting situations. It delivered. The book is not brilliantly written or well organized, but it's logical and coherent. I also lent it to a friend who was an SLR beginner and it was very helpful to him. Overall, a good, solid effort that does impart valuable knowledge to both the beginning and intermediate level photographer, though perhaps not much to offer those with advanced skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazed","review":"The author takes all of the technical jargon, drop kicks it into a rubbish tin, then explains in plain and simple terms, what it is that you really need to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally someone gets through to me!","review":"I went to our local library and found this book, took it home and as I read (I didn't want to put it down!)I finally began to understand the concept of exposure!

Bryan's book is the best. It is not full of the tech-no jargon you see books (by some pretty famous photographers) who I believe get caught up in the \\"technical language\\" resulting in books that are difficult to follow and impossible to utilize in the field.Bryan, explains, shows examples and you can go outside your front door and try some of his techniques. The results are amazing. Buy this book with the realization you will carry it with you in your bag for reference.Walt Paholak"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very remidial","review":"This book was nowhere near as detailed and in depth as I had hoped. But putting that aside I found it to be a frustrating read. The author makes extensive use of analogies that I found confusing at best, and simply absurd. I found the author consistently patronizing, and his writing style to be extremely long winded. I actually found the 2 pages on exposure setting in my camera's instruction manual to be considerably more informative and easier to understand.But, if exposure is a complete mystery to you, and the idea of 100 worker bees carrying buckets and trying to catch water from a variable flow faucet makes it easier to understand how a camera works, then by all means this is the book for you. Hence my 2 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really about understanding exposure","review":"This book came recommended by a number of people as a great book to help you understand exposure, just as the title implies. However, it doesn't really help a photographer understand exposure, it just tells the photographer to use the program modes and viola, that's a \\"correct\\" exposure. There is no real discussion on what makes an exposure \\"correct\\" other than the electronics in the camera--aka what someone else decided is correct. This book does not really encourage experimentation with understanding what exposure will convey the artistic message you as the photographer are trying to convey. Also, many of the example photographs in the book need to be updated/modernized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for any Photographer","review":"If you're just starting or a pro this is a great book! I'm learning a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books...","review":"Too many errors, a condescending (almost insulting) writing style, inconsistencies, and a lack of real information make this book hardly worth reading. It would be difficult to know about these problems without reading the book first so I hope this review will give some insight into these issues.The book is probably aimed at beginners yet those are the ones who can least afford to get bad information. Those who already know about exposure can see the errors for themselves but the beginners will read this and think this is the real goods. It is not.There are far better books from which to learn about exposure, among them: Ansel Adams \\"The Negative\\" and \\"The Camera\\" and Alain Briot's \\"Mastering Landscape Photography\\".Peterson's book is highly rated and my guess is the rave reviews are from those new to exposure, who don't know they are being shortchanged."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Map Without Any Roads","review":"If I had to sum up this book in one sentence I would describe it as \\"A map without any roads\\".The title is misleading because there is no real \\"How To\\" involved in this book. If the author's goal was to say \\"Hey! Look at my pictures and the setting I used to get them\\" then he has succeeded. The rest of the books are some sectioned off background information to help the reader to understand the images better.The reason this book gets a 2 instead of a 1 is because there are some really nice images in the book. I was going to give it a 3 but then I just remembered how the author was breaking his arm patting himself on the back when ever there was an image of his wife & kids involved instead of leaving them anonymous like the other subjects.As far as teaching, you would receive better information from the person working at the local camera shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for starter and intermediates!!!","review":"A great resource...

This book is highly enjoyable, a little dry at the start. He explains the very basics, I guess that's good if you are just going into photography and don't know about stops, ISO, shutter speed, etc.He talks about the sensor of the camer and how it's at the center at everything - that and other hints on how to take pictures make this book very enlightening. He even tells you exactly what to do on certain days, it's excellent.One thing he could have talked a little more was composition and how to make a dull looking picture a very good one (composition). The discussion on filters was very useful in understanding how to solve the problem of differently exposed areas in your picture, I'd probably just buy this for that section.High highly recommended read, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, concise book dispelling the fears of Y2K","review":"Debunking the Y2K Terrors & Tales is an excellent book, filled with common sense examples that dispel the fears and mock the myths about the crisis many expect at the end of the year.

It is a short story but feels like it goes on forever. Overall the best part of the story is when Ginger and Pickles discuss their frustration on not eating the customers. Overall boring. It also mentions them selling snuff a few times. My children kept asking me what snuff was. That was the only part of the story that stood out to them. My nine year old didn't want me to finish the story and my four year old kept interrupting. Not worth keeping, we deleted it. But it is great that there are free kindle books, I guess when you download free books you will get a few duds once in awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Half Pretty","review":"My children have Peter Rabbit in the same format. The story of Ginger and Pickles is dull. My children who will sit through chapters of books were up and gone before we even got halfway through Ginger and Pickles. Some of the pictures are beautiful. Many are just simple sketches, with no color. I was hoping for another treasured classic, since they love Peter Rabbit, but this one was definitely a dud. The book looks pretty sitting on the shelf, but that is where it stays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thums up for you IQ","review":"Very very good cd, IQ wasn't one of my favorite band in the early days.Since the album \\"Ever\\", fourteen years ago, they have done really great prog albums and \\"Dark Matter\\" is one of the best album of the band. From the beginning to the end, this cd is full of powerful music, great transitions, good feelings and melodic instrumentation as we, prog music fans, really like. Highly recommanded. A jewel in my cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Wall Of Sound!","review":"DARK MATTER was my first introduction to the band IQ. I had heard an mp3 sample of the tune Sacred Sound and I was hooked. That song alone is worth the price of admission. Sacred Sound is very reminiscent of the classic Genesis lineup and does remind one of the tune Watcher Of The Sky. Other great tunes on this CD are Born Brilliant and Red Dust Shadow. I have heard some criticism of the lyrics on this CD being anti-American and I suppose they are, but I can tolerate such things if there is a point to it, and the music is good. This CD is great. Finally, some folks do not care for the vocals of singer Peter Nicholls, and that might just be personal taste, but the perfect keyboard work of Martin Orford more than makes up for any vocal shortfalls. This is just a great band. This one is definitely a buy for all fans of progressive rock and those who pine for the classic days of full sound bands like Procol Harum, Genesis, and YES."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern day neo-prog masterpiece","review":"\\"Dark Matter\\" gets everything right,... period. Epic, melodic, intensely creative and gorgeously produced. I was introduced to IQ quite late in the game via the equally fantastic \\"Frequency\\" and was hooked. I've been a long-time fan of the genre and was delighted to discover these guys. I could go into drawn out evaluations of each song but the bottom line is; if you like excellent neo-prog, you'll love \\"Dark Matter\\". If you're an IQ fan, you're sold already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album","review":"This was the first IQ CD I had heard (though I have heard about 4 other songs by them previously), and all I can say is WOW. IQ is not a band that gets any airplay in the US, and even though I am a big prog listener, until a few months ago I never even heard of them even though they been around a long time. After seeing numerous great reviews of the CD on various prog sites and listening to the 30 second samples, I took the plunge, and am glad I did. Its the best new release of 2004. Every song is good, and the musicianmanship is excellent. Particularly good are Sacred Songs and Harvest of Souls. There are certainly some recognizable Genesis influences, but its not a mere rehash of Genesis either. I highly recommend this CD to any prog fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very high","review":"2 1/2Being a band in this genre named IQ, you would expect some intelligently structured, unlifted material, but the bland pop-prog manages to convey an epic mediocrity and copycat nature above all else."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those who are new to IQ, read on","review":"I picked up this album after reading over the reviews since it was also recommended by amazon. Obviously by my rating, I was not very impressed. I was introduced to progressive rock by Dream Theater about 15 years ago and until recently, I'm embarassed to admit, I didn't realize there was a genre called 'progressive rock'. The musicianship of IQ is good but I was hoping for something to grab me. The whole album is much more laid back and melodic than I expected. The over all tempo is - and hopefully this makes sense - trapped in between soft rock and your normal every day rock. As far as songs go, they seemed to meld into one another. In other words, no one song stood out as the leader of the pack. This cd wasn't really to my liking but if what I described fits your fancy, go for it - you'll love it.For those of you who are looking for a review and are already fans, I'm afraid I can't be much help to you in regards to comparing this album to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this","review":"awesome old school sing along hard core punk rock. jade from AFI, eric ozenne from nerve agents. what more could you ask for? buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"east bay hardcore at its best","review":"Redemption 87 is freakin awesome. theyre a tuff band outta east bay that plays sick old skool hardcore. all their originals on this album are very very good, except for \\"Whats New?\\" which is only 9 seconds long. there r 3 covers on this cd, none i really like too much except for \\"Tied Down\\" by Negative Approach which is pretty sick. the 3 last demo songs are pretty good, sound kinda similar to Minor Threat's style.

I thought it was way too long, so I put off reading it for a few months. Finally I picked it up and almost immidiately fell in love with the story. This series is one of the best fantasy series I've ever read!The main character is hilarious. I read so much (about a book a day) that not many stories surprize or delight me anymore. Not so with this novel. I was laughing out loud, again and again. I'm now twenty and this is still one of my favorite books.Fun enough for the kids, yet interesting and mature enough to not throw off the adults.And don't be thrown off by the overall rating.

Bean is expanded greatly and his reparte with Sister Carlotta alone is worth the price of admission. Another good read from Mr. Card."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read.","review":"It was interesting reading other people's reviews. People had complaints that never crossed my mind. Personally, I thought it was excellent. It took me only two days from start to finish. First of all, I enjoyed watching Bean and Peter's progression. Bean ponders on how Ender was able to beat about any enemy. Peter is forced to be more humble as he's outsmarted there are apparently others who are a step ahead of him. Among them are his parents, and are two of the most interesting characters in the book. I have to say, though, Bean and Petra's romance may not be appealing to some. Petra does, for some strange reason, want to have children with Bean, despite his altered genes and she's only eighteen at most? Furthermore, she knows he's going to die young, but she doesn't worry about that. The reasoning behind them getting together seems kinda weird. All in all, it was extremely interesting and I loved the ending. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It stands alone","review":"Well, this wasn't Ender's Game, as the other reviews point out. At times, it is too into the romance plot and I must admit that I didn't recognize some of the character traits in the characters.Despite this, I thought that the book was excellent. It isn't quite as action packed as... Ender's Game, but very geopolitical, which I find intersesting, and his view of the future is very neat. You can't look at this book as a action packed adventure, although it has that. Read it as a geopolitical thriller that tells continues the story of Ender's the somewhat modified army, and you should enjoy it. I look forward to the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! One of the worse books I've ever read...","review":"After so many years of being one of the biggest fans of Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender Series\\" I can't believe what a really awful book this is. It's condescending, insulting, and completely unbelieveable. It's really very sad that after I have enjoyed so many of his books that the very last one I read would be so very very BAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cards Religion on Display","review":"Where are the charachters from the first two books? Where did the relationship of Bean and Petra come from? Why is a teenage girl obsessed with child birth to the point of endangering her own life? Why is Card writing about a 14 year old boy having sex and getting a girl pregnant?It seems that either Card was forced to write a diminished story due to publishing pressures. Or he had to write about the joys of unrestricted reproduction to apease his mormon fans. Either way this was a horible book that was ruined for me as soon as Petra started nagging Bean to father her children. Card seems to have lost his way and I for one will not be buying his next offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bean saga sputters and fades...","review":"Like Children of the Mind, the least of the original Ender series, Shadow Puppets marks a point where Mr. Card has either lost interest in his characters or inspiration to continue the series. The drop in quality since Shadow of the Hegemon is precipitous. While reading, I was surprised by how uninvolved I often felt.That's not to say the book doesn't have its fun moments. The scene featuring a depressed Peter Wiggin right before a potentially career-ending press conference is hilarious, and the climax is fairly exciting. Yet the rest of the book is crushed by an overemphasis on babymaking (sure Bean and Petra are exceptional, but they're still teenagers), and the spark that makes you race through Mr. Card's earlier works is curiously absent.Still, fans of the Ender and Bean novels might as well read this book. Though the series seems lifeless now, the story still isn't over. A future volume detailing Bean's demise may be worth waiting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Has Its Good Points","review":"I am a big fan of Card and have read many of his works...including the previous books in this series. As usual, Card draws his characters in incredible detail. The relationship between Bean and Petra is very intimately and carefully shown and it is the highlight of this book. But unlike the vast majority of Card's other works this book just didn't \\"grab\\" me. It was a good story, and by no means will it turn me off to reading more of Card's works (or further books in this series), but somehow the book just didn't suck me in like most of his other books. Overall, this book should definitely be read in the context of the series...but don't expect anything too spectacular --> a rarity for Card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book lives up to all the expectations of the Ender and Bean saga. It is absolutly entertaining and amazing. This book is a page turner and I couldnt put it down. A Must Read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls far from the tree...","review":"I think few have expectations that this book or series measure up to Ender's Game. I started reading the new series with Ender's Shadow which was actually pretty good, but Shadow Puppets and Shadow of the Hegemon have been disappointments. The great thing about Ender's Game was that it was a book about kids, but you were able to suspend your disbelief that little kids were saving the world. Card fails to do that in these installments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously lacking...","review":"I have been a fan of Orson Scott Card for years and have ready everything that he has written. Unfortunately this book is a serious disappointment in both plot and, more pointedly, in dialogue. As the Battle School children are getting older they sound more and more like spoiled children. Card should focus on his \\"genius child\\" theme and avoid the children as they grow up, and should certainly avoid trying to write romance in any way shape or form. Of course, even with this book being a bomb and it looking like the entire series has fizzled out, I still would recommend reading this book if you have gotten this far in the series. You wont like it, but how could you avoid reading it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"just keeps getting worse","review":"The original Ender's game was deserving of a Nebula. Ender's Shadow was a worthy followup years later told from a different point of view. But the following three books in the \\"Shadow\\" series grew increasingly ridiculous and unexciting. Much of the book is in dialogue (either internal or external form) where the characters exhibit some self doubt, which could be compelling but here is just leaden. The author's anti-abortion political and religious beliefs are especially pronounced and blatant in this entry in the series, which some might find off-putting.But ultimately, it is the poor quality of the writing, and the increasingly ludicrous coincidences that propel the plot, that make this the worst entry in the Ender series that I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely bad from the get go","review":"I read all the other Ender books in the series so why not this one? The very first thing in the book is Achilles' rescue. I almost stopped reading right there. (It is taxing my limits not to swear or being vulgar right now) I thought that there might be a good explanation for it later on in the book. Nope! Not even close.Remember Peter the genius? Well, it's Peter the special ed student now. I have spend enough time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Achilles returning to the Hegemony is the moment this series jumped the shark.","review":"Not since Anakin and Padme has a romance been more boring or still-born.This is the last book in the Ender Series that I will ever bother reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going down hill fast","review":"I liked Ender's Game, and was ho-hum on the rest of the Ender series.I loved Ender's Shadow, and thought Shadow of the Hegemon was good.I did not care for Shadow Puppets much at all. The entire Peter Wiggin part of the story is awful! Is this the same character as in the previous books? The character who's clear thinking, logic, ability to appeal to the emotions of the people captivated the population with essays and arguments using the pseudonyms Locke and Demosthenes? No! This Peter Wiggin is extraordinarily self doubting, highly immature, and emotional. Strangely, after masterminding Locke and Demosthenes and always being a few steps ahead of everyone, he now can almost not make a move without help, consultation, an enormous amount of prodding, and a great deal of whining.For me, it was mostly a waste of time and money. I will be buying the next in the series shortly and hoping it is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadow Puppets is Right!","review":"Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are two of my most favorite books. This flimsy excuse for a book seemed like just another attempt by Card to cash in on the success of the rest of the franchise. I wonder if he realizes that while he may gain profits in the short term...in the long term it only serves to denigrate and hurt the whole series. I found the characters uninteresting as they seemed to really be puppets, acting out the desires of the author with no real sense of purpose or reason...other than thats where the author wanted to go. The plot was uninteresting and made me feel like I was watching a bad B (or C if there is such a thing) Sci-Fi movie.I am starting to wonder if William Shatner \\"Shadow\\" wrote this book. It's that bad. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Wrapup to the Shadow Series","review":"I thought this book nicely wrapped up the \\"Shadow\\" Series of the Ender books; Bean finds a reason in Petra to join the rest of the human race, Peter learns a harsh lesson from his own mistakes, Achilles finally gets his comeuppance, and the world is a little stabler place to live in. I did find that the post-Formic world was a little too much like our present world but Card himself states that the recent events in Afghanistan greatly affected his writing of this novel. So for the price of familiarity, we get to pick at Card's mind. Not too bad of a tradeoff.I do hope this was the last book of the entire series. Anything more and Card is milking it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of the Trojan Horse","review":"In this latest chapter of the Ender's Game saga, we find Peter, Bean and many of the other battle school grads only a slight distance from where we left them in the last book. The plot of Shadow Puppets revolves around Peter's decision to liberate Achilles from his Chinese captors. Everything collapses, though, when it appears that Achilles was not actually a prisoner at all but instead his supposed imprisonment is part of a deliberate ruse that Peter has walked right into. In a few seconds, Peters world changes. He learns to trust his parents, realizes that he isn't always right and has to flee his Hegemony compound.The world is dividing itself into factions, Bean decides to have a child, and much more ... This book is a must read for anyone enthralled by the Ender saga!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this book written purely for the purpose of bashingChina?","review":"I usually like Orson Scott Card's book but I was terribly offended by the book Shadow Puppets. Does he have anything nice or at least respectful to say about China? All he does in the book is either make China out as an insensitive tyrannical country on the whole or make fun of Chinese customs, such as those of respecting the elder and speaking humbly, even in a self-deprecating way. But Card really stretches it too far and it's done nothing but make me angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stunk worse than my gym socks","review":"Card is a masterful writer- he can captivate, engage, entertain, and educate. He writes stuff that will make me laugh out loud or cry like a baby. This wasn't any of that. It had no depth. It reads more like a report on what everyone is up to now- like one of those spam Christmas letters you get from people you knew in college. Sure, it is nice to hear from them, but it doesn't really move you to call."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow Puppets is a worthy continuation","review":"Shadow Puppets is a worthy continuation of the Ender series. Shadow Puppets continues the saga started in Shadow of the Hegemon (apparently they were originally one book), where the Chinese have taken over half the world with the insane Achilles driving their strategy. Although the beginning of Shadow Puppets suffered the same weaknesses of SotH (namely the inclusion of Achilles), most of the story ignores him and introducing interesting new characters and plot points.

All the characters speak with the same exact style of voice. A half-formal, half-scarcastic (but never genuinely funny) monotone. Card's earlier works in the Ender series were great, with characters you can care about. Here, it feels like we're at a dinner party with George Lucas and Orson Scott Card talking about their past triumphs, revisiting them, and in the end ruining them through boredom and pretentiousness. I can't believe how much yapping there is about stupid political situations. It could have worked if they didn't sound utterly made up, with a \\"And then the main characters were 100% right and guessed all the right answers\\" tacked on at the end.And the audiobook version: The characters speak as if everything they say is super-important and must be said in a whiny whisper. Chapters are separated by the cheesiest music I have every heard this side of an elevator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Tedious","review":"Like many of the other reviewers here, I find this series has steadily declined since the excellent \\"Ender's Shadow.\\" In both \\"Ender's Game\\" and \\"Ender's Shadow,\\" Card managed to blend action, philosophy, heroism, and moral dilemma in powerful, yet subtle ways. He made us really care about Ender and Bean, and he kept the tension perfectly balanced. Unfortunately, all of the subtlety seems to have disappeared, along with much of the action. I finished \\"Shadow Puppets\\" not only caring much less about the characters than I had before, but downright irritated with them. And I had a headache after being hit non-stop with the Sledgehammer of Morality.

AWFUL game","review":"Wow, there's so much to say. This is probably the worst game I have played in a very long time. The idea of bringing back old, washed up wrestlers is an awesome idea. I rented (thank goodness) Legends of Wrestling because it had the old Hulk Hogan and many of my favorite wrestlers of yesteryear on the cover. However, when I brought it home, I was very disappointed. The graphics are so-so, the collection of wrestlers isn't all that great, there is a lack of good movie footage, load time is terrible, game options are terrible, and so much more. When the game is loading, it shows a series of about 10 different wrestlers still 3d pics, which is _very_ annoying. The worst thing is gameplay. The wrestler is so hard to control, it's unbearable. The wrestling moves are pathetic. Pretty much everything about this game is pathetic.

This story was different from so many others on the subject because it dealt with love through submission. The first half of the book is good; the last half confused me a little. A third person, Laura, is introduced into their relationship, and Julia has no problem with this. I guess I'm old fashioned, but jealousy runs through my veins and I could never be as accepting as she. Also, why is it that most D/s novels feature relationships like this, not completely committed? Well, besides that, I liked the book. It is very erotic, and if you are into dominance and submission, you will enjoy it.

I enjoyed this book up until the last 50 pages or so. I got the feeling that the writer was struggling with a suitable/plausible ending to an otherwise enjoyable story. It dragged on a bit and the final who-done-it & more so - why - felt weak and far fetched for such a big story.I did enjoy the info and data on the NPS, racism and sexism in the south, and the strength of the character.

This is a bit of a culture shock to Anna, particularly when she discovers a strangled teenage girl with a KKK hood on the Trace. What did Anna get herself into?Author Nevada Barr continues her tale of the life and times of Anna Pigeon. This chapter in the Anna Pigeon saga was about average, but still entertaining. I now envision Ranger Pigeon as a creature of the open vistas of the West, so the narrow Trace, a job that involves a lot of vehicle time, and kudzu everywhere is a bit of a disconnect for me.BUT, as I've written before, if you want to understand the psyche of Anna Pigeon, and grow with her, then you need to read all of the books in this series, in order of their publication.Watch out for alligators, Ranger Pigeon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep South","review":"This summer I discovered Anna Pigeon. In my opinion - and I only have one book of the series to read, this was the best.

The descriptions of the landscape are the only worthwhile part of this bigoted travesty; apparently, her perspective of Natchez never adjusted from the watchtower she occupied as a park ranger there. I did not read her last book -- set in New York -- but did it have any descriptions of \\"plunger justice,\\" or is that now considered socially acceptable. I suggest Ms Barr stay with what she understands and write a book on botany."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book","review":"I just finished reading this book & it was so hard to put down.

At first he just like the shapes when they were out of the table... they rattle. It wasn't until about 14 months old that he started to understand the concept of hitting them through the table with the hammer. Now at 17 months old it is one of his favorites. The string on the hammer could be just a little longer... it has to be lined up just perfect in order to have enough room to hit the shapes. Also the sides could be a little taller so that the shape actually fell through the other side when it is sitting on the floor. Normally my son wants me to hold it while he hits so he can push the shapes all the way through. Overall we really like this toy and I'm always excited to find a basic non-battery skill teaching toy. We recite the colors while playing with this and some of the shapes... although some are hard to really name. Oh and my son thinks any toy you can hit is great... definate bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a great toy","review":"My 22-month-old has loved this toy for almost a year.

Wait until Hallmark wakes up and smells the Elmers and makes a top-knotch scrapbook program... which will hopefully come soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good for graphics but that's about it","review":"It is so frustrating because you can't work a 2 page spread with the two pages side by side. I've only used this for printing out some clip art and/or sayings and such. And when I've used it for a full page layout, it always leaves a 1/2 inch boarder around the edges of white...I know that's a printer issue but it's still annoying. I would never use it for a full page layout."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed...","review":"I saw this in the store the other day and thought what a wonderful idea!! Considering the Hallmark name, I thought it had to be decent. I hate it. I put in the time to learn how to use it. I have a technical bachelors degree and work in the IT field, so you'd think I'd be computer savvy enough to use this. I have hundreds of digital photos and was quite upset to see the note in the instructions to only use the square or retangular templates with digital photos. What??!! That makes it useless to me. $20 down the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I was very anxious to receive the Hallmark Scrapbook Studio. The day it came in the mail, I installed it on my computer only to find it did not work. Each time I tried to use a pre-designed template, my computer would crash.

My problem with the book is it's an exceptionally poor quality print - the book is new and yet the text looks faded and in some cases practically disappeared! Very disappointing.

Since it says 6 up, I thought it would sit on a shelf for another two years before he could play with it but I was wrong. He's able to do it and is actually quite good having whipped through the first two levels very quickly. The third level was more challenging but it kept him occupied as he tried to solve the challenges. My three year old daughter who has no patience at all and who I never knew was able to solve puzzles, sits there and plays with this toy quietly. She's moving through the first level quickly as well so I think the age level on this can skew younger if you have kids who have the patience for it...or they will develop the patience for it because it's so much fun. Definitely educational but also great tool for parents who want to keep their kids occupied. Only problem we have now is they fight over it - of course!"},{"rating":"2","title":"age 3+","review":"I bought this for my 3 1/2 y.o. daughter. Unlike other games it's 3D which is much more appealing for this age. She didn't get it at first and i thought she was too young.

They are both a year older now, and still enjoy it. My oldest is now ready for the \\"adult\\" version but the more difficult puzzles of the Jr. game still provide some challenge. An unexpected benefit from this \\"game\\" is that my sons love to watch each other play and offer encouragement and sometimes advice, and neither gets discouraged when he gets stuck--how great is it to see that?It also travels really well, we take it in the car for our frequent long trips and take it on the boat to play during snack time.Parents--I definitely recommend both Rush Hour versions and the booster cards."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun game that encourages problem solving - LOVE IT!","review":"The children absolutely love to play this game and I bought the Rush Hour Jr. for my youngest son, we also have the regular version for the older kids. His two older siblings have also gotten quite a bit of use out of it (ages 6, 9, and 10). My two oldest (ages 12 and 16) enjoy the regular Rush Hour. It is hard to find something that encourages problem solving and keeps their attention, I am happy that Rush Hour and Rush Hour Jr do that. In my career I see many adults that have no clue how to solve problems on their own and I am trying to instill that into my children at a young age.

I taught him how to set it up himself and how to play. He sits quietly with it for ages working through each puzzle. I love hearing his thought process on it. \\"What's blocking the ice cream truck? The fire truck. What do I need to do to move the fire truck?\\" etc, etc. I sit and watch him and he goes through them all on his own, shifting the pieces to move each car in the proper way. A great game for problem solving, seeing the bigger picture and the details. I highly recommend this game! He has mastered the green (beginner) cards and is now making his way through the yellow (intermediate ones)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game","review":"Purchased for DS7 but fun for all of us. We spent a couple hours playing this game when first received. Love the convenient storage pouch also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great strategy and improving concentration game","review":"We bought this game after reading positive reviews and deciding that we were trying to avoid a lot of plastic toys this Christmas. We focused on games and puzzles instead, and this has been my 5 year old twins favorite. The concept is simple - move the trucks and cars out of the way so the ice cream truck can get through. I'm impressed with the patience and strategy my 5 year olds have displayed. It's also small, so it can be taken on vacation, etc. Great addition to our games!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"This game is pulled out nearly every day.

Very easy clean up, which I REALLY like.It did a good job grinding pumpkin seeds that had soaked in water for several hours (was supposed to be 24) for a raw foods pate. We had to add a bit of water at the beginning because it was just creating a sticky paste on the blades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The 5th edition of this book had been compulsory reading during my undergraduate inorganic chemistry courses: it was the inorganic chemistry bible. This edition fails to reach the high standard of its predecessor. In fact, it isn't even a good advanced inorganic chemistry text. Much of the really useful stuff that forms the basis of an understanding of inorganic chemistry has been omitted in favour of niche topics. The book would be better called 'Advances in Inorganic Chemistry' or 'Selected Topics in Inorganic Chemistry'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected","review":"This was one of the best book for inorganic chemistry, but this edition is very different from the previous ones. Many useful chapters have been done away with; they have been replaced with chapters rather poor, especially those about catalysis.I advise the fifth edition, which is much better, even if it's quite old: the updates of new edition don't offset its flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me!","review":"More like a dictionary or reference guide than a textbook.

That comes within the feel of the race and thensome. For Burnout, the game actually seems to falter a bit through the lines. Largely because the game is one of the most lackluster video racing games ever. Not only that, the game also has its replays in crashes more likely than the game itself. Although they are nice, the feel of getting first place is really not there in this game at all. Instead, you're mostly draging around in the mud. The object of the game is for you to race and not only capture first, but also fill your boost meter to the max, by closely missing each of the ongoing cars. It does seem to falter a bit, and also the game is not the best in control. I strongly suggest you pass up this game, and instead get Mario Kart: Double Dash instead. You'll have a much better time."},{"rating":"2","title":"O.K. But not O.K.","review":"I think this game is cool,but there are some bad things....THE BAD THINGS ARE:It is very fast.Long roads to travel.And, you have to race to get more roads.THE GOOD THINGS ARE:It is rated E {for everyone}.It will take a YEAR to finish the game.And I think you sould try it!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok!

If you're looking for a game to race against your friends--don't choose this one. The courses are so long that you rarely even see the other player on the course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but...","review":"I love this game!! The racing is challenging yet rewarding at the same time. You complete grand prix's to get new tracks and chances at new cars. I also like the crashes...its a lot of fun to crash as much as you can but still finish the race. I would have given the game a ten except for one thing. The tracks are repetative. You open up a new track and it is just bits of old tracks pieced together and done backwards. Nevertheless, the game is still very challenging and fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a good, fun racing game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this one a miss","review":"I really regret purchasing this game. Good idea, poor implementation.The back cover leads you to believe that the game is all about terrific crashes. In the game itself, the crashes are far from spectacular, and after a few crashes you're tired of seeing the tri angle view. The car models themselves are only marginally destructable, and the environment is not destructable at all, leaving you wishing you could skip the instant replay of the boring crash scenes.I spent the first few minutes of the game going through menus to turn off the terrible music. Graphically, the game is anything but impressive.I wouldn't reccomend this title to anyone, it seems as though little to no effort went into the development of this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Awsome Game!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this game is sweet, the graphics are total awsome, and the game play is nice. If I had a rating for control, game play, and fun. through a 1-5 rating ill have to say control is 4.5, game play is 5.0, and fun is 5.0.

I started playing and i decided to get into an accident to go along with the theme of the game, it was nothing special and yet i still lost controll of the game. i went on and every single crash you get into, no matter how small, will cause you to loose controll of the game to go into some replay, and that is the single handed most annoying feature i have seen in an game. the graphics are nothing special and dido for the controlls and gameplay. if you want a good racing game go to something like rumble racing and don't waste your time on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaded - Get Burnout 2 Instead","review":"I have to admit that I am probably jaded. I got Burnout 2 (B2) before getting Burnout 1 (B1) and there is a world of difference. Now, if I had gotten B1 when it first came out, I might have been impressed. But, now, there is no way I would trade them. B2 has much better graphics, better sound, slightly better control. B1 takes too long for many races. It forces you to see crashes way more often than you want to. I did not find B1 any \\"harder\\" than B2, just more annoying. The jaggies on B1 make it hard to see detail, so that makes B2 so much more impressive (it runs on the same hardware). Only get B1 if you want the \\"full\\" Burnout experience and/or are trying to be records (the latter is my perspective, obsessive-compulsive person that I am)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For Sore Losers","review":"This game is great!....unless you're a sore loser... these kind of people shouldn't play this game. I've seen my 17 years old brother playing it. Once he crash, he restarts the race. What a waste of time. The racing takes time but it gives you many chances of winning. Just don't give up. Hit the gas.I love the sounds of crashing and screeching of the tires. -sighs- Fast Cars. o0o fast cars... very fast acceleration.I think this game is a lil' bit better than Gran Turismo. Because Gran Turismo is so serious and difficult. Long time to load. You want to race for a quick time? Use this game. Fast. Easy. A lot of fun. I don't even use memory card. Try rent at Blockbuster.

Its too expensive for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"none","review":"I gave Burnout 1 star beacause it didn't use the car's names. It used the janaric name of the cars like sportscar and pickup. That alone cost the at least one star. Second, I didn't think that the game presented a real chalange like other racing games such as Need For Speed do. In those games you get points for doing things like placing in races, but you don't get that in Burnout. You also have different options in NFS that you don't get in Burnout. You can Be the Cop and catch the annoying speedsters. In my opinion, you just get a better quality of game in NFS. I would say not to buy this game. If you like a real racing game, Burnout is a poor choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"great game, but...","review":"this game is hands-down the best racer for GC. but there's a major flaw. this game took me about 3 days to beat, after you unlock everything theres really nothing left to do but 2 player mode which dries up easily. and the AI isnt NASCAR worthy. this game is great for renting but not for buying.-Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is going to be great","review":"This game is cool... and I know my games and this looks like a very good game!Well I will be honest I do not like Crzay Taxi the same people that are making this game for GameCube but this game is not a timeing game so i hop this game is cool.The game is cool for ps2 and I really like it for ps2!If this companey is reading this make a nascar game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad games don't get better with age","review":"this game is so incredibly bad it should be a crime to sell it. i am referring to the ps2 version, but i doubt there were any improvements made to the gcn port. do not let anyone tell you otherwise...this is a bad game. if it were possible to give it negative stars i most certainly would.now for the reason why. the advertisements give every indication that the crashes are realistic. while that is the only statement that may be true, let me tell what isn't. this game is no fun. i do not like a linear racing game of this sort. the crashes are fun to see the first time. after that it becomes tedious to watch not one, not two, but three angles of the same crash.let's take out the crash effects. what you are left with is a horribly bad race game. it can be beaten easily.steer clear of this money robbing hack job of a game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I was never compelled to write a review before, but this CD was so disappointing and irritating to listen to that I just HAD to.

In a nutshell, this is a really bad bad movie, from any angle you look at it. Lousy plot, mediocre acting and directing, poor special effects, using lots of old NASA clips from the Space Shuttle, and so rudimentary that any TV series from the late 70s has better SFX than this flick. I really think that despite the low budget, nowadays there is no excuse for making such a lousy movie (and Moon demonstrates that a good movie does not necessarily requires a fat budget). And by the way, the 2012 addition to the title is just a marketing hook trying to take advantage of the 2012 phenomena hype.In summary, do not waste your time and money watching this movie.

I'm just here to say I'm a huge fan, they rock in concert & their last 3 cd's are awesome!!Yes, I got on the \\"Name\\" bandwagon, that song caught my attention, and honestly, since then, they're my favorite band.If you like a variety of songs, great rhythm, songs written like poetry that you can relate to...what are you waiting for??"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY OPINION OF GUTTERFLOWERS","review":"I honestly have to say that it is growing on me. I \\"LOVE\\" \\"THINK ABOUT ME\\"...its unlike the other songs on the cd. Its more up beat and fun!! Johnny's lyric's are alot more intense and dark in comparison to DUTG! His voice has never sounded better. Robby's song's sound alot like his pryor songs that are on DUTG. SOmetimes its hard for me to to be critical when it comes to the Goo's. I really do love most of their music. I respect their determination and their strong will to keep putting out better music for their fans. I believe that gutterflowers will bloom!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Gutterflower Blooms","review":"Well have the Dolls ever put out a bad album? Nah. But some are better than others, and this one ranks up there with their best, like 93's \\"Superstar Carwash.\\" While not a total rockfest, this album has tons of energy that gives the great arrangements, and the gritty, honest lyrics thier power. The rockers, like \\"What do you need?\\" are harder and more sinister on Gutterflower than they were on \\"Dizzy\\", while the ballads are much more subtle and focused, Like \\"Sympathy\\". Rob's songs are better this time around, and John's Lyrics contain some real zingers. Listen to \\"What a Scene\\" and you will see what i mean. This album does a better job of balancing thier desire for commercial success with thier hard rock roots than Dizzy up the Girl. Some highlights include Big Machine, Think about me, What do you need? and Tucked Away. Well the whole thing is good. Dont just stand there, go out and get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Follow up to Dizzy","review":"DUTG is one of my favorite albums and I like nearly every song on the CD. Every song had a \\"soul\\" to it. Each one had its own sound while staying within the feel of DUTG. All the songs on Gutterflower sound 80% the same to me, just different words. I was expecting more. but definitely not a seemless follow to DUTG as the editorial reviewer thinks. If you're in the mood for some good Goo Goo Doll,s get your copy of Dizzy or Ego."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spin Doctors, Gin Blossoms & now Goo Goo Dolls","review":"\\"Gutterflower\\" comes off very forced and desperately commercial. The end result is a very dull and boring album that doesn't offend, but it is very unmemorable. Spend your cash on \\"Superstar Carwash\\" if you don't already have a copy and don't waste your money on this disappointing effort. I hope the boys wisely invested all the money they made from \\"Dizzy Up the Girl\\". Look out Spin Doctors & Gin Blossoms, here come Goo Goo Dolls."},{"rating":"1","title":"very overrated band","review":"Dont pay attention to any of these 4 & 5 star reviews. This album is a complete waste of time & space in anyones music library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album - as good as Dizzy Up, no doubts!","review":"The reason this album was so good, as well as Johnny's normal amazing songs, is that Robby actually contributed something good this time, especially the much more upbeat 'Up Up Up'. I really like this album, the more you listen to it, the more you'll like it. You must buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would get 5 stars if Robby didn't sing!","review":"I've been a Goo Goo Dolls fan for awhile. I could never understand why Johnny doesn't sing on all of the songs. Robby might have one of the worst singinig voices I've ever heard on a major record label. I can't imagine the three guys, as a band, sitting around and thinking Robby's songs sound good.Johnny sings on 8 of the 12 songs. Robby only sings on 4. The 8 songs Johnny sings on are wonderful. \\"Big Machine\\" is probably my favorite on the album. As of right now, \\"Here is Now\\" has been the only song released, but I look forward to several of the other Johnny songs being released in the near future, to much radio success. These songs aren't as Top 40 as \\"Dizzy up the Girl\\" was, but I'm glad they're not. The Goo Goo's sound on \\"Gutterflower\\" is more mature, and very easy to listen to. Great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sell-out cd","review":"Although many Goo Goo Dolls fans may see their love ballads as a sell out to their previous Offspringesque punk days, I for one am a fan. Johnny's lyrics cut to the chase, you wouldn't think that a guy could feel such pain in Sympathy or Here Is Gone (especially with the upbeat style), but he does. Whether it was due to his recent relationship, Johnny sings what every girl wants to hear and what, I hope, all guys eventually feel. I've listened to their \\"Ego\\" CD and I am definitely a fan of their \\"sell out\\" music that parallel the likes of Matchbox 20 and LIfehouse. \\"Dizzy Up the Girl\\" was a tough act to follow, but the Goos do it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome record, second only to Dizzy Up The Girl","review":"The wait for the Goo Goo Dolls new album was well worth is, as Gutterflower is a great addition to their album history. \\"Here is gone\\" is a very real song, their first big single in three years. It, along with \\"Big Machine\\" and \\"What a scene\\" will help them rise back to the level they left off with \\"Dizzy up The Girl\\". The songs have a much more rougher edge than the last album. Robbie sings a few more songs on this one, which adds to the originality of the album. You'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot","review":"this album isn't that good, it only has about 3 good songs on it. There best album yet is still dizzy up the girl. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at Best","review":"The Goo,Goo Dolls have learned the Formula Game.now while the Lyrics have gotten a bit more fuller on this Set there standard of Instrumentation&Production is in the same safe territory.this Band much like Matchbox 20 has found a safeness&they are both trapped in&stuck there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tacks, great CD","review":"This CD has been criticized for being \\"more of the same,\\" or sounding like the last two albums. However, that isn't a bad thing! Still, I disagree since the songs in this album sound a lot darker, angrier and edgier. Just read the lyrics and you can see that right away: \\"Love and sex and loneliness/Take what's yours and leave the rest/So I'll survive\\" or \\"Everything's all wrong, yeah/Where the hell did I think I was?\\" Try to find such lyrics in Dizzy up the Girl or Boy Named Goo. Anyways, most of the tracks are absolutely spectacular. Whereas the main track, Here is Gone, isn't all that great, many of the rest, like Big Machine, Sympathy and Think About Me are gems.A Definite Must Buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Because only half the songs are good","review":"Most of the goo goo dolls famous songs, like \\"Sympathy\\" and \\"Big machine\\", were written by the band's frontman. These songs are great; I have no problem with them. But the other half of the album has songs written and sung by another band member, and they are truly horrible, unless you like corny sounding country rock/ballad music.When I heard the rest of the songs, I was really dissapointed. Maybe you might disagree, but I'm the kinda person who likes bands like The Shins, The Strokes, The Vines, The Hives, etc. Try any of the bands for much, much better music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bass Player should not sing","review":"This CD has a few good cuts from it buts its like most Goo Goo Dolls CD's, Only a couple good songs then the rest are [not good]. The songs that Robby (bass player) sings are terrible. I can't stand his voice and the songs seem to be ones that somebody left in the garbage can. I'm sorry to be so scathing, but I have to move on to the next song every time I hear his voice. Maybe its just my tastes, but thats how I feel. They should have waited another year or bought some songs from somebody. It does have a few good singles but over all I'm glad I didn't buy it and just downloaded it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"I've only listened to it twice so far, but it sounds really good. I'm sure there will be at least 2 or 3 big hits to come off of this one.One thing that could have made it better - a couple of more songs by Johnny. Robby's tunes are decent, but Johnny's are VERY good this time. He must have been in the 'songwriting zone' while working on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Rock & Roll from Beginning to End","review":"If you liked \\"Dizzy up the Girl\\", you'll like this album too. It doesn't really break new ground. What it does do is offer the irresistable hooks that have become the Goo Goo Dolls selling point.There are the obligatory couple of dogs on this album. And no, they're not the songs Robby sings, which I thought were well done.'Worth checking out if you're already a fan. If not - pick up \\"Dizzy Up the Girl first\\". That one is still their undisputed best, as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Goo!","review":"I come from England and over here the goo goo dolls havent really made a name for themselves and not many people know them 'goo who?'. But i am one of the fans and I must say this is by far the best album although the other albums were magnificent too this album is incredible and really shows the brilliant talent of Johnny and Co. As one of the reviews previous to this states that they can listen all the way through well i truley agree. I hope they tour in the UK sometime, missed them last time :( .this is a must for ALL Goo Goo Dolls fans especially after a break up! :) Big Machine Rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I had previously read, and definitely recommend, a book by the same authors \\"Yes, You Can Still Retire Comfortably!\\". It was straightforward, practical, to the point. And in that book, they referred many times to this earlier book of theirs. I thought ... wow! ... if these guys can make market timing as simple as they made retirement planning, the world is a wonderful place.I was wrong. Simple? Yes. Totally simple. But, let me save you the time. While making a convincing case, they \\"prove\\" that only a fool (and I do not mean that with a capital F) would have bought stocks since about 1984. If you believe that, buy this book.In short ... buy their retirement book. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can successfully time the market?","review":"According to the backward looking evidence presented in this book - the answer is an unqualified yes. All you have to do is live to be 200 years old so that you can take advantage of the optimal buying opportunities that occasionally present themselves.Seriously, I bought this book because I enjoy Stein's humor, and there wasn't enough of it in evidence here. The techniques the authors advocate could have been expressed in a 15 page brochure and are basically useless to the typical investor with a 20 year accumulation period.Want to buy this book? Wait until it appears in the bargain basket at your local B&N or Borders Books. It won't be long before you can find it there."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one book I wish I didn't purchase","review":"The best aspect of this book is the \\"common sense\\" it provides regarding buying stocks/funds. However, in a nutshell, the authors recommend holding onto stocks/funds for 30 years. Unfortunately, I'm only 30 but even now at my tender age with all my investment years ahead of me, I wasn't convinced this is a book I want to trust for the next 30 years.The gains they talk about are hardly convincing. For example, using their approach would have gained 818% in thirty years HOWEVER had you simply done dollar cost averaging, etc you would have gained anywhere from 600-750%. It just depends on the years they were covering. I literally thought to myself...why go through 30 years of this if it will only result in that much difference. Their findings are interesting but not convincing or revolutionary enough to make me change my present investment approach...and I would be very surprised if anybody will be that affected by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Just awful!","review":"The authors not only completely fail to recognize the roll that randomness plays on their poorly conceived \\"strategy\\", they also profess to being able to eliminate the single biggest risk of investing in the stock market. If their secret really worked, why sell it to anyone? Why not invest everything they have, make a killing, and retire to a country of their own? The worst part is that this pair has access to DFA funds. That's a shame. It gives them credibility when none is deserved. I guess Ben wants to win all the money back (from other peoples' wallets) that he lost in his last game show . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, you can time the market","review":"Although Ben Stein is a very smart man he has several incorrect statistics in this book... Most of his ideas won't work in real life investing.. I hope readers take this book for what it is.. A joke! Or at best, entertainment. Do not use this book as an investment guide...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonishing!","review":"Astonishing that these highly educated authors have no idea what opportunity cost is. Their method of analysis is completely invalid; the market timer should not have the ability to double up on his investments if the regular investor cannot. If you can only save $1000 per month, how can you be investing $2,000? The answer, of course, is by borrowing money. Once you factor in the cost of borrowing that extra money into the authors' scenario, the entire market timing system collapses.It's also astonishing that the authors point out but gloss over the fact that their system would have kept your money out of the market for the past 20 years. Despite the bear market of '00-'02, the past two decades have been one great time to be in stocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm buying it for everyone I know!","review":"Finally, at last, a book about the financial market that combines great advice with true wit and common sense.

However, this album is a totally underrated gem. With the help of Bill Stevenson and Karl Alvarez they created an indie pop/punk masterpiece.Stevenson and Dando mesh amazingly well. Since Bill is quite a pop writing master himself, his drumming and production complement Dando's voice and writing style perfectly. Karl Alvarez has played with Bill for so many years, they play together like one unit and sounds brilliant.Lemonheads fans will love this album, and ALL/Descendants fans will love it as well. It really has the best of those two sounds. Not to mention some great occasional guitar work by J. Mascus.This is a seriously good and consistent album that has the kind of hooks that grow on you, which makes for lasting classic tunes. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappontment","review":"Worse album Evan has made to date - sad to say given how excited I was for this to be released!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and stereotypical","review":"I'm not a quilter, but I believe that a good book should appeal to me nevertheless. \\"Round Robin\\" seemed good on the cover but dissapointed me completely. I was expecting a story about real women and their lives, and instead I found this silly plot and unrealistic heroes. The dialogues were unbelievable and the whole book gave me an overall feeling of soap opera. The book might be great for soap opera fans, but I just wish the cover would make this more explicit... I'm sorry I wasted my money and time on such a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So close to being good","review":"I was looking forward to reading this, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. The book is very poorly edited, which caused me no end of distraction. It has the feel of a religious Harlequin romance novel, although religion never really shows up. I felt preached at. I wanted to know what happened to the characters, but felt like I was having to slog through the poor writing and editing to f ind out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than her First","review":"Can I give a review on a book I haven't actually finished?

I doubt I'll finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Round robin of stories","review":"This is the 2nd book in the Elm Creek Quilters series. The group has just formed the quilting camp and Sarah and the others decide to make Sylvia a Round Robin quilt. As each character takes a turn with the quilt, we learn some background and get up to date on their current lives. Each has their own challenges that they are working through, from teenage children, husbands who are struggling with their identity, unknown relations, and a difficult relationship with a mother. An old flame appears in Sylvia's life as she has challenges with her health. The women begin to come together to support each other through their ups and downs. I liked the change in point of view between the different characters and thought the author really started to get the series flowing with this one. I found the quilting descriptions fascinating. An enjoyable, easy to read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continues the interesting story but","review":"This is the 5th of the series I've read. I am enjoying them, but this one didn't measure up to The Quilter's Apprentice (first one) and later historical ones, The Runaway Quilt and The Lost Quilter, as I see it.I particularly enjoyed learning more of the history of Elm Creek through these characters (especially Agnes.) However, the themes with the supporting cast was rather contrived, especially the skateboarding issue and Judy's unknown family situation.The skilled author has used voice most effectively throughout allowing the reader to \\"hear\\" from each character. In each novel she has some interesting tricks that make me look forward to the next novel.I notice my library has multiple copies of each book that are well-worn! This is a quality series of worthwhile reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Round Robin","review":"The book was in excellent condition and would do business with this person again. thank you Sherry"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very touching story","review":"This story is all about conflict, resolution, and moving beyond the hurt. The Elm Creek Quilters are making a surprise quilt for Sylvia, while their own lives are in turmoil. As each quilter is given the round robin quilt to add to, some momentous event happens in her personal life that directly affects how her part of the quilt appears. I think that it is a good lesson on how art imitates life.It is all brought to a head at the end when Sylvia suffers a stroke. The following pages show how each quilter adapt to their own situation and face the changes that must occur in their own lives.A wonderful story and I can't wait to read the 3rd one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-bending!","review":"A wonderful book which really makes you think. This story answers a question which is put forth in the title \\"How do you make a four-dimensional robin round in all ten dimensions?\\" From Elm Creek of the present to the trans-Neputian Dyson sphere of the far future, this books manages to convey aspects of every human, and spatial dimension. A very odd mixture of the contemporary American woman novel combined with the tech-jam-packed novels of such as Stephen Baxter, this book may not be for everyone. However, I must state that I have never seen anything quite like it before. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely story of friendship and family redemption","review":"In the first book of the series, Quilter's Apprentice, the Elm Creek quilt camp is established. In this second book of the series, author Chiaverini takes us deeper into the lives of the Elm Creek Quilters. We read about a mother and daughter who don't get along, a woman whose father deserted her mother before she was born, a mother having trouble with her teenage son, a quilter whose husband is considering adultery, and others. Quilters will probably enjoy this book on several levels, but even a non-quilter such as myself can appreciate reading about the talents of others and will enjoy the friendship and support that the women in this book give to one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy successor to The Quilter's Apprentice","review":"Jennifer Chiaverini scores again with this beautiful follow-up to A Quilter's Apprentice. Elm Creek Quilts has successfully established its series of weeklong quilting retreats, and the quilters have settled into the pattern of teaching assignments, but in this book personal relationships are starting to unravel. Sylvia is determined to reunite Sarah and her mother. Sarah's husband Matt begins to regret what he sees as his and Sarah's dependency on Sylvia. Quilters from all over are coming to Elm Creek to escape and renew, while the Elm Creek Quilters are facing a multitude of personal problems. As the group pieces a round robin as a gift for Sylvia, we learn a little more about the strengths and challenges of all of the women who make up the group. Though at times predictable, the stories are touching, and well-told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I loved Round Robin and I thought it was much better than the author's first book. I enjoyed each of the stories of the Elm Creek quilters. This is a great book for quilt lovers, which I am one. However, this book with its great stories would appeal to other readers as well. Of course, I want to go a quilt camp like the one depicted in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Quilts and Quilters","review":"This is a great follow up to Ms. Chiaverini's first book - Quilter's Apprentice - but it is also a book that can stand alone. There is enough background given that reading the first book isn't a necessity. But, having read both books, this one was like returning to Waterford, Pennsylvania to greet old friends.This book takes us deeper into the craft of quilting, and into the lives of the quilters. We learn the background on several family disputes and watch as the tangled threads straighten out and become a part of stronger, more fulfilling lives.We also watch as two very important and lovely quilts pass from hand to hand, with each quilter adding her own intricate and personal design, until they become the pride and joy of the Elm Creek Quilters.This is a book to wile away a quiet evening, a book that's hard to put down and one which, at least for me, will be hard to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"charlotte not bad","review":"This is my favorite b. davis film!

Long ago Davis's married lover had been murdered - by her father, she thought - but actually by his wife, who kept that a secret because de Havilland had been blackmailing her. The movie is famous for the histrionics of the main characters, especially Davis who is wild-eyed and screaming through most of the picture (using a totally fake Southern accent to boot). De Havilland is at the opposite end of the spectrum: smooth-talking and quiet-toned. Sometimes both actresses come across as mere types rather than real people. Agnes Moorhead plays the maid who crows the right conclusions first, and is the best of the lot here - she's very convincing. Not a bad movie, but perhaps if the hysteria was toned down it would've been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte","review":"Love this movie, but ordered for a friend who loves it even more!!!

Bette Davis and Olivia DeHavilland chew the scenery with no holds barred and the result is over the top camp. The story line, with Bette living a life of guilt over the death of her married lover, can be confusing at times but the performances are worth watching. Agnes Moorehead, an actress who never got her due, is a riot as Velma, the housekeeper loyal to Bette. Certainly not a Bette Davis classic like The Letter or Dark Victory, but a good watch all the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hush Hush","review":"Love the line...\\"Public Relations?

Even if both versions existed, you couldn't put them on the same level. Olivia and Joan would have played it very differently. You can't say one of them would have been better.

I really wish Bette Davis would have done more movies like this. If you've already seen this movie, i recommend \\"The Nanny\\" (I think that's what it's called) and \\"Whatever happened to Baby Jane.\\" In my opinion, neither of these surpasses this.

The wear and tear on his lip was apparent on these VERVE sides-- Satchmo clams a few notes here or there. Despite that, the man's effervescence remained and his ability to vocally deliver was better than ever.Featured on COMPACT JAZZ are Louis with both small group and big band. Personnel on tracks 2, 4, 6, 10 and 13 are: Oscar Peterson (p); Herb Ellis (g); Ray Brown (b); Louis Bellson (d). Sound quality of these stereo sides is excellent. This collection is a fine opportunity to hear Armstrong just before he became a total parody of himself.

Following the chronological events of Miss Russo life we can see that those qualities, that are so much looked for these days, are not limited to over confident specialist. They seems to come first right from the heart and the soul. Growth is assured by a very high dedication to principals that must be deeply encrusted in the person. Miss Russo is a model of that determination, backup by a clear sense of what she should and can do. Events, knowledge, money are important but at least it is refreshing to see that work, help, family and friendship can still be a way to realized dreams.The book is not an how-to, nor it is a lecture on business and management principles. It is a story, a very good one, it must be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a long way to the top, and Sarina isn't there yet","review":"My parents gave me this book hoping I could find a leader to guide me.

I really wanted to like this book, but I could just about finish it. Why? I expected these men--of the Free Fellows League to be older. The heroine is in her second season, so I assume she is about 19. None of these characters worked for me. They all seemed to be self-involved and only concerned for the now. He gets wounded and comes back from the war--and whine, whine, depression. The author could have done so much more with these characters.At the start of this book the friends are at school and make this pledge-to form the Free Fellows League complete with rules. Talk about not growing up--just about the entire last half of the book is about why our hero can't love his wife because of some dumb rules he made up as a teenager. And also because he \\"isn't good enough for her\\". I realize that the reader has to take into consideration the timeframe of this book, but enough already.

And all the author has to say is that the galleons were defeated by England at the Armada battle in 1588.Well, in 1589 and even larger English navy, the Drake- Norris expedition was destroyed by the Spanish thus ensuring the survival of the Spanish Empire for another two hundred years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Elsewhere","review":"I looked forward to this book.

Having read what I did you would think that Fela invented everything in music and is the second coming of Christ. I regret buying this and don't say I did not warn you.

This book was easy to read and very engaging. I couldn't put it down. It was extremely funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of humor","review":"I read Naked on the recommendation of a great many people, and it may be because it was so highly recommended that I was somewhat let down. After being told time and again how clever and funny David Sedaris' writing was, I found it amusing at best, but never particularly enlightening or knee-slappingly funny.Naked is, simply, a collection of autobiographical essays relating to various events in Sedaris' life -- the years he lived with his grandmother, a youthful trip to Greece, adventures in hitchhiking and, as the capper, a visit to a nudist resort. Some of the stories are quite funny, others less so. A few are downright maudlin. There's nothing wrong with any of them, but I was never particularly engaged either -- chalk it up to personal taste. I don't really get into nonfiction unless I find the author or the subject matter particularly engaging. In the case of Naked, the author and subject matter are the same thing, and it's just not something I got excited about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor with an edge","review":"I already owned the print version of \\"Naked\\" when I purchased the e-version (my husband noticed it was on sale). Some of the essays are laugh-out-loud funny, and some are more dramatic, such as when David Sedaris talks about his experiences hitchhiking or caring for a quadriplegic friend. He doesn't pull any punches. I wish parts of \\"Naked\\" could be combined with some of the essays in \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\". His observations in both books cover emotions about family and acquaintances that everyone can relate to in some way. He also discusses his homosexuality and the attitudes of others about gay people, which are both funny and perplexing. My favorites in \\"Naked\\" are Chipped Beef, Next of Kin, The Drama Bug, Dinah The Christmas Whore, and Ashes. I thoroughly enjoy his writing style, even in the essays that are not my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and Original. A Very Good Read.","review":"This was the first book I've read by David Sedaris. It does not disappoint. His stories range from laugh-out-loud to cringeworthy, and are nothing if not original. I really enjoyed reading his various tales, told with just enough sarcasm and self-deprecation. I look forward to reading his other books.His writing reminded me of another gay humorist/memoirist Wade Rouse. His bookAt Least in the City Someone Would Hear Me Scream: Misadventures in Search of the Simple Lifeis absolutely hilarious. Made me spit out my milk one morning. I also recommend Chuck Klosterman's books likeFargo Rock City : A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural North Dakota. All of these are perfect to read on a long plane flight! It's just the person sitting next to you might think you're strange as you break out laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"I received my copy of \\"Naked\\" from my sister as a birthday gift in December, and because of a particularly stressful semester, have not had a chance to read it until now, mid-May. What a pleasant surprise it was to read this book and be entertained, appalled, energized, and at times left on the edge of my seat. David Sedaris has a knack for catching the reader off guard, which is where a great deal of his humor originates. This tome is nothing short of brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Dissapointing","review":"I contemplated purchasing this book for quite a while but coulnd pull the trigger. Finally after reading \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" by David Eggers, I was recommended this book. I didn't find any of the stories funny.

After hearing him in person, it's quite easy to picture him telling these stories, yet imagining, 'how in the world did he survive his childhood?'

I had high hopes considering the rave reviews everywhere, but was very disappointed to find out that this book was far from funny. This book is sad and depressing!

Inspired by a reader who had it recently while I was vacationing. I was being optimistic that this would not be a bunch of dumb, pointless essays. But I could not get past the first two! Come on, who goes around licking doorknobs, anyway? This is elementary fare. I did not find this amusing at all, just idiotic, as I said. So I have returned this Sedaris pulp too.

We had read the reviews in Amazon.com and were expecting a laugh a minute. However, we were all disappointed in the book. For most of us, the book elicited a chuckle or two, and generally not until the middle of the book. One Amazon.com reviewer commented on Sedaris' dysfuntional family, but it is Sedaris himself who is dysfunctional. One of our members has heard Sedaris on NPR, and she enjoyed the book more than the rest of us because she said it explained a lot of the background of his radio stories. The consensus was that Sedaris is a loser who is writing to elicit our sympathy for his poor pathetic excuse of a life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Me When It's Over","review":"The first 30 pages of this book are funny, entertaining and well written. As for the other 261, just tell me when they are over. Sedaris tries to keep you reading with odd dysfunctional family stories and adolescent troubles. But, it is not enough to keep this book afloat.

I laughed out loud numerous times while reading this book, and when I wasn't chuckling out loud, I had a knowing grin on my face. Sedaris is a master of diction--he knows precisely which words and metaphors to use in order to evoke maximum comic value from his musings. I did notice, however, that the lengthier pieces in this collection (especially \\"C.O.G.\\" and the title story) were not quite as amusing or entertaining as the shorter pieces (most notably \\"Get Your Ya-Ya's Out,\\" \\"I Like Guys,\\" \\"The Drama Bug,\\" and the hilarious \\"\\"Cyclops\\"). Perhaps Sedaris is more of a comic sprinter than a long-distance runner. No matter--he's a funny guy, and I look forward to reading his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but \\"raw\\"","review":"I love listening to David Sedaris on \\"This American Life\\" and think he's very funny, smart and clever. This is the first book of his I've read, and I was not disappointed. Most of the stories are side-splittingly funny, but there are a few that are almost too emotional or raw for my taste. Not too crude or unpleasant, just too personal, I think. I don't think I've ever read a book that was more aptly titled. Some of the stories (and all of them are great and well-written) just made me feel like he was baring himself (emotionally or psychologically) in a way I had not anticipated, and it was just a bit more than I bargained for. It won't stop me from reading some of his other books, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL AUDIO BOOK","review":"This book on audio download is wonderful because the stories are hilarious and insightful, and so very honest.

He never takes himself, or anything else too seriously.It makes you realize that life is never as bad as you think, or as good.I will definately buy the other books by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and Insightful","review":"These essays give an account of David Sedaris' childhood and early adulthood - the stories seem brutally honest, but he can always imbue what seems terrible and insurmountable with humour. I love the way he writes, and I laughed out loud many times. Although there were a couple of stories where the events were just plain horrible and unfair, and in the last essay \\"Naked\\" Mr. Sedaris repeatedly shows his complete lack of understanding of the names for female body parts, overall this is a worthwhile, entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickedly wry","review":"I had to stop from time to time and contemplate the world in which Sedaris lives/has lived as a talented, gay, Greek man living in Raleigh with his dysfunctional family and twisted worldview. I had to take said breaks, becase this book is too funny and meaty to read in big doses without some measure of physical or mental harm. BUY THIS NAUGHTILY FUNNY BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book of Decade","review":"I don't know how this book made it to the NY Times Bestseller. It was the worst piece of writing I have ever read. Even twenty year olds in my previous fiction workshops could write a more substantial, insightful story than Sedaris. It's pathetic that all it takes to sell thousands of copies of a novel is a person inventing the most outrageous stories about his 'supposed' real life. This should have been classified under fiction, since there is hardly a shred of truth to these short memoir essays. My advice : don't waste your money & time for this garbage; it comes a dime a dozen."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH","review":"I have yet to laugh.

My sister had been telling me about this author David Sedaris for a while and she got me a copy of Naked for Christmas one year. It took me some time to read it and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I trust my sister's taste in books but I had never really read a humorous book before so I didn't know what to expect. Sedaris's quirky and self indulgent humor caught me completely off guard and I actually found myself laughing out loud, something I rarely do when reading. The thing that I love about his writing style too is that I find he has a good blend of mixing humor and very moving little portraits of people (mostly his beloved dysfunctional family) without becoming sappy or cliched. My only gripe with this book was that a few of the stories pace dragged a bit, so I couldn't give it a five star rating. But on the whole, it is a great title that should be picked up by those who want a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed until my head exploded!","review":"David Sedaris has the kind of sense of humor we all wish we had. He looks at the world through twisted glasses and the result is hilarious. Sedaris writes simple stories with amazing uniqueness. I have to say, his story \\"A Plague of Tics\\" got an A+ for uncanny humor and for provoking side-splitting laughter.

Sedaris is naturally funny and is quick with a witty one-liner. And the way he describes people, you feel you know them. Probably my favorite story is the first one on how he dealt with his childhood tics: as he walks home, Sedaris had to go through the most bizarre set of obsessive-compulsive actions you ever heard. If you wanna laugh, buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Sedaris opens the door and lets you in.","review":"I read the fudge colored towels part on an airplane. I laughed hysterically and was sure that security was going to be waiting for me when I exited the plane.

I once read one of his books during a long flight;laughed myself to tears. everybody seated near me wanted to know about the book and the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny.","review":"David Sedaris is one of the modern writers with a skill for comedy. The stories in this collection are funny enough to give you laughs even after the first reading.\\"Chipped Beef\\" is one of the great early stories, demonstrating the use of understatement and overstatement to make a story of childhood one that is memorable with quite a few belly laughs.\\"A Plague of Tics\\" gives the reader a look into physical comedy on the page. The thought of the young man shaking and licking his way to school and back, every day is so hilarious that it is quite marvelous.\\"The Drama Bug\\" demonstrates the childhood fascination with drama but also the inflation of one's own talent with something that actually resembles talent. And that happens all the time. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud Hilarious","review":"The best thing about David Sedaris is that he is NOT a gay writer... he just happens to be gay. When he mentions something about his sexuality, it's very matter of fact- and really has nothing to do with the story he's trying to tell. I found so many things that I could relate to in this book... and things that made me think that my own family really isn't all that strange (when compared to his family!) Everyone I have ever let borrow this book has wound up buying it for themselves (or received it as a gift!). If you hate this book there is something really, really wrong with you!! Make sure you check out all of David's other books- they are all completely wonderful, and all have a permanent place in my book shelf!

David - thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book of the decade","review":"Naked, Barrel Fever,and Holidays on Ice are 3 wonderfully woven books. I love them and reccomend them to anyone and everyone. One might think it is straight comedy, but he uses events in his life that would sometimes be considered troubling or sad and says them in such monotone, you realize that \\"don't sweat the small stuff\\" is evident in every sentence. I love these books and the David Sedaris is an amazing person, i can't wait for his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"About $9,000.","review":"Be warned: read this book and you will get laugh-lines. Deep, permanent laugh lines.The L.A. plastic surgeons generally have lower prices for a face lift than the N.Y doctors. But you really need to explore, because cosmetic surgery in L.A. is like sushi; it's everywhere. So it might be worth the cash to go to a N.Y doctor.Although, I understand that there are some great doctors in Atlanta. My point is: research your physician before undergoing surgery.Basically, expect to pay around nine grand. But again, this depends on what you have done and where.If you really don't like the idea of going under the knife, simply don't buy any book from Sedaris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and Smart","review":"I am jealous of Sedaris' gift of writing--he is witty and brilliant. 'Naked' is ridiculous, sharp, and energetic. If you need a good laugh, you're in for a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for David Sedaris!","review":"Sedaris' essays in this collection all read like dark comedies. They're perfect; brilliant. I savor each one, trying my best to read them slowly. Read his stuff! Read it now and put more money in this man's pocket! He deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and relentless","review":"Sedaris's witty and relentless observations make for an entertaining book that will keep readers laughing. I found the bathroom humor tiresome at times, but that pervades even some of the best books and movies today. Still, Sedaris stands above most writers of humor with his honesty and his keen, cruel sense of observation, especially in scenes like his excursion into nudism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naked","review":"Worst book I've ever read. Sedaris happily describes a sad and pathetic life as if it is either enviable or humorous - and it is neither!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not engrossing at all","review":"I agree with the reviewer from Boston below. I was very enthused about reading this book when I purchased it; it looked great. I took it on a flight from Chicago to Tokyo. It didn't last past Minnesota. In fact, I considered leaving it on the plane. The incidents were not amusing nor interesting. It was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to the hype","review":"I bought this book based upon the reviews I read on Amazon, and was greatly disappointed upon reading it. I expected a side-splitting reading experience, but instead was 'treated' to the life experiences of a drifting whiner. The funniest part of the book was the beginning 'fantasy' sequence. Once he got out of that mode, it was all downhill. If you're a responsible adult that doesn't find humor in the young and un-(or under)employed, don't buy this book for laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad I Threw it Away","review":"I just plain didn't like this book. I thought that both the humor and the writing style were very weak. I read the first two chapters, skimmed through the rest, then pitched it in the trashcan. If there was a rating lower than one star I would have selected it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Side Splitting???","review":"One reviewer rated this as \`side splitting'. I totally disagree. Don't get me wrong ... I, too, am a fan of David Sedaris, but not of this particular piece of work. In fact, I'm now feeling pissed at myself for spending $11.95 for this boring story; especially since I'm unemployed. Even without any outside distractions, I could not stayed focused on Naked. Take my advice and save your hard earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad and humorless!","review":"I can't believe the ratings that other readers have given this book. What a waste of money and time. Sedaris has no sense of humor, he is just pure obnoxious! Please don't waste your money....Come and pick up my book for free, I mean it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exposed","review":"Is this funny, really? This book opens up the main character and exposes him like a mean sister at Thanksgiving after his greatest blunder. Is it wrong to laugh? Is it right? Who cares? This book just makes you face the fact that there is humor in everything. A quick read, leaves you with a smile on your face, thinking, \\"That was funny...um, but should I be laughing?\\" Well, obviously...duh. Of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud Funny","review":"At first I couldn't understand what all the hoopla was over a memoir about a guy I had never heard of. Then. I read. Never have I laughed out loud so much when reading. David Sedaris' life growing up in a big family in North Carolia is either real or fiction, I don't care. Read it and enjoy. Especially the chapter on his obsessive compulsiveness and inclination of licking light switches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"The stories in this book become repetitive. The story(ies) is(are) funny but only for so long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was It Worth The wait?","review":"Hmmm...Yes!Sedaris' first book \\"Barrel Fever\\" left me aching for more of his self-deprecating sense of humor. Aching for over a year, in fact. His new book, although a bit more serious in tone, still is jam packed with the humor so twisted that we are sometimes afraid to laugh and enjoy it. Sedaris is a master at developing characters psychological foibles( In Naked we are led to believe they are his foibles) in such a way that even the characters don't reallize that they are slightly demented. \\" A Plague of Tics\\" is the best and most memorable of the seventeen stories partly because we can identify with the small boy's compulsive behaviour, which he deems totally acceptable and has even driven his complacent mother to do the same. Most every person can find an awkward moment looking back through their childhood years and Sedaris seems to find the most painful ones and make themplainly and unabashedly comical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny? Yes. \\"Side-splitting?\\" No.","review":"The publisher touts this book with quotes of \\"side-splitting\\" and \\"laughed so hard I dropped the book.\\" This leads me to believe that the typical book reviewer suffers from some degenerative bone disorder. Or maybe I have stronger, split resistant sides and a better grip than most.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. David is an honest and funny writer. But, unlike the apparent high altitude, chain smoker who reviewed \\"Naked,\\" I didn't have to \\"stop reading to catch my breath.\\"A fun book, and also check out \\"Barrel Fever\\" by Sedaris - another great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will laugh out loud","review":"I loved this book..and his other ones, too. I finished \\"Naked\\" and started all over again, with the same pleasure obtained. David Sedaris is a comic genius, and develops a sympathy for his characters and family that is phenomenol. I look forward to a long career from this author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out-loud Belly Laughs","review":"I bought this book to read on a quiet day alone at the beach. After 15 pages, the other beachgoers must have thought me mad, for I was sitting by myself guffawing at Sedaris' wacky characters and situations. If you don't laugh out loud at the 7-page essay \\"Cyclops,\\" check your pulse: you may be dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny, truly the ideal summer book!","review":"Started reading this book on vacation and was the object of many sideways glances at the hotel pool as I began to laugh out loud. I thought that Sedaris was funny on NPR, but this collection of essays gave me so much enjoyment that my eyes were tearing. Fans of irreverant humor will truly enjoy this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Now I've Gotten Into It","review":"I bought this book earlier today and I'm already half way through. I was gifted a Kindle this week so I wanted to spend the day reading, preferably something funny. After one dud, my friend recommended Naked to me. So far I am enjoying it. It did take me a couple of chapters to get into the swing of things fully but the humor has me now. Quite clearly Mr Sedaris is a very good writer (even if some of the stories are clearly exaggerated, perhaps fully fabricated?). I do like his view of things, he has made me laugh numerous times. Overall - even if I am only halfway through - I would recommend this book, maybe not to everyone, but definitely most. Hope the rest is as good. I will be reporting back. If anybody has a recommendation for more humorous books, I'd love to hear them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"don't read this in public.","review":"oh I loved this book, I read it in Chicago when I was on the train to work. Bad idea, it was so hard not too laugh, I was red in the face. Several people gave me this nod, like they knew why I was laughing.Very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"slightly disappointed...","review":"I'm giving this book 4 stars because it wasn't as good or as funny as I expected it to be. I found a lot of parts where I was smiling but not much laughing out loud. To me, Augusten Burroughs does a better job of getting me to laugh hysterically but I suppose it all depends on the type of humor one enjoys. Next up for me is \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" so I obviously enjoyed it enough to check out his other books but at the same time I was a little disappointed (I thought I would enjoy it more). The stories about his family were the best (there should have been more!), his mom was my favorite character.All in all it was certainly worth my time but I prefer Augusten Burroughs' messed up childhood to Sedaris'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...well, this one reader just didn't get it.","review":"Ok. The string of raves from Amazon customers and the press alike convinced me to get, um, Naked. And I swear unto you, I am a funny guy. I like to laugh. I like humor. Really. Just plain didn't find this book funny, or even readable for that matter. Well, just found it kinda tedious, overwrought, whatever, anything but funny.So I don't get it, and it must be my own defect. What's so funny about this yawner? The same things people describe here as evoking of various rolling and emitting, well, I read the same thing and found it all boring. Controversy makes the world go round...decide for yourself I guess..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painful to read, mostly plotless, but entertaining","review":"The seventeen short stories in this book are entertaining and make for a fun read, but they mostly revolve around the humiliation and embarassment of the author. On more than one occasion the author ends up hiding in a ditch while others are searching to beat him up. It pains me to think that these tales actually occurred.Most of these stories do not have plots nor any closure, since they're simply the retelling of past events, and as a result I was bored with many of them. My favourite, by far, was \\"Something For Everyone,\\" which had well-developed characters, revealed the author's deepest impression of himself, and (unfortunately) ended in a humiliating tragedy.In summary, this book is recommended but requires a fair amount of wincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get out your handkerchief...","review":"On many occasions, I had to put NAKED down, gasp for air and wipe my eyes as mascara dripped onto my shirt. One of the funniest books I have ever read. I was calling friends to read snippets of prose to them over the phone; the trouble was, I couldn't stop laughing long enough to complete the sentences. Sedaris has hit, no, SMASHED the nail on the head with his assorted musings about everyday life in end-of-the-road towns with whacked-out inhabitants. Nothing is sacred. It's delicious"},{"rating":"2","title":"tra-la tra-lee.....","review":"i just now finished the last chapter of Naked. and i simply had to spout to the world my new love of David Sedaris. this was the only book that had me laughing out loud whenever i picked it up. on the subway, at work, alone at my house....i couldnt stop laughing. i identified so much with mr. sedaris' image of his own family. and i saw myself in him so often. and it made me laugh at myself and see the humor in otherwise horrid situations. the story \\"ashes\\" in which mr. sedaris talks about his mothers teminal illness almost brought me to tears and as soon as i launched into the next story i was laughing out loud alone in public again. read this book. perfect for any cynic."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've read Barrel Fever, this one's a bore.","review":"\\"Barrel Fever,\\" Sedaris' first book, is original, daring, hysterically funny, and very queer. In \\"Naked,\\" Sedaris has succumbed to an ailment common to humorists who've written one good book. Known in some circles as \\"Woody's Disease,\\" the writer, having achieved some acclaim, imagines that readers should find windy diary accounts of his very ordinary personal experiences funny. Naked barely rises to amusing, much less funny. The savage queerness that gave the first book it's best lines has evaporated into vapid middle-class air. Don't be a codependent. You'd get more laughs out of a fifth reading of Barrel Fever than the first reading of this nakedly commercial offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"He has a way with words that pulls the curtain back from fantastic versions of life people seem to hold."},{"rating":"2","title":"cracked up","review":"This product arrived on time, was delivered as described, and completely met my expectations.

His title story about a week at a nudist retreat was hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"people will think your crazy","review":"People will think your crazy as you laugh out loud to the book of short stories by Sedaris . I read the book on vacation at the jersey shore and I couldn't put the book down, whether I was by the pool or at the beach; I had to have it with me at all times.This book would be worth it if it only had 2 stories in it, those being C.O.G and Naked. though funny as hell, this book isn't easy on Sedaris's family or for himself for that matter. he lays all on the line in a book no one should pass up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!!","review":"You will never have so much fun laughing at people no matter how many books you read. I hate to say that I laughed at David Sedaris' past, his life, but I couldn't help it. This is the most side splitting memoir I have ever read. The most enduring image I have is when Sedaris says he used to mow the lawn in a football helmet. No one semed to understand why I laughed so hard at it, but you just can't help but laugh. But above all, you can't help but be impressed with how soothing and simple Sedaris' writing is. It's painful and redeeming, but all in all, it's excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funnier than a barrel of golf slacks","review":"One of those rare books that made me burst out laughing. Some pretty gross details, but as long as you aren't eating your dinner..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud Funny","review":"This book was my second adventure into Sedaris's work, my first being \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\". I enjoyed that book, but I have to say that \\"Naked\\" was even better. This book had me laughing out loud on such a regular basis, my boyfriend must have thought I was crazy! As with the other book, I feel that the strongest points in the book are toward the beginning, and the story slows down as you reach the end. However, this book starts off at such a fast pace, you won't mind the slowdown. This is a book that any fan of Sedaris MUST read, and everyone else should give it a try as well. Funny, eye opening, and clever...check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never buy a brown towel again!!","review":"I read this on a plane and laughed so hard I started to cry. I tried stopping the laughter in tears and it was just not possible. The passenger next to me was getting concerned she was stuck next to a loon! I finally asked her to read a page about the brown towel incident. She not only laughed with me, but kept wanting me to tell her what happened next. I am buying multiple copies to give as gifts this Christmas coupled with Holidays on Ice. You just can't go wrong with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess the Yanks are quite different","review":"The short stories were nicely written, drawing on the presumed real life experiences of the author. As an author of humour, I found the style too self-consciously witty and trying to hard to be hilarious. In short, I found it tedious and barely raised a smile, let alone a chuckle and certainly not a belly laugh through the whole production. I put this down to the cultural differences between USA and Australia. It appears that readers in the USA have to be belted over the head and told when to laugh before they can appreciate humour. I prefer something more subtle. I am sure the author is a nice person, but there you go...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be sold on the hype.","review":"David Sedaris has a rather common gift of quiet observance. He can take these observations and pepper them with funny quips and one-liners. But he is unable to write a story worth coming back to. Once you get past the formula of making every other sentence a sarcastic oberservation, there is really nothing worth mentioning.'Naked' leaves you wondering, \\"Why was this book written?\\" It has its funny moments, but none of the stories themselves are funny. There are no meaningful insights, save the occasional \\"and here's a moment that sums it all up, isn't that clever?\\" ending. It reads like a list of experiences in one person's life.I had great hopes for this book. The first story intrigued me. After that, there were a few laughs, but nothing else.Save your money, and go out and talk to a perfect stranger over a cup of coffee. You'll learn more about yourself and people as a whole, and maybe have a few funny adventures of your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light, fluffy but not much to take with you","review":"While it was entertaining in parts, this book definitely is not one I would read again.

I could not identify with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fizzled Out","review":"After the first two chapters, I was laughing out loud and congratulating myself on having chosen a really good book. By the middle of the book, the humor was wearing thin and I found myself actually disliking - very much - the main character. By the end of the book, I couldn't stand him, and I wasn't laughing anymore. He struck me as a weak, non-memorable whiner who would rather play the cynic as opposed to trying to make any situation he found himself in better through some initiative of his own. I had no expectations when I bought the book - didn't know what it would be like. But after having read it, I feel as if it was time out of my life wasted. You know how when you finish a good book you feel a real sense of satifaction? Well, with this one I felt only annoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type of humor.","review":"This book is more depressing than funny. Definately not my type of humor. I wish I would have known it was this dry kind of humor before I bought it. It was NOT a page turner for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I've enjoyed Sedaris' essays on \\"This American Life\\" and loved his \\"Holidays on Ice\\" book, so I was really looking forward to this. It simply wasn't funny. I found it sarcastic, angry and even depressing. It wasn't just self-deprecating, it was mean-spirited.I definitely do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fizzled out","review":"This was my first experience with Sedaris and initially found him to write sarcastic humor extremely well. He is so witty, I tried to commit some of his one-liners to memory. I was intrigued with the first essay and really impressed with the second about his compulsive behaviors. His descriptions of his mother were fantastic! Kinda' Ya-Ya sisterhood, without all the resentment. His self-descriptions were very flat, leaving me with a feeling this is a person I wouldn't want to hang out with ---- which can't be true because he is very funny!Unfortunately, this book fizzled out for me. The hitchihiking stories have been done before. The look at middle America was funny at times, but not insightful. It got slower and slower. I could hardly endure the last chapter and didn't need to hear another description about someone's pimply butt. I just wanted it to end.I recommended reading the first two essays. If the third lets you down, forget it. It doesn't get any better than chapter 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat funny...","review":"Somewhat funny, but not worth nearly the hype these reviews have attributed to this book. If you've read everything else, consider this book. If not, don't waste your time. I won't review the pointless prose of each chapter. It was disjointed and in many cases, it tried to be much funnier than it is. One or two of the stories in this book are worth reading, but it is nothing compared to what some of these reviews claim.When I read, I want one story that will keep me turning the page for 500 pages. This is comprised many stories that make you want to turn the page simply to see if it gets any better. It may be of some interest to light readers who want to read a story in 10-15 minutes.

She enjoyed it quite a bit. However, she fell from the top of the cage to the bottom and injured herself. We put another hamster in the cage at a later time. She also fell from the top to the bottom of the cage. She broke her hip and suffered a lot of pain from it before she passed away the following week as an older hamster. When we took this cage along with us to the vet, she told us that the height was dangerous, a conclusion that we had already suspected. She told hamster should have a fairly low height cage because they do climb and fall. After these two hamster girls were injured we bought the Superpet My First Rat Cage and have used it ever since. It has been an excellent habitat for Syrians, with low enough height as well as larger floor space. We have now had over twenty hamsters over the years, most of whom have enjoyed the Superpet rat cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Clean","review":"Just like everyone else I bought the cage for space for my hamster.We have only had the cage for a little over a month I'm returning it.Cleaning so it wont fall apart is impossible, I like to clean the cage every 5 days this one is so hard to keep together you have to re-build every time it's cleaned.I found my self letting it go longer because I knew how long it was going to take.

My gerbils love this cage. They sleep in their petting zone (they actually take the bedding inside the bottom of the cage and take it up there to make their own den). The only con I have is that my gerbils were unfamiliar with their water bottle so I had to put another one in for access on the bottom floor. I also have realized that they will use the bottom floor, second floor, and fourth floor -- but not the third. I am unsure why. They also enjoy the built in wheel and love to run in it. If you are in the market for a cage for a hamster or a gerbil, this is the best cage I would ever recommend. It's easy to take apart, and easy to put back in place.

We have it in our bedroom and have to sleep in another room if we do not have the required 45 minutes to clean it when necessary which would be every 2 days ideally if your pets happen to be mice.

I go to the gym 4-6 times a week for about 2 hours or so a day.When I first used these gloves, they were rather tight, but after a few uses, they mold to my hand perfectly. They are snug enough to protect my hand, but not tight so they cramp or cut off any circulation (even when gripping a regular bar). I have washed these in my clothes washer and they are just fine, too.The one thing that I see as a negative with these (but this is with most workout gloves)--the finger coverage isn't quite long enough for me. I'd feel better with about 1/8-1/4 inch longer fingers on the glove. But they aren't short enough to cause any problem.All in all, I can see these lasting a LONG time, even with the heavy use they get with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Training Gloves","review":"I ordered a small, since this is what I have had in the past,although not this brand.

After a week they responded and told me to contact the warranty vendor (Saeco, it turns out, does not offer any warranty on their product!).I called the number they gave me and got a recording. I left phone number and email contact info. They have not responded.I contacted Saeco again and they said, in essence, tough luck--that's when they told me that they offer no warranty service on the products they sell.Any company that does not warranty its product is a failed company.

This make is very easy to turn the unit while it sits on the counter so you can easily get to the reservoir or the grounds.My one gripe is I wish they had an external indicator showing the water level of the reservoir. I've wasted beans with a partial brew not realizing there wasn't very much water left.UPDATE (Aug 2009):I have had this for over a year now. During that time it has broken down twice. Both times it started leaking water and the \\"boiler tubes\\" had to be replaced. The first repair was under warranty, but I wasn't so lucky the 2nd time.Do not buy this machine - save your money.

It includes sections on history, usage techniques, horticulture and other aspects. The tone of the writing is that of a passionate advocate. It can be a bit sad to reflect that the hopes for a panacea to end poverty and deprivation through implementing bamboo have not been realized. But one aspect of idealism is optimism. And that remains a worthwhile and endearing aspect of this book. As i have recently obtained the book, i can't vouch for the currency of the sources and references. I can say the vast store of practical information in the book will be valuable as i learn more and attempt to utilize bamboo in greater ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO much info!","review":"If you threw half the chapters in this book away, you would have a better book...It is very comprehensive on bamboo,I am glad I purchased it but too many paragraphs on \\"saving the world\\" (ecology comments)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book first if you are new to bamboo!","review":"This was the first book I read about bamboo many years ago when I first started planting bamboo.

Although publicized as a serious read, this book reminds me of a Harlequin romance, just longer and with bigger words and without protagonist names such as Lance or Crystal, although Bruder, the spurned lover, comes close. This is the type of book you find on the shelves of a rented beach house, next to the sections devoted to Danielle Steel and Anne Rivers Siddons: the same misunderstandings, contrived plots, and improbable coincidences. If you must read it, save it for the beach or a long plane trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disapointment","review":"I loved A Danish Girl--it's up there with my favorite books ever, and I'd love to write the screenplay. I looked forward to Ebershoff's new novel, but Pasadena is off-the mark. I loved the concept--I loved the first quarter of the novel, with the start of the Wuthering Heights romance, etc. Only, I feel like Ebershoff took so long writing this section that he ignored Bronte's pace . . . the book is LONG, and yet he never gets to the second generation's story . . . and our \\"Heathcliff\\" and \\"Catherine\\" never have their firey reunion w/ Catherine's mad scene . . . heck, he only barely brushes over Heathcliff's marriage to \\"Edward's\\" sister. Ugh. I looked forward to these scenes, only for the book to end on a flat note. Could've been good, I wish he'd try again and think about plot a little more. The generational saga with a little boost would have really set Pasadena off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wuthering Heights warmed over","review":"I've read Wuthering Heights and in comparison with this book, Wuthering Heights captures the story's tragic loves much better. Pasadena is Wuthering Heights dressed in an orange grove and onion farm. I was disappointed that the story is not only using Bronte's storyline, but it doesn't have the force of Bronte's. Ebershoff explains Linda's and Bruder's reasonings for their mistakes, but Bronte gave a more magical and spooky tale. If you are interested in California history, there are other books, and if you are interested in a tragic love story, check out Wuthering Heights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pasadena","review":"I did not like this book. I lived near Pasadena and currently live near Carlsbad and was very interested in the history of the two cities where the story takes place.

It is a waste of money (even for $8) because there's only about 22 minutes of play on it. Potshot's first album at least has about 32 minutes (more for your money, obviously).

However, this was not bad at all. It is not the greatest lobster bisque I have ever had, but it is downright solid. And for frozen, hey, big plus points there. It tastes like real lobster meat, and, while not exactly generous in their portions of lobster meat, they most certainly do not skimp on it. It is a little less creamy and zesty than I am accustomed to, but again its not bad by any stretch of the imagination. I will be buying more of it for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resourse","review":"Wonderful book if you need to find out what little things came in what package.

This book teaches you the importance of having a plan and gives you many references and examples to help you develop your plan. It not only teaches you how to plan your success, it explains how to balance your personal life with your career. I know people who are considered successful, but they are unhappy. They have not learned how to have a well-balanced life. Daryl Green understands real success has many components, not just work.I found the sample personal action plan very useful. It was easy to understand and implement. Daryl Green has taken something that can be very confusing and placed it in a format that makes perfect sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fun album.","review":"If you watched the movie and liked the music, you'll enjoy this album.

In addition the computer has a well put together feel to it.

Sorry, won't give it a third try.The instructions are inconveniently written on the inside layer of the cardboard packaging itself, which you have to tear apart to access.

It's very difficult to use as the buttons are inacessible through the plastic, meaning you have to take it out each time to use it.The vendor should show the actual item, not a completely different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"You could probably cut this book in half and it would be a better read. Rice spoonfeeds us the plot, she overdescribes, and she throws in sappy red herrings. If she had built up Jane's betrayal without telling us everything about it, then revealed it to us at the same time Dylan found out, it would have been more compelling (though we may have suspected where she was going). The resolution was much too flat - I didn't see how the characters got to a place of forgiveness for a betrayal that to me would have been unforgivable. I really wish I could have edited the manuscript for her.My biggest objection to the book is the way adoption is portrayed. The bio-mom is constantly referred to as \\"real\\" while relationships with the adoptive parents (who some would argue ARE the real parents) are trivialized.I give it two stars because I kept reading, even though I wasn't enjoying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Summer Read","review":"I always encourage my students to read anything but textbooks during their quarter breaks. This is one of the books I chose for myself! It was a great \\"sit by the pool\\" read and I actually read it in one day. It wasn't 'rocket science' and it kept my interest throughout. Maybe a little predictable at times, but immediately after finishing it, I picked up another Rice book (Beach Girls) and enjoyed another relaxing read. If you're looking for intense drama, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a 'feel good\\" read, this is what you want!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this book very disappointing. Everything was so predictable, I didn't even have to read to the end. Jane was an extremely selfish, self-centered, 35 year old woman. She came home on the pretext of taking care of her mother, yet, that's not why she really came home. She came home to butt into the life of a daughter she gave up at birth and to get into that daughter's uncle's pants. Jane has a younger sister, who has stayed with their mother all these years, pretty much giving up a social life, and her career. Jane supposedly came home to help her, but all she did was leave the sister with more work, and even took her car whenever she wanted without asking. What a selfish character. Anyway, as stated above, the whole story was very contrived and very predictable. What a disappointment.

I've set the track \\"Neither Heaven Nor Space\\" on repeat many, many times. \\"Hi-Speed Soul,\\" \\"Fruit Fly,\\" \\"Inside Of Love\\" and \\"Happy Kid\\" are infectous little gems as well.

The ballads lack any memorable hooks and the only good song that I really liked on it was \\"treading water\\"(which is quite a good song). hi-speed soul is halfway decent but thats about it as far as this album is concerned. High/low and the proximity effect are much better choices than this one. nada surf seems to sound somewhat different with every release. They decided to slow it down alot with this one, but it just comes off as boring. In order to play a good ballad there has to be melody and emotion which isnt here. I miss their sound from the high/low (love that song\\"the plan\\") days and wish they would go back to it. anyways maybe they should come back to america and start playing louder, just my opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"NADA SURF STILL HAS IT","review":"I have long been awaiting this album and I can honestly say I am not disappointed. If you like some of the more dynamic songs by Nada Surf such as firecracker (from proximity effect) you might not be so enthused about this as the songs are all a bit more mellow. The standout songs on this i think are Hi-speed soul and the The way you wear your head which are some of the faster paced songs on the album. As always though if you like good music and meaningful lyrics then you will love this new album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album released in 2k3","review":"'Let Go' sheds Nada Surf's nerd-rock image and transforms them into truly talented songwriters. The album isn't without some flaws, Happy Kid, Blizzard of '77, and Fruit Fly all harken back to their 'Popular' days. Truly great ballads are intermixed with some great up-tempo songs. Also lost was a lot of their tongue-in-cheek humor that is great the first time but makes for a short shelf-life. It's been replaced by truly vulnerable lyrics about love, relationships, and life. Standout tracks include Blonde on Blonde, Inside of Love, Paper Boats, Neither Heaven nor Space, and my favorite: Killians Red. Buy this album now, it will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nada Surf is Back, they're Tight, and ready to Go!","review":"LOVE THIS ALBUM! It's intelligent, catchy, and fun. Actually just saw them live and it's refreshing to see a band that has been together longer than a year that can hold their own in front of an crowd. There's a lot of bands that have one hit early on that can't follow it up- but this band can and has. They have paid their dues and it shows especially live! The singles I strongly recommend is \\"Happy Kid\\" and \\"The Way you wear your Head.\\" If you like Jimmy Eat World- this is for you- although Nada Surf was probably around first and lyrically Nada Surf has a little more to say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This album is a total disappointment. I heard many good things about this album from fans of Weezer and just critics altogether. I really don't get a lot of people are raving about this album. Although there is nothing significantly wrong with this album the songs just sound boring and repetitive. It is like listening to the same mellow, surf song ten times over. The only song I enjoyed was Killian's Red but the rest of the album you could easily toss away. Basically this album is just boring ...

I liked that because of the humorous approach it took to high school and the heavy edge it had to it. That is gone in this album. Instead the band has adopted a softer side. They all sing (in harmony!) and their voices are nothing special at all. Instrumentally, they sound exactly like all the other pop-rock bands out there. They could be some other group, and you would never know.Their lyrics are [bad]. I had to keep myself from laughing out loud at the stupidity of the lyrics in various songs.

We have had Shun Classic kitchen knives and this sharpener for about six years. This tool keeps them factory sharp for about a year and a half before they need to be sent back to Shun for a factory new re-sharpening. Some reviewers suggested this tool wears out. I disagree. It does need to be cleaned regularly as it will clog with the fine metallic particles generated while sharpening. A little dish washing soap on the back (rough)side of a kitchen sponge works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for everyone!","review":"I bought this for my 6 month old son for Christmas and he liked it..

I do recommend removing the sticks because they're very small & that's the first thing to go in the mouth.. I tucked them away in a drawer until he's older.. It would've been better if they'd come attached but they don't also making them easy to get lost..

There were so many holes in those books that I found myself figuring out any solution beyond the basics on my own. Now the books are becoming very useful because you can tell the authors are seasoned in Asp.net and have a lot more knowledge on the subject. This book has, so far, answered every question I have had about Asp.net 2.0 and even ones I didn't know I had! I haven't even finished it yet, and it has been more than worth its weight in gold from what I've learned in the 7 chapters I've read so far. Great job!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for an experienced programmer new to ASP","review":"I found this book very useful and informative.I have programming for 15 years but was a complete novice in ASP.Net.

It consists of code snips in C#, but no complete examples. Like another reviewer wrote, nothing works after the first \\"hello world\\" sample. If you already know ASP.NET, I suppose this book is somewhat useful, but the book is verbose; why spend a whole chapter (Chap. 2) on Visual Studio 2005? If the purpose of the book was a \\"how to\\", showing step by step how to build an ASP.NET project, then I could understand this inclusion, but the book is not a \\"how to\\" (other than a trivial example, I didn't find a single complete \\"how to\\" in the entire 1300 page book).Avoid like the plague--a complete waste of money and paper.UPDATE: not as bad as I thought, once I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but lacks a lot of details","review":"Be careful, don't get this book for beginer to intermediat topics.

The examples are not very thorough.this book has 34 chapters. does that not seem like an awful lot of stuff to you? how could you really cover topics in detail with 34 chapter?sorry but i don't like this kind of book. i prefer a book that leaves you feeling confident. this one make me feel helpless.I will probably return it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pro ASP.net 2.0 in C# 2005","review":"This is really a good book.

I would purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete and relatively in-depth","review":"I first purchased this book, as I normally do, to read on a not so well documented part of ASP 2.0 but I quickly became very interested to read the rest of the chapters and it was not long that I went through the whole book which is a rare occurrence for computer books. The book is written to both satisfy the person who is looking for a particular topic or for one who is interested in complete technology overview. Chapters are grouped into well related sub sections which make reading a lot easier and more logical. The only shortcoming of the book was its lack of complete working examples. Although the book has many examples, they are not complete and some don't work. I highly suggest downloading the examples from the publisher's website to get a better understanding of these examples.

Grimaud is known for the Brahms but the Rachmaninov CD in particular demonstrates that her playing is having trouble expanding out into different and diverse repertoire. There is heavy groaning in the background if you listen carefully during the performance, and it sounds like someone is reading off pages of music (you can hear pages turning). In order to give the best performance possible, it needs to be memorized. That way, you're focused on not reading the music but playing it with emotion and interpreting it. This CD is a disappointment given Grimaud's Brahms reputation.

Unfortunately this potential is largely squandered in the book's fluffy and unexciting subplots and lack of a coherent vision.The portrayal of character relationships among the Rhomandi is the best part of the book. The rest of the plot doesn't have much to it, including an unexciting subplot about a 'leythium' creature (leythium is an electricity-like energy that is the basis of the Ring's power). The deux ex machine ending also disappointed.All in all, there are much better fantasy books to read (eg LOTR, EarthSea series, His Dark Materials by Pullman).

It is easy to read, but it does take some time to read and understand your chart. I took time away from it, went back to it, and found some new exciting information. It never gets old. It can always re-peak your interest. I would recommend it to others who would like to have a collection of astrology books.

These prices Amazon offers is comparable to costume jewelry.The only thing I would change is the chain it came with. It is of a thinner quality. I would try to find a longer and stronger chain for the pendant. It still deserves 5 stars for quality and beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I bought this for my mother as a birthday gift. It is very pretty and she loves it.

I always wondered if a \\"Logic Trance 1\\" existed somewhere as it was impossible to find in the US. Fortunately cd shops are now importing this cd from Germany so it should be quite accessable by now. The only reason I give \\"Logic Trance 1\\" 4 stars and not 5 is because although it is excellent, \\"Logic Trance 2\\" is still by far the best in this series. My favorite tracks on this 2-cd set are The Beloved \\"The Sun Rising (deeply satisfying mix)\\" and Resistance D. \\"Cosmic Love\\". Tracks like these completely define the slyle and sound of early trance which most artist seem to have steered away from now. It also seems to be a bit heavier and more dancable than it's follow up \\"Logic Trance 2\\", although not quite as diverse.

The medium seem to be right for us and it is nice to have the beeper to let you know when they are done. All in all this will be a good replacement. Hopefully it will last for 40+ years as well.

My wife sent it in for repair a couple of times and it came back promptly, repaired and cleaned. Then it worked for 4 or 5 times and failed after baking three waffles the last time. I didn't want to send it back for repair again, but maybe that's the best \\"choice,\\" so I took it apart and found the failed fuse in the upper part of the unit. It's a 240 C 10A fuse, apparently a thermal-cut-off type like the NTE 8242 Thermal Cut-Off 240C/464F sold by Amazon. But it's very annoying to have to repeatedly send it back for repair or have to repair it myself. Chef's Choice should replace it gratis. Note that the fuse is a crimp type, i.e., the wires must be crimped into some connector, not soldered as soldering will likely damage the fuse.When the waffle maker works, it works great but it's unacceptable for it to fail so soon and so frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"chef's choice830 wafflepro heart waffle iron","review":"this is the second wafflepro heart waffle iron I've purchased.

If we hit upon a good setting, cleanup was very easy.The audible beep when the waffle was done after about 90 seconds was the best feature; it would have also been nice if it made more than one waffle at a time, so some member of our family wasn't waiting for it to finish to continue eating breakfast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, perfect atmosphere.","review":"This is a great atmosphere CD.

But in WIDOWS, McBain tries his hand at psychology and demonstrates clearly that he's ill equipped to do so. I'm an avid Ed McBain fan, and I've read the majority of his 87th Precinct series. His work is excellent in the genre of hardcase noir writing. I've spent a lot of hours immersed in his novels and consider him among the 'greats' in police procedural stories. But I think he missed the mark here, causing me to recoil out of the story too many times. Fortunately, this is the only book of his that has done that so far, and I remain solidly a fan! In spite of my negative opinions of this particular book, I would suggest still that people buy it and assess it themselves. McBain books are definitely worthy of collecting by those who enjoy police procedural mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paganism, but not Shamanism","review":"This book may appeal to those wishing a New Age or Wiccan approach to nature and spirits, but has very little to do with true shamanism. Most of the rituals are far more Wiccan-based than anything, and the book doesn't have much to do with the shamanic principles of ecstacy and journeying (the basis of shamanism) at all. Those wishing to expand upon their general pagan practices may find this book interesting, but for those interested in shamanism there are much better resources out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading at best","review":"The back cover of this book proclaims it to be one about the path of the shaman.Reading it was quite a different matter. It combines neopaganism and New Age with elements of shamanism. Add in the hefty doses of New Age and neopagan \\"love, light, and etc.\\", and the blend is nauseating. I'm sure this must be a reflection of the author's personal path, but to represent it as shamanism is wrong.I'm not sure I'd recommend this book to even a beginning paganism student. I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anybody wanting to learn about shamanism.I would not have bought this book unless it were required reading for one of my classes.

I was hoping for more of an educational (how to, if you will) style, but even with the firm assertation in the beginning of this book that she IS WICCAN, not Native American, she doesn't really approach the information from either way. People don't like it because they say she thinks she is teaching Native ways, but she isn't. She just could have organized her information better, and settled on which religious approach she was going to write from. I was interested in studying Shamanic practice for quite a while, but have finally become disgusted with what seems to be the general attitude the Native American shamanic community has towards Wicca and Pagans. Irregardless of if you do or do not have Native American ancestry, if you practice Wicca, you're a wanna be not worth the air you breathe.

Although it is an interesting book, it is by no means useful to one truly looking to start their path to Shamanism. Amber Wolfe gives some basic ideas of Shamanism and interweaves them throughout the book, but this is, in essence, not a book about the ways of the Shaman- it is a book about the ways of a witch who integrates some Shamanism into her own eclectic style. Too much of this book is celtic and wiccan influenced to truly be a useful guide to Shamanism. Much of it comprises of rather light, useless excersises, mixed in with interesting yet essentially unimportant anecdotes.

Most disappointing however was my hope of reading about a piece I had listened to a performance of the day before, the Mendelssohn Piano Trio. Op. 49.

It skips some of Hawaii's most beautiful beaches and on Maui it doesn't cover Mt. Haleakala which is over 10,000 feet high and has lunar-like landscapes. This is one of America's most majestic national parks. This video also doesn't include the amazing Road to Hana. This was by an Australian and while it discusses succession of Hawaii from the USA, he never even mentions Pearl Harbor one of Hawaii's most visited and famous historical sites.

COUNTRY LIFE does not have the singles of the self-titled disc, and it doesn't have the consistency of SIREN, but it is definitely a stand out disc for any collection. Ferry's vocals slither in and out Three and Nine in a Bowie fashion. The music recalls Heroes/Low era Bowie. Like Bowie, Ferry is so talented he makes vocal dexterity appear effortless. One can almost hear him dance through \\"If it Takes all Night\\" in a Presley slide step. Casanova may be my favorite song for it appears to be the most original of the discs singles. I give any disc with out seven stand singles the highest of ratings because a solid disc such as that is hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Roxy Music Album","review":"I absolutely love the two first Roxy Music albums (Roxy Music and For Your Pleasure) and I am also a big fan of most of Roxy Music's and Bryan Ferry's music after this album. Country Life however has very little resemblance with all the other things Bryan Ferry has made. It consits mostly by noisy, \\"serious\\" rock-songs, far from the arty, strange, romantic and beautiful sound and the unreal, almost surrealistic lyrics that Ferry usually provide. Country Life sounds more like a Lou Reed album, than a Roxy Music album. Ferry is great being Ferry, he doesn't have to pretend he is Lou Reed. There are one or two good songs on the album, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL SHOCKHOUND LPS ARE MP3 DIGITAL RECORDINGS, NOT ANALOG","review":"ALL SHOCKHOUND LPS ARE MP3 DIGITAL RECORDINGS, NOT ANALOG.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DIGITAL CRAP, LOOK FOR THE ORIGINAL ANALOG RECORDINGS."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Wonder I Never Got Into This Band In The Slightest","review":"Turgid, plodding music.

The lineup is incredible and each song is a unique experience.

While it truly is a spectacular work (really, all their works are with the exception of Manifesto), this album fails to create an atmosphere like some of their other works. This is not, however, to say that this by any means a week album. In fact, it contains some truly amazing and infectious songs.While most will be familiar with OUT OF THE BLUE and, perhaps, CASANOVA, the best songs on COUNTRY LIFE are the deeper cuts that are so incredibly bizarre, but altogether entertaining. It's hard to resist the upbeat rocker, ALL I WANT IS YOU, the loungy A REALLY GOOD TIME, and the repeated \\"hey, hey\\" at the end of the twangy PRARIE ROSE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for mentors AND protoges.","review":"I have read lots of motivational books, and this was one of the most inspiring.

As an example of oppression, racism and naked greed this story is little different from the fates afflicted upon other poor black neighborhoods. The author has a grasp of the details, but presents the same material again, and again. On occasion some paragraphs seem copied almost verbatim from chapter to chapter. If you must have the information in this book, then I guess you need to buy it, but do not expect to be able to tolerate reading more than a couple of chapters (and you probably don't need to anyway!) A 40 page pamphlet would have been a more appropriate format.

Rarely have they been cutting edge, but the ones I have owned have been rock-solid reliable and rugged. I was pleased to find this one at a very good price. It does have all of the features and speed I presently need in a notebook, and is so much cheaper than those with even a little bit more capability that I had to buy it. If in two years I need USB 2.0, CD/DVD burning capability, or some other important new feature in a notebook, I won't feel bad about upgrading since this one cost so little up front.With the unit now in my hands, I'm not disappointed. It runs well and seems Toshiba rugged.

My guess is that the display was already defective and the movement caused the display to go out. I contacted Circuit City since the laptop purchase fell within their 14 day window for defective returns. The Santa Maria Ca. Circuit City was rude and refused to assist me. I contacted their main office who did not provide any assistance either. Toshiba says they will repair the unit in a approx. 9 day turn around.

These activities are creative and helpful. What is so useful is that these activities can be modified/altered to suit your class level. Some of the expressions and topics are a little strange and not really suitable to use in class for young learners who are at beginning level. But of course you can alter them. I have been able to make up many of my own lesson ideas from this book, written by ESL teaching veterans. \\"Grammar Games\\" is very helpful. I also recommend \\"More Grammar Games\\" which is a part-two, or addition to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of limited value","review":"I have to confess that I was extremely disappointed in this book. First of all, there is virtually nothing for lower levels. So you're out of luck if you're teaching a beginning or even a lower intermediate class. The second problem for me is that it's \\"veddy British.\\" I would have to translate into American before I used it. The third, and biggest, problem is that the games require a lot of preparation. Many of them require a lot of hand-made flash cards. Do you really want to spend two hours preparing a fifteen-minute activity? The only way this would be profitable is if one is teaching the same lesson to multiple groups. When I removed all the things that were culturally inappropriate, I had only one game I could use for my lower intermediate level Arab teenagers. It was a good one that I found valuable, but it was not worth paying this much money for only one game. Two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent novel","review":"I had to read this book for my British Lit class in college. I had never read anything by Schreiner, and was drawn into the story right away. I found myself unable to put the book down and finished it in just a couple nights.

Many of the songs sound almost exactly the same, the only difference being softer or harder sequencers. It seems as though they could only come up with 1 idea for a song and just repeated that idea over and over.The only track that does stand out is \\"Snow On Angel's Feather\\" which is, to me, the type of song that made me fall in love wih their music in the first place.

Reads more like a philisophical tome than a physics book. Not even a good reference. Not enough emphasis on building problem solving skills. Exposition is murky at best. Not a good book for a first exposure to the subject. Makes me wish Kittel & Kroemer was still in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I think this book is an example of what sometimes happens when popularity overtakes quality. This book is definitely popular. Some might even call it a classic. But it can't really compare with newer thermodynamics books that more closely follow the modern approach of teaching thermo. It would not be fair to say that the book is incomplete, as it covers all of the necessary topics. However, it does a fairly good job of making the subject more boring than it needs to be. And to anyone who has learned thermodynamics must realize how serious a charge this is. The single biggest obstacle to students struggling to learn thermodynamics is that they find the subject boring, and this book doesn't do anything to help the situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 of the best books","review":"I totally liked Only the lonely. it's really funny and its a really good book. alot of other girls can relate to it too because their parents might be divorced or might think of themselves as madison"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only the lonley","review":"Madison Finn is a girl I can really relate to.

Madison is constanly saying stupid things like, \\"thats cooler than cool\\", or \\"thats so bizzaro' Another thing is, shes to nice! She doesnt have much of a pesonality. When you think about it, this is not what kids act. As for the story, Madsion complains about how much she misses freinds Egg (theres a REALLY stupid reason why hes called that) and Aimee. I think the author just thought kids thought names like Egg are cool, though she trys to hide this behind the fact that hes called that because he got hit by eggs one year on Halloween...Very boring story line. This is one of thse books that you count how many pages are left until you FINALLY finish the story.I started out liking it, but it got worse and worse, and the authors writing started to decline. If you feel you MUST read this book, borrow it from a freind or the libary."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT A TIME WASTER","review":"The Files of Madison Finn was one of the best books I've ever read.

If you want a little more depth, try one of his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"I've read almost all of Ed Greenwoods works and I really have to say that this series wins the cake on the worst one yet. It starts out with promise but the further you get in the book the more it seems to insult your intelligence. The main characters mainly go through the last one and the this one as well just fighting an endless host of people with swords and magic. Through pure luck they continually win and if they get beat someone comes along and saves them at the last minute. There is really no plot development and it gets way too mind numbing. I made the mistake of reading the next two out of boredom and kept hoping that something would happen. IT NEVER DID!!! Even if you love Ed Greenwood please avoid this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ecology/Medical Thriller","review":"Robin Cook is one of my favorite authors. I enjoyed this book as much as all of his others. He's created a doctor/researcher who almost breaks down after an incredible number of problems are thrown at him. He's impulsive, but reacts as any of us might under the same pressures. I read the whole thing in one day, unable to put it down. As a mother, I found what happened to his daughter so shocking that I was both horrified by the book, yet unable to put it down. If you have a horror of sick children, you might want to choose another one of his books. But even if this bothers you, I will just say that the ending does justify reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling Better","review":"This, like all of Robin Cook's books, is an excellent read. Once you begin reading anyh of his books, it's very difficult to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"The book FEVER by Robin Cook was one of the best of his books that I read. I really enjoy reading medical thrillers and this book fits that category. Because I enjoy and am interested in medical terminology and also leukemia (for personal reasons) I found this book to read easily and fast. I would recommend it to anyone with interest in the same field as mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frantic...","review":"Having read half of this book, I remember why I don't care for Robin Cook. Unlike a previous reviewer, I found \\"Abduction\\" a far better, more enjoyable read. The main character in \\"Fever\\", Dr Charles Martel, is frantic to the point of being obnoxious. I can understand a father's being upset about the miseries his life has delivered to him, but the development of this character leaves me unsympathetic toward his plight. I make a point of finishing every book I start, but this may be my Achilles Heel..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real life...not a chance","review":"The medical aspects of this book are inaccurate. It is clear that Dr. Cook has not cared for patients with leukemia, or has chosen to take dramatic poetic license. If I were not a physician who cared for such patients, I might have enjoyed it, but I was too distressed by the lack of understanding of the science."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is misleading!","review":"As a Spanish teacher, I bought the video to show my students how Carnaval festivals are celebrated in Puerto Rico. How wrong I was! There is a scene of a Carnaval parade that lasts a minute or so and that's all the Carnaval cultural background that you will find.

Hope he will enjoy more than I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans are screwed","review":"Unfortunately, even if you buy both the 1st and 2nd soundtracks to this movie, you will still miss out.Why didn't they just put the musical numbers featured in the movie straight to CD? The world may never know. You'll get a bunch of obscure songs, remixed versions of your favorite songs, and stuff that seemingly came out of nowhere.With 2 soundtracks released for the same movie, it just shows you how they kept messing up. It's sad there never was a descent soundtrack to this awesome movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak transfer","review":"Includes important missing music from the first sound track album. However, this CD is a victim of poor engineering. The insturmentals are acceptable but the vocal songs are distorted with weak dynamic range.

I find it odd that they made a video for the song (included on the DVD), play the song on the website, but not put it on any of the soundtracks! Bummer! What's the point of getting people who watch the DVD or visit the website excited about the music....then not give them access to it?I hope they come out with a 3rd album soon that has the rest of the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sparkling Diamond","review":"I was really looking forward to this disk, now I'm annoyed. Of the tracks I was hoping for we only got the \\"Show Must Go On\\", and the \\"Bolero End Theme\\". No Can Can remixes (which I was *really* looking forward to), none of the really fine instrumentals in the film. So overall I would not recommend this disk unless you are a diehard compleatest like I am. Maybe I'll just take the tracks off of the DVD...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Film Score for this film?","review":"Elton John and Jule Styne are all well and good, but some of best musical moments in this film are provided by a sometime subtle, sometimes not-so subtle film score recognized by the Golden Globes and totally ignored by the Oscars. Tone deaf as usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"All in all, the first soundtrack was more worth the money. Most of this album is instrumental tracks or remixes of Your Song or I'll Fly Away. While the presentation of Like A Virgin, The Show Must Go On and Spectacular Spectacular is well done, they leave key elements out of other songs or just leave them out period. The aca pella intro to Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend is missing (how can you take that out!?), Gorechi (where Satine sings as she coughs), and other peices that made the songs so together are just gone. All in all, very disappointing. Surely Lurhman could have done a REAL soundtrack for a movie that has become a possible reemergence of musicals in cinema. Obviously not...either that or the money lenders are smelling money a bit further down the road...like at a 25th anniversary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"I was not real thrilled with the content or the mix.

I got the soundtrack and it seemed to be missing songs I thought would be on there. I bought it anyway (much to my chagrin) and started listening to it. There was no Can-can remix, no Sound of Music, and worst of all, NO FINALE SCENE RECORDING! I was so angry with myself and with Baz Luhrman. The soundtrack, except for 2 or 3 new tracks, leaves the listener wanting. Unless Baz plans on creating a Moulin Rouge 3, I will never be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked the first - two is too many","review":"I don't own the second cd. I don't plan to. I love the first Moulin Rouge cd and think it's one of my best. A true MASTERPIECE! There are songs left out of it, thats true. But the second cd doesn't include the elephant love medley and has a very nice redition of your song and come what may. I wasnt at all let down. It's true the cd doesnt include some of my more favorite songs, and does contain some that aren't so great. I love them still. The cd is directed to the pop world, but the songs are in no way unbearable. I'm outraged at the way people are trashing the first and I think owning two cds is excessive. I would not buy a third. I don't feel at all let down by the first cd. I highly recommend buying one or the other of these two cds. But two is too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this CD after reading other people's review's ...","review":"I was very disappointed ... there doesn't seem to be a good soundtrack of this great musical... to date. I few songs sounded similar to the one's in the movie ... and yes they were Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor but the CD is incomplete. Half the songs are missing and others are just instumental with no singing. I don't know why the other people gave such a good rating ... I know music ... and I've bought soundtracks before and have never been so disappointed ... but such a great movie without even offering a good soundtrack? I don't get it?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oy vey...","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love \\"Moulin Rouge\\", but whose idea was this piece of garbage, and what was the point of it?

There are Excellent songs in this CD but I wouldn't mind if there was a Moulin Rouge 3.Also, worth mentioning, is that the First CD was more of the Party Club Style that we felt when we entered the Moulin Rouge for the first time. As for the Second CD it is more of the Dramatic Aspects of Christian and Satines love for eachother. There are themes to each of the CDs (as far as I'm concerned) so If Moulin Rouge 3 will come out, a combination of emotions from Drama to Comedy will be a great addition to the 2 CDs.P.S. The Remix of One Day I'll Fly Away and the song Borelo are amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for fans of \\"Moulin Rouge\\"","review":"Either you loved this film or you despised it. I have to admit, I loved \\"Moulin Rouge\\" because it was bold, different and unapologetically theatrical.The music is integral to the film and the volume II of the soundtrack has a lot of the desirable music. For example, the incomparable rendition of \\"Like a Virgin\\" by Jim Broadbent (a must-have for any fan of the film) and my personal favorite, the gushy \\"Come What May\\" ballad. Yeah, it's sometimes over the top, but in a good way..."},{"rating":"2","title":"First's The Worst, Second's the Best...","review":"Ah, staying true to the schoolyard rhyme, the third album should be the bird and fly over the previous two Moulin Rouge CDs. Although there is no certain assurance of a third Moulin Rouge OMS, hope for one is high. The first containing nothing more than songs done by commerical artists, while the second (and one of my personally favorite CDs) was the direct from movie soundtrack. Although it seems to be missing some of the better songs from the movie, this CD is a great improvement from the first one. Keep thy fingers crossed for a third, more complete version of the best movie ever's soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved But Not Nearly Complete","review":"After watching Moulin Rouge, there were a few songs that really stuck out as the staples of the movie. \\"The Pitch\\" was one of them, \\"Come What May\\" another, and \\"Zidler's Rap\\". The first soundtrack was nice, catching some of the more whimsical emotions, but it failed to sum up the movie in its entirety. The second soundtrack is much more dark and captures the twisted side of the Moulin. The tracks fit together better, the sound is more Broadway and less pop, and the tone fits with the tone of the movie. All together, the second was better than the first, but I expect that a third will come out and be better than both of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs at Least Five Listens, but then Its \\"Spectacular\\"","review":"At first, I was disappointed with this CD. I thought it sounded tinny, and I was hoping the songs would be longer and livelier. However, I have now realized that both of these \\"faults\\" are purposeful. This CD is darker than the last one, and it focuses on Satina's life, commodification, and death. By featuring Satina's songs and experiences, it acts as her eulogy - and her biography. I highly recommend it. (And I do suspect that MR3 will be coming out soon.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"I rented Moulin Rouge and loved it. I bought the first soundtrack, and enjoyed it immensely. But after purchasing Moulin Rouge 2 and listening to it, I felt that I had wasted [money]. \\"Your Song\\" (#1) is a nice ballad but doesn't seem to go anywhere. \\"Sparkling Diamonds\\" is ok but the verson on the first MR cd is better. The Tony Phillips remix of \\"One Day I'll Fly Away\\" is awful (minor keys and dischord). \\"Come What May\\" is so-so but the version on MR (1) is better. \\"The Pitch\\" (taken directly from the film) is quite good. \\"Your Song\\" (#8) is respectable. (Enjoyable if you like background music.) \\"Ascension/Nature Boy\\" is slow moving. \\"Closing Credits\\" is (surprisingly) very enjoyable. (It's unique and intriguing.)The diehard MR fans may enjoy this album. But for the average fan, you may want to think twice before purchasing. (Borrow a copy first, if you can.) It's possible that this album may \\"grow\\" on a person, but I am not 100% sure.In any case, caveat emptor. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but was expecting more.","review":"A few albums/soundtracks all inspired by, from, or for this film, have come out now. Why not make another? Here's hoping Baz will see this and do just that!I thought that this was a good CD overall, however I would've liked to seen more on it too! Particularly the Sound of music/Children of the revolution except with Kylie Minogue! I have been waiting and waiting for a second volume to come out, especially hoping for that part. So now that it has come out, it was a big disappointment. I guess if you want it all, you sometimes only get half. Compared to the Romeo & Juliet 2 soundtrack, this 2nd soundtrack could've been just as good if not better. Otherwise what IS on the CD is great. Huge fan of the movie, get it. If not, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an AWESOME CD","review":"Ever since the movie came out, and I noticed how much music had been left out, I had been greatly disappointed. I kept hoping that the producers of the movie would indeed release another volume for the soundtrack, and I was not disappointed. It has more of the great songs that had been omitted, and helps to keep the movie's spirit alive. However, I do hope along with the other reviews that have so far been posted that they release a third volume with all of the other music they still left out. Even the little snipit songs that don't last any longer than 30 seconds. Hopefully, I have another volume of great music to look forward to."},{"rating":"2","title":"MR fans will want this one, too","review":"I'm very pleased with the CD, though I won't be retiring my CDR burned from the DVD... as with the first CD, the versions on this release were tweaked to fit the final cut of the film, and appear in their \\"original\\" mixes here. For example: in \\"On With the Show\\", the seamstresses vocals are mixed MUCH higher in the film than they are on the CD. The CD version is great listening, just not the film mix, and buyers should be aware of that going in. I'm very happy to have these clean, professionally crafted songs, even if they're not quite as I know them from the film. (My neighbors may not be quite so pleased.)As another reviewer mentioned, there's little of Craig Armstrong's score here. I wouldn't mind a third release to tidy up loose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Sounding","review":"Although the mixture of songs is good, the fidelity and sound of the ones that are the \\"movie version\\" are terrible.

I was excited to know that a second soundtrack was coming out - but I am very disappointed. How many times can they redo Nature Boy, and Your Song. I am not interested in all the instrumentals that were inlcuded in the 2nd soundtrack! I am happy with Like a Virgin and The Pitch.

I have taken multiple cheap shots, and the punching and energy blasts rarely hit. You can beat the game by merely using 2 moves over and over again.

EVERY single thing in it is off course to the show. The very first things you fight are wolves, but for some reason, they made it so the wolves can kill you in 2-3 shots when you have to punch them 50 times to kill one. Also, when you fight Radits, piccolo says \\"lets do this already\\" he dosen't do one thing to help you. He just sits there watching.Another dumb thing about the game is that you have to do little side missions such as saving a boy in the forest. When Goku is going to fight Napa and Vegeta in the episodes, do you see goku helping people getting a toy boat or saving little boys in the forest. I THOUGHT NOT!The Game is very short and easy too. You can go to a level of 25. There is one challenging thing in the game and you will find that out on your own.This is the worst game ever. DO NOT BY IT!.

I love the other games. I hate Legacy of Goku. It is the worst DBZ game ever, if not the worst game ever. The gameplay was awfull, the combat and energy system, not to mention the flight system, were terrible. Although many people say that it followed the anime well, it didn't. Only the basic plot was followed, the rest was made up for the game. Also, as I'm sure you've heard, I hate how dogs and bank robbers can kill you at the beginning of the game. Fortunately, it wasn't all flaws. The graphics were actually pretty good, and the game had the feel of the show. Also, it led to the release of more(and better) American games. So, I would only recommend this game for die-hard fans, just if you want to say you have every DBZ game.

I feel that if there had been more quest and higher levels to obtain it would have been much better.

This turned out to be a major disappointment. In the beginning you are really weak and are easily killed by wild animals. In the show, Goku is making fools out of giants before he is 13. Also, I don't know why they made it so short. I beat it in less than a week, even though I didn't play very much. You don't learn many moves and you learn them in the wrong order, in incorrect places. The only good thing is the graphics and the storyline.

The problem is when a wolve spots you, he charges at you, and you can't get the freaken wolf away from you. you can't punch, because you'll die first.

I mean, they could have at least put in more of the DBZ plot. I finished this game in 5 in a half hours. That had to have been the shortest game I have ever played. For one thing, Goku should have already known the kamehameha wave. He didn't learn it from king kai, he learned it as a child from master Roshi. Also the enemy AI is so stupid!

This is one the poor money making schemes. I love the rich plot of DBZ. This has very few refrences to the plot. The fighting engine is simply unacseptable.

No they don't do this, they have him say \\"Oh no, I lost my balance I think I am going to fall!\\".

I hope that the gameboy game is better. So take it from me if you are hoping for some great fighting and fun game play, you are looking at one of the worst games of all time.

Golden Sun has hard puzzles that took me a month to beat(got stuck a few times and didnt play it for a while)get Golden Sun not Legacy of Goku. hope this helps u save some of your work time along with your money:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"This game stinks! For one thing, it's way too short. I know from other GBA games that it would have been possible to fit the whole series in this game, if they just took out the cartoon in the beginning.Next, the story barely follows the storyline set by the comics and cartoons. Goku is supposed to know the Kamehameha when he was a kid in \\"Dragon Ball\\", way before the DBZ series, not to mention he does not have a limit to how long he can fly in the show. You also can't see what is happening elsewhere like in the show.Also, the controls are hard to get used to. The character moves too slow to hold anyone's attention for long, even in his Super-Saiyan form.Add this all up, along with a boring fighting style, mediocre graphics (except for the cartoon), and no replayability or secrets to unlock, and you get this money waster of a game.

There are countless other books I would rather have rather spent my time on.

(\\"Ain't I a riot?\\" he silently asks the reader every three sentences or so, and the answer is no.)The story about the prostitute might have been amusing, if Sedaris had chosen to poke fun at the upper-middle-class family for being a bunch of sheltered and condescending weenies. Instead he seemed to think the family was pre-e-etty edgy for entertaining a prostitute (a PROSTITUTE! har-dee-har-HAR! an unattractive one! chuckle! in ripped fishnet stockings!) in their nice suburban home.Wouldn't all NPR listeners like to be so awesomely cool and free of social prejudice as to have over for dinner a real-live beaten-up prostitute who works at a cafeteria and smokes? How gritty! How true to life! How...anthropologically compelling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a refreshing read for the holidays","review":"Refreshingly clever and slightly twisted essays of poetic hyperbole and autobiographic fact about the holiday season. Best essays include (Dinah, the Christmas Whore) Sedaris' trip with his sister to rescue a prostitute from her abusive boyfriend, which restores his faith in the uniqueness of humanity during the commercialistic holiday season, and his various experiences while working as a department store elf (SantaLand Diaries). Grade: B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"His mother says he always stirs the turd...","review":"Having encountered the praises of Sedaris by other reviewers online I decided to pick up Holidays on Ice as my introduction to his art. It's a short, fast, and hilarious read on a topic that brings much joy, sorrow, laughter, and terror to us all: Christmas.Flipping through the book before purchasing it I see a chapter titled \\"Dinah the Christmas Whore\\" and I knew it was going to be a bumpy ride. \\"The Santa Land Diaries\\" should be made into a movie. Or at least should be something read to your family instead of that tired old \\"Twas the night before...\\" rot. Blisters the Elf had me in stitches during this story. And the fictitious family letter \\"Season's Greetings\\" was a laugh riot.I will definitely be reading more of Sedaris in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"humorous","review":"I liked Me Talk Pretty One Day better. Holidays on Ice is a mix of autobiographical stories and fiction. I prefer his autobiographical ones, but I still thought all of the stories were great except for one.It's a very short book - I read the whole thing after dinner last night."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Photo Elf","review":"Heartwarming stories of Christmas are common - tales of holiday cheer, families coming together to celebrate, and perhaps an unexpected miracle. This book doesn't have those stories.Rather, what it has is a laugh-out-loud funny look at David Sedaris's stint as a SantaLand elf at Macy's in New York City. This story is both believable and uproarious, and shouldn't be missed. Any holiday shopper needing a pick-me-up from the hour-long lines at the mall will certainly get it from this story!The most poignant of the stories is contained within the chapter called (if you can believe it), Dinah the Christmas Whore. This story points out the importance of serving others, and how families can come together.The four other chapters are worth reading for an interesting, if cynical, look at the role of the season in contemporary culture. They aren't nearly as enjoyable as the other two, and have some dark twists, so do be forewarned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read right before Christmas for great laugh!","review":"This book was a really fantastic collection of 6 short stories regarding the holiday season. I had heard so much about David Sedaris and what a talented satirical writer he was, and I was much impressed by his ability to parody the American publics love/hate relationship during the holiday season. His life as an elf in the Macys's shopping store in New York had me laughing out loud. And the upbeat Christmas letter that includes the introduction of a Vietamese stepchild was hilarious.I finished the book in two days of light reading and realized the author is truly dark and twisted but extremely talented. \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is next on my list. I guarantee you'll like this book, but just to add to the fervor of the writing, I suggest you read it a week before Christmas during your most hellish and frantic points of your life; it'll add to the hilarity of your situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sedaris...Funny, Intelligent, High CQ","review":"Actually, I toyed with giving this five-stars. However, I figure I should employ five-stars for IMPORTANT literary treasures, such as the collected works of Shakespeare, \\"War and Peace,\\" and \\"Valley of the Dolls.\\" So, need a laugh? Well, any of Sedaris' books will do. They...\\"Barrel Fever\\" and the even better \\"Naked\\"...are funny, provocative, and full of weird and colorful people. While \\"Holidays on Ice\\" takes from his other books, it is a veritable laugh-o-rama. And \\"SantaLand Diaries\\"? I have read it a half-dozen times, and I STILL chortle merrily. David, what are you writing? This Midtowner wants more. And, folks, not only is Sedaris an intelligent, witty writer and essayist, he is just as cute as a button. I enjoy getting his books so I can see his little impish face peering out from the end page. And, really, when it comes right down to it, isn't that what it's all about: the author's CQ (Cute Quotient)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will leave you HA HA HA not HO HO HO","review":"Most hilarious Christmas tales around. You will never look at Christmas the same after exploring Sedaris's amazingly funny but somewhat dark world. It's a blessing that I read the stories, especially the now classic SANTALAND DIARIES in the end of October to remind myself not to fall into the trap of the Christmas commercialism. Totally refreshing after years years years of overly sentimental and corny holiday tales. I am amazed at Sedaris's guts to write down a lot of things that most of us would rather to keep to ourselves and that makes me realize what a hypocrite I am. You all must simply have this holiday gem!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifying","review":"Although I have enjoyed Mr. Sedaris's sarcastic humor in the past and found his occasional murky perspective both truthful and poignant, this book was simply too horrific to continue reading. There is nothing entertaining or profound about the murder of an infant. Needless to say I was disapointed in this book. I can only speculate that those who find any entertainment value in a story describing the torment and torture of a baby the very reason our society is rapidly sinking into a state of depravity from which we can never recover. How I long for more of Erma Bombeck's sense of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well written or interesting compared to his other work","review":"This book simply has no satirical value. Once you get beyond the first chapter, it continues downhill. I read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" and just assumed the writing in this book would be just as good or at least interesting but the author was incapable of mixing funny into any part of the book. Not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I'd never read anything by Sedaris prior to reading Holidays on Ice for a book club, and it was by far one of the most hilarious things I've ever read. I would suggest not reading it around others because you will laugh uncontrollably and inappropriately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"This was my first encounter with David Sedaris and I'm sorry to report that it will probably be my last. I was severely underimpressed with this collection. The very first story about working as an elf in Santa Land elicited a few small smiles, but beyond that, most of the stories were rather dull, or I waited for a point to be made or a humorous twist, neither of which ever came. I am usually a fan of the dark and sarcastic humor that Sedaris is lauded for, and this book just missed the mark for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too bitter, even for me.","review":"Too bitter and jaded, even for me. The first story, The Santaland Diaries about his time as an elf at Macy's in New York, resonated with 12 years of holiday retail experience. It was also funny. The other stories were just... ugly.

It was a departure, for sure - but NOT AT ALL pleasant. I actually enjoyed Sedaris' writing style, even the sarcasm, but much of the content was disturbing at best. I gave up after a section that ended in a particularly horrific death. Only one nice thing I can say for it - it made me appreciate the high-calorie sweet holiday stories once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"This was my first exposure to David Sedaris, and I hope it'll be my last. For starters, there's his voice--a grating, oddly inflected whine that frequently made me want to eject the tape. As for the material, some of it is amusing, but many of the stories cross the line between sharp satire and sick, unfunny (and often boring!) discourse. Maybe there are better works by this author, but this one is really terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"a.k.a., Reflections of an Increasingly Sick Society","review":"A writer of any caliber, with any skill, would not need to sink to the depths of Sedaris to make a point.

Its definitely not funny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"Sedaris writes in the same style as Nick Hornby but his stories aren't nearly as humorous or interesting.

I opened this book to find a few laughs amid bittersweet memories and family gaggles. It was well worth it. Sedaris brings just the right sardonic touch to his tales of growing up in suburbia, his first jobs, and, primarily, his life as an elf. Alas, Sedaris also reminded me that men see humor from a certain angle, and I found myself missing the writings of the late Nora Ephon.

It just happened to be the holidays so this seemed a natural choice. I was very disappointed.Four of the six entries here are fictional which halps make his biographical essays that much more believeable. The \\"Santaland Diaries\\" is decent. There are funny parts but the diary aspect of it makes it choppy and I have found his humor best when he controls the flow of the story rather than cutting together some events.The other biographical essay here is \\"Dinah, The Christmas Whore\\" which I found the best essay here but is what I would call the literary version of a b-side.By the end I found that I was enjoying the entries so little I was skipping large chunks hoping to get to a good part.After my first book from David Sedaris I was eagerly looking forward to another one. After this I'm not so sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laundry Day will never be the same","review":"Simply did not like the book.

Unfortunately there wasn't one. Santaland was my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this no stars I would!","review":"Since when did the murder of a baby and two 10 year old boys become funny or even \\"dark\\" humor?

The baby is murdered by a long lost daughter from vietnam who, after her step-mother asks her to \\"watch the baby\\", \\"WATCH THE BABY,\\" which is screamed at the listener again and again, promptly puts the baby in the washing machine and then into the dryer.

The first story was okay but nothing brilliant or particularly funny. The 2nd was dumb. I didn't even want to read the rest of the stories and am selling my copy to Half Price books though I don't expect they will give me much for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the book is better?","review":"David Sedaris, author of Me Talk Pretty One Day, is normally one of my favorite authors. His essays and short stories are usually humorous and enjoyable. However, Holidays on Ice proved to be the exception. This was an audio edition of four of Sedaris' essays/stories about Christmas. While the first story about a department store elf was marginally funny, the rest were horrendous. Sedaris' normally charming narration was grating and whiney and while I did listen to the very end, I honestly wish I hadn't. Perhaps this one would be better if read, rather than listened to, but I think not. I'm not a fan of the Christmas holidays and, seemingly, neither is Sedaris, but his stories didn't prove amusing - they were just annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Synical","review":"The stories would start, introduce the characters, a plot, and then stop.

I read it on an airplane as my husband tried to watch the airline movie. I kept laughing and snorting. My husband could not share my enthusiasm, having no idea what I was reading, so he became annoyed. When I thought I could finally compose myself, I would read on, and that was it, forget any composure! Sedaris not only has a great humorous mind, his words are brilliant. I believe this and much of Sedaris' work qualifies as lasting literature. I purchased eight books to give to friends for Christmas... a perfect gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Ho Hum","review":"If you're looking for a collection of funny Christmas stories to lift your spirits, I wouldn't suggest this book. The first story has quite a few funny moments, is believable and written well, but I found the rest of the collection to be a little too bitter, minus the foreign Christmas story. That had a funny ending but then the last line put a damper on even that one. Also, who uses the word \\"retarded\\" anymore..? It's so NOT funny to call anyone that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scintillating","review":"I limit my reading of Mr. Sedaris's works to the privacy of my home, as the involuntary bouts of snorting laughter his works produce in me prove too disruptive in public."},{"rating":"2","title":"not your typical holiday stories!","review":"Very enjoyable.

I'm already planning to read some of his other books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a holiday book","review":"This book is very dark humor. Not a light holiday read. I have a rather extensive book collection and this book went straight to the recycle bin. Not a keeper for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some things aren't funny...","review":"I generally like David Sedaris; in fact he's one of my favorites. But when his stories veer off into the death of children, almost gratuitously, I can't see the humor. This is, please note, the first book of his that I haven't enjoyed. But it's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seasonal Cocktail","review":"This book got me through November and December, two months when I'm weighed down with holiday depression. Sedaris crafts these stories with sincerity and humor and he makes you ponder how such events could ever happen. You'll read the book in a matter of hours because of its shortness, but the following year, you'll want to pick it up again and revisit the hilarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holidays on ice","review":"An oustanding and hilarious book describing holiday events.

I highly recomend this book for anyone with the least bit sense of humor.Max"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Miracle on 34th Street...","review":"If you are looking for the literary equivalent of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"-this book is definitely NOT for you. However, if you appreciate slightly cynical and sardonic commentary on the holidays, you will most likely appreciate this set of short stories by David Sedaris. From Jim Timothy, the extortionist who preys upon a Pentecostal church, to Dinah, the \\"Christmas [...]\\" Sedaris packs his vignettes with unforgettable characters who will make you laugh-even though you know Clarence the Angel would disapprove. If you've had enough of family bickering and other such holiday treats, curl up with this offering and you'll find a kindred spirit in David Sedaris."},{"rating":"2","title":"most stories are a must read","review":"The first story about the Santaland stood out more than the others, but I would give the story about the baby in the dryer just as much credit for being just as creative and almost as funny. This is a book that you will find yourself laughing outloud, which I have never done before until now. The best part is that it is small enough to fit in a purse and the stories are short enough to read while trying to waste time. I gave it four stars because there were a couple stories that drug on and could have been deleted and the author is very forgiving when you read another one of his right after"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's how you make a holiday tradition...","review":"Buy this book -- a paperback copy is good, not a Kindle version -- and put it with your Christmas/Holiday stuff. Just store it in the boxes along with your tree stand (not to be confused with your deer hunting tree stand...), Christmas balls (don't confuse those either), family recipes and homemade ornaments. Then pull Holidays on Ice out each year and read it during the holidays. Preferably with a stiff drink in your hand. Add a rosemary sprig with a few speared cranberries to whatever you're drinking if you want to really get festive about it. The stories are short, quick, and highly enjoyable (TWSS). I swear it's been a holiday tradition of mine for years. Happy Holiday Reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE DAVID SEDARIS","review":"This is the first book I haven't like as much as the others ...but his elf experience at Macy's is worth the price of admission.

Do not recommend. Got it for a book club, but am not impressed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I bought this for the Santaland Diaries, which I'd heard was very funny. It turned out to not be much of anything. I don't know, I guess I expected the shenanigans to be more interesting than \\"Look through this window and you can see Cher!\\" I read a couple of the other stories too, but they likewise failed to hold my interest, so I gave up before finishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny at first, but lost my attention.","review":"This is the first David Sedaris book I've purchased and attempted to read. The first couple of chapters were interesting and funny but didn't have anything to do with dealing with family. It was about his Christmas job. I didn't necessarily like his view of families and children in which the humor was a little too dark for my taste. Halfway through, there was really more mundane daily stuff that didn't hold my attention. I didn't have any interest in finishing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"...this book already has a lot of reviews, but I wanted to say that whenever the author says \\"what I wanted to say\\" or \\"what I should have said to them,\\" you're about to laugh really hard.On the other hand, the first story is th best with the others (while funny, if dark) don't quite measure up to expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall Down on the Floor Laughing!","review":"David Sedaris is probably one of the funniest writers writing today. Out of all his books this one is the funniest, which is saying a lot. He has the perfect balance to make everyday events hilarious using hyperbole and sarcasm without actually resorting to outright cruelty. I cannot reccomend this book enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infantacide! Hahaha!","review":"Really horrible. First story is ok, but the second is disgusting and sick. Don't read this. I am sorry I paid money for it. Not funny. Wish I never read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Tricked Me","review":"Having read all of David Sedaris' books and having loved them, I was glad to drop $10 on this small new book. The only problem is that the stories are not new. Nowhere does it say this on the book cover. You have to turn to page 4 to see that almost every story appeared in another major publication that I already have. I could have just re-read the books I already have. This is the last David Sedaris book I will buy. Write some new stories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most depressing book or tape","review":"Humor are far in between the dark and depressing view.

The author, David Sedaris, pokes fun at his dysfunctional family and the way he has resolved this issue by stumbling through is own life, finding humor at every turn. I hope you can find time to read this most enjoyable novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holiday Commentary","review":"Very good collection of David Sedaris works around a holiday theme. Enjoyable commentary on modern holiday life but very sad that much of it is all too true.

I didn't finish it & neither did most of the club. Very bleak & twisted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"This book was not very good. I didn't think it was very funny and the sarcasm was over the top. He tried way to hard when writting this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"entertaining...","review":"The book was worth reading, even if it's just for the first story, which I really enjoyed. I would say it was the best of the group of stories that was in the book. The others were okay, but not as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Swiftian essay\\" ruins this book.","review":"I am a huge fan of David Sedaris, and bought this as a possibly subversive Xmas gift for several of my friends. However, the story that includes the mindless death of an infant is not strong enough to justify the really shocking events of the story. Hey -- I like biting satire, but this story isn't good enough to carry it off. This one story really ruins the book for me -- it's a pretty crass attempt to shock, and it backfires. Sure, Sedaris has the right to write it, but prospective readers have the right to be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected","review":"I read Sedaris' \\"Dress Your Kids in Curduroy and Denim\\" *I think I got the title right) and found it hilarious. So when I saw this by the same author in the bookstore, I bought it. NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.The first story, \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" is hilarious, though. The best story in the book. I probably liked it so much because it was based on his life, (at least I think so), while the other stoies were unclear and coming from another person's point of view. I guess I like Sedaris' writing because he turns his own experiences that seem so ordinary and well, sometimes odd experiences, into such hilarious stories. So when I read this, I was expecting to read another compilation of funny stories like those he wrote about in \\"Dress Your ...\\" But I guess not. If you want to read the \\"SantaLand Diaries,\\" I suggest you buy the other book that has it nd not spend the money for four other stories that aren't his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Start, but lacking","review":"The Santaland Diaries was quite amusing. However, I did not find the remaining stories engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes.","review":"Buy this book. My sis was right when she gave it to me; you'll embarass yourself laughing out loud at all the wrong times even if you're not reading it - just THINKING about it! It's affected my writing a great deal, I now look for the humor in EVERYTHING. You'll love it unless you're a buffoon like the guy above who gave it three stars. Did anyone love Barrel Fever? I'm reading it and a bit disappointed so far. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new dimension in wit.","review":"This book was my first introduction to Mr. Sedaris, and I know that I will be reading more from him - soon. His wit is extremely sharp, and entertainingly cynical. He uses the language of that intelligent class clown that made everyone laugh in school, including the teacher. Further, his writing is as frank, honest and comfortable as a letter from a close friend. This book treads the common ground that most readers can easily identify and find much humor with. From the brazen condemnation expressed in \\"Front Row Center\\", to the satirical, if not sarcastic \\"swiftian\\" essay entitled \\"christmas is for giving\\", Sedaris keeps his reader's face suspended in a grin puncuated with out loud knee slapping laughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLIDAYS ON ICE:STORIES","review":"I am very pleased with the book. The condition was perfect. It arrived on time. I would purchase from dealer again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonfiction essays are very good; fiction essays stink","review":"After a glowing recommendation from my sister, I got this book and have to say I have mixed feelings about it. The (pseudo) non-fiction essays (Santland Diaries and Diana the Christmas Whore) are extremely funny and well worth reading. Unfortunately, the fiction essays are horrible. They are very mean spirited, pessimistic, and well, just not very funny. The satire is laid on thick and shameless, as if he had a bet going to see how absurd and over the top he could make a story. And each one is worse than the next. I was drowning in it. I've heard better reviews about some of his other books, so I'll give those a try. I would never recommend anyone buy this book, but please check it out from your library if just to read those non fiction essays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a holiday flight home","review":"This book will give you a new perspective on holiday dread. Compared to these stories your holidays can't be all that bad. This book is well written, engaging and hilarious. Buy a copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I know what funny is.","review":"I never knew Sedaris could write fiction until I read this book. \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!\\" had me laughing out loud in a restaurant (so not me), like I was some crazy, addled ol dude sitting at a corner table sharing a joke with his imaginary friend. It is a very rich little book. Read it, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted","review":"David Sedaris gives us a book on Christmas with a twist. This is not a book about how wonderfull Christmas is but how sick and screwed up the world is with Christmas as the backdrop. My personal favorite story is about working as an Elf with Santa at a department store for the holidays. The little vignettes within the story about the going ons in the Santa department is truly funny because it is true. I worked at a famous toy chain one year and the same stories happened to me. Not one of the stories is traditional, but written with a New York sense of humor. \\"Front Row Center With Thaddeus Bristol\\" is about a serious review of children's Cristmas pagents and is every bit as blistering as if they were a Broadway play. \\"Christmas Means Giving\\" is about one-up-man-ship of trying to keep up with the Joneses and is every bit as funny as it is sick. If you want a book with a warped sense of Christmas that is funny, this is for you. This is definitly not for children, but it is for their parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Again","review":"Sedaris' work makes me laugh, and this book was no exception. His wit is dry and sardonic, and really, what better target for irreverent wit than the holiday season. His short stories are all rooted in his life history, his recounting of truly hillarious incidences. I loved this book, and recommend it to anyone who appreciates dry humor. If you want to be amused, read his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"Picked this up for $5 at Boarders just before Thanksgiving. Quick, fun read! Prior to Holidays on Ice I'd never read Sedaris. Will definately seek out his other work."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Sedaris is always hilarious","review":"Not the best book I have read by him, but a great book in general!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very depressing!","review":"I thought a book with a holiday cover and a title containing the word holiday would be a great one to read during the holidays. Much to my disappointment, it was anything but cheerful. What wasn't depressing and horrifying was tiresome. So much so that I put it down and did not finish it. I am very sorry I spend my money on such a terrible book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would start with another Sedaris title","review":"I really enjoy David Sedaris. However, this compilation of stories didn't sustain my interest. Partly because I have read some of the stories in other collections, and partly because they just didn't flow together as naturally as his other collections of essays. I liked the theme of the holidays being less than perfection. It wasn't as hillarious and wake your husband up because your laughing out loud as the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"SantaLand Diaries is all it is","review":"I like David Sedaris and usually find his stuff very funny with that certain twist. The first story - Santaland Diaries was great - the others, not so great. Some were absolutely horrible-- things no one wants to envision during the holidays. Does that make it funny? The others were just plain boring. He could do better. \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" was so much fun to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one good story & five...uh, not so good","review":"I enjoyed the first story about the author's adventures as a department store Christmas Elf. This was a true gem that made the book difficult to put down and I eagerly looked forward to the next 5 tales. Unfortunately, they all fell far short of the expectations laid out by their predecessor. The first story is great, but that fact alone can't hold the remainder of the book, therefore, I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"The stories are disjointed and pointless. I have read Sedaris' work before and couldn't stop laughing, I didn't even chuckle reading this book, was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Read","review":"I read this every few years at Christmas for a good laugh between shopping excursions. A light, easy read. Quirky look at \\"traditions\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Hilarious dark humor, must read. Holiday humor that anyone that is annoyed by the holidays can relate to or find joy in reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"With the heightened expectations of Holiday and Family comes the opportunity for some slightly dark tales...","review":"This book is not for everyone but was perfect for the people in this house. Clearly the author brought some real-life memories and experiences to these unexpected stories and characters that live outside the pristine snow globe. Only David Sedaris could pull off \\"Dinah the Christmas Whore\\" and manage to entertain his following. I can't wait to read my next David Sedaris book - \\"Naked\\". These are short stories, perfect to read at the airport or on a plane..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully dark and sarcastic.","review":"This is a quick and enjoyable read. I found it very refreshing in that it isn't just another feel-good holiday book."},{"rating":"1","title":"holiday","review":"I was hoping this would have been a funny Christmas tales and all I got was killing things... my disapointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"From Delight to Disgust","review":"This book goes from being brilliant in Santaland Diaries (hence the 2 stars) to being offensive against minorities to being simply disgusting and appalling: children being raped and murdered. During his \\"delightful\\" trek through the holidays, one baby dies after being thrown into the dryer, and two other children are given away and found raped and murdered. And this is funny?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Condition","review":"This product came quickly and in the condition the seller promised. I would recommend buying from this seller in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dark for my taste","review":"Huge disappointment. I have read three David Sedaris books previously and had found them laugh-out-loud funny. \\"Holidays on Ice\\" nearly ended up in the fireplace when I hit a particularly dark chapter. His humor has always been on the sarcastic side, which generally appeals to me, but I didn't find this book amusing. If I want to be horrified, I'll read Dean Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not enjoy this game.","review":"I am a die hard Star Wars fan, this game is an abomination of the Star Wars franchise. I bought this game about the same time that the movie came out, and i was seriously let down. The entire game is a side scroller that is loosely based on the movie. Even the music seems as though John Williams had nothing to do with it. On the back it said you could choose your Jedi, but when I started Playing I did not have a choice. Also the inability to save just added to the over all let down of this game. I am saying this as a fan do not buy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIGHT GAME/RIGHT PRICE","review":"MY GRANDSON REALLY ENJOYS THIS. AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT! WHAT MORE COULD ANYONE WANT?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for die hard gamers","review":"If you aren't a die hard gamer this game is likey not for you.The controls in side scrolling lightsaber mode are complicated and non-intuitive. Example: Stop moving, press the A (attack) button first, _THEN_ the direction pad to direct your attack. With most games its simply attack in the direction you are moving. While this may be life in the real world (\\"uh oh, I better get ready to fight, Attack, Go for the chest\\") it doesn't work so well in this game where the goal is to move to the end of the level.I didn't find the graphics to be all that impressive. It's pretty hard to well show lots of detail on the small GBA screen.Honestly, take this game on a \\"test drive\\" (find a friend) before you shell out the hard earned dollars for it -- unless you're hardcore..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The force is a bit disappointing with this one.","review":"In a nutshell, its too easy and has bad graphics. Episode I has better game play and control, which made this all the more disappointing. And unless if im missing something, you cant use your force powers against Dooku, he always counteracted before i got to pull them off. I defeated him by pressing one button over and over again. Wheres the challenge?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"this game is great! it has good graphics and it is filled with detail! the 3 modes are great, including lightsaber battle, space battle, and speed racing! i recomend this game a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck...","review":"Man, this game is sad. Graphics are palatable, but the controls kill what should be an otherwise awesome game. For example, the controls during lightsaber battles are so complex that you are required to stand still while dishing out your justice ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a SWEET Game!","review":"If you would like to play the game, I think you have to have a little batting practice first because you have to hit a lot of guys with a light saber. The player you will be at the beginning of the game is Anakin. Now you may think it is easy when you beat the first guy but then it turns double. The first time I played it I had no idea what to do but then I found out what to do. The second level I didn't get passed it but I took a couple of trys and I almost beat it but I didn't. Hope you like this game. It's really awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not enjoy this game","review":"Don't get me wrong I am a diehard Star Wars fan, yet to me this game was a huge suckfest. The side scrolling adventure and the horrible graphics further retard the game. The music sounds as if John Williams had no role in it. The story line (if any) to the movie was no where nearly followed, and the title cards that explain the plot bored me into into oblivian. I also did not enjoy the fact that if I got to Level 9 and felt like stopping I would lose all of data from before. I even tried to write down all of the pass codes, but by the time i was done playing and writing my batteries had died. This was just another example of Lucas Arts trying to milk the Star Wars franchise. The game was horrible and not even worth the lint in my pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"the good and the bad","review":"This game to me could have been better. It definately could use a save button. The enemies are pretty easy to beat except there are so many of them.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Star Wars.And if you get a lot of time to play your game.I do like this game quite a bit. The levels are pretty good(graphics and gameplay) and pretty hard to beat. I would rate the hardness of this game at 4 1/2 stars. I also like how they organized the levels. Including 3 flying levels and 8 Ground levels. But you only get to use Mace Windu once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great. Lacks nothing at all","review":"First of all the music is by the John Williams Band, which is nothing short of amazing. The side scrolling levels are fun even if you are 3D game fan,I'm one too. If you loved the movie, at least try the game. It stays true to the movie and there are photos from the movie also. The 3D action is extrordinary.The game really pushes GBA's abilities to the limit. I also think some people may agree with me in saying that I hope Star Wars, Episode 2 will also have a game for PS2, X-Box, and Gamecube."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad game","review":"This game is horrible! the graphics are bad and the controlls are stupid.But the worst thing about this game is the sound.DO NOT get this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Attack of the Clones","review":"This game is a pretty cool game because There is 11 levels play as Mace Windu, Obi Wan Kenobi , and Anakin Skywalker. I would rate the gameplay about 6 1/2 the graphics about a 8 for the Gameboy Advance. I beat the game in about 3 days but I still Play it The bad part about this game is it is very repetive but it is still pretty fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Really not a 4 star but a 3.5 star. It has some good gameplay, but having to write down all those passwords is hard. In one of the levels my GBA went crazy and everything got screwed up! Other than that its an ok game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very frustrating","review":"Now there have been some bad Star Wars games, and this is one of them. When I first saw screenshots of this I thought it would be a great platform game like the original Super Star Wars for the Super NES. Boy was I wrong. The controls are unresponsive, and while the characters are nicely designed, the background levels aren't designed very good. The John Williams score is grating on the GBA's tiny speakers, and all that combined means that you will die, a lot. And when you die, no matter how far you get in the level when you die, you start over right from the beginning. All in all, I think Star Wars fans should use the force, and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the other versions!!!","review":"The game is Starwars that's good but the rest is bad lame graphics,difficult controls,lacks fun. i really gave this a 2 because it's Starwars if this game is like Jedi Outcast I gave this a 5 stars why did Lucasarts didn't develop this game?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The best is missing","review":"\\"Everything She Does Is Magic\\" is missing from the soundtrack.

This is not an easy book to be casually read in the hope of securing instant gratification or wisdom; it is a serious work which the reader will have to read through quite a few times, and think through even more. At the end, though, the reader will be rewarded with a profound understanding of the reasons behind the societal collapse in large parts of the third, fourth and Soviet worlds; of why Europe remains, and could continue to remain, politically a pygmy; of why the \\"free market\\" will keep the majority of the world's peoples and nations \\"free to stagnate\\"; and why the folks living in \\"God's own country\\" can bid goodbye to the good old days of carefree plenty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great submarine book!","review":"Two Hours to Darkness is one of the greatest submarine books ever written!

This book was basically about trying to find the Invisible Man. I cannot think of something in this book that intrigued me really in any way. I would NOT recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Most Boring Books in history!","review":"This book is extremely boring! There is far too much detail about every little thing that occured in the book. Dr. Kemp, who is a strict man of Science is nothing bu something that makes the book boring. I truly do not like science at all. It is kind of depressing to me, but not to everyone. But, the novel deals with Griffin coming into Iping in some freak costume. I have never read another book that was as hard as this one, or even more so, BORING! Who wants to read a book about Science and all of the minor little details that deal with such and such? I am disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"booooring stuff","review":"Picture it. I was having a BAD day. I drank bad milk. I failed a test. I got struck in the head by a branch falling from a tree.

This was not one of my finer days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!!","review":"This book was quite boring and didn't make sense in many portions of the book. I was quite disturbed by the inconsistant flow of the book, quite irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless and eloquent","review":"This novel is truly a great. It sucks you in in only that way that H.G. Wells can. A very intelligent and logical man discovers how to make himself invisible. That's great, except that the process is quite painful. You'd think being invisible would be great, only it's not. You can see through your eyelids, so you can't sleep. Sleeplessness leads to madness. And what about food? You must procure it somehow, and being invisible makes that difficult, as is making friends. All this leads to a madness no one can truly understand, only H.G. Wells makes you see behind this madness to see the logical man gone mad."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked","review":"I hated it.

I cant tell you how disappointed I was with this book. I can see how this could have made a large impact in the time period it was written. It was new, it was interesting, it was 'special'. Now, I've been through many books having to do with science fiction and invisibility. The plot of this book is interesting, man makes himself invisible on accident with a medical experiment gone wrong. He then meets trouble in a town. He ends up being isolated. Here's my main problem, the main character was not likeable in my opinion. I just never had any connection with the book.

You can read it for fun as a great story, or you can get all English Major on it and beat every last drop of fun out of it analyzing the hidden meanings, subtexts, and philosophy of the thing.I read it mostly as a a fun story, and it is that. It had my attention throughout the whole of it. Here's something about Wells: he writes the best pandemonium scenes. Ever. There's one in here that makes you feel for the people that don't know what to do, and at the same time you can't help laughing at the whole thing.If you want to get a little deeper, the main character comes off as rather endearing at first -- and maybe not so much later on. I think we all might wonder what we'd do in his shoes, and hope not the same things.It's a good read and well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Invisibile Man","review":"This book started out kind of dull.

At first he thought that at the idea of being invisible, he soon discovers the many negative aspects and must continue his research to accomplish what he is discovering or dream.This book will be a great book for all types of readers.I would recommend that anyone that reads this story or novel,pay much attention on what the author's purpose of writing this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book was astonishing to me because it's not a traditional science fiction novel. It's a novella. Making it easier to follow the actually complex plot. This is not a mad scientist story. It is about a young, immature, and brilliant chemist who saw only the benifits and none of the drawbacks. This book makes you take a second look at a lot of your fantasies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly compelling! (But the audiobook was badly read).","review":"I was concerned that this book would be boring. After all, the title pretty much says it all: there's a man; he's invisible. What now? Being invisible is all well and good, but it's not a story in and of itself. How can you make an invisible man exciting. The answer is: you make him a psychopath! :)The only disappointing thing about this book was the narrator of the audiobook version that I listened to. She made a lot of mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should you get this?","review":"This must be one of the better books I have read. The \\"true meaning\\" of the plot was a but fuzzy to me at first but as I read more carefully, it's a good, genuine moral.

Of all of the white soul singers out there influenced by Marvin Gaye, you would have to put Palmer very high on the list. These are wonderful adult contemporary songs that are full of soul, heart, sass, sexiness, and intelligence. Excellent compositions, and Palmer sings them very well.The whole vibe of this album makes this part of the 1970's look good. Loads of fun. Great album cover. This is the perfect laid back island vacation or sailboating record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Identity Crisis","review":"These early Palmer efforts (with the exception of the debut cd)simply leave me bored. They seem to flounder with very little zip. This is my least favorite of all his cd's as it's the only one I sold on Ebay. The songs as written do not have a point and Palmer in these days is still searching for his identity. If you are looking for great Palmer try, Don't Explain, Honey, Heavy Nova or even his debut cd.

So, if you have a flashlight or other device with a spring at the bottom, many are wider than the width of a AA battery and don't make contact with the AA battery base. Some other AA to D converters have a plate on the bottom of the case to make it the width of a regular D battery that the bottom of the AA battery would contact, hence making good contact regardless of the contact method in the device you are using them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"works as described - but not a good solution","review":"Yes, a AA battery will fit inside this thing.No, a AA battery doesn't last very long compared to a D cell battery.I bought one of these for a baby bouncy seat.

Friction is the only thing really keeping these together and working and that sometimes just isn't enough.I will try another brand next time.

I'm sure that the author, based on all her other books, is a fine writer, but she dropped the ball on this one. It would appear that she didn't leave her home to write it...that she took advantage of the internet to gather her facts and quotes. Some of her facts were innacurate, such as saying that Timothy B. Schmit might have \\"taken a step backward\\" when he participated in the Poco reunion. That was Randy Meisner! Not only is that common knowledge, If you read \\"Pickin' Up the Pieces\\" by Richie Furay, He says that when the Poco reunion was in the planning stages, he suggested that Timothy as well as Paul Cotton be a part of it and his suggestion was shot down. There some other singer/songwriting inaccuracies as well. She is obviously British, which isn't a bad thing, but I seriously doubt that she left the country let alone her desk to get her facts.

If you're seriously looking for decorating ideas, take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had expected more inspiration and fun than this","review":"I thought this book would be more inspiring and have more new ideas than than it turned out to have.

I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"total fluff, total waste of money","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that the swell concept is forced. This entire book is forced, trying to be cool when it's simply a regurgitation of old ideas or commonsense basics that I've read, like, a zillion times. The book is not worth the money. I was disappointed at the book's size and how few pages it had. Add that to the fact that the pages say nothing, and you get nothing for your money.

The wind was blowing and I could hear the wrestling of the bamboo swaying right and left against a smoldering sky streaked with pink, orange and violet. A ribbed candle sat on the patio table with the flame flickering in and out. I was physically and mentally exhausted that day and in the background I could hear some jazz piano music that was playing on a old Panasonic stereo system I purchased almost 20 years ago at Circuit City. It's just about on its last knees, then I remembered a friend suggested that I play this CD. There is only one thing to say.......There are jazz piano players and then there is Bill Evans. I know that he died in 1980, but if his physical presence was ever with me on that deck, believe me I would have taken him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This was my first exposure to Evans' solo work, in fact to anything led by him. Bill Evans in his solo work evades the typical ultimatum between stride style left hand and booie woogie left hand, playing straight up chords instead and often echoing the right hand melody with his left. He also maintains a certain evenness and serenity through his melodic choices, and for these reasons the album feels less exhausting than some other jazz greats' solo albums; the others are great indeed, but I could easily listen to this album multiple times in succession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Because he's Bill Evans","review":"Amazon asked me to review this recent purchase. Well what can I say? It's like the fellow who interviewed Coach Popovich about Manu Ginobli (I paraphrase): \\"So Pop how did you know Manu would be able to perform just now in a clinch moment?\\".

Beginning with Hungry Again, I began to enjoy Dolly's new music. The Grass is Blue was great and still makes trips out of its case to my CD player. This CD, however, surpasses both. Dolly really shines here. There are so many good songs, so many good arrangements and so many songs that don't sound like everything on the radio.

Tyrone Power and Alice Faye were Fox's answer to MGM's Clark Gable and Jeanette MacDonald, and along with Don Ameche and the incomparable Alice Brady, their film just as fun and entertaining as MGM's hit.Good Americana, with enough melodrama and music to satisfy any diehard movie fan. The highlight is the great Chicago fire, which is even more spectacular than the burning of Atlanta in another 30's classic, \\"GWTW\\". It is amazing they did all those great special effects without computers and animation. Just good old-fashioned sets on the back-lot. \\"In Old Chicago\\" is a golden chestnut from the early disaster movie genre of the 1930's."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"We O'Learys are a Strange Tribe\\"...","review":"that's a line of dialogue that gets pretty tired towards the end of this spectacular, since it is much too overused. However, be that as it may, this film used to be on TV a lot when I was a kid, and I always used to watch it for the marvelous fire footage. It's the sort of scene that appears to be a history book come to life, with horse-drawn fire engines racing down the street, and massive buildings caving in while blazing away. And wouldn't you know it? The whole thing started in the barn of Mrs. O'Leary--the same Mrs. O'Leary who is the mother to mayor Don Ameche and crooked guy Tyrone Power. The two brothers are always at odds, eventually even clashing, though not romantically, over Ty's treatment of chanteuse Alice Faye. Yet, because they are A Strange Tribe, they always are there for each other when the chips are down--and with an inferno raging away, the chips don't get downer than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is Up","review":"Why is it for such a fantastic television show they can not manage a game worth it's the show's worth. I am a dbz freak but i don't think that people are making a good enough game(s) for the show. I would like a story mode maybe like spiderman on XboX or somthing but i just think that an all out fighting game is not what the public wants(or at least me). We need to create a story mode to dbz so people can have a taste at what it would be like to have powers like in dbz. I have been waiting for a game such as i have described ever since dragon ball z started (after dragon ball) i think the customers want to know how toe shoot a khamehameha andd see it's power because that's what video games are for right?

This game has so many errors in it. First off all the text phrases, \\"if successful,\\" and \\"if you declared a tokui-waza,\\" are completely ignored. Secondly, the game was not upto date with the CRD at the time the game was made, so you can put in all the cheap cards you want and make an nearly unbeatable deck, making the game incredibly easy. Thirdly, all cards form all sagas are not included, so you have 1/3 the cards that you should. Also, the whole layout for this game is hard to follow. If you plan on purchasing the Legacy of Goku, instead don't.

I quickly read reviews that other owners of the game had posted, and all-in-all this seemed to be a decent, if not GREAT buy.I was wrong -- dead wrong.This game is very, very bad.The rules are written enigmatically, and it is very hard to figure out what exactly is going on just by reading the rules and watching the tutorial.The gameplay is difficult, and annoying. Each time you want to see attributes of a card it takes a long time, and becomes tedious. There is also very little replay value, and if you want to earn one, if not all, of the secret characters you are in for a lot of really tedious playing.Do not buy this game, even if you are a huge DBZ fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much thinking......getting a headache.","review":"I just got this yesterday.The game is o.k and you get a free promo card , but there is too much thinking.There's no fighting or action ,but using cards.But the game is long and that is why I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good AC Adaptor","review":"The AC adaptor was bought for my JVC eAvinu GPS and it worked out of the box !!!

The prices included become a good baseline for local dealers, so you can guage market values when looking for \\"that special\\" gun you always wanted.After all....with SEVEN MILLION copies sold...the publishers MUST be doing something right!One thing I would like to see added (as if they don't put enough information in there already) would be a section of AIRGUNS...not the sirsoft, but things like the Red Ryder BB rifle for example.

The author converted all of the useful information found in tables and graphs to the SI system, rendering the tables and graphs useless. Most process engineers working in the U.S. use U.S. Customary System units, mainly because the plants they work in are based on the same units of measurements. Myself, I do not want to waste my time converting from SI units to U.S. units when I need information for a design problem.

Not too many folks this side of Joe Cocker have successfully covered Beatles' songs, so an entire album was an ambitious project indeed. The best thing that can be said is that certain omissions (e.g. \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" \\"Rocky Raccoon\\") save this from being an all-out train wreck, although \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" is painful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this album","review":"I don't take the time to write reviews, but I felt I owed it to the public to let them know that this album just doesn't work. An intelligent musician with some clever ideas does not equal good music. No heart, no meaning, and he doesn't even have a very pleasing voice.

Any way on to the games, I'll Start with ecco the dolphin. Ecco is the story of a dolphin trying to defend the sea. It has very good graphics and will keep you playing for a long time. Golden Axe is about three characters trying to save the world from the evil Death Adder. You can play as any of three characters which are a dworf a big tough looking guy and a sorceress looking lady. the graphics are good considering the era they were started in the sound I think is pretty terrible but it grows on you, it doesn't have very many levels but it is pretty challenging to beat them all.

All in all a great package is here. and I'd like to know how they fit it all on tiny little cartridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashin'!","review":"The game is quite action packed, but the Sonic Pinball game is a perfectly great handheld game! Golden Ax and Ecco are GREAT!

Graphically, each game resembles the originals but with less polish on the GBA. Golden Ax is a clean brawler in the likeness of TMNT with medieval-style characters and repetitive hack-n-slash gameplay, that for some reason never gets old. Sonic Spinball is the biggest disappointment in that all levels, boss included, have the same tune from the first stage. What's up with that!If you are looking for classics with enjoyable gameplay and have a GBA, I would recommend this. Otherwise, if you have a Genesis get the original games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry about..... this reality coming through","review":"I'm a fan of HRC but this record is just plain bad.The lyrics are painfull to listen too (ie \\"unfaithful of lies\\" ughh!)

Since she is steal rear facing and can't see Mommy and Daddy she just talks to Dora. The doll has been thrown, chewed on, stepped on...you name it but it still continues to withstand all the abuse my toddler inflicts upon it.I like the fact that it is so small since most dolls are too large for her little arms to hold properly.If your little one likes Dora then you can't possibly go wrong with this doll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Follow-Up to Comanche Moon","review":"I thought that Comanche Heart was a good follow-up to Comanche Moon.

It's just that at some points in the book, I felt that the author almost copied some of the scenes from \\"Moon\\" and only sweeked them a little for the latter book.

The album, Palmer's first as a solo artist after fronting Vinegar Joe and Dada among other bands, has strong funk rock chords throughout the arrangements and the young Palmer's voice is surprisingly soulful and emotive. Palmer worked extensively in his early career with Little Feat, The Meters, Allan Touisaint, and Lowell George, and all of their influences are felt here. In fact, the album's title track and debut single were written by Touisaint. Funk rock fans will enjoy this album as classic rock style collection while die hard Robert Palmer fans will enjoy seeing a more expressive and creative side to the singer than what was shown on his big 80's hard rock hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure bloody brilliance.","review":"Blue-eyed soul or otherwise, whatever label you choose for this album the truth is that it is simply bloody brilliant. The sincerity just ooozes on every track as does the funk courtesy of the Meters and the irrepressible Lowell George & Crew. To give Mr.Palmer his due (he's diabolically soulful and funky on this album and I didn't mind his later stuff either)a chap's gotta do do what he's gotta do, roll w/the punches, change with the times etc. Besides, anyone who can funk up an obviously 'trippy' track as 'Sailin Shoes' deserves more than just the obligatory critical kudos.When I do get to this album it's usually 'layter'in the evening, my listening pleasure enhanced by a couple of Rusty Nails or whatever is your poison, be it a single malt or wheatgrass. Just a tip for first time listeners, I usually start with Track 3 (Sneakin') and then loop back to Track 1 and 2. Works for me folks, En'BLOODY'joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average White Man","review":"Robert Palmer is not much of a rock vocalist, but he is certainly not a R & B singer.

It's too bad that they cancelled this one and not CSI Las Vegas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start","review":"Although this show has faded down the stretch, the first season of CSI: Miami is definitely worth the pick-up. The cases are fantastic but still believable, as is the science for solving them. The characters are varied and believable, with (with the exception of Horatio, the lead character, who is developed more slowly - not at all until season 2, really) just enough personal touches to convince you they are real people who lead real lives outside of the crime lab but not enough to distract you. Usually spin-offs are doomed for failure, but every now and then you get a good one. For the first few seasons, at least, this was one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miami Vice Meets CSI -- What Could Be Better?","review":"I never really watched CSI: Miami before I tried out Unbox but I decided to try it with the $0.01 promotion. It turns out it's really, really good and now it's one of my favorite shows. Seriously, this must be the best looking show on TV. It has interesting crimes, lots of action, fast cars, good mysteries and David Caruso is a very strong lead. I think the camerman should be one of the highest paid people on the show because it looks awesome. I think the thing this show needs for it to go to the next level is for someone from the suporting cast to emerge as a young, sexy star equal in stature to Horatio and a counterpoint to him in the stories.

Curuso is a total bore, no personality and acts exactly the same as he did on NYPD Blue. A total let down, but that was to be expected. I would go so far as to say that this is a poor show, period. I watched the entire first season, always waiting for it to get better. It never did. The only decent acting comes from Procter and the M.E. from News Radio, who is utterly unbelieveable in her role. This is what happens when TV execs recycle TV shows. Suprisingly, CSI NY is even worse, and I have tremendous respect for Sinise as an actor.Don't fake the funk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original by a long shot","review":"I really liked the original series and when I finished its first 3 seasons, I was looking for more and decided to try this. A big let-down. The regular characters never get very involving, if one of them got killed in the line of duty who would care? Also, where the original series had some humor and wit, especially as to how the crimes were committed or twists of fate that obscured how they happened, this has very little humor, and wit has been replaced with gross-out or shock appeal. Now its how many family members can all be killed in one episode, what's the youngest victim they can come up with, how gruesomely presented can be murders be, how much torture or mutilation can be shown to spice things up? This is like the National Enquirer version of CSI. Perhaps it is a natural evolution as the writers have to find 2 more new crimes to present each week. They've run out of clever, so they go for shock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad way to start!","review":"I love CSI: Miami but this season is a little much. For one thing every time a murder happens it has to go into detail and look at all the gory parts that other seasons don't this season is also kind of boring in script I think Horatio has about the only good lines.

Frankly, I wasn't a big racing game fan (I prefer FPS). However, after you learn the ins-and-outs of breaking, accelerating, downshifting, and leaning, the game is great fun. Add to that the competition of playing on Xbox Live against 15 others who are learning the game at the same time as you, and you have a formula that will keep you from getting a full nights sleep for months.

The prose is ponderous and the main characters are dull. An anthropologist returned to England after ten years in Uganda, the haunted Munday (a bad-tempered, stuffed shirt if ever there was one) becomes an incongruous partner in a steaming affair with the apparition, Caroline. Their clandestine meetings are occasioned by Caroline's invasion of the conscious mind of Munday's wife, Emma. She finds herself compelled to send her husband off on irrational errands which culminate in more sexual encounters with a waiting Caroline. (Difficult to swallow? Yes, indeed) The promised horror and haunting don't really make the grade and the most entertaining portion of the book, in my opinion, was the unwelcome visit of the African Silvano to the English village where the Mundays were not regarded kindly. This, at least, was worth an occasional chuckle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I love Paul Theroux, I've read most of his work, but this cruelly disappoints. He can write great fiction : look at The Family Arsenal, but this is not great fiction. I couldn't get into the book at all, the characters didn't grab me, the plot seemed forced, and the sex scenes towards the close of the book seemed almost to be there to encourage the reader to actually finish the book. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring....","review":"This is the first book that I have read by Paul Theroux. I am generally a Stephen King reader but unfortunally my English teacher does not allow him for a book report.

Never cloying and very absorbing!! At first, I thought I would prefer original recordings than modern style ones with synthesizer, which was effectively used in almost every song revealing his desire for new expression, I think. This album is very sweet and must be one of his best. Whenever I turn on my CD player for this CD, I listen to whole tracks. I'd really like to recommend this CD to anyone who wants some rest with easy feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The master does it again!!!","review":"Simply amazing. I just can't tire of listening to this man. He is definitely one of the masters of instrumentation. The feeling, the incredible violin sounds, the impetus that all his songs portray. He carries your soul on a cloud to seventh heaven.Like I said, \\"The Master\\". Only one that comes close is Frank Pourcel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over reliance on synthesizers makes this Mauriat's worst..","review":"This CD is probably the worst album Paul Mauriat has ever produced. This CD relies too much on synthesizers and it could have been all programmed and arranged by computer. During the late 80s there was a move away from full symphonic sound and this CD is probably the worst example of that phenomena. It's ashame because I really love Paul Mauriat and an avid fan. On his 1962 and 1965 albums of famous French melodies the symphonic quality of his orchestra is a real gem to hear with all pieces skillfully and beautifully arranged. Thankfully, Paul has gone back to a more orchestral style and has produced some very wonderful sounding albums again. It's ashame I can't award this album with a higher rating - I'm waiting for the release of \\"Paris With Love\\" (1965) and \\"The 14 Waltzes of Chopin\\" (1970) for these are two of Mauriat's greatest works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as always!","review":"Listening to these songs brings back the nostalgia and the beautiful memories of my childhood. Paul Mauriat's arrangements of these wonderful classics are the best ones you'll ever heard.

The problem may be in the poor quality of the recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic 3d DVD","review":"There aren't many 3d videos or dvds around, this one is the pick of the crop. It is easily the best 3d movie ever made, one of the few that didn't trivialise the depth effects and eeriness of 3d, but used to enhance an otherwise enthralling film. Technologically, no other 3d movie was ever so seamlessly and flawlessly made. Without the 3d however, this is still a great film, it has such a great creepy, mysterious feeling, and a deliberately paced build-up and denouement. This is more than worth the modest price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes me back","review":"Love this collection of old-timey hymns, and Andy's voice is strong and true.

The author focusses almost exclusively on matters that probably never concerned more than a few Tamils and certainly aren't taken seriously today. Reading this book to learn about \\"Being a Person the Tamil Way\\" would be like studying the fine details of feng shui to learn about being a person the Chinese way. Putting it another way, imagine reading a whole chapter in a book about what we mean when we speak of \\"home\\". Do we mean our present house? Our parents' house? Our town, our region, our country?

My iPod was always coming back to Mass Romantic since then, and now the New Pornographers have finally brought out a new album. It's great. It's the kind of music that just infects your soul with a grin. Several stand out tracks, \\"All for Swinging You Around,\\" \\"Laws Have Changed,\\" and \\"Chump Change\\" have grabbed me first, but the whole album is fantastic and will undoubtedly be whirring through the iPod for the rest of the year.

If anything, 'Electric Version' could be considered 'Mass Romantic Part 2' building upon the same successful formula...catchy guitar hooks, sparkling melodies (along with Neko Case's silky sweet vocals), romping keyboards, and an allround infectious power-pop vibe that makes it a treat to listen to. Energetic yet playful at the sametime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop perfection. Probably better than The Beatles.","review":"This is the best pop record I've heard so far in 2003.

Actually, she's got a huge amount of talent all around her including Carl Newman (Zumpano), Dan Bejar (Destroyer) with John Collins and Kurt Dahle holding the rythem down tight. This collaborative supergroup turns out upbeat, single-quality, killer music on nearly every track. \\"All for Swinging You Around\\" or \\"The Laws Have Changed\\" would be my top picks, but just about every track is a winner.

I expected more of Neko Case and I certainly expected an album that didn't sound like it had been recorded in a metal storage shed. Jeez, the producer and engineer should go back to the garage for some lessons. The melodies are pleasant, but so is a bowlfull of warm jello. The playing is adequate, but not inspired.

However, repeated listens show how this record is superior to Mass Romantic, which no doubt is fantastic. The production is still like a wall of sound, but the songs just sound better. Don't listen to anyone who says Dan Bejar's songs plagued this record, for his are definitely standouts.

Erwin has a chatty and disarming style that is a joy to read. Unfortunately, it is a public disservice to distort reality as Erwin has done in this book. In depicting his role in the whodunit, Erwin has liberally embellished his own contributions and those of his colleagues. After proclaiming for years that the extinction was unrelated to the Siberian volcanism, this book now implies that such a relationship was his idea. The whitewashing treatment of his team's blunder in misdating the extinction and related events is worthy of the most guileful politician explaining away some scandalous act.As long as you don't mind the plethora of factual errors and self-promotional aspects, it is a fine book. Unfortunately, it will not weather history well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was waiting for.","review":"The box around the cheese was broken and the other items were spread all over the box.

McLaughlin's original compositions and creative reworkings of other material creates a very interesting and enjoyable mix.

All in all, this album is well worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"i wish there were more than 5 stars","review":"this record is unbelievable. but I mean seriously brilliant. A brilliant John Mclaughlin, an increadible Kai Eckhardt, and there simply arent enough words to describe Mr. Gurtu's work on this CD.

I also appreciate the talent of it's artists. This 2 disc set offers a wide, wisely chosen selection from most of the popular operas, performed by most of the world's greatest singers, present and yesteryear. Yes, you will find legends such as Maria Callas to Pavarotti to the up and coming Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu; sharing space on these discs. Economically, I was able to obtain this set for under ten bucks. My research could not find a more varied set with such a stellar roster at any price. It will impress any novice to seasoned collecter. I wish that EMI annotated the set better, a brief synopsis of each track would have tutorial value.

It clearly instructs you how to do each stitch and shows you where you would most likely use it.I started by stitching little sailboats around the ankles of a pair of denim overalls for the son of a friend. I haven't made it to a different project yet...I am working on my seventh pair of overalls...this one with flowers and butterflies around the ankles and over the straps for a little girl to be born later this year.

The sound quality is horrible on this remaster. The kick drums are clipped like the sound is turned up way too loud. The midrange is also pretty raspy and harsh. I'll have to stick with my original version. As far as the music, I think this is Robert Palmer's best. I am really disappointed that they couldn't get the sound quality right. It is hit and miss with remasters these days. I wish people would take the time to do it right. That, or get their hearing or equipment checked prior to attempting it. The Pink Floyd, Rush, AC/DC, Van Halen, Elton John, and Supertramp remasters sound great.

But this is a solid AOR collection, highlighted by 'Bad Case of Lovin' You' (Doctor Doctor), his cover of Todd Rundgren's 'Can We Still Be Friends?' and a forcefully-delivered 'Under Suspicion.' There's no glossiness here, and the band and production are tight and solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful recording","review":"Thuis recording is an absolutly fantastic buy, the freshness, and vitality which il giradino armonico employ in their interpretation is not only extreemly exciting to listen to, but also works very very well, i think that the hightlight of the whole cd is the sonata representativa, which has a freshness and gypsy-style of violin playing that I have never heard before.

If Sanders kept to one major plot instead of trying to develop three, it wouldn't be so bad.

I was bored by the time I was a quarter way through the novel and struggled to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I have read and enjoyed other Akashic titles but this book was a disappointment. Is Kamikaze Lust a trashy novel on the pornography industry? Or is it a love story between two women? Sanders can't decide, making for an unfulfilling, disjointed mess.

Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had expected","review":"I really didn't like the book, it did not have my attention and by the last half of the first chapter I was bored.

In a time when the music industry is dominated by over-managed, over-produced entertainers, it's refreshing to know that there are still pure artist out there. Entertainers entertain, and artist create art, and when you see Devin live, you realize there's a big difference. Devin is an artist, and if you don't believe me, then checkout Club Zero. Club Zero is not a Live album, or CD (woops, showing my age), but that's the beauty of his music, what you hear live is exactly what you hear on this CD. That's because he has real musicians with him, and therefor, you hear real music, just like a concert.

The narrative is disjointed and hard to follow. There is very little information about the psychology of the killer. The writing is insulting to the reader - it almost seems as though the book was written for children.

However, this case of Richard Grissom, probably the most heinous murderer in the history of Kansas, deserves more attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This book compelled me to read it through, but I kept waiting for details.

I knew two of these girls and why Grissom wont give the families a chance to locate and burry the victims is beyond me. This case brought to life the Death Penalty in the state of KS. And if not for one mans driving force through it all its hard to say that Grissom would have been convicted. Thank you Paul Morrison, for caring so much for the girls and the families. I am from Overland Park Ks. and also know that Grissom most likely killed at least one other girl, Terri. Our town was in tears as the search continued for years. If you didn't live through that trial and feel first hand what went on you can't possibly know the effect it had and still has on many of the KCMO and KCK Overland Park and Olathe Ks areas.

But it would be a shame if you're into Gil's sound to ignore this album for it is more ambituous in orchestrations and Gil's compositions. \\"Hotel Me\\" for example has a unique orchestration of 2 bassists (Gary Peacock/Richard Davis) and the propulsive drumming of Elvin Jones. In fact I really dig the recording quality on this disc than on the Impulse. Other great soloists featured on this disc are Wayne Shorter, Kenny Burrell, Johnny Coles and Thad Jones.

Her affection and admiration for him do not allow for much admission of errors of judgement in technical, personal, or business matters. Still, the man's brilliance is clear, as well as the stubbornness which cost him so much.This is principally a story of a man's life. There is little in the way of technical information or photographs of the technologies that Farnsworth invented and developed, nor are there references for the interested reader to follow up on. The writing is only fair. But the story and the man are interesting enough to fit this book in the library of popular inventors' biographies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks a unifying theme","review":"This book is a compilation of previously published materials that lack a unifying theme.

There is a loose connection between the articles involving chaos on the seas (mostly man-made but also natural) but not enough to make a coherent book. There are times when I wondered what the point of the book was besides passing on some interesting stories. In the introduction he tried to link the \\"outlaw sea\\" to terrorism but that idea was never reintroduced or significantly supported.Read the book if you're interested in maritime disasters.

This is a voice to be reckoned with. The song Kisumu 100 is backed up by familiar African chorus and yet is new-sounding, blending modern African Pop with a really innovative sound. The title song \\"Mama Africa\\" is a tiny bit reminiscent of Miriam Makeba, very folk-ballad. This is not a cliche sound--it is a blend of the best of traditional, pop and international World Music. If you like African pop and African singing such as Ladysmith Black Mambazo, you should really enjoy Suzzana Owiyo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional gone global","review":"Her music combines the traditional with the modern. For those familiar with Miriam Makeba, Rokia Traore, Sally Nyolo and a bit of Zap Mama, you will not be disappointed. The music is both folksy and contemporary.

For several years I had searched for an alternative to a Palm with a keyboard, PC sync (MS Outlook) and an affordable price.My Psion Revo does it all for me - except for the lack of backlit display. It set up easily and quickly with excellent documentation, syncs quickly and perfectly with my PC and MS Outlook and comes with it's own version of a decent word processor, spread sheet, contacts, agenda, e-mail, phone dialer, calculator, and more. A modem is also available for an additional cost. It looks good and even feels good in my hand and is small enough to fit in my pocket - though I don't trust any expensive piece of equipment in a pocket.

END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it, disappointed","review":"I decided to go against the grain of Palm buyers based on the reviews I read at Amazon, and bought a Psion Revo.While I did like the convenience of dragging and dropping Word and Excel files into my Revo, I found the synchronization to be a major problem.Very often my PC would not \\"find\\" the Revo and I had to Juggle the Revo in its docking station till it did.Contacts and appointments were often duplicated (in one case, replicated 4 times!), the e-mail program just crashed on me requiring a soft-reset.There are very few apps for the EPOC system, and those that are out there are fairly poorly written.Overall, disappointed, I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great !","review":"I recently purchased a REVO online about the same time that my husband got a Visor. I ahve to say that I prefer the REVO for at least two reasons, it has a functional albeit small keyboard, and a rechargable battery. The only reason I rated this a 4 and not a 5, is that software for the REVO is more difficult to find, it seems to originate in Europe mostly. That is a little disappointing because in the medical field, I need to have material such as drug references etc that are pertinent to practice in the US. In all other ways, I have found it to be absolutely great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reliability nightmare","review":"Great product with lousy reliability. I've had the motherboard and the battery-pack replaced in the last 6 months. I understand that the reliability problems led to Psion dropping the product line. Do thus not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a Jaguar: sleek, in need of constant tinkering","review":"The Revo reminds me of a sleek product from another British company: the Jaguar. Like the Jag, the Revo is beautifully designed (including the EPOC OS) and amazingly powerful for its size. It'a also like a Jag in that you spend an awful lot of time tinkering with it to get it to run like it should. The problem is that the internal (and very hard to access) rechargable batteries are notoriously temperamental, meaning that you'll turn the thing on when it supposedly has a decent charge and...nothing. The Revo bulletin boards are filled with similar tales of woe. A pity, because this would otherwise have been an amazing machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"pls give us a backlit screen","review":"The Revo is tremendous and powerful for a small, easy to pocket palmtop. I immediately bought a handwriting recognition program but found it to be slower than typing and less accurate. For a PDA at this price with a battery that doesn't need recharging for 12 hours of use, I'm very happy. However, a backlit screen would be a huge plus 20% of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best handheld device so far","review":"I have used many computers/handhelds over the past fifteen years. The REVO in my opinion is the best I have encountered. The built in software is exactly what \\"we\\" need for collecting information in agricultural research plots. The transfer of files between machines (infrared) is awesome! Light weight , easy to hold , lots of memory and rechargeable long lasting batteries are all positives for this little machine. The only drawback is the screen darkens in direct sunlight. However it takes just a second to adjust. Great machine. Great price. Lack of availability right now is a big concern as there are no other handhelds being made to touch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious alternative to Palm and PocketPC","review":"Sometimes it is important to question the value of buying into the standard. In the case of PDAs, the argument is made that buying the standard (e.g., Palm) gives you access to more software, more compatibility, and a more secure future (since also-ran platforms tend to be discontinued). I suggest here, however, that you question those arguments. Most people never add software to their PDA (and if they do, they use it once or twice) and also will keep the device for a few years at best before replacing. The Psion Revo gives you all the great features of the other devices, a usable keyboard, nice design, and the ability to exchange information with a Palm via infrared (so you can zap you business card info too). Psion is very popular in Europe and deserves a shot in the US. If any event, however, most users will want to replace their device in 2-3 years because the technology keeps getting better! Worth serious consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is pure, unadulterated, NON-\\"Garth\\" Country music","review":"George Jones and Merle Haggard are the only two remaining TRUE Country 'n Western stars.

I also wanted to make a bold statement so I chose the red one.This watch is 3.8mm diameter total, the red dial alone is 2.7mm, plus 1mm thick.The scratch resistant mineral crystal on top is totally flat on the same level that the stainless steel ring.This detail makes this timepiece so classy! The stem to adjust the time is neatly placed at 4 o'clock as well as the date window.Red leather band is of good quality, has a bucke stamped Victorinox on it.Quality is everywhere in this watch.

It worked with difficulty, frequently giving inaccurate weights. Finally, after less than 2 years of moderate use (and a new battery), it died. Now it's off to the dump ...This is a product to avoid and, most likely, a company to avoid. It is telling that it is no longer available from AMAZON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One Of Wilson's Best","review":"Cassandra Wilson singing jazz standards is kind of appealing on the surface, but a closer listen will reveal that this is actually not what she's good at doing. I wouldn't call her a \\"jazz\\" singer anyway, because for me, Shirley Horn was the best female jazz vocalist of all-time.Wilson does show an impressive range with these selections, but again, I don't think this is her forte at all. The musicians are great: Mulgrew Miller, Lonnie Plexico, and Terri Lynne Carrington. They are all fantastic, but Wilson's voice simply does not fit into this kind of setting.I think anyone interested in Cassandra Wilson should check out \\"New Moon Daughter,\\" which as far as I'm concerned is her best recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocks today just like it did in the 90's","review":"I grew up on this disc.

Given the tumultuous events occuring in the news today, Time's End is not only a timely warning about the dangers inherent in the erosion of citizens' rights, it's a must-read for those curious where current trends could lead. Time's End is a taut, highly visual, and fascinating futuristic thriller. The characters are intriguing, and the ideas driving the plot resonate with startling clarity.Matthew St. Amand..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless drill bit, should have bought the import","review":"The corner chipped off this bit on the FIRST hole.

This was not as strong as the first 2 of the trilogy. The one thing we do get to see is the downfall of andy laus charector both mentally and profesionally. The movie shift to much from the past to the present that you start to whish that they stayed in one place for one second so that you can get a grasp of what is going on. This is like the godfather the first 2 are a masterpiece but the 3rd part even though it is good it leaves you dissapointed by the way it turned out in the end. If it was not for the great performances from everyone this would have gotten a three star from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Getz and Diz","review":"This is a classic recording. One that should be heard by all jazz fans. The ignorant notion that Stan Getz got wiped out by Dizzy is preposterous. Both musicians play their hearts out. Of course Dizzy plays great here - he was at the top of his game. But Stan TOTALLY keeps up with Diz. One wishes that the producers/engineers hadn't made Diz play with the cup mute so much. Listen to Stan's amazing facility, clean articulation, and fleet fingers on the incredibly up-tempo \\"Don't Mean A Thing.\\" Stan also plays beautifully on the ballad \\"Talk of the Town\\". For top musicians like these two, it was all about furthering the music. The game of \\"who won the jazz boxing match\\" is left to half informed non-musicians who don't know how difficult it is to play on the level of these two superb gentlemen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant collection from 6 jazz legends-in-the-making","review":"With Getz, Gillespie, Oscar Peterson, Max Roach, Ray Brown and Herb Ellis all playing together, how could a session go wrong. It doesn't on this exceptional collection of cuts from these six masters. Mixing standards like \\"It don't mean a thing\\" with jam sessions like \\"Impromptu\\", this group sounds like they had been gigging together for years, but this was a one-time-only gathering. The interplay between Getz and Gillespie is comparable to Davis & Coltrane with the exception that both Stan and Diz are unquestioned virtuosos who never step on each other's riffs. The real treat on this album, besides the amazing clarity, is \\"Siboney\\". It provides a glimpse of the CuBop and Bossanova sounds that the two headliners would popularize in the coming years. If you like small, tight jazz ensembles, you MUST get this album"},{"rating":"1","title":"lost album","review":"downloaded album to my wifes K-fire.

I am not fond of country music, but I am interested in Grandstaff and I sincerely hope they make a go of their career. If you are looking at Grandstaff to be \\"Statler Brothers part 2\\", sorry you are looking in the wrong place. Even their rendition of \\"How are things in Clay, Kentucky\\" (a Statler tune) differ greatly from previous recordings I have heard.

Instead, the author tries to get you to buy his software if you want to see any example at all. I give the book 2 stars because it tries to do marketing instead of doing it's job of giving buyers useful information.Based on the title of the book \\"ISO 9001 Requirements\\", the author did do his job explaining what the requirements are.

Another girl, Kelly Johnson, is angry about her parent's divorce. And Bambi (my favorite person- she is so smart and strong) is being pressured and lied to by her jerk of a boyfriend.

She's not liked at school but, then she gets into a club. I wouldn't read this book again. There was some killings but, it should have been more detail.

The way the girls treated that boy, shaving his head and etc., was VICIOUS. Eerie. Sick. This book is being removed from our reading list at the school where I teach. At first, I thought maybe the parent was overreacting. I am not for censorship and I feel that children should be able to read whatever they want, within certain boundaries. However, in the aftermath of the highly publicized violent school shootings, maybe this is not such a good idea. After thinking about the content a little more, maybe it does need to be removed.

I liked this book because one of the girls could see things others couldn't. I love that especially in Lois Duncan books.

Other than that I thought it was very good. Lois Duncan captured the unwanted truths about a wonderful club such as the daughters of eve. The way that Irene lead the girls with her hatred of dependence on a man. It seemed to me that just because of one bad little run-in with a man she deemed all men to be that way.

I read all the great reviews about it and decided I would go for it. Big mistake! I started taking the pills and got my period right away which lasted 13 days!! (Normally my period was 3 to 4 days). I thought okay, maybe this is just the start of these pills \\"normalizing\\" my cycle who knows? Well I am still waiting for my period after 45 days now and have taken 2 pregnancy tests. Deff not pregnant. These pills have messed my cycles up and I am so annoyed. I stopped the pills and am still waiting for a period so that I can try to get back on track!

I did not ovulate until CD33 (almost 2 weeks later) and wound up with a 45 day cycle. I have not taken it again. Since this cycle, I've been right back on track. I don't know if this product is to blame for that whacky cycle, but its the only thing I can figure.

This product THREW MY NORMAL 28-DAY CYCLE COMPLETELY OUT OF WHACK! My cycle was so out of sync (1-2 weeks late) that I thought I must be pregnant. Well, I wasn't pregnant. What I was, however, was utterly frustrated. After 3 months I threw in the towel and returned to taking my regular prenatal vitamins.I would HIGHLY DISCOURAGE anyone with a NORMAL CYCLE from taking these supplements.

I started taking this product about a month and a half ago and did not ovulate this month. I thought at first that maybe it was just me, but now after reading all of the other reviews regarding non-ovulation, I now see what the problem is. If this is supposed to \\"enhance\\" your fertility, it should definitely not make it so that you don't ovulate. I bought another month of it a couple of weeks ago, and let me tell you, it's going right in the garbage. I really wish I had known about this problem before I went ahead and wasted my time and money on it. I just hope that it doesn't take long for me to get back on track and start ovulating again.

After one more month I went to the OB/GYN who recommended I go to a RE and then prescribed me Provera to induce my AF.

Please, listen to my review, this medicine is not helping, it destroys the body. I do not know if I will be able to recover from this.

The only thing it gave me was acne, a jacked up cycle and 10 extra pounds on my ass! Do you know how it feels to be 8 days late when you're trying to have a baby only to get your period on that 8th day? Let me tell you...IT SUCKS!!! I have NEVER been late. I am always 28 days to the day. Now, my second month of not taking these stupid pills, I am going on 2 weeks late and I know I'm not pregnant because I already took a test.

I got my period just 2 weeks after taking fertilaid. Here's the catch- I was having really strange side effects like dizziness and cramping so I decided to go off fertilaid because I didn't like how I felt. That's when I got my period.

I had no pain or discomfort with this cycle. In fact my cycle has been very medium/light and I am normally heavy/clotty so I know it's working. I also have to add that I had a laparoscopy performed on Sept 29 and the Dr. said that my first cycle would be very heavy due to all the stage two endo and scar tissue/cyst removed.

It seems to me that Nancy shows signs of BPD, denial, feeling like a Saint, seeing things in black and white, living vicariously through her daughter, lying and believing your own lies and rewritting the past to fit your needs. I am sure if Jennifer said she would never forgive you there must have been many reasons leading up to that moment and this book and that interview the final straw for her. Sad.

In the theory you need to know specific points to do the calculations, but with a little modification to the theory you can choose arbitrary points. I still use the program I made years ago.

When there was only just 30 pages left, I gave up on it. I flipped through to see them talking about how they love eachother. It was very strange.The story was boring and went on for too long on pretty much nothing. It just wasn't my thing. I just couldn't get into it. But perhaps you may like this book.

She is a really good author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad book","review":"but not a great one either.Set in a mythical renaissance kingdom in Central Europe, WHEN THE KING COMES home tells the story of Hail Rosmer, art student with a fascination for a long-dead artist/alchemist. When the alchemist's seal is used to return long-vanished King Julian, Hail is drafted to protect the kingdom from the necromancer.It's an interesting premise and Stevermer's world is interesting enough as well. I found it hard to get into the characters, however. Hail's fascination for Maspero drives the novel, but isn't really explained. Partly because the story is told from Hail's first person point of view, the other characters blend in together without strong differentiation.WHEN THE KING COMES HOME is a pleasant read--but it has hints that it could be so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING !","review":"After having read many fantasy books by many different authors I must say that this book was the worst of all !Even though the style is ok, the plot is as interesting as watching a stone fall to dust...At first I thought it might improve and kept on reading up to page 184 (of 236) but then just couldn't stand it anymore and stoped.The story is very constructed, the surrounding world doesn't feel real, everything appears very static and the characters are lifeless puppets. Not even once did I have the feeling of being part of the story, instead I always forced to myself to keep on reading in hope for an improvement ...which never came, up to that point where I simply gave up, and I'm not the kinda guy who gives up easily on a book.I can't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow, but brilliant","review":"Many of the other reviewers have complained that this book moves too slowly. If you go into it expecting a rollicking adventure, then you'll be disappointed. This is not a novel of swords and sorcery. It's not something that you could pull from transcripts of your last D&D; campaign. And that is very much in its favor.Stevermer has painted a picture of the life of her main character. She is not your typical fantasy heroine, nor is she a wilting flower waiting to be saved by the big strong men. She's an individual, and the joy of the book is learning about Hail.The book expects more of you, too. Unless you're familiar with Renaissance Europe, and have a more than passing acquaintance with the Arthurian legends, you'll find many of the references obtuse. But for the rest of us, Caroline Stevermer has given us a rich world full of memorable characters, and my only disappointment is that the book was too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"try something else of hers","review":"There's no doubt Stevermer can write some eloquent prose, however, her ability to keep a story interesting falters in several places in this book. It took a short while for me to get into the book and start liking it, and it was a good story for half, until she threw in her major plot twist which I feel disrupted a more interesting story. By the last few chapters I was speed reading just to find out how it finished. I have hopes that her style might yet yield a better book from her, but I don't think I'll try another Stevermer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good toy","review":"I bought this toy for my daughters 2nd Birthday.

The mat could be ripped up by rough handling, but it is quite durable and lots of dance fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good dance mat but Barney should not come off","review":"We bought this toy for our 16 month old because he loves music and he loves Barney. The toy is a great hit with both our 4 year old and 16 month old. However Barney comes off the toy too easy. We have not had a problem that Barney falls off on his own however if the baby goes to touch Barney or hug him than he comes out of the socket.

My 2 year old loved this toy, but since Barney doesn't stay put (or deflated), it made her upset, so we ended up throwing it out.

Marinoff does not suggest that philosophers replace psychologists or, as the title of his most popular book claims, that Plato can replace Prozac. What he does say, however, is that philosophy ought to be mined by people interested in figuring out how to live their lives in a more balanced and ethical way. Unfortunately, the book is not as good as it may have been, due to Marinoff's trademark abrasive style, which takes the form of unnecessary (and very long) rants against other professions and the very same academia from which Marinoff receives a stable job and good benefits. Talk about not biting the hands that feeds you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome addition to my Breau collection.","review":"I found this CD intriguing for several reasons. A.)

And the trick ehre is interesting; Fuguet takes the structure of a noted director (can't remember who, because my brain is swiss cheese; Elia Kazan?)'s autobiography and turns it into the story of a family trying to make it. The beginning works very well, being a series of emails between the narrator and someone he met on a plane about why he's decided to simply abandon his career and sit in a Los Angeles hotel room writing this, and the structure is intriguing, but beauty is only skin-deep. Once you scratch beneath the surface, you find another Oprah's Book Club candidate ripe for the plucking, a dysfunctional family with no qualities to make it stand out from the rest of the dysfunctional family pack so popular in today's publishing world.If you like dysfunctional family novels, this will probably be right up your alley.

Leave it to Poirot to discover the true culprit by questioning each of them about their bridge-playing methods.This book does not follow the typical Christie method and has fewer characters than usual, making it more difficult to provide necessary clues while concealing the mystery of the person who committed the deed. As usual, it has fast-paced dialogue which moves the story along nicely and multiple twists at the end.Christie is #1."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a ride!","review":"Finally, Meredith's story, and is it ever a good one. If you've been keeping up with Kay David's Operative series, then you know these books are no ordinary Superromances.

I highly recommend this book and the whole series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't just be me","review":"I got this when I began teaching myself to decorate cakes... I thought this would be an invaluable tool. This was not the case...The wire does more to push, pull and crumble the cake than just cut in a straight line. Every time I try to use this, I have a mini panic attack, thinking I'm going to ruin my cake.I do much better with a long bread knife. My cuts are cleaner and smoother. I thought perhaps when I started, I just didn't know what I was doing, but I have since revisited this tool of destruction and all attempts ended the same. I have no idea what to do to make this work. I've given up on it and decided to stick with my trusty bread knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I was so excited to get this because it is diffcult to make a cake completely level. I thought it would make it easier. It didn't. The handle is too small which makes it hard to get any sort of force behind the lame wire that is supposed to cut cake. It simply rubs up against the edge of the cake and makes more of a crumbly mess that cut anything. A waste of money. This went into the trash after 5 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the cash","review":"I bought the wilton brand cutter, and like other reviewers, had similar experiences.1. The wire often doesn't cut into the cake round , and I often have to start it with a knife cut.2. The wire does flex, which means you don't get a good, stable cut. I've often had to go right behind and re-level the cake after a pass with the wire cutter.3. If there's any crusting on the side edges of the cake, it will tear out whole chunks as the wire passes through it. Even when you hold your hand over the sides to keep it from doing major damage, it still tears and crumbs.I'm of the opinion of others here who've stated they've returned to their knives, which do a much better job. The cake leveler might work better if you're cutting into a hot cake, but it surely doesn't work on a cooled down one. Skip this and all similar products and instead invest in a good knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The wire simply refuses to stay taught in the small grooves especially as you move it higher.

The songlist, save for Burnin' the Floor, Matsuri Japan, Afronova, Afronova Primeval, and B4U, was pathetic, IMO. Plus, I noticed a 1/4 second lag between myself hitting the arrow and the game registering it. Could be that the disc was scratched. Is it supposed to do that?

Still, the movie is remarkable and worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Something","review":"While I appreciate the talent and beauty of Ms Gerrard's voice, I find this \\"soundtrack\\" to be missing an essential piece, in that it doesn't contain any of the Maori chanting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whale rider - original score? - I'm not so sure.","review":"I recently rented the movie Whale Rider, and shortly into it became aware that the main atmospheric motif, (a kind of ambient piano riff) was in fact lifted hook line and sinker from track four of an album entitled 'Waiting for Cousteau' that was released in 1990 by Jean Michel Jarre.The instrumentation, production and melody are identical, and unsurprisingly the interview with Lisa Gerrard on the DVD failed to include any reference to the earlier recording as an influence.The other tracks on the Whale Rider CD/DVD bear no such resemblance and are nice evocative pieces of the subject of the movie. It's a nice easy listen, but any owners of Waiting for Cousteau out there might lift their eyebrows a little when the main theme comes over the stereo....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty but ...if you are waiting for her voice","review":"Is a good sountrack,but I miss her voice, because is a diva for me, but if you want to listen her, buy another CD,this is not like the others and her voice... is not here, but is peaceful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Beautiful","review":"This is a beautiful soundtrack to go with one of the best movies I have ever seen. Paikeas Whale, Waka in the Sky, They Came to Die, and Empty Water are worth the CD by themselves.This soundtrack never fails to move me. If you are a fan of Lisa Gerrards work you wont be disappointed, she comes through as usual with her soul-stirring vocals.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent while driving","review":"This music represents the passions of struggle and commitment as protrayed in the movie. It uses the mystical sounding shell flute, and invokes feelings of compassion and mystery. If you're able to appreciate new age instrumentals, then this albulm is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"well made light should last a long time","review":"lights seem to be well built. hd construction and bolted together where it counts. i dont see the knobs that keep the light from tilting lasting long so i plan to replace with a wingnut. cages are a little bit of a pain to get on during assembly but go on good and tight. comes with extra light and holder mounted to the front of the light which is a nice feature. the lights only tilt 1 way from factory. depending on which way you install the base it will only tilt up or down. easy fix tho just grind the tops of the base brackets where they mount to the light until they are rounded and good to go. the wide angle is good for after dark pong and cornhole for the cookouts. for the price they are great lights and i would order again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandino, Nicaragua's Nationalist Guerrilla","review":"Outstanding book. Excellent historical account of General Sandino and the genesis of the nationalist struggle in Nicaragua. A little vague on the extent of American commercial interest the US Marines were sent to protect. This book should be read by anyone looking to understand guerrilla warfare. Espcially useful in paralleling combat tactics used by the viet-cong or any nationalist insurgency. Should be required reading for all troopers headed to advise against the FARC and ELN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor AM reception","review":"I'll admit, this radio looks neat, has decent sound for its size, and the FM reception is good. However, I could pull in virtually no AM stations without physically touching the antenna, and the stations I did get were not as clear as expected. In the photos of this product, the tuning knobs appear to be metallic, they are not. for $100, I expected better."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK radio for listening to music, way too much bass for news","review":"I bought this radio at Target for $59.99 (they sell the black color model only). It has a good analog FM tuner and I like the retro look. However, the \\"surround sound\\" feature actually resulted in a somewhat muffled sound in our kitchen. But my major complaint is that there is way too much bass for listening to news, which is what I do most of the time (NPR) -- and there is no bass adjustment. It is probably a decent radio for listening to music, but for my purposes it was unacceptable. I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"straightforward","review":"I use this DVD on days I just want focused pilates ab work. While it is a whole-body routine, I don't consider it one of those \\"complete workouts\\" like the ones where you will get some cardio, strength and cool-down all in one. This one is calm and focused...I think of it more as a supplement to my fitness regimine but not a crucial part. That is not to say that this DVD isn't difficult; you will definitely feel this one the next day. It's great for what it is but not meant to be a DVD for weight loss as the name would suggest. But get it if you want to have a really strong, flat stomach.Bonus: there is a storter routine included that is only about 15 minutes and there is even an audio version of it to take with you anywhere...pretty convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for intermediate level!","review":"After two years of consistently working out, I was starting to get bored with my usual handful of pilates and yoga DVDs. I received \\"Maintenance Pilates for Weight Loss\\" this past Christmas, and look out! This is a pretty tough 30 minute routine. Ana is great at cue-ing, but does move quickly (so beware!). Even though I like to consider myself pretty fit, my muscles were shaking during some of the moves so I knew I was really working. It's tough, but I'm looking forward to working at it until I can look as smooth and fluid as Ana does when she performs the exercises.As a side note, my mom (who has never done pilates before) tried doing this DVD with me and it was way too advanced for her. I loaned her my beginner DVDs to work with until she tries this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but defective.","review":"I bought this ring along with another smoky quartz ring from the same vendor. This ring fit nicely, but the large stone was chipped, scratched and had numerous bubbles in it. The silver is 'heavy' looking, not delicate. The other ring had to go back because it was simply HUGE, and I didn't want something that big, but it was in excellent condition. It sat a good half an inch above the top of my finger and the stone was as wide. This ring was also big, but not overly so. Neither appeared like good quality rings but then for these prices, you can't really expect top quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garnet ring disappoints","review":"The ring I received had several scratches on the big stone and the side stones were lighter in color and didn't match. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the small stone color.","review":"I was disappointed in the color of the 6 small garnet stones surrounding the large center stone. The small garnets are very light in color, like a blush. I am having my local jeweler replace them with fire garnets to match the center stone. Had I known of the color variation, I would not have purchased this ring. The photo on the internet does not represent the true color of the garnets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful ring, better than picture","review":"This picture does not do this ring justice. The ring sparkles in every light but it sits low on the hand so that the prong don't get caught on things like hair and treads from cloths. The color of the stones match my high quality garnet necklace perfectly, but I didn't have to spend tons of money to get that quality. This ring is worth so much more that what I paid for it. It was a wonderful buy and I only wish I had purchased it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't remember.","review":"I really don't remember buying this... or why I bought it.

But, even purchased as the spinoff console version, I still expected (and hoped) the gameplay to somewhat fall inline with the traditonal 'battlefield' gameplay and mechanics I fell in love with on the PC. I would consider this title for dedicated fans of the modern warfare genre who intend to play this exclusivly on LIVE. If you're looking for a co-op or offline multi-player look elsewhere.

It seems like an ok single player game, but who really likes to do that? Everyone wants to play online. Except in this game, you really can't. All that has been happening to me so far, is that I have problems signing on, I lose my connection halfway through a game, and it when I can play, it doesn't keep my stats. All in all, if you want a decent single player game, this might be for you. If you want to play online, send me 50 bucks, I'll send you Halo 2, and we will both be happy.

Clarke spends the majority of the book discussing the basics: what to expect from different varities of wine, and what to expect from the various geographical regions where wine is produced. He spends little time on specific labels (although he does offer a few suggestions), so if you are looking for a buying guide this is not your book. It does not go into much depth, but it does a fine job of covering the subject in a light, engaging manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, useful primer","review":"This is a brief, breezy three-part primer for the aspiring wine aficionado; liberally splashed with color photos of wine, wine country, food to eat with wine and Clarke with a glass in his hand.First he discusses wine flavors, what to buy and from where, according to pocketbook.

Not even close!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Norah Jones","review":"Norah Jones' sound is very haunting and it really made me take pause when I heard a clip played on CNN. I instantly became a big fan. I like the fact that the music seems to be sort of a Jazz / Country hybrid that's very moody and soothing. I'm glad to say that I became a fan before I realized that she is the daughter of Ravi Shankar. I am a huge Ravi fan but that had no influence on my liking Norah's music. I look forward to hearing more from this young artist! It would be sort of neat if she and her sister Anoushka recorded something together. Hhhmmm, Jazz/Country/Sitar music... Why not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i can live with norah jones on the radio","review":"norah jones seems to be sparking some controversy with her debut album 'come away with me.' The first time i heard her on late night t.v. i was very impressed with her smooth jazz style...not to mention her looks. i have read a few negative reviews about her, and i disagree with the comments of 'just another person jumping on the bandwagon' of the rejuvinated jazz scene. the album offers a relaxing, very slow-paced, even romantic feel to it. Now all the harsh critics who are not giving her a chance, i ask you to reconsider. Bare in mind, this is ms. jones' first album, and the potential is there for her to become a great musicain. i agree, she is not reached greatness yet, but her jazz roots and mellow voice will prevail over time. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Example of SACD","review":"My rating of 2 stars applies to the SACD version of this record and not the CD. I consider the CD to be a 5 star recording. After carefully listening to both the two channel SACD mix and the CD stereo versions I could not discern an audible difference. I enjoyed the 5.1 mix and found the rear surround to be tasteful and subtle, not at all distracting, but, again, no significant improvement in detail except that created by spreading the sound around to five channels. A recent article on the \\"Stereophile\\" website suggests that the SACD mix in fact shares the same 16 bit lineage as the CD, which would explain why the two channel mix and the CD mix sound identical. Norah's label has cheated its customers with this one and should go back and do an actual DSD mix and replace these \\"CDs\\" for free or give us our money back. There is no reason to purchase this SACD in addition to or in lieu of the CD unless you are interested in listening to a standard resolution 5.1 mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice like honey","review":"This album is so romantic and soothing.

Her soft, silky but strong voice carries this low-key album across musical genres in rare form. It's groovy enough to be jazz. It's catchy enough to be pop. It's accessable enough to enjoyed by almost everyone.Reminicent of music heard in many a fine piano/jazz establishment, this is not the kind of album that warrants intense, purposeful listening. It's humble, mininalist mentality and spartan sound are its beauty, making it perfect for grabbing a warm cup of coffee, a good book (or a friend), and enjoying a quiet evening together.She's surrounded herself by great musicians and producers, so judging by her debut, we'll be able to expect great things from Ms. Jones as she, like fine wine, improves with age. COME AWAY WITH ME comes highly recommended to those seeking a pitch-perfect album with which to unwind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come Away with Me","review":"Can she sing? Yes! However, not in the mode of a Billie Holiday or an Anita Baker. This is not Jazz, but Folk. Ms. Jones has no vocal range and little interpretability of the lyrics. Nothing exciting here. Nothing innovative. Nothing plus nothing equals nothing. She is just another pretty face. The ears don't lie -- she is just an average singer with a great promoter. This CD will not stand the test of time. Guarantee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Norah needs to live a little","review":"I was very disappointed with this artist. I don't even think she is a jazz singer in the true sense. This record and its selections are flat. The artist lacks shading, nuances in her vocal presentation. Could it be she has to live a little, learn a little before she can take her place with the great jazz female vocalists who preceded her? Yeah! the voice is clear but needs developing. Compare her to a young Sarah Vaughan or Carmen McRae, even Peggy Lee and you'll hear there's nothing to her first CD. I am 70 yrs old and was born and grew up in Harlem. I've seen and heard the greatest vocalists at the Apollo Theatre and other clubs, music halls etc.,in New York."},{"rating":"1","title":"This won Grammy awards?!","review":"I was lured into downloading this album by hearing the song Don't Know Why on the radio. Honestly, after track two, I couldn't find any more songs that even compare to Don't Know Why! And yes, I listened to the whole album! Now, why did this win so many grammys?! Was it the pretty face on the cover? Was it the fact that she plays piano? This album reminds me of music played in the ocean liner ballroom during the opening scene of \\"Ghostship\\"!

That's right, chief: pop your blue pill and tell yourself you're the man, but for god sake, find something ELSE besides this bland collection to play. Go with Chet Baker, Nat King Cole, or the aforementioned Holliday and Fitzgerald - you'll have a better soundtrack for lovin', trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzled by the Excitment","review":"I purchased this CD based on reviews that Norah Jones was the next great up and coming female jazz singer, who sang beyond her years. I was in for a huge disappointment! Most of the songs sound like soft country tunes, rather than jazz reditions. Her voice is breathy (trying to sound like Diana Krall), but weak. Most of the arrangements are average at best. If you are looking for a jazz singer try Diana Krall first, then Jane Monheith or Tierney Sutton. Norah needs to go back to school, brush up on technique, and try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhh...","review":"I simply don't get how on earth this singer gained so much popularity. With her 'average at best' voice, painfully dull and mediocre arrangements, lyrics that say a whole lot of nothing (most of which she doesn't even write)...what is there to like? And what clown ever classified her as a jazz singer? She's really closer to worn out dive bar singer at remote casino on an Indian reservation somewhere.

If you could call an album a classic, it would be this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"JillBBev","review":"Every Grammy Norah Jones recieved for this album was won hands down. Never have I enjoyed a collection of songs on one CD as I have with this.The writing, music, and lyrics put one into another dimension. It is a rare thing when an artist can produce a collection such as this. Any of my friends who have heard this CD when driving in my car goes out to purchace it the same day or next day after hearing it. Norah Jones is just plain magnificant in each and every piece.There is not one cut for which I do not care for.Hopefully her next work will be as wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muzak for the Y-generation","review":"Thin, bland instrumentals with monotonous arrangements that don't seem to accompany Norah Jones so much as just happen to be playing while she's singing. Her voice has an interesting, appealing quality that is not very effectively supported or shown off. The mixing seemed unbalanced with her voice too prominent like she was singing in your ear while the band was playing out on the patio. I think a triple shot espresso might have help her near comatose delivery. Did no one noticed during the recording of this album that a collection of elevator music was being produced? The multi-channel track of the sacd version was horribly mixed. Was everything below 80 hz intentionally left out? I gave this album 2 stars instead of 1 because it is better than Brittany Spears. I've listened several times to see what I missed that maked this Grammy material. I can't figure it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learning to Krall","review":"22? You bet. Real jazz artists take it slow for effect -- think Lady Day playing catch up to the beat or Jimmy Scott stretching meaning and melody until they nearly break. Norah takes everything at a snail's pace because she obviously still needs her training wheels. The voice is nice, but the songs are mostly empty, and the monotony of the mood and pace are deadly. Of course the Eva Cassidy set will eat this up, but fans of real jazz and real romance are advised to move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the mark with lack of versatility","review":"Ok... I wrote one of these before, and I guess I want to explain my point.I think this could have been a really good CD if Norah had bothered to stretch her voice a little bit more and pick more exciting or even remotely interesting material. From start to finish, you get the same chords, arrangements, and vocal emotion. Even her upbeat moments are spent dragging her and her listeners down.Having said all that, I can move on to the music. Don't know why is the absolute best track on the CD. In listening to it, you get the gist of the CD from start to finish. However, if you feel the need to listen to something else, Come Away with me is pretty pleasant as well.I cannot in good faith say anything else good about this really BORING disc. How it won the grammys it did will always befuddle me, in much the same fashion as the ALICA KEYS is better than INDIA.ARIE debacle, but that's another issue entire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is the worst cd I have ever listened to in my whole life. I listened to it after she won mutliple grammy's and was amazed that this cd even won one. She does not write her own lyrics for her songs nor her music. This cd is a complete waste of time and I feel sorry for al souls who beleive this is a good cd. Her voice is absolutely horrendous and the melody in all the songs is pretty much the same, along with her continuous monotone voice. I wasted part of my life by listening to this cd. I feel as though I am a stupider person having listened to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"Norah Jones has a lovely voice. Really. And you get to hear that voice in the same tonal range and at about the same tempo for song after song after song. \\"Don't Know Why\\" is, by far, the most interesting song on the record and, frankly, I don't know why she didn't do more like it or at least vary the overall color of some of the rest of the record.I'll be visiting the local \\"CD Swap\\" with this one very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Armagaddon Come Quickly","review":"How I ponder the state of the world for it is surely near the end. The time is right for the antichrist to reign. The henchmen of darkness gathered in their gloomy abode chuckle at the ease with which the masses are stoned. To prove their point, one omonous devil reveals a scheme so daring it surely could not succeed. \\"My brothers, this will break all the rules, for I can prove humans are complete fools.\\" \\"I have an artist, boring and stail, who I will promote along a golden grammy trail\\". As the music plays, the demons howl. \\"Surely, our power is great, but people are not so stupid to make this artist's fate\\". Alas, they were wrong. The ignorant masses lead like sheep bought into this artist who induces sleep. Yes, it is the twighlight of civilization to be sure. The devil laughs as the aweful jazzy music drones, for they made fools of all who bought into Nora Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Know Why You Like This Song","review":"Puke, puke, puke. Can you hear me puke. This is 100% rectum. Her dull voice bodes poorly with the cheesy backing music. Sounds like a bad night club singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go away from it...","review":"...boring, too hyped. Even at malls it puts to sleep. Same notes over and over again. Get couple of beers instead at your local pub watching football..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!","review":"Do not listen to this CD on a rainy day. You are likely to get very depressed. This is not a jazz CD. It is more like a Country and Blues CD. No diversity in the album whatsoever. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing","review":"Once more, I find it amazing how you put a cute girl behind the microphone, let her breathe in a supposed sexy and sultry voice some superficial words and how massive success comes.Even worse, the music is not pop music, but muzak, and they absurdly call this jazz !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come away with me","review":"I saw Norah when she first performed on TV with Willie Nelson and friends, I was floored by her voice and piano talent collectively.It was oddly enough Emmy Lou Harris @ 22, mixed with a touch of Patsy Cline, and a small dose of Bonnie Raitt. Incredible!! Can't wait for the nest CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern Woman in Search of a Soul","review":"A bright and shining piece of mediocrity, well produced but shallow and emotionally constrained. The kind of pointless superficially impressive fluff used in demonstrations at audio shows and the like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come Away With Me - Nora Jones","review":"My friend bought this CD, and let me listen to it. I can't believe how horribly raspy her voice was. She does not put any emotion into her voice atall, and she turns the song into a drone. My advice is to not buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly Overrated Fluff","review":"You've got to wonder about the Grammy awards when a lightweight piece of fluff like this wins in a major category. Maybe Norah Jones's whispery little-girl voice works for all the budding dirty old men out there, but to me it is the stimulus to see how quickly I can change the station. In my opinion, this young woman's breathy mewing is as irritating as nails screeching down a blackboard. Her future lies in doing voice-over promos for children's television shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Such Style!","review":"When I first heard a tiny clip of Norah Jones voice on a television newscast about the grammies, I told my husband that I have to find out who that enchanting, smooth and tonal voice belongs to. I had never even heard of her prior to that time.As soon as I heard the name of the artist, I ordered my Norah Jones CD from Amazon. This music has gotten into my soul. I hum her tunes constantly. I even wake up in the middle of the night with her songs on my mind.I like all the songs on this CD, but my favorites are, \\"Come Away With Me,\\" \\"Don't Know Why,\\" \\"Cold, Cold Heart,\\" and \\"Turn Me On.\\"The lady has got style! I'm glad I bought this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED THIS CD","review":"This CD is probably one of my favorites of all the CD's this year. It's cool and mellow. Perfect for relaxing to. Norah Jones has an amazingly beautiful voice. It is haunting, and sublime. it will be stuck in your head all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Velvet Voice","review":"This album is the perfect music for the end of a stressful day. It evokes a mood of cocktails on the beach at sunset! Her voice is simply gorgeous, and her musical style & phrasing is beyond her years. Don't know where she came from, but I can't wait to see what she puts out next! Destined to become a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great female vocalist","review":"So the first track, \\"Don't Know Why\\", is all over the radio now. I even noticed it in the background of a \\"Smallville\\" episode. That song is why I bought the album and, thankfully, I love the rest it too! I was surprised to hear her jazz voice on a pop station. If pop music is your thing, be careful, there's a soft country element to some of these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful pipes for such a young lady","review":"I just love this CD especially the song \\"come away with me\\" it is such a romantic/free song. Don't so much like the following CD she did with the heavier country tinge, I love her sound when its closer to Billie Holiday & reminiscent of a smokey intimate jazz/blues club. She is so very talented,& beautiful on the inside & out, I have a soft spot for this CD & so many of the songs recorded on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good job norah","review":"if you like fiona apple, tori amos or other artists of the kind, this may make a nice addition to your collection though it has more of a country-jazzy sound to it"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent debut","review":"This album is appreciated by my 11 and 15 year old daughters, my ex (grin) husband (oh, he's a jazz musician!) and me, your atypical 42 music lover. I think Norah shows a great deal of potential and this disc is very lyrical. I'd recommend it to anyone into Diana Krall or Shirley Horn. We play it to mellow out - even the country influences work. I hope her next CD has a bit more blues and we all can't wait to see her in concert"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising treat","review":"During my weekly trek ... I spy a new music listening station devoted to \\"New Women's Releases\\". Intrigued I listen to several selections on the same old Celine Dion, Alannis etc & then I pick up Norah Jones. I was really surprised her music was released because it's not 'poppy sounding' like Michelle Branch or Vanessa Carlton, who have become popular as of late and it's not like Shakira or Britney. She had a voice that drew me in. It reminded me of listening to old records of Billie Holiday with my grandparents on a rainy Saturday night. I grabbed the CD up right away. I admit I am a jazz & blues fan but you don't have to be to enjoy this music. Her voice is so different & sounds much more mature than her years. I hope Norah has success & starts a trend towards what I hope the future of music holds: talented musicians. Imagine that!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An all around beautiful CD/artist!","review":"I just so happened to stumble upon Norah Jones while watching her performance on the David Letterman Show, and I fell in love with her music immediately. This is a great CD for those who are waiting for Sarah McLachlan's next album since Norah's beautiful voice and piano playing reminds me so much of Sarah (at least in my opinion!) Norah's sound is a bit more soulful and jazzy, and it's absolutely beautiful. This CD is great lounge music...very cool to listen to if you've set aside a day to just relax and, yes, lounge around! Norah Jones is just one of those artists who you are so glad you've found in your record store and you just know she'll have an amazing career...this CD is a must for any fan of Sarah or anyone looking for a great CD to listen to after a long day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft As A Warm Summer Breeze...","review":"Nora Jones has a voice that just melts the heart. It is as sweet as a Godiva Chocolate. Her voice is, to this reviewer, strangely reminisent of the 1970's singer Maria Muldar: soft and light.This daughter of sitar and Indian music expert Ravi Shankar has clearly learned the art of working the words of a tune. Who would have thought that the Hank Williams tune \\"Cold Cold Heart\\" could ever sound right without a nasal twang? Jones has taken the song in a whole different direction...and done so with grace.This is a woderful and delightful work. Hopefully there will be many more releases from this talented performer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Voice that's Incredible!","review":"Norah Jones, who I believe is Ravi Shankar's daughter, has one ofthe most beautiful voices I have heard in a long time, and she makes it seem so easy to sing like she does! When I put this CD on, I have to listen to the whole thing, because it's that good- She is definitely headed for great things in the music world! I highly recommend any of her CDs of the two that I have heard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great smooth album.","review":"Get it...listen...turn down the lights...grab your sweetheart...light the fire...cozy up...what a warm wonderful album. Can't wait to see the future of this star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps not...","review":"I bought this CD and while I found it mildly enjoyable - it is hardly deserving of the effusive reviews nor is Miss. Jones to be compared to Billie Holiday. She lacks the sophisticated improvisations, versatility, and interpretative talent of a true jazz musician. While she is certainly talented her delivery is uninspired at best.I understand that this is her first album and perhaps her potential will be developed on future releases or perhaps not...At any rate, I've put aside this CD since I found it disappointing and have taken refuge in the exceptional talents of her label mate - Cassandra Wilson....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arresting","review":"Although Norah Jones is young, she is an extremely talented artist. I received my first Norah Jones cd as a mother's day present--what a wonderful gift!!! Her music is absolutely arresting--I was captivated before the cd even finished! I now own all her CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and lovely","review":"Love listening to her voice. So beautiful! Definitely one of my favorite singers! Her music always has a story...and I can always relate with them! I never get tired of listening to her! Another great artist liker her I would say is Selah ReesSelah ReesAnd I love her sound too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEET WITH AN EDGE!","review":"Sexy and romantic. This record is for all age groups. Her voice is incredible and the song sellection is excellent. If you like Eva Cassidy you will love Nora Jones. A must have for any music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best of 2002","review":"Simply Put One of the Best Albums of 2002. Norah Jones \\"Come Away with Me\\" is one album u can listen to from beginning to end without skipping tracks. Her Voice is so silky and smooth. A must own album for anyone who loves good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"Because Norah Jones's voice is disarmingly calm and cool, it is difficult to NOT enjoy this music. Her voice is very pretty, and her piano playing is at least adequate (sorry, but it's not that difficult). Nonetheless, the kicker is \\"Cold Cold Heart,\\" which I'm sure Hank Williams never expected would be treated like this. \\"Come Away with Me\\" and \\"Don't Know Why\\" best exemplify her ability to not put too much power into a song and yet still have the emotional aspects come through loud and clear. Definitely recommended for those who want a bridge between pop and jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Over-hyped","review":"I don't see what all the fuss is about, to me the only good tracks on the CD are \\"Don't Know Why\\" and \\"I've Got To See You Again\\". In my book a CD with only 2 good tracks is nothing to brag about. I think Diana Krall is a far better choice in this music style."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Love her voice. Love the music. Great to listen to in the car and I'm in the car a lot. Can't wait for another CD from Norah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice voice but Jazz/Blues? I think not.","review":"For those who expected the style to be Jazz/Blues/Country will likely find the tendency to more country. Not my taste. At times he voice is a little raspy and bluesy but there is distinct \\"twang\\" that stands out in her voice along with the requistie country steel guitar. Overall, I do like her voice but the combination of a lackluster music selection and a definite country slant just doesn't work for me. Comparison to Diana Krall are inappropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Listening","review":"Norah has a wonderful voice and the arrangements of these tracks are carefully done...not over orchestrated at all. Good job; good album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I bought this CD expecting big things from Norah Jones. It is a boring CD. Except for the \\"Don't Know Why\\" track, the rest are a waste. If Jazz is your thing, you will like it. I could have bought the CD single instead for the one song. Don't waste your time! Stripped and Justified are better CDs!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the straight-ahead Jazz or Blues Fan","review":"I would call it more \\"soft country\\" than a Jazz album. I listened to it a few times, and sold it, as every song sounded the same. Norah can't compare to Eva Cassidy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated...","review":"Norah Jones is very overrated. So is this cd. I only gave it two stars because there are two good songs..\\"Come Away With Me\\" and \\"Don't know why\\". I don't understand why she won a grammy. I know she is a jazz singer, but her music is so bland. I mean you can be a jazz singer with some funk and personality. Look at Billie Holiday. Well I don't recommend this album..all the songs sound almost exactly alike. Buy Alicia keys \\"Songs in A minor\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but she's just another pop voice","review":"I'm always on the lookout and hoping for a young representive for the classic standards. After hearing pretty Ms. Jones I have to admit I was very disappointed. The voice is mature I'll warrant you. It's old beyond it's years!! It appears to be wrecked! She presents a song (esp. Nearness of You) with a breathiness that she must think passes for style. Hopefully, she'll stick to the pop stuff and leave the standards alone. She really doesn't know what she's singing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious snooze-fest","review":"Norah Jones introduces us to seven dwarves for the new milennium - this album is sleepy, samey, insipid, boring, mediocre, overrated, and derivative.Oh, and by the way, it's most definitely NOT JAZZ.Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought Norah Jones","review":"\\"Come Away with Me\\" was a big disappointment. All the songs sound the same; there is no change in rhythm, tempo, voice range or piano composition. One song seems suspiciously similar to one by Leonard Cohen, with just a few of the words changed. I hope I can sell this CD. Although Norah is a sultry beauty, her talents in voice and piano leave much to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This review is just a reply to the review of The Grouchy Reviewer. For a person who likes Kylie Minogue you shouldn't even bother writing a review for Norah. Her CD is just great, any person with a little bit of taste would agree. No offence to other Kylie Minogue fans, but only mentally challenged people would call her CD a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mellow Macy Gray?","review":"This is a very enjoyable, easy-listening CD. I like it a lot.... I [feel like] she sounds like Macy Gray singing jazzy and country-ish (and some combined) ballads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, BAD Compact Disk","review":"So I really like Norah Jones and liked the songs on this CD. It is the CD quality that is unacceptable. I bought the CD from Amazon and it skipped/made unusual noises as the CD played (I tried four different CD players - obviously not a player problem). I returned that copy and Amazon sent me a new one. That did the same thing and would not even play in my car CD player - IT'S NOT A REAL CD, but rather is some fake. I retured that copy and am out shippling costs. Bah!Very disappointed with Amazon for selling such a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozefest 2003","review":"Oh c'mon now, you know this is so tired. Album should have been titled \\"Songs for Middle-Aged Yuppies Who Think They're Hip.\\" Throw this in the bargain bin along with Lou Bega and Eiffel 65 CDs. I \\"don't know why\\" this got as much attention as it has, certainly unworthy of all the Grammy wins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Hype","review":"I have to admit. I only listened to her album because of her Grammy wins. Her jazz is really nothing extraordinary and all the songs sound flat. Her voice is pretty monotonous too. If I could give this album \\"no stars\\", I would. Her music gives me a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the fuss about????","review":"I find Norah Jones vocals to be boring at best. My daughters had more exciting voices when they were 6. It amazes and saddens me to see someone like Norah Jones have the record sales she does, while singers like Debelah Morgan with an unbelievable voice fade into obscurity. But then, with \\"singers\\" like 50 Cent leading in record sales as well, I guess I shouldn't be so surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norah is a waste!","review":"\\"Come Away With Me\\" the debut album for a singer who cannot even carry a tune! I have always wondered why she won all those Grammies. Her voice is so dull and boring! She looks boring. Boring Norah for a boring album. I'm glad she's easily forgotten and her second offering sounds corny as well. I'll throw her up in the lines of the very plaintive and annoying Alicia Keys! Go get Nelly Furtado instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Dont Knoow Why I didn't buy a different cd....","review":"Ugh...if you need to sleep, need a lullaby, then here you go. norah Jones has NO, I mean NO, vocal range! She stays on one raspy note in her raspy, ANNOYING voice!\\"Seven Years\\" would have made me cry...if sung by someone with vocal talent. I'm 14 and can sing better than her!If you want GREAT music, check out Michelle branch's \\"Hotel Paper,\\" which I'm listening to as I write.DON'T LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snorah Jones","review":"Bland, derivitive, unispired, underwhelming, no passion, no emotion, a waste of resources. And those are the good points of this piece of garbage. She butchered Cold Cold Heart, and for that should be banned from Texas, and from ever recording again. Someone please book her another gig at the second rate hotel lounge where she belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Jazz Singer?!","review":"When I first heard this CD, I knew nothing of Norah Jones. My first impression was that she sounded like a teeny-bopper country music [hopeful]. I still don't understand why the word \\"jazz\\" is so frequently mentioned when referring to her style/voice. I personally did not like her voice or this CD AT ALL. I'm glad I didn't buy it, but I still feel sorry for my friend who wasted her money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"justwhatweneed","review":"just what we need, another disgraceful atempt as slowmo jazz, the dammedest thing is her father is a music VIRTUOSE. Comes as proof she is not hereditarily gifted.This is filling empty spaces with more emptyness and consuming dear dear silence.My thoughts: this CD is overall something else for insomniacs."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did it ever get published?","review":"Very disapointed. I should have sent it back for a refund, instead I put it with several others and sold it at a garage sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"good CD","review":"this CD is smooth and sensual with jazzy piano and guitar throughout and a calmness in her voice and the instruments combined. This is calm, soft rock music that is a rare find today that one can relax too, some say it's for the adult audiences, but I feel it is for everyone and that's probably why it won grammys. It would be nice if she put in some indian music influences in her future records to show pride in her heritage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Album by an Innovative Singer","review":"I am charmed by this album by Norah Jones. This CD was so good, jazz songstress Diana Krall copied it's style in her newest CD called \\"Girl in the Other Room\\"... and it can't come close to this, the original. Jones is sultry, spicy, but never dull. She can pour emotion into a song with great style and remain her own woman. I like this one and recommend it highly. Accept NO substitutes if this is your kind of music.. this is the best of the crop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is probably the most relaxing music I have purchased in a very long time. Her voice is beautiful, the lyrics (from most of her own songs) are mellow, and the music is mesmerizing. Enjoy a nice bottle of wine with this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold on to what you have...","review":"When I heard the first release,(Don't know why) I was absolutly amazed. Then I learned Norah was a 22 year-old piano major from Texas. What?!! Every time I listen to this awesome collection of music, I'm see myself in a comfortable, smokey piano bar watching a breathtaking talent singing about the same way I feel. Norah is a tell it like it is, natural entertainer, who has a gift for soothing the mind and soul. The arrangment is fluid, a bit redundant, but if you want to be relaxed, and listen to an angel tell her tale, get this cd. Norah, like fine wine, will only get better with age. I'd love to see her live. I believe she would show us her true prowess, free to play and sing how she sees fit. She gets my vote for this year's best new TRUE talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Pleasant!","review":"She has such a beautiful voice, each song sang with emotion and grace. Her voice reminds me of Emmylou Harris and Carol King. An interesting blend of folk, jazz, and a little country without sounding hokey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful -- in parts","review":"Norah Jones' fragile-sounding voice, combined with the spare piano, guitar and bass arrangements, make the best tracks on this CD really shine. Her rendition of \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" will remind you more of Billie Holiday than Hank Williams. The opening track, \\"Don't Know Why\\" is especially haunting. The problem with this album is that it is uneven. Some of the songs are just not very arresting, despite the appeal of Norah Jones'stunning voice. Still, it's enjoyable listening and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Went Away With Norah","review":"The buzz started a few weeks ago...and then there was much press about SXSW in Austin and Norah Jones always seemed to be high up in the articles. Now that I've heard the album, I can understand why!Many have compared her style to Nina Simone, et al...I first went to the stylings of Holly Cole and her relaxed, soulful approach. The entire album is a treat - from her original songs to the covers. The players are wonderful too...Adam Levy sounds so much like Bill Frisell that I had to look at the notes (Frisell appears on another track).The sparse production is just right....how could she go wrong with Arif Mardin? I look forward to following her what-is-going-to-be a long and illustrious career!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant CD","review":"Just as I was losing faith in the music industry, along comes Norah Jones on the Blue Note label. Rare is it to find a Blue Note recording in the Pop bins at your local music store, but that is where you can find Norah ... However, it doesn't really matter what label the music critics put on her. Norah is pure heart and soul. She is as refreshing as an evening sea breeze on the Gulf coast following a scortching-hot day. This CD deserves more than five stars. Well done, Norah! See you at the Grammys next year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too thin a voice","review":"The music's good, but Norah Jones' voice just isn't enough of a voice to listen to a whole album. It lacks timbre and depth and richness and that made it difficult for me to listen to it more than a few times. None of her renditions stayed with me past the drive into work."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this CD","review":"I recommend this CD if you like the kind of relaxing music that Norah sings. Very soothing and calming, I liked it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"this cd far surpassed my expectations.. it is a great body of work.. definately recommend.. soothing sounds.. wonderful music.. just what I wanted.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing to the soul...","review":"Classic Norah Jones with beautifully written songs that speak to your soul. This album is pure emotion and you'll find favorites that you'll return to for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD!!","review":"I first bought this CD because of the song, \\"Don't Know Why\\" as I enjoyed hearing it every time it came on the radio. After listening to this CD several times, I found that I love all of the songs. There's something about Norah Jones' style - jazzy, smokey, sometimes a bit country - whatever it is, it's perfect for work as well as home. I've turned several friends on this CD and they all love it! My husband loved it so much that I had to buy a copy of my own for work! Definitely an artist that I will follow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect too much","review":"It's funny, other people say that this wasnt what they were expecting in terms of where she came from, and I agree.This really isnt following in the footsteps of the legend of Ravi. A few musician friends said they saw her, and that she was very uninspired. I mean, for people who listen to Dildo or the like, I can imagine this being just what they've always wanted. For a daughter of Ravi Shankar, I'm very dissapointed that she took the easy way out."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzZZZzzzzz","review":"The Grammy Awards made too much out of this album. Probably because most of the Grammy Awards member voters were all old and deranged.....Norah Jones is 22, talented, but I don't like piano / jazz music. It's too boring. I fell in love with \\"Don't Know Why\\" and \\"Come Away With Me\\"....only because I hear it at the store that I work at...100 times over and over AGAIN.The rest of the record sounds like it's on repeat (like most have said on their reviews.) It's good sleepy elevator music - if you enjoy that kind. I don't.She has already recorded some new tracks that should be out by next year. Hopefully they're more up beat.... She even said that she was \\"bored of playing the same songs over each night\\" during her concerts.....I'm glad Norah and I have something in common :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"i \\"don't know why\\" this won grammys","review":"now I'm not a whining teenager or some teenybopper who loves hip hop and bubblegum music, I'm a fan of classical music, jazz, motown music and pop legends like michael jackson and madonna; and I can tell you that Norah does not have soul or depth in her music or weak vocals, and I don't know how in the world she got 5 grammys. Was it the pretty face? or was it because she sat behind a piano just like that other flash in the pan alicia keys last year? well whatever the cause, don't believe the hype and don't even waste your time on this CD. Hearing this CD was like taking sleeping pills"},{"rating":"1","title":"music for the dead","review":"Big deal. Just what is this suppose to be; music for automated systems that put you on hold? How can anybody listen to this without becoming 100% bord? I'd rather buy a sound effects CD at least there is variety there."},{"rating":"1","title":"record one song over and over and over again, you'll save $","review":"I wanted this CD so badly because I just was mesmorized by her voice and loved the music to \\"Don't Know Why\\". However, after listening to it once, I pretty much decided that it was like hearing the same song over and over and over again, to the point that I now hate this CD. I've listened to it probably about 4 times, and am anxiously awaiting to give it away. My coworkers won't let me play it because they insist that it sounds like my CD player is broken and playing the same song over and over and it puts them to sleep. Sorry Nora, you have a beautiful voice and I love the style, but can't you do a little more? So very dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"why the HYPE????","review":"This is a very overrated cd. All songs sound the same and it would make great elevator or dinner music where you just needed soft noise. Great example of a record label and awards show working to promote one artist. Maybe it was worthy of 2 grammy's but not 5 or 6. Can't tell me there aren't other good artist's out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm no jazz expert, in fact, it's not my preferred genre of choice, but I'm more into the old standards I suppose. I tried this cd from just being bombarded with \\"Don't Know Why\\" and even though there are one or two charmers on the cd, this turned out to be a major disappointment.I'm not saying that Ms. Jones isn't talented, her voice is lovely, but I expected a little more from all of the glowing reviews and praises that I had heard from everyone and their mother. It doesn't bug me that much that she didn't write many of her songs, hell, \\"Turn Me On\\" and \\"Come Away With Me\\" are the only two songs that I really like.Still, this one was a major disappointment for me. I regret not purchasing some Billie Holiday instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb musical experience","review":"This girl is simply amazing. I first heard her on the radio and I pictured an older woman because her voice is far beyond her age and her lyrics are incredibly deep. I pop this in my cd player in my car and keep it in there for days, just going through the cd over and over again. The songs are relaxing and overall satisfying throughout. The instrumentation is excellent and her voice continues to amaze me everytime I listen to it. Her lyrics suggest that she's an experienced and very intelligent young woman; it's a great cd and I'd recommend it to anyone, it's just such a pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Distinctive voice","review":"I first heard Don't Know Why over the radio - the distinctive voice of Norah Jones just stuck in my mind. After a couple of times later, I just needed to find out more about this singer.Her renditions of vocals are excellent. She lends a unique feel to songs, not the typical jazz singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful Goodness","review":"My mother Loves her voice no matter where we are, shopping, in the car, at a resturant if she hears her singing she will stop and ask me who it is that is singing. So Merry Christmas Mom! And she loved it, great smooth silky voice with bluesy bass line. Norah's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD in Years","review":"No matter what style of music you enjoy, the simplicity and mellow sound of Norah Jones is a HUGE welcome into \\"mainstream\\" music. Her entire CD is the best I have heard in years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic and beautiful","review":"Her voice is reminiscent of old jazz singers like billie holiday. delicate and soulful. the music is perfect with her voice and is very mellow.Turn off the lights, put on some candles and melt away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented Yes, But EXTREMELY Sleep Inducing!!!!","review":"Honestly, I tried to like Norah Jones's whole thing, but I am hard pressed to be interested on an ongoing basis.It's certainly NOT because of a lack of talent, nor for lack of capable musicians (she's got 'em both in spades), but the harsh truth is, her music is so monochromatic and one-dimensional, at least on disc. Doesn't she do anything besides MELLOW?These same songs, if given varying tempos and arrangements could've been very cool, but here, it's just the same danged thing over and over.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"Given what's on the market today, Norah Jones is a breath of fresh air. She doesn't have all the secrets of life at 22, but she's a good sight further down the road than some of these 18 year olds.Jones has a beautiful, smoky voice that makes this album perfect for rainy day listening. I put it on to unwind, and I must confess that I don't pay so much attention to the lyrics. Some of the song lyrics I love, like Come Away with Me and Don't Know Why, but overall the beauty of this album is in the arrangements of the melodies and the loveliness of Jones' voice, which are worth the price any day. The Nearness of You has to be one of the best versions I've heard. Truly a talent that will stick around and get better with age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refined, Elegant, Subtle","review":"I have now listened to this CD dozens of times. The music is pure and refined. Nothing in his CD sounds manufactured. Her voice and piano playing are smooth and graceful. This is music to relax to after a stressful day or to listen to while preparing dinner. There are layers to the songs that you will begin to hear after several listens. This points to the depth of the material and its lack of superficial elements that only excite you for a few times until you realize there is nothing there."},{"rating":"2","title":"silky, sultry voice... I love it!","review":"I think that this CD was an extremely good purchase. I have listened to it several times, and never seem to tire of it. I don't believe that she is overrated, as others suggest, because I feel that she has a truly beautiful and unique voice. I particularly love the smoky sweetness she imparts in \\"Got to See You Again,\\" and the pleasant mellowness of the title track. The only reason I didn't rate it with 5 stars is because I still would buy Diana Krall (in my opinion, the most amazing jazz singer) before Norah Jones if given a choice, and not every song on her CD appeals to me (I do forward through one or two tracks), whereas on Diana's, I do not. But all in all, it's a worthy CD of your attention and will provide you hours of listening pleasure. I'm sure we'll be hearing much more from her in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Reading. Start Buying.","review":"This is fresh, unique, familiar and in every way worth every nickel. Her voice is sweet but not innocent, her arrangements refreshingly, acoustically, airy without being stark and the production is clean and entirely authentic. If you fail to be moved by this stunning debut collection of moving melodies, check in with a cardiologist. IMMEDIATELY."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is relaxing music....","review":"I purchased this CD and the first time I listened to it, I almost fell asleep. Not because it was boring, but because it was soothing and relaxing; not loud and obnoxious. This would be a great gift for even a 10 year old. My daughter loves it(she's 12). BUY THIS CD NOW!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Best Jazz Singers of All Time","review":"The minute I heard her sing I knew another one of the best female vocalists had come along again. I've been fortunate to hear most of them, Ella, Sarah, Peggy Lee, Kay Starr, Jo Stafford, Barbra, Dinah, Joan Baez, even Billie Holiday. Norah's voice, phrasing, and arrangements are personal, her own muse. She's also beautiful and a wonderful performer. Best of all she writes much of her own music which most of the singers mentioned didn't. She's great, she's it, and she'll be around for a lifetime"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"After reading most of the reviews, I would have to say that there are more positive ones than negative ones. I myself, have listened to the album, and have found that Norah's voice is refreshing. She reminds me of several singers, but that's all it is. I'm not comparing her to jazz singers left and right because it doesn't do justice to the work that she has culminated on this album. I know that some reveiws criticize her as not being enough jazz. Well...she's not, because she is Norah Jones. We should appreciate the fact that her album a genre all on it's own. I don't think she's trying to imitate anyone, but rather her songs and her voice are influenced by artists she admires. I know there are hardcore jazz people out there, but I think we should appreciate this album for what it is. Her smooth smokey, yet sensual voice complements her songwriting on the title track, and for the other songs as well, specifically \\"Lonestar.\\" I can't wait for her next album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Norah Jones Brings \\"It\\"","review":"Norah has an amazing voice that captivates you. A few songs are great lullabies (not in a bad way), that make you really sleepy. Others are great to sing along to--and read along to, thanks to lyrics included inside the cover.Don't Know Why-5/57 Years-3/5Cold Cold Heart-5/5Feelin' The Same Way-5/5Come Away With Me-5/5Shoot The Moon-5/5Turn Me On-4/5Lonestar-2/5I've Got To See You Again-4/5Painter Song-5/5One Flight Down-5/5Nightengale-1/5The Long Day Is Over-4/5The Nearness Of You-2/5OVERALL RATING-4/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully unique!","review":"Okay, I don't have any mind-blowing analytical takes on Norah's Jones' debut CD. All i can say it that this is a great CD and she deserved each of the 5 Grammys she won for it. Her melodies, lyrics, and voice are so relaxing and inspirational. I know her lyrics dont' exactly express poetic epiphanies of life, just observations of a young woman loving and living her life--that's what I got from it atleast. It's also nice that this is a CD you can never get tired of!! I was a little disappointed that Norah Jones didn't write as much of her material as I expected, but I was thrilled that she did write \\"Come Away With Me\\" because that is one of the greatest love songs I have ever heard! I love her details like wanting to go away with her lover on a bus and sleep listening to rain on a tin roof. WONDERFUL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My mom LOVES this CD","review":". . . and I can understand why. Norah Jones has a beautful voice, she works with great musicians like Bill Frisell, and each song is carefully crafted to sound perfect and not offend anyone. When I hear this album, I get bored. Norah Jones sings over one slow and classy song after another and I nod off, waiting patiently for something to happen. Thanks to the success of this CD, maybe she'll branch out on the next one. Maybe she'll try something less predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bye Britney .. Hello Norah!","review":"Thank god for the music business changing. It is very refreshing for me to finally have a young female artist who isn't pop and rock. ...I do not know how anyone can rate this cd with anything less then 5 stars. Who ... Yes the song on the radio has gotten over played, but trust me the entire cd is excellent. ...I've only been able to listen to one other cd completely through and LOVE every track. This is one of those cds you can just play and not have to get up constantly to change tracks! It is absolutely amazing.... Norah Jones is a unique gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"I love this CD...it is SO great to listen to when you do not want to be distracted...I can still do all the work I need to do at my desk feeling relaxed and not having a distracted feeling that sometimes comes with other types of music I listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This is the first Norah Jones CD I bought and I now have all of her work. This is still my favorite CD of all time. It is so romantic and relaxing, I listen to it all the time. Driving in my car, cooking in the kitchen, drinking wine while entertaining friends, while reading, and before bed. I even like it while I do yoga! I love her and especially this CD and recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most long-winded album of all time - and it's so popular!!!","review":"What a boring album! And this one got so many grammys and has sold in millions all over the world?! Oh, my Lord! That make me anxious. What a music taste people have! I just can't believe it! And I am not that kind of person that only like Limp Bizkit, Marilyn Manson etc. I like both pop, synth, rock, hard rock and Enya but definitely not Norah Jones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One word to describe her","review":"Theres only one word that could describe Norah Jones on this CD...BORING!The music makes you fall asleep. DOn't buy it. She didn't deserve all of those awards that she won."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Talent?","review":"Norah Jones has a nice voice, very reminiscent of Rickie Lee Jones however, I didn't find any tunes which I found that memorable. In fact, There weren't any tracks which were medium to up in tempo. All tracks were very much the same in style and presentation. Maybe she should take a lesson from Rickie Lee Jones on how to groove. Grammies have become a disgrace in recognizing true talent, maybe they need some holes drilled in their ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"It ain't jazz","review":"If you're like me--and looking for a new female vocalist that has some vision and personality in the jazz genre, here's another woeful disappointment. Continuing along the slippery slope begun by Diana Krall (who at least has SOME jazz chops) we hit mid-slope with Jane Monheit, and with Ms. Jones, we have probably not yet hit bottom. At least she does have a voice, and does not contort the music beyond recognition. She's obviously listened to lots of Bonnie Raitt. Perhaps she has a niche in Nashville. But please, please, please don't call it jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Dusty In Memphis - Re-Mastered instead","review":"Arif Martin had a huge hand in both recordings - producing the string and horn arrangements in Dusty In Memphis over 30 years ago. The recently released re-mastered version on Phillips is amazing. Rarely have remastered albums convinced me that the ordinary listener could tell the difference.Norah had a fine first outing with this CD, but awarding it - album of the year - is like the Sports Illustrated cover jinx.Let's give Norah another ten years to see how this album holds up and see if she can gain some soul in her life experiences which will translate to her music. For now - give Dusty a listen if you want music from the heart and soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I am a Eva Cassidy fan. I was told that I might like this CD. The production and engineering on the album is terrible. The piano often sounds like the microphone is too far away. The music is very flat. The first song on the CD is the only decent song on it. However, the musicianship and the quality of the recording could have easily been better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surface music","review":"Even taken as a pop album, which this is, Norah Jones is a perfectly pleasant singer, but hardly memorable. Seeing her live convinces me that there is not a lot beyond what you see and hear -- substance and resonance just aren't there, and certainly no sense of musical adventure -- which makes her far from jazz. She's pretty and likable in that college-dorm girl kind of way, but there seems little to indicate musically that there's a long-haul career ahead. This is more Edie Brickell than Rickie Lee Jones, for example. She's somehow connected with the zeitgeist of the moment, and there's nothing wrong with that. But she, and her material, are nothing special. The most interesting thing about the album is legendary producer Arif Mardin's return to a more stripped-down intimate sound. But the songs themselves -- they're easy to listen to, and instantly forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wallpaper music for an elevator","review":"Simplistic words and melodies. Voice lacks range, timbre and brilliance. All songs sound basically the same. Based on some reviews I was expecting the next Diana Krall. Not to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me fall a sleep","review":"Everytime I turn it on I fall asleep.Love her voice.Works better than a sleeping pill"},{"rating":"2","title":"she grew on me","review":"I listened and the more songs I heard, the more I enjoyed her stylings. Her voice is different, but she carries it well. Now I see what all the buzz was about.Yes, I say buy it. Yes, it is worth it.Give it time to grow on you too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come back, Laura Nyro!!","review":"Save us from soul-less voices and mediocre pianists with the same boring tempo, limited vocal range and no originality in all her songs. Get Laura Nyro's first 6 albumns instead, plus Gonna Take a Miracle, to hear the real thing instead of a weak imitation of a female piano-playing vocalist. What a fuss over nothing! Guess Ravi still has some real pull..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nora Jones Is Horrible","review":"My friend bought this CD, and let me listen to it. I can't believe how horribly raspy her voice was. She does not put any emotion into her voice atall, and she turns the song into a drone. My advice is to not buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of voice","review":"I don't even know if what she does would qualify as a whisper or if she just has a very alarming vocal problem, but I know about vocal performance and it is completely missing. You could think that the feeling would compensate this, until you realise there's hardly any feeling either. Regarding the music, what can I say, blatant wannabe attempt at jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT VERY ORIGINAL..TRY SOMETHING ELSE IF YOU WANT REAL JAZZ","review":"Well I am not impressed. I think she should develop her own style and stop the Macy Grey undertones. I notice a lot of people are commenting on her appearance, that should be irrelevant when it comes to great musical talent. Unfortunately it seems to add an extra star to a review if someone thinks you physically appeal to them as well....which is silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"Before I bought this CD I thought easy listening was for loosers. But I was wrong. The deadly cocktail of wonderfuly lyrics and Norah Jones's voice was a very pleasent surprise!! All the song have been wonderfully performed. In this day and age of war and voilence, we all need to take a break and this CD does a wonderful job of bring back old memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"Norah Jones does remind me of many who have come before her without sounding like any of them. She interprets each style and genre with elan. As beautiful as she is, could her voice be even more so?I recommend this CD to anybody who enjoys being swept away and is looking for a aural escape."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Star with a New Sound","review":"Norah Jones has created a new sound for adult listners who are tired of the same old shuck and jive from other artists. She's refreshing, light, simple and simplistic. I purchased her CD over two months ago and still find that I need to listen to it everyday. She's has that special sound that makes me think I'll purchase anything she produces without hearing a preview. I can't wait for the next one. Good going Norah! Keep up the great work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You want to fall in Love?","review":"Like many of the other reviewers I decided I had to have this cd after just a few notes of \\"I Don't Know Why\\". I described this cd to a friend recently, I said that \\"it makes me want to just lay around and do absolutely nothing\\". I needed to furthur clarify that though, You know when your lying in bed with someone you love and there is no where else you'ld rather be, that's the way Norah Jones' music makes me feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gorgeous Cd","review":"I love Norah Jones! This cd has been added to my list of all time favorite albums. I love her voice, I love her lyrics, I love her talent at the piano. This album is absolutely beautiful. Even if you are not a regular jazz fan,(which I am not, by the way) you can't resist the beauty of her music. Every song is fantastic. Even my 8 month old daughter loves it, we have made it her regular bedtime music. Slow, jazzy, romantic, anyway you want to describe it, this album is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely!","review":"My daughter introduced me to Norah Jones and I owe her one. Jones is remarkably assured for someone so young--her soft, smoky voice is always true, her piano work is simple, even elegant. My only quibble would be the sameness of the mood throughout the album, so that the original compositions tend to blur into one lengthy number, relieved by fine renditions of \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" the old Hank Williams classic, and a fine rendition of Hoagy Carmichael's \\"The Nearness of You.\\" It's hard to fault someone who has such an immense and distinctive talent; but it would be very nice to hear Jones do a few more of the old standards and offer a little more variety in her choices. That said, she's a dream of a singer/musician and this is a lovely CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"mesmerizing","review":"Recently discovered Norah Jones and have only the one CD \\"come away with me\\". Her voice is sweet and captivating. The songs are a mix of mellow and sexy. I would definitely recommend her to the \\"baby boomer\\" generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with your day job.","review":"Norah's singing has very little depth. She joins the ranks of low volume, breathy female singers that look good on the album cover only."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"F\\"","review":"Terrible recording.

All the songs are the same, and nothing ever changes about her musical styles or the songs she's singing.There are much better CDs to spend your money on. Don't buy the Grammy hyped CD. Spend it on something better. I wish I could give it zero stars, but they don't make that!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST CD EVER","review":"Horrible CD, how did she win all those grammys, I mean these songs are horrible. I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone.

Phony through and through."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, flat, nothing new here","review":"Received as a gift, was looking forward to listening to it, but quite disappointed. I don't know what the big deal is. There are far greater talents out there that haven't garnered this much hype. Okay to listen to if you are having trouble sleeping.To me, this is just another product of the popular music hype machine. Pretty face + okay voice with a new packaging twist= CD sales. Musically not much new or fresh here, even her voice is not all that distinctive or unique, though the musicians do a fine job backing her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbagey and borin'","review":"Hurl tomatoes at this rotten loser, just do anything to make her stop singing! This is pure music for octogenarians who remember the jazz age and actually want to relive it. I don't understand who would want to relive music like that, when we have three decades of great pop, rock, and rap. I can't belive she won 8 Grammies. That shows what the world has come to. I hate Nora Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss Thing needs a personality transfusion NOW!","review":"Honey, you have a LONG way to go before you can join Ashanti and Beyonce in the big leagues. You need to get a new sound or change your clothes or something because you are too DULL. Get some flava, girlfriend! This CD is just not working. Not feeling it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Impression not always the right one.","review":"After seeing Norah Jones on David Letterman after this CD came out, I was hooked! She was/is terrific, unique. I immediately bought this CD and after listening to it was very disappointed--my first impression was that every song seemed to sound the same. I kept listengin to it and discovered that while Norah's voice seems to maintain the same melodic quality, the words and music started to change for me. I love this CD--it's calms the nerves during rush our traffic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre - Get Eva Cassidy Instead","review":"I know I'm going to go against the popular grain here but it seems like the positive reactions to this album are less about its great content than it is about finally hearing something different than what is typically forced upon us by the music industry. For those of us not clued in to this genre before Norah Jones it truly may seem better than what it truly is...quite frankly Norah Jones is certainly talented but this collection of one-note music has been waaay overrated...its like listening to the same song over and over on each cut.The reality is that record executives saw the incredible, suprising reaction & record sales of the late great Eva Cassidy (from Washington D.C.!). So, they went out and found someone who had a sound similar to hers...that was Norah Jones. So, if you like the sound of Norah Jones you will be thrilled by the original - Eva Cassidy - but it's like comparing jug wine to a vintage cabernet."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album & great vinyl record!","review":"I had the CD for a while and recently bought the vinyl and it is of top quality! Great sound quality and no pop sounds! Excellent purchase! of course not forgetting the excellent artist and her amazing voice! one of my favorite albums no doubt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY A GOOD ALBUM BY AN AMAZING ARTIST","review":"THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE POWER OF NORAH JONES DEBUT COME AWAY WITH ME. HER VOICE IS LIKE SILK WITH A TINGE OF THE BLUES, EACH SONG JUST FALLS INTO YOUR IMAGINATION. HER BEAUTY IS BOTH HER LOOK WHICH IS COOL AND NATURAL AND HER SOUND. SHE WILL BE AROUND FOR YEARS TO COME AND I PLAN TO BUY EVERY ALBUM SHE PUTS OUT. AMAZING"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe she's more interesting live?","review":"A couple of friends told me they thought I'd enjoy this album--maybe because I'm a big Madeleine Peyroux fan--but when I received it as a gift I found it dull. Monotonous. Soporific. Limp. Depressing.Jones has a good voice, sure, but to my ear, she sings without feeling or nuance, like she's giving a recital at school. She sounds bored, and she certainly bored me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rainy Sunday afternoon music","review":"I was watching TV one day and had NO idea that I was gonna end up expanding my, all ready too large, CD collection. I am a huge fan of mellow, rainy day, quality time with yourself music and this CD is great for that. Norah has a husky alto that I love, she may not have a Mariah Carey range but you can't hold that against her. She is capable of music that doesn't make your ears bleed. Low key. With songs like \\"Don't Know Why\\", \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\", \\"Painter Song\\", and \\"The Long Day is Over\\" she can't go wrong. For all those people that thought it was a waste of their hard earned money should listen to it again when they want to relax. This album is not meant to get out of your seat and ready to party. This album is meant for quiet reflection and relaxation, it is meant to inspire. This album makes me want to write my poetry with music on instead of in the silence of an empty apartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL","review":"Texas-bred newcomer Norah Jones is the real deal.She's no label-modeled teen-pop model trying to play jazz.She may be beautiful but she has talent to back it up.Her debut\\"Come Away With Me\\" is quite simply beautiful.\\"I Don't Know Why\\",\\"Cold Cold Heart\\",and \\"The Nearest Of You are precise and features Jones' sultry,impressive phrasing.No,Norah Jones is not the new Billie Holliday or Nina Simonebut she is a promising young talent whose musical sophiscation,elegance,and style is timeless and beyond her years.\\"Come Away With Me\\" may not be the album for everyone but I think that if you like mellow music with elegance and ease,\\"I Don't Know Why\\" you don't own this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzz zzzzz zzzzz...","review":"...zzzzz....huh? Oh. Sorry about that. I was listening to this CD I bought, and was just about to write a review for it when I fell into a deep coma-like sleep, which resulted in my head landing on the \\"z\\" key. Well, on to my review.This music is boring, slow, and lifeless. I love slow music, but this stuff is completely unimaginitive. I can't believe she won a grammy for this. Then again, when has anybody that recieved a grammy worthy of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Hit Wonder?","review":"Thats right Track number one is the only thing worth listening too. After that the rest put me to sleep . Arif hired all the big names to back her up but they fell asleep too. On most of the song she plays pianismo on the keys and is singing to just herself in a little room. The roots and presentation of the song make me wonder Bluegrass? Jazz? Country? Pop?. So I sold the CD to someone at the Office. Yes Norah has a fine voice on the next CD please lose that annoying whisper and pick up the tempo Like maybe a collection of jazzy songs that were on Diana Kralls earlier CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lounge muzak","review":"This kind of singing might be acceptable in the lounge of a third-rate Vegas hotel, but what all the hype is about is certainly beyond me. When Jones tries for intimacy, she mostly provides breathy gook; when she goes for volume, she's just strident. She is in tune most of the time, but that's little compensation for what's on this disc. Can a duets disc with Josh Groban be far behind?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and bland!","review":"This album is simply boring. Songs are bland, interpretation uninspiring. Don't let the meaningless marketing slogans trick you."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING BORING BORING!","review":"If you think back to BEFORE Norah Jones took all those Grammy's...no one knew who she was!! Song of the year?!...um..no. Yes she has a little bit of talent, but I find her to be extremely boring. These are the kind of songs that you can't wait for to end. She exemplifies no vocal range and the strength of her voice is that of a medicore vocalist. Don't waste your money. Go for something more like Celine Dion or Clay Aiken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! Invasive copy protection. Might not play on your cd player at all!","review":"Great cd, unfortunately the copy protection prevents me from putting it on my ipod, and worse yet, the cd won't play in most of my cd players. Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Bad Can It Get?","review":"I really have no clue as to why Norah is so successful. She doesn't have a good voice, and on top of that, this is one of the most boring albums I have ever heard. As another person said, her voice really doesn't do the song justice, and she didn't even write it. The song could have been good if they had given it to someone with a more powerful voice. Why in the world do critics feel that they need to catre to her? Well, I simply \\"Don't Know Why\\". Do not buy this pathetic album, there are so many better songs and albums out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's the hype???","review":"After all of the awards I decided to give it a listen, then again a few days later. Still what a snooze. There are two ok songs but all sound the same and they would make great elevator music. The tempo is so slow and I think I heard one up tempo part of a song. This is a classic case of the record label or awards show trying to build an artist. It would have been fine for her to win a couple of awards but not the volume she did. You can't tell me there aren't other good musical talents out there or was she the only one for the entire year. What a slap in the face of the awards shows staying open minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star for ...","review":"... filing this CD under \\"Jazz\\". Only a generation spoiled by years of radio listening could come to the idea of calling anything (anything!)that sounded different \\"Jazz\\". But it isn't. It doesn't swing, it has little to no improvisation, it's got no compositions to speak of. You could call this music \\"Popcountry-Kitsch\\" or maybe campfire music, the same thing Michelle Shocked did 20 years ago. But in the genre of \\"Popcountry-Kitsch\\" it sure deserves 5 stars.Just listen to any song by Charles Mingus and you'll understand what I mean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recording sucks","review":"Music is good (somewhat sleepy...) but something went wrong in the recording. The instrument balance is not so good and Norah's voice is badly recorded, too rough."},{"rating":"2","title":"a jazz legend for 2002","review":"she sounds like if BBKing, ELLa and Etta James mixed genes and had a child. Come Away with me is a great song, and her rendition of Cold,Cold Heart is fantastic. SHe is someone you wouldn't care how much the ticket price was. She makes you wish you could sing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old soul....New voice.","review":"A true talent!! A new voice with an old soul, Norah Jones encompasses everything that can be classy about a contemporary artist. Using her sultry voice to create a jazzy feeling to old school covers or creating new classics, this album is a must in most any collection. It makes you want to light and candle and drink a glass of red wine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Relaxation at it's best!!!!!","review":"Some of the best relaxing jazz i have heard in a long time, i really like norah jones style very much so. She's very easy to listen to and you will not hate you bought the vinyl version of this album, i mean don't get me wrong the cd is ok! but only vinyl is the way to go. Vinyl rules and so does norah jones!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Norah Should Stay in the Studio","review":"I just attended the Norah Jones concert last night in Berkeley, too. The sound mix was horrible, the concert had no momentum, and Norah had zero stage presence.Better to buy her CD's and listen to them in your own home. The concert experience was extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth easy listening vocal jazz","review":"Got this CD as a gift and I find it to be a consistent album with many songs that I enjoy. It is great mellow music for a car trip or relaxing at home over dinner. I think people will find other tracks to enjoy on it than just the couple of hits that came off the disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"come away with me","review":"very happy with this purchaseproduct arrived quicker than promised datewould purchase from amazon.com again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"A friend handed me this album an hour ago and having been through it once I can honestly say it's an instant classic with me.Jones's voice is soothing and exquisite. Much of the album is actually blues and she does a fantastic job at it. She borrows vocal patterns heavily from Bonnie Raitt, but does it with her own style and elegance. She doesn't belt out the emotional parts like many of the blues artists of the past - at times i *really* wanted her to, too! - though I suspect she could, effortlessly.Keep an eye on this girl; she's very talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine cd by a young and talented artist","review":"Please don't be put off by the negative reviews... This is a fine album by a young and talented artist. Norah Jones has a sultry and sophisticated voice that belies her youth and is well suited to the musical selections on this cd. This is one of those rare mainstream albums that crosses generation gaps and the whole family can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some good songs, but have you heard \\"More Than This\\"?","review":"In fall of 2001 I heard this young woman's performance on Charlie Hunters Analog Playground CD. The version of More Than This that Ms Jones sings is really entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.....Norah Jones","review":"I just watched Diana Kralls new Live in Paris DVD and feel it was the best live musical performance I've ever seen. This CD by Norah Jones, hands down, is the best recorded music I've ever heard. Get it and listen. Quite simply the best recording I've heard ever. I guess that is why it is tops on the Billboard charts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"She is a way too lucky lounge singer. I think many people think when she's singing these songs she's poured a lot of heart and soul into them. However, she did not write these songs, and her voice is just her trying make herself sound as if she's Billie Holiday; when you hear her talk her voice sounds nothing like her singing voice. She's just another talentless young wannabe star the music industry throws at us in a different formula than that usually used in the pop music genre. The most credit she has for herself is that she can play the piano; and there's plenty of piano players way better than her."},{"rating":"1","title":"pleasant enough, but not exciting","review":"this is a pleasant cd to listen to over a dinner or maybe on a sunday morning. but it doesn't do a whole lot for me in terms of making me feel something about the music or lyrics.i kept waiting for norah to stretch it out a bit. maybe kick in that voice a little more to give me something to get excited about. it never happened.she seems to have the ability/capacity to belt a little but i felt like she was holding back the whole cd.maybe she will get there. maybe she had bad advice from producers and recording execs.i also think she sounds like too many other female artists at certain times. there is nothing that sets her apart.give norah a listen and then follow it up with billie or eva cassidy. there is absolutely no comparison.it a solid cd, but the hype surrounding it is out of control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purely Stunning, Inspiring Work","review":"After a long day of work, I was flipping through the channels and caught Norah Jones' video for \\"Don't Know Why\\". After that, I was hooked! Upon purchasing the CD, it has quickly become one of my all time favorites.The entire CD is an outstanding blend of jazzy crazed piano mixed with outstanding vocals that touch your soul. This is one of those CDs where you can just pop it into your player and not have to worry about skipping certain tracks. If you need to entertain a trendy event, want to have a romantic evening, or even just relax in a bath with candles around you--then this CD is for you!My favorite tracks are \\"Don't Know Why\\", \\"I've got to See You Again\\", and \\"Painter Song\\"....Now, if this only came in minidisc...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coast Girl is independently talented","review":"Exceptional - Norahs father, Ravi Shankar has lived in the Central Coast of San Diego for over 10 years and I think this is where Norah grew up. This area is like \\"Hawaii turn left\\". in life style, music and quiet talent like Norah. Her style is reflective of this with a personal touch of worldliness, simple compassion and provacativeness . sensual , alluring and a very real expression of everyones thoughts at one time or another. I recall her father playing benefits at local schools. Pearl Jam grew up here, Blink 182 , Jewel lives here amongst many musicisians all the way way back to the 40's - in quiet retirement. Several contemporary jazz artists as well. So I'm not surprised . She has the capability of being a female Sting if she continues to broaden her scope. who doesn't have some of his music !!?

When I need to tune out the world and tune into my own strength to get something done, I pop this CD into my computer, don my headphones and I am immediately at ease and the work flows like nobody's business. It's soothing, calming, and the epitome of relaxation. I feel as though I have been transported away from 25 other co-workers trapped in a field of cubicles and into a convertable on a warm summer's day, driving through the desert at sunset!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Got To Hear This Again","review":"I first heard this record while sitting in the Majestic Café enjoying a nice meal with friends before we left for the opera. I was so compelled by it, that I had to ask the waitress, \\"Who is this woman singing?\\" I made a mental note and went right out and bought the album. Since then Jones has found critical acclaim and much press coverage, particularly in Rolling Stone which featured her in their \\"Women In Rock\\" issue along such contemporaries (and I use that word very hesitantly) as Brittany Spears, Avril Lavinge and Alanis Morissette. One thing puts Jones way ahead of the competition however: she's undeniably talented. Who cares if she's beautiful? Who cares if she is Ravi Shankar's daughter? One listen to her voice and nothing else about her seems very important. From touches of country to laid back jazz, Jones floats through genres and defies categorization. A wonderful debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bora Fest","review":"This CD is so boring it put me to sleep within 15 seconds.She should be renamed Bora JonesAfter hearing this I was begging to be taken awaybut not with her.If I had to go away with her I may never wake upfrom the coma her voice puts me in.So Peace Out Snora Jones"},{"rating":"1","title":"Background noise","review":"Don't get me wrong, this is not such a bad piece of music (most buyers and reviewers seem more than satisfied). But, since Ms Jones is often referred to as a jazz musician, I feel obliged to point out that from the jazz point of view she has very little to offer.Not only does she come from country and pop music as much as she comes from jazz (at least at this album; I haven't listened to much of her other work), she has terrible influence world wide. Because of her financial success, all sorts of easy-listening singers get labeled jazz-divas even in my small country in South-East Europe.I hate to disagree with the popular vote, but for me this album falls somewhere between background music and background noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst SACD titles I own!","review":"The sound on this is very anemic. The bass is almost non-existent. I've read this in other reviews but I had to see for myself since I love this album. It's true. Stick with the regular CD. Later Edit: I've decided it's not as bad as I first thought. What I said previously still applies but you won't be wasting your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever music type it is...I like it. *Update* YUCK!","review":"Jazz? Pop? Starbuck's background music? I don't know. Does it have to have some deeper meaning or \\"label\\" to like it? No, of course not. Norah has a very soothing voice, pretty songs...overall well done. *UPDATE* I'm so sick of this ...CD! So overplayed...I think it's the same song twelve times...I'm so tired of this CD! Yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"I immediately fell in love with her voice without even seeing her. She just has the type of singing style you hope will be around forever. I am gonna tell on myself agewise, but she reminded me very much of Phoebe Snow, who was very popular in the 70's.Don't Know Why, of course, is the best song on this cd, but Come Away With Me, cuts deep into the soul if you listen carefully.This is a must have for any music collector of good new music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need A Nap? Here's The Ticket","review":"My wife and I had never heard of Norah Jones until the day after the Grammys this year when she carted home all sorts of trinkets. My wife assumed that winning the best pop artist award would signify a good pop album and thus picked up the disc. Wrong. Norah is a beautiful young woman and has a lovely voice, but the songs just have no spark. It was like listening to CSPAN with a piano. I can only assume that she received attention and overhype due to her father Ravi Shankar who was idolized by the Beatles (George Harrison in particular). But that connection doesn't make you great.I hope Norah ups the tempo on her next CD (it won't be hard to do) and maybe we can see what type of Pop Chops she has. But her career has Lauren Hill and Taste of Honey potential, so I hope she enjoys the success she's getting. I know I'll enjoy my sleep after listening to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Over Rated","review":"Norah Jones sounds the same through all her albums. She sounds like she went to bed with a sore throat and woke up and started singing. She seems to have that feeling you get when someone walks in and flips the light on when you were asleep.She leaves her listeners the same way, bleary-eyed and half-asleep.Her 'mature voice' and style I've read about, and heard is less engaging than, say, Ben Stein with a twenty year, pack-a-day cigarette habit reading me his grocery list.In short, don't fall for the hype. Re-title her albums as 'music for insomniacs'."},{"rating":"1","title":"14 identical songs","review":"I still have to find out if this CD has one loooong endless song, or a shorter one repeated 14 times?Good musicians, good arrangements, but in the whole is sooo boring. Maybe because the mix is bringing too much in front the voice.It's a girl that is singing for 1 hour, with a silent background track. If you love the voice of this girl, then it's okay, keep on listen to her singing. But there's not much music on the CD, just a girl, singing. All the time in the same way. Miau miau miau miaaaaau."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to this instead of taking sleeping pills","review":"Oh my GOD how did this evil woman perform voodoo on the Grammy voters to get them to vote for her album? Seriously this music is so depressing. Not one song is uplifting. Everyone needs to wake up and listen to something with beats. I mean BIG BAND music is much better than this, much jazzier, more.. human. This album is like morphine. Don't waste your money on it, even when you find it in the bargain bin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"oops..its sleeptime","review":"This has got to be the most overhyped record of all time. It sounds like one long soulless monotone track from the beginning to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY THE VERY BEST OF CHER INSTEAD!","review":"I cant stand NORAH JONES.This is not the cd for you.ITS AWFUL.I wouldnt buy it.I listened to it at a friends house.A MAJORdisappointment.BUY THE VERY BEST OF CHER INSTEAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"-","review":"Norah Jones has a beautiful voice, and the instrumentals are perfectly paired with her voice. You may have heard only one or two of these songs on the radio, but the entire disc is good. Sweet, innocuous, and and melodic."},{"rating":"1","title":"REMINDS ME OF JANIS JOPLIN","review":"I never heard this singer before but thought I would give her a try and quite honestly did not care for her at all. She is so pretty though. She sounds alot to me like Janis Joplin but then I did not care for her years ago either. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, Norah!","review":"I found myself dancing to 'I've Got To See You Again' as it played in the music store. Sold me right then. I wake up with different tracks running through my mind and I can't start my day without a fix of Norah. Her versatility is stunning, from 'Cold, Cold Heart' to 'Come Away With Me' and 'Painter Song' and I expect to wear out my CD in short order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over-rated? Hardly!","review":"Norah Jones is one of the best artists to come around in a long time. If you like Bonnie Raitt, you may very well enjoy Norah.Monotone voice as stated by past reviewers? Her range may be somewhat limited but she is a good vocalist nonetheless. As far as vocals, it's so annoying that there are so very few good \\"singers\\" these days anyway. Buy this album, it deserved every award it got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going To Become One Of The Greats","review":"Not for a very long time have I been this excited about a new artist. Norah Jones is one of the greatest singers/story tellers/interpreters of music to come along in years. My prediction is that in a few years she will become of the greatest in the panthon of female singers, taking her place with the likes of Billie Holiday, Barbra Streisand, and Ann Wilson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance hits the mainstream!","review":"Stylish, classy, sexy in a demure manner, and definately confident! Something always comes along to break the trends of mainstream monotony. Norah Jones made this come true. Her music combines perfect elements of classic lounge jazz with a modern twist of pop and R&B. Sounds a bit strange maybe, but Norah Jones elegently opens her soul to seep into her music. I can't put my finger on exactly what I love about this intangible flowing creativity. , but just to sit and FEEL the music is enough. I'm not an extreme jazz style buff so I wouldn't know an exceptional amount concerning the technicality of this music, but I don't need to to be an ardent fan. Soulful music pours from her eyes, voice, and fingertips; the music bussiness revealing a true afficianado of an artist. I highly reccomend this album for any light-hearted soul listeners. I look forward to more imaginative, and simple (yet so elaborate in feeling)work from her in the future. 5 stars and a smile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"Simply stated, a wonderful must have CD for any collection. Her soft vocals and simply stated music combine to form a powerful symphony off all emotions. Simply Wonderful. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the perfect album-and a first, no less","review":"I picked the album up a few months ago and it has become one of my most played discs. Norah has it all-the music and lyrics and soulful emotions-and all are well beyond her years. Most songs are soothing, a few are a little peppy and together, all are a perfect mix. The piano licks are awesome. A super album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeat....repeat...repeat","review":"Many of the songs sound the same. After listening to the CD a few times I found myself saying \\"didn't I just hear that song?\\"I would recommend any of the Sade CDs over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow, Sexy and Highly Enjoyable","review":"I had heard \\"Don't know Why\\" on the radio and fell in love with it, but I have a hard time making my self spend money, particularly on CDs. I decided to check the CD out from my local library to see if I would like it, and boy did I ever! I listen to it everytime I am home, and am dreading returning it to the library on Friday, so guess what, I'm going to go buy it, and you should to! It's incredible, think Diana Krall mixed with Sheryl Crow! She's got such good pure quality in her voice and she matched it up with awesome musicians that bring out the very best in her. If you buy this CD , you'll love it...I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good debut, but not as spectacular as the Grammy's believe.","review":"I love her voice. Norah Jones could sing me to sleep anytime her heart feels like it! She has a wonderful tool at her disposal and this is a great way to kick off a career. The only drawback I have heard in this release is that the tempo is pretty much the same all the way through the album. I would have liked to have seen Norah and her producer put a critical ear to the collection and realize that they needed a little more variety. Not that I want to hear her leading a few AC/DC tunes or anything, just a little different tempo and vocal variation. I can't wait to hear the follow-up to see if she can overcome the musical sophomore curse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow down, turn the lights out and listen!","review":"This is the most refreshing music I have heard in a long time. The girl knows blues in the most fundamental way. If you've had a rough day or week and need something to relax you try this CD. I didn't find a song I didn't like on it. Of course I had my preferences. The title song is the kind of song that takes you on a trip beyond reality.If you have been arguing with your spouse and just not getting along, listen to this CD together... it just might be the salve that heals your relationship;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"MASTERPIECE","review":"There are thousands of reviews for this CD, so I won't go on for long...This CD is a masterpiece...there's not much else to say about it.. When I heard the first single for the first time and saw the video I was not impressed--thought she was rather boring...but now I've grown to love Norah.This CD has so many greats, I won't go into each one. EVERY song on this CD is unique and timeless. It's amazing that a jazzy type artist like Norah can be one of the biggest selling artists of today..she brings hope to the music business..I love her...so sexy, and so so talented."},{"rating":"1","title":"monotone","review":"If you like every song sung the same way in the same key and without expression, then this album is for you. Ms. jone has vocal potential, unfortunately it isn't evident on this recording. For maximum listening enjoyment, especially when it concerns \\"Turn me on\\", I reccomend the late and forever great, Nina Simone."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's NOT to like...?","review":"This woman is not only stunning to look at, but stunning to listen to. Is it jazz, is it folk, is it pop, is it easy-listening? Let's just call it an earful of each, mixed together majestically. Her music is soulful, flowing, and mercifully not oversweet...just right! There's not a weak track on the entire album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colors the world a moody blue","review":"The songs in this album are definitely moody. It's like looking through blue shades and out the window it's raining. It's blues, but not down and out blues; more sultry, sexy blues, actually. Its influence is from the Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi schools. I'm surprised it's gone popular. Her voice has the sharp cut of Eartha Kitt, and I'll let you figure out the others she sometimes resembles. She's like one of those greats reborn. The title song was in the tv series Dawson's Creek, and I'm happy to say that the other songs are just as playable for tv and cinema. She is that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I have bought this year","review":"Love the cd. She has a soothing voice and I have been playing it on my work cd player for a week now and still haven't gotten sick of it. Bought it for song #1 however have enjoyed the entire cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great singer","review":"This is a great album for relaxing. Norah Jones as a great voice and all the songs on this album is very mellow. My favourites are The Nearness of You and One Flight Down. If you're a fan of Michael Buble or Josh Groban, you may like Norah Jones as well. Norah Jones' jazz style is complementary to both Michael Buble and Josh Groban."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, sleepy, she doesn't even write most ofher own stuff!","review":"i bought this CD back in 2001 because i was going to a bunch of indigo girls shows where norah jones was opening (to think that wasn't too long ago...). live, jones is ok. however, her CD bores me. the songs all sound the same. not to mention that she doesn't even write most of her own stuff. the \\"don't know why\\" song that's all over the radio is ok. the rest of the CD is pretty bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre - Get Eva Cassidy or Diana Krall Instead","review":"I was given this album as a gift, and I know I'm going against the popular grain here, but I have to say it like it is...her over-played radio \\"hits\\" were tolerable but after playing the overall collection of songs twice it just doesn't inspire me to play the CD again. (My wife says that she sounds like a cat \\"yowling\\" on a back fence - a little extreme).Fortunately, I had picked up CDs by Eva Cassidy & Diana Krall prior to receiving \\"Come Away With Me\\" and was blown away by their voices and musicianship...this made Norah Jones' efforts come off weak in comparison. In short...it's fashionable, one note music that's tolerable in the short term but I'll be curious to see if the music endures the test of time or if it goes the way of the \\"Pet Rock\\".UPDATE: Yep, she went the way of the \\"Pet Rock\\" - vindicated"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite there yet...","review":"Maybe she's grown a bit, artistically, but listening to Norah Jones still leaves that tasteless flavour in my mouth, song after song. A typically hyped-up young figure, certainly a beautiful and charming face, but far from the consummate artist record companies will have you believe, Norah Jones still does not make it with me. Maybe one day she'll stop faking that seductive voice and start singing properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nepotism helps","review":"Come off it folks! This over-hyped product is a album people will have comprehensively forgotten in a couple of years!Norah Jones has very little talent and her voice is dull and expressionless. You know it is!Let's get real - there is very little to talk about here. Norah Jones has been allowed to make an album an it is a crime that really talented and exciting young singers and musicians don't get opportunities like Ms Jones. Of course, having the great Ravi Shankar as your father does help!I wonder how many people who raved about this album have now changed their minds?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORAH JONES!THIS CD IS TOO BORING AND BLAND!","review":"This cd is boring.I listened to it.I WOULD NOT BUY IT.Save your money.Buy the VERY BEST OF CHER or BROADWAY MY WAY-LINDA EDER CD.CHER cds and LINDA EDER CDS are 100 times better.You wont be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to fall a sleep?","review":"Romantic easy short cuts, great for romantic movie backgroundMakes you sleepy,You won't notice the different in between songsVery flat arrangementsI hate it, same setbacks than Diana Krall except Dianna has great legs...Go for Stacey Kent if you are looking for great vocal jazzlittle culural note:She is one Ravi Shankar's daughters.The sitar player, who taught George Harrison to play the sitar and who played with the Beatles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the grammies","review":"I don't know what suddenly made Norah Jones the biggest artist of the year and sold millions of copies and won a jackpot of grammies. Did people forget about Jazz music? and now suddenly when there are few artists making jazz they decided to go for this. So called critics even compared her to Billie Holiday. But Norah Jones music is neither Jazz nor comparable to Billie Holiday. Sure the album is diffrent from the rest, and that's perhaps why it was hyped up. The music industry needed something diffrent to increase their budgets. \\"Come away with me\\" is a pretty dull album in general. A few decent songs but far from as unique as beeing said in the papers. Go find some real jazz albums instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soothing or Boring?","review":"I guess there's no accounting for taste, so maybe I'll try to stick to the facts. This is an album of soft, poofy jazz-like softness, sparse instrumentation and homogeneous arrangments that do not make a statement. She sings competently with a breathy style, doing the exact same thing the exact same way. All the songs are pretty much exactly the same.If that's what you are into then you'll dig this. Personally, I'm into songs that have definite parts, and albums that have definite songs. I'm not impressed with Grammy winners. I like music.I had an Algebra teacher in high school that spoke in the same monotone for 55 minutes. You reaction to that will be your reaction to this record. Soothing...comforting...unchallenging...bland...it's an insomnia cure for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant, but what's all the fuss about?","review":"The industry is hungering for a beautiful, young icon to take up the torch (literally) of the old classic styles. Unfortunately, this hunger blinds them to the mediocrity of this particular release. A couple of the tracks are quite pleasant but otherwise the music is boring (think Yanni.) I saw her live and her stage presence was limp at best. One of the reviewers here wrote \\"This girl is HOT!!!\\" If she weren't 22 and beautiful, would anyone be listening? Oh well, maybe I'm just jaded. Certainly there are a lot of popular singers out there with worse voices!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rising young diva","review":"Nora Jones is a rising young star with a sultry voice of an old soul. The entire CD is amazing. The music puts you in the mood..and you know what I mean. If you like that bluesy sound, then you will enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it Jazz - or is it not Jazz?","review":"I listen to all kinds of music. In my car's CD case I have Dave Brubeck sittin' right next to Sammy Hagar, Georgia Sattelites, Memphis Slim and John Scofield.So is Norah Jones jazz? Yes. And no. If I had to pigeonhole this album, I'd call it dreamy-pop-jazz-folk.Yes, it's all dreamy and slow, with a minimalist approach to arranging... And so what? It's perfect for a rainy afternoon or a latenight drive on the highway.Her voice is soothing and stylish. Not a real powerhouse singer, but she's got a nice timbre.I read somewhere that she jokingly commented her next album was going to be death metal music. Personally I hope to see some more uptempo stuff on her next disc.Some might argue that this album's monotonous. Others (like me) will say that the songs flow into one another seemlessly.Anyway, I personally am charmed by this CD and I do hope to hear more of her in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being a JAZZ fan is a lonely life!","review":"Like many others have stated, it's certainly refreshing to have a release of this caliber sell through the roof. Whatever kind of singer you want to call Norah, she certainly has talent. When the album first came out, she was actually labeled and filed in the JAZZ sections of record stores, which her label Blue Note sadly realized was the kiss of death. She quickly got relocated to the pop section and the great word of mouth made this one of the best (and best selling) releases of the year. My only wish would be for those who are enchanted by Norah's music to check out other deserving vocalists, such as Cassandra Wilson and Kevin Mahogany, who like Norah are hard to classify but have talent to burn. If sales of Cassandra and Kevin could be Norahesque, then 2003 would get off to a great start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like you Norah, I am Baffled!","review":"At the Grammy awards, which she swept for some inexplicable reason, Norah Jones expressed amazement at her success with this CD. Well Norah, I would have to agree! After listening to the first four tracks, I could not take it any more. I really do not understand this woman's appeal, singing style, whatever you want to call it. I was totally underwhelmed. She is clearly a product of promotion. And I bought into it, big time. I succumbed and bought the CD. Oh well...If you, too, get the urge, listen to the brief track segments online first before making the plunge. Next time I will do that myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful voice-but a little disappointed","review":"Norah has a lovely voice, but I was expecting a sound truer to the jazz genre. Her sound fits more closely in the folk category. If I knew this prior to purchasing the CD, more than likely I would not have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty But Boring","review":"She has a beautiful voice, btu does nothing special with it or her material. I know she's extremely popular, but so was Lawrence Welk."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know why!","review":"What a great album. I can't listen to this one enough. Her voice is like silk and is perfect to just relax to. The production is also very clean and easy on the ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully soothing and relaxing","review":"I purchased this cd having only heard two of the tracks (Come Away With Me and Don't Know Why) and was positively thrilled with the rest of the offerings. I would recommend this to anyone looking to unwind or just enjoy living in the moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The phenom Ms Jones","review":"This is such an outstanding production, so much better than the later(I think) CD. Miss Jones should be careful which guitar players back her up. She should stick to Bill Frizell or maybe she should try Mark Knoffler, if she can get him away from Emmy Lou."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why music keeps amazing me","review":"Do you know where Norah Jones was 12 months, or even 6 months ago? I don't either. Once or twice a year an album comes along, out of the blue, that just blows you away. It's what makes music such a great art. \\"Come Away With Me\\" is one of those albums. Don't be scared by the \\"jazzy\\" label people throw on Norah Jones. This simply is a collection 14 songs, 45 min., of beautifully polished and intimate songs.The best songs on the album are the opener \\"Don't Know Why\\", the Hank Williams cover \\"Cold Cold Heart\\", the title track (one of the Norah Jones-penned tracks), and \\"Painter Song\\" (one of several songs by bassist (and beau) Lee Alexander). If you like to be surprised, or if you simply like great music, whatever style, then by all means buy this! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserved Every Grammy---","review":"I thought this album was amazing-- there isnt a song that i say i did not enjoy on it-- her timing when she sings is one of a kind and it is amazing. I love the smoky and soulful twing to her voice and needless to say, her band and songwriters are nothing short of genious. The hype is the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come Away and Breathe the Free Air","review":"Most music today is claustrophobic. This project is skillful but simple. The simplicity of the work is remarkable. When was the last time you heard a drummer play a set with brushes? When is the last time you heard musicians respect each other's space and not compete for dominance? This is a wonderful cd that teaches us to respect every musician. Each is heard. Each part fits together like a jigsaw puzzle. The songs are great. The arrangements are great. The musicians are great. Norah's vocals are unbelievable. The cd is a classic. Come away and be enchanted by this wondeful project. Come away and breathe the free air."},{"rating":"2","title":"let it play","review":"It's a pleasant surprise to buy a cd that doesn't require skipping certain tracks to enjoy. The only problem I see is that I could have had a few more songs to chill to ...I just make sure the \\"continuous play\\" mode is set, and I'm good for several hours. Truly original voice and seamless fusion of jazz and a bit of country (and I don't tend to like country) make for a unique vibe that stands out from the rest of the music scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly","review":"I saw this lovely creature on late night television once and was compelled to buy the cd and see what else was on it... I am amazed. Norah has such a sweet and beautiful voice. I am not really into a lot of the \\"new\\" jazz artists, usually I just stick with the classics, but this disc has not been far from the cd player since I purchased it. Definately worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jones on the Radio","review":"Recently I was travelling down the interstate late on a Monday night listening to the local UW-Milwaukee radio station. I was flipping through the stations searching for something good to listen to. Upon hearing \\"Don't Know Why\\", the dial stopped spinning as I was intently listening to her radio interview. She followed up that track by playing the title track, \\"Come Away with Me\\". There is a very unique quality to her voice and the music gels with it very well. I like its mellow quality and would recommend the CD to anyone who can appreciate music period."},{"rating":"1","title":"A voice that doesn't do the songs justice.","review":"-A word to the wise: This album is overrated.This album fell short of my expectations. While the song list is good, the voice that sings them is not. It is raspy, monotone and lacking emotion. After repeated listening, striving to find the element that bewitched the Grammy judges, Norah's voice failed to grow on me; instead, it began to sound like fingernails on a chalkboard.Sorry, Norah, keep working at polishing that voice.Instead of falling for all the hype behind this album, take a good look at Eva Cassidy, a 'newbie' just like Norah Jones. The only thing that separates Eva from Norah is the voice; refreshing, full of colour and emotion. Eva's singing skills far surpassed those of Norah (she passed away in 1996), and is well worth a listen.-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go away with Norah Jones","review":"I don't understand why Norah Jones is so big and impressive. She didn't even write her big hit \\"Don't Know Why,\\" yet garnished a lot of Grammys for it anyway! In my opinion this girl is an overrated performer; Vanessa Carlton definitely should've walked away from the 2003 Grammys with Song of the Year for her very own penned \\"A Thousand Miles;\\" Avril Lavigne's \\"Complicated\\" hit was even a better choice than Jones's \\"Don't Know Why\\" tune. I think Norah is talented but I think the pop market isn't her cup of tea. Like I said already, folks - an overall boring listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Man's Rickie Lee Jones","review":"Pop music is in a pretty bad state if this is what is being hyped. She's not bad, not untalented and possibly has a lot of potential, but you may find she's no big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"What a boring CD. I played once put it away. Played it again just because....... still not impressed. Gave it away, My friend gave it back.Don't waist your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Dont know why","review":"I bought this album. Only two songs that are good the rest all sound the same with very little to nothing to offer. I am trying to find someone I know who truly thinks that his was a good album. Unfortunately, I have been looking for quite some time. Still do not know what to do with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good cd","review":"I own this cd and love it.I love Noahs music.I highlyrecommend also BROADWAY MY WAY BY LINDA EDER.LINDA EDERis an incredible vocalist.Linda EDER can BELT out a songand hold a note for a long time.Buy BROADWAY MY WAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the stop button please....","review":"A co-worker of mine played this cd at work during a quietevening shift. After 10 minutes of listening to this womengo on and on in that monotone voice, I was ready to scream,\\"somebody help me\\"! Now, this is just my opinion, but jeese,I thought that cd would never end. This cd gets irritating afterfive minutes of play. But that's just my opinion. I would not buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy smooth jazz....","review":"Corinne Bailey Rae is attempting a Norah Jones imitation,but is better with her hit single \\"Put your record on\\" because she is spirited.She's evoking Billie Holiday in her songs&it; shows.In \\"Come away with me\\",Norah Jones sings sappy,overdone love songs.They're not so much romantic as melodramatic.Each song SOUNDS THE SAME.I worked at a job where my boss played this album OVER AND OVER.This album is supposed to have retro appeal,but it is an attempt to be blues from back in the day,and it doesn't succeed.The songs lack variety,and Norah Jones' singing style is grating rather than seductive.If you enjoy divas,go for Bebel Gilberto,Angelique Kidjo,India.Arie,the early Enya albums--but this is worth skipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grammy ? How?","review":"It is beyond me how this CD sold 8 million copies but that being said I should be in the studio now. I am a talented entertainer and I could produce a better product on my worst day. I am not trying to be arrogant but this work is methodic without any variations. I am quite disappointed that I bought it. The only track worth it's salt is the single that was played on the radio.Good Luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think to go somewhere else","review":"This is vapid. Music for people who think they should listen to jazz. You know, stuff you put on to make people think you are hip and so it is in background while you try out your moves. I think it is more the double entendre of the first hit. Yes, I suppose it is funny, but at some point you have to look at it musically, where it falls flat. I rate as one star as a jazz CD, but maybe two or three if you just want to pretend to be in an elevator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snorah Jones","review":"Overhyped, and highly overated album. Just more proof of the out of touch with reality mentality of the Grammy's. Great for insomniacs, also great if you want to hear the same song over and over. Where has good taste gone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't even get to listen to this thing","review":"I tried to download the music to my office computer and then found out it cannot be done. When I switched to my own laptop. It showed as Downloaded. So I never get to listen to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but I can't get past the fifth track","review":"I wouldn't say this album is particularly dissapointing unless of course you had very high expectations due to unrealistic promotion by the music business claiming she's the next big thing; in which case you probably deserved to get ripped off anyway. No, my low rating is not due to lack of quality - it's more the lack of soul; soul being an intangible thing which you cannot mimmick - sorry Norah. Due to this lack of soul I keep dozing off halfway through track 5 - the furthermost point I have got in the album. She's sort of mastered the technicalities of her art but not given enough of her soul; maybe she needs to slum it for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Norah Jones is not really anything special. Her songs all sound similar and most are quite bland. Norah Jones is not what I'd call a jazz singer. Her songs are pop with jazz influences."},{"rating":"1","title":"An intriguing voice with nothing to say","review":"Norah has a beguiling voice, to say the least, and her piano playing is strong and confident. However, the songs on this CD are bland and boring, for the most part, and Norah doesn't do anything special with the songs that are decent: THE NEARNESS OF YOU is about par with most piano bar performers' renditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down","review":"After reading all the hype about this new artist, I ran out to get Ms. Jones' debut CD. I usually purchase about 60-70 CD's per year. \\"Come Away With Me\\" is by far the most boring recording I have purchased in the last five years. Blessed with an above average voice, Ms. Jones could not have picked more boring material than she did for her debut recording. This music drags on and absolutely puts me to sleep. This CD sounds like one continuous song with 15 pauses in it. There is very little variation from song to song and the musicians play a very uninspired background role. The lyrics are weak and I do not hear the Jazz/blues connection that everyone is writing about. After multiple listenings, this recording falls somewhere between below average country music and second grade blues - This one goes into the resale stack. Don't believe the hype. Save your money and check out Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves - now they will put a smile on your face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and Sweet","review":"This album is not profound or genius-level but is very uplifting and makes me feel good every time I listen. Many of the cuts are very good arrangements that showcase Ms Jones' talents extremely well. This is a welcome change from the usual manufactured pop that dominates these days. Thanks Nora for sticking to what you do best."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah.........","review":"I'm with these other folks. I don't get the hype. Her vocals and interpretations aren't that remarkable. The only thing I did like was the recording quality - not a lot of production, very minimal and sparse. However, I dont think that's worth the price of the record. Try Diana Krall, or Bebel Gilberto. I seriously doubt anyone will remember these covers after the dust settles."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh sooo mellow, baby","review":"Norah got like 7 someodd Emmys for this album, and she and the producers earned it. nothing like it. OK, she reminds me of a white Nina Simone. sultry, soft, sexy, and - well - mellow. love it.i play this CD at work and everyone loves it. in fact if there is a day that all the customers are being poopy - we put the CD on to calm every one down, and yes, it works!!good for fussy husbands too (sorry, hunk man, the love of my life!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Norah Jones","review":"I'm not much of a jazz lover; but I heard so many great things about this person Norah Jones, so I gave her a try. What was the big deal? Her voice is ok; I really didn't like this album too much. I did like \\"Don't Know Why\\", \\"Come Away With Me\\" and a few other ones, but that was it. I didn't what was so great about this album, but like I said, I really don't like jazz but I give any type of music a try; and this is not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snorah Jones - just another Natalie Merchant [copy]","review":"Where can I start. First of all, \\"Don't Know Why\\" is the best song on this album. The rest of the songs blend into what seems to be the same repeated chords and lyrics. There is way better talent out there, and Norah got the Grammy's left and right, while that may be the case, I'm sure she cannot top her success with her next album. It's a good album, but she is totally copying Natalie Merchant. The piano, the looks, the shyness, etc. Just my heartfelt feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"All the songs are the same. Same tempo, minimal backing, similar vocal phrasing. I respect Jone's talent, but give me some spark! Maybe for a dinner pary or something, but for concentrated listening it doesn't cut it. I need some soul, baby! Maybe she has it, but I'm missing any sense of urgency or a sense that she's experienced stuff in her life. Maybe with age or a different song selection we'll see some more energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a really good first start!","review":"Nice voice and nice lyrics. Sometimes a little country, but good overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora Jones's voice has it all","review":"You will be impressed by this an amazingly talented young singer. She sings like a master with her jazzy, bluezzy, saultry and sexy voice. She sings with such passion. I never heard such wonderful and delightful voice like Nora Jones. Buy her CD now.

She rocked I loved her voice and that she's so real about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am hooked","review":"I purchased this CD yesterday after hearing \\"Don't Know why\\" & \\"Come Away With me\\" for a couple of weeks on the local jazz station here in St. Louis. Norah Jones, is just amazing and she has a very unique sound which separates her from all of the rest. I am a big fan and cannot wait to see her in concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"MONOTONE!","review":"This CD is for those who have trouble sleeping. The first release song\\" Don't know why\\" is the only good thing about this CD. I wanted to love it but could not get past the monotone vocals and sad music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grammy Gold","review":"This CD was better than the endless hours of radio play it received but not good enough to upset the hard work and dedication real singer/songwriters such as Bruce Springsteen have given us for over 30 years. The songs are nice if you're strapped in the backseat of your Father's Oldsmobile with windows that only roll down half-way. But if you are between the ages of 0-60 put this CD on your funeral-setlist and until then listen to likeable, knowledgable, creative, artistic, resourceful, eye-popping, heart-stopping, earthshakin', earthquakin', pants-droppin', Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band. What were the Grammy people thinking when they voted?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible voice, but shoot the drummer","review":"Norah Jones is the Billie Holiday/Eva Cassidy/Nina Simone of today. Voice, timbre, phrasing, articulation are all outstanding. She communicates and fascinates, thoroughly sings real songs and writes them too.I predict a bright future for Norah immediately after she dumps the guy on the desk who thinks we bought this album to hear a drummer and the bored session musicians holding her back.Buy this album for those tracks where her voice gets top billing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept Growing On Me Until 5 Star Sensation","review":"I liked this album at first but thought it was overhyped. Now that I've listened to it a great deal more, I've become a fan. Jones really has a very seductive, beguiling voice that works its magic on the listener time and again. It is hard to imagine anyone not being moved by \\"Come Away With Me\\" and \\"Don't Know Why.\\" She also does a magnificent rendition of \\"The Nearness of You,\\" which I thought had already been done to death. I was wrong. I don't like her father's music (Ravi Sankar) and probably wouldn't have listened to her if I'd known they were related (assuming, wrongly, that they'd sound the same). Jones won 5 Grammys via this recording and I'm not surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing and Quiet","review":"I like this cd because when I listen to it the music relaxes me. It puts you in a mellow mood. My favorite tracks are: Come Away With Me, Turn Me On, Shoot the Moon, and The Long Day is Over. The others are good, but this ones really stand out to me. Norah's voice is really great. She never oversings or screams in the songs, If you want music that is soothing, but this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Promise for the Future","review":"I never tire of this CD. Every song is terrific. Along with Jane Monheit and Diana Krall, we're lucky to have three outstanding talents at work right now. Along with Diana, Norah plays the piano and has a rich musical heritage. I am eagerly awaiting her 2nd album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"LOVE the product!

I bought it thinking that it would work on Xbox 360 as do most other original Xbox games. Unfortunately it doesn't work on Xbox 360. The backwards compatibility doesn't work.

Not only do you have Bird doing some serious jamming but a whole line-up of the top jazz players of the period: Johnny Hodges, Oscar Peterson, and Ben Webster to name a few. The ballad medley is excellent as each player gets a song to show their stuff on, but the biggest reasons to buy this disc are the songs \\"Jam Blues\\" and \\"Funky Blues\\" which are really just extended jam sessions where all the players really get to stretch out. I would recommend buying this disc in the newly released box set titled \\"The Norman Granz Jam Sessions.\\" Not only do you get this disc, but four others with all star line-ups that include Oscar Peterson, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz, Roy Eldridge, Lionel Hampton, Count Basie, Ben Webster, Johnny Hodges, and Buddy Rich to name a few. So do yourself a favor and pick up the box set ASAP. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for the Price","review":"My son is 2 1/2 and love Blues Clues, so this book was a win.

It had none of the insightful, suspenseful twists that I have enjoyed in his other books. And it had no ending, it simply stopped which was to be expected as it really seemed more of a germ of an idea for a story as opposed to being a good story.I'll read his future books, but I don't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"I have a rule ... once I start a book I have to finish it. This was painful - this book is not bad ... it is horrible. Every page was a chore to get through. I picked up this book because I thought Genesis Code was such a fantastic book - while I read this one - I kept thinking - there is no way this is the same writer. So I went on line and did a search - it turns out that JOHN CASE is actually a husband and wife team.If a husband and wife team decides to write a book - admit it - hiding behind this pseudonymn is insulting to readers. I regret the two days I wasted on this piece of trash. I will never again pick up a \\"John Case\\" book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible depth and suspense","review":"The Murder Artist is an excellent journey of mystery, suspense, and a whole lot of knowledge. The best thing about all John Case novels is RESEARCH! They go out of their way to develop some really intricate, complex plots that really become a learning experience wrapped in a really great story. The last book by the authors, The Eighth Day, just didn't live up to the realism and thought out plots but The Murder Artist definitely makes up for it.The story centers around a journalist whose children have been kidnapped. Rather than waiting around and crying daily on TV like other parents he decides to do something about it. Here the Murder Artist takes off and you'll delve into suck topics as magic, origami, voodoo, carnivals, and the mind of evil. It's all there.Read the Murder Artist and you'll suddenly find yourself not only thrilled and entertained, but you'll learn a LOT of really interesting stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drags out...ending, where !!!","review":"I just was trying a new author and so once I start a book, I finish it.

It has its faults, it is hard to beat but is that wrong. When someting is hard, I found more replay value in it. The controls are a little off but not bad. Just run through the missions while just passing the checkpoints to get a idea of what to do. When you are done you will accomplished something that was hard. The stunt stadium is a very fun part when you make you own stunts. When you get mad, just calm down and try it again.

The PROBLEM with this game is you are paid to do scenes EXACTLY as the director wants you to.You are never given any set up as to how the stunt will go! you just hop in the car and hope you can do as instructed a split second before you get there, and if you miss, you'll be starting the scene over. basically you need to do each stunt over and over until you can get through every part perfectly. NOT FUN!!! the ONLY thing this game has going for it is the graphics, which I quickly lost sight of with frustration.This game is made by Atari, and Reflections. the makers of the great detruction derby games. Sorry guys YOU BLEW IT THIS TIME!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR Disappointment","review":"I saw the commercials for this game and the game looked awesome. Until I bought it. I played it over and over again trying to just get past my first stunt.

Believe me, the only cool part about this game is the commercials."},{"rating":"2","title":"two words stuntman rocks","review":"I think this game is awesome because you do stunts that are in movies and after you do them you see them on the movie and if you don't get stuntman you got a bad game"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this game if you like Grand Theft Auto 3","review":"I concur with the negative reviews. To echo: no checkpoints, disappointing graphics, annoying long static screens between attempts, short missions that don't forgive tiny mistakes. The game is worthy only of a PS1 console (four years ago) and it is the first video game that made my thumb hurt (X button for accelerate) since Enduro by Activision 20 years ago. I am gleeful that I only RENTED it after seeing the slick ads on television."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, waste your money somewhere else","review":"This game is super bad. It is difficult and very frustrating. Unlike some games where the challenge is figuring out the puzzle, this game makes you repeat and repeat the same move over and over. The load times are very long and very frequent. I'm sure if you spent years you could get good at it. In my opinion, a game has to be a little fun at first or who else but a masochist will want to play it.This game literally made me furious. To be fair, driving games usually aren't my cup of tea, but this game is a real turd. The graphics are good, not great, but solid. The only good thing about this game is that I rented it.If you like extremely hard driving games that take months to master, then this is right up your alley. If you like games that are fun and that you can play the first night without getting very angry, then stay away from this game.I hated it, I'm going to rent Way of the Samuri again, that is an awesome game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God for Blockbuster","review":"I am so glad I rented this game before I bought it. It is awful. It is so hard and there is no way to change it. In fact, even when the do finally complete a mission, usually after hours and hours of frustration, you figure out it wasn't fun. This game is just not fun. You cannot make a single mistake or you have to start all over and the load times are unbearably long. After 2 days of having it, I took it back. You have no idea what you are supposed to do until you have failed the mission 5 or 6 times. Also, when you have to chase a car, nothing happens to it but all of the AI cars try and hit you. It is rediculous.Do yourself a favor and get something else, anything else if you want a good game because this one will do nothing but frustrate and annoy you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst 50 bucks I ever spent...Sooo Disappointed!","review":"The game is a great idea but it has been created totally wrong.

If you enjoy stupid time limits, and having to start over from the beginning EVERY SIMGLE time you make a mistake, (AND TRUST ME YOU'LL DO THAT ALOT...I'M NOT KIDDING) and then waiting 10 to 20 seconds for the game to restart then you'll probably like the game.

It is pleasing to the eye, the graphics are really clean and well done, but the gameplay is so painfully difficult that the only thing I found enjoyable was turning off the machine and boxing the disc back up for rental return.I spent a couple hours trying to get past the difficulty hoping I would get the hang of it after a little bit. NOPE! This game should be played only by people with extreme patients, and professional gaming skill, not for the mass of gamers who want to simply have fun.The grossly inadequate amount of time given to complete each stunt will either make you really excited to try harder or really angry and want to snap the disc in two, set it on fire, and mail the unrecognizable clump back to the cruel game developers.The game is a rental at best for about %80 of the gamers out there.

I returned my copy the same day I got it. I've played annoying games before, but nothing like this. The point of the game is that you're a stuntman doing car stunts for movies. Sounds cool, eh? Yeah, I thought so too, until I played the game and after making the smallest mistake during my run I had to sit through a really long load time, JUST TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN! The part I played before and after the loading was really cool and really fun, I just don't want to play a game where I watch the load screen more than I have a chance to enjoy my playing. If they came out with a \\"No or next-to-zero load time\\" I would go and get that right away.

Each level or scene, has about 10 stunts to do. in the VERY first scene, u have to go FULL speed and do a 180. First, you have to have the right car or you will end up failing the mission. If you go a couple of mph less than the full speed of the car than you wont jump high enough and the director wont like it. Also, I found myself doing VERY close to a 180 but it didnt count cuase i missed by a couple of degrees.

I play the occasional game. I thought Stuntman looked like fun, all those cool stunts similar to the movies I grew up watching. However, after several hours of frustration I had managed to complete only a couple of stunts. The cars handle badly, the timing is very hard, even little things like a road sign stop your car like a steel wall. The reload time is terrible.

The point of the game is to do car chase scenes in stupidly named movies. This is where the frustration kicks in. First you have to endure long load times just to hear the stunt's name. Then you wait again for the scene to begin. They expect you to do the scene perfectly right off the bat. You don't even get a practice lap or even a layout of the scene. The cars handle exactly the same. The guy who tells you what to do is sometimes late leading you to crash and run out of time. I found myself doing the same scene for 2 hours just to unlock a car and stunt piece for the stunt editor. It would be worth it if only the stunt editor was fun. This game was overhyped just like MGS2:SoL. Go buy Medal of Honor:Frontline instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give this game negative stars.","review":"This game stinks. They have a great graphics engine, and an awesome idea, and its so annoying. The director is verbally abusive, and you would never be expected to land 20 stunts in a row perfectly. Each part would be choreographed, and walked through before filming. You can NEVER get it on the first, second, third, or even fourth cut because you don't even have an idea about which way to go, you have to learn it as you go along.

They know nothing about the gaming experience fun. ...-Ira"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good game for patient gamers.","review":"This game is sometimes very hard, but a patient gamer should be able to enjoy it. The stunt constructor is cool, but you're only allowed to put a small number of ramps and toys in the arena at one time.

The graphics for one are basically just the same as driver for psone except for some cutscenes. The controls are poor and there is no way to change them. Apparently if u r going in reverse, u cannot use the e-brake. The gameplay itself is original but it just gets monotonous with no real storyline. U can build your own stunt arena and screw around there, but that is the high point of the game.

I end up playing each level 15 or more times before I can beat them. If you ask me it ruins some of the things that should be fun like crushing cars in a monster truck rally. You are timed, so it makes it even harder, and I assure you that if you don't have a lot of patience, you'll end up burning the CD.

But the biggest problem with the game is that if you make the slightest mistake during a take, you have to start over again.

Wrestlers can only do four main moves from the grapple and you have to use the control stick instead of the d-pad. On top of this, the music during gameplay is absolutely terrible. I turned the music off to be less annoyed only to find that the game is practically silent when its off. The crowd barely makes a sound when you perform a good move and is ABSOLUTELY silent when you perform other moves. You get the feeling like your wrestling in an empty stadium!!

Each wrestler only has 10 grappling moves. (5 from front, 5 from back). And a special move. The control is okay. It is annoying when you try to pick up weapons. You have to press A+X at the same time. There is no story mode/career mode. There is a battle for the belts. All you do is an amount of matches until you face the champion. Don't even try a fatal four way match. Every opponent will go after you the whole match. There is about every match type. Cage, ladder, hell in a cell, single, tag, tlc, and hardcore, table.

And since I haven't found a good enough game to stand even close to No Mercy, I hate the Smackdown series, this was even a bigger dissappointment. It's just like Smackdown, a nice button mashing game where you just frantically press buttons which takes no skills what so ever. Forget about using low tier wrestlers against the Rock, I did about 20 Eye of the Hurricanes on him and he still got up. The more then 1 on 1 wrestlers matches [stink] cause there is no way to knock out the other wrestlers long enough to get a pin.

The music for some of the wrestlers is not in the game (nWo for instance) and it detracts from the entrances a little. (Rob Van Dam's new theme is in the game though :) The roster is deeper than the ocean, and it is the main reason that I bought the game. (Even the invasion wrestlers are there!!)

There are some great players like Hogan, Triple H, Regal, Stonecold, Kane, Trish, Stacey, Stephanie McMahon, Vince McMahon, Kurt Angle, Edge, The Undertaker, and many many more. But unbelievably they don't have Marc Henry, Randy Orton, or, at least unlockable, Andre the Giant. I'm probably gonna wait for Smackdown 4 to come out to get it with Rey Mysterio. The graphics are also unbelievable in this game.

THQ spent way too much time worrying about the graphics and sound quality, and didn't give hardly enough matches or environments.

He did indeed take serial and aleatoric composition beyond the level they had confortably settled in in a way similar to the tonal-structural revolution that Monteverdi initiated in his works of the early Baroque period. But he never was satisfied with surface dazzle, as was his contemporary Penderecki. His sound structures are based on profound musico-mathematic scaffolds of hitherto unrealized brillance that only he could have, and indeed did, formulate. Xenakis ranks with Stravinsky, Webern, and Cage as one of the four most advanced and most brilliant composers of the 20th century.

I have these shoes in tan and in black, and even though they seem to be made very well, the ankle strap is dangerous. I twisted my ankle while wearing the shoe, and ended up with a severe break of two bones (fibula and tibia) in my ankle. I feel that the shoe was the cause of my twisting my ankle because the ankle strap cannot be tightened. The velcro on the ankle strap has to fit exactly over the other side of the velcro on the shoe itself to close properly. If the ankle strap was adjustable, the shoe would be a great shoe. But beware!

I could not find any information in the various submarine books that have been written, until I discovered Admiral Davenport's book in my local library. Aside from the book being extremely boring, I found it interesting that the Admiral disliked Clay Blair's description of him in his book 'Silent Victory'. I got the impression that the only reason Davenport wrote his book was to defend himself over Blair's portrayal. What do you expect from a former Journalist? The book for the most part reads like a series of patrol reports, nothing original. The O'Kane or Fluckey books are a much better read. Fortunately, the book is available in most libraries. I don't see the publisher printing a second edition anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"fluffy and cute","review":"Im new at planting stuff, and just shoved a sprinkling of these seeds into two pots on my balcony around March, and up came a lot of green grass over the next few months and then came outside one morning to see stems and little fluffy white balls on them.

I always say \\"There's nothing like learning from the BEST\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for kids","review":"I thought this book would be a little creative. I was wrong. The book is weak for a couple of reasons: first, instead of teaching how to draw specific elements that make these characters it shows how to draw individual entries. So if your child wants to learn how to draw a viking, (s)he will only see one perspective and nothing more. No technique on how to draw the helmet, the garb etc.. Second, the book doesn't follow basic techniques to learn how to draw. In my opinion this book should be for 5 year olds in the house that are tired of coloring books. Buy a Jack Hamm book if you want to learn how to draw!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhelp for any artist","review":"I bought this book because it had decent reviews and I collect drawing books. There is no explanation for any of the steps nor reasoning as to why the author is choosing the random lines to \\"progress\\" his drawing. As a schooled artist, I found myself staring at each step baffled as to why the author belives this book will help people learn.It's no wonder this particular Draw 50 book does not allow you to search inside the book. If it did more people would realize it is not what they are looking for.I did take a glance through some of the other books in the Draw 50 series, (How to draw Animals, How to draw aliens) and they seemed to be more put together than this book. This one could be the bad apple in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality DVD Player","review":"This player died on me after only two months.

And the P-scan is degrading, getting worse. You'd be better of with the cheap coby brand--(at least it worked well for 2 or 3 years) at least you know when it is dying, rather that this slow death.

Having read Reed's amazing erotic classic, The Pleasure Chateau, & seeing how much Lautremont had influenced his style in that book, I was certain that a book by Reed dealing directly with Lautremont himself would be something extraordinary. I was extremely disappointed to read this dull, minutely over-analyzed fictionalized *report* on Lautremont's not-all-that-interesting comings & goings, relationship with his father, etc. Perhaps if I hadnt had such high expectations for the book I would have liked it better, but somehow I doubt that, for I wasnt even compelled to finish it. For that reason alone, I give it two stars, figuring it would be unfair under the circumstances to give it any less...and on the chance that Reed, who I still admire greatly for The Pleasure Chateau, might have done *something* of interest, eventually, with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read The Original And Skip This One","review":"The implication here is that in this book--told from the point of view of the brilliant Isidore Ducasse, the future writer of Maldoror--Jeremy Reed will show the reader that he is quite up to the task of reproducing the mad, visionary, surreal style of the original. He isn't. What he does deliver is 144 pages of clotted prose seasoned with hints, guesses, a few facts, a few interesting tropes. Skip this book and go directly to the original, or, if you can't read French, purchase the Complete Works in the Lykiyard translation from Exact Change Publishers.

This earlier work is much cleaner and it really showcases their awesome musicianship and vocal talent. We use this music in our ballet class as well as Alison Krauss and Union Station. We found one of Nickle Creeks later CDs not as beautiful to listen too and not able to use for our dance classes.

My base WiFi router is a D-Link DL-524 and all played nice together. I'm in a modest two bedroom Condo with the cable modem and router up next to the TV and my computer is back in the bedroom with me. Not exactly me telling you that it works even in huge 16 room mansion but you should have no problem finding a place to hide the router and have the computer be wireless somewhere in the average home. Install of the pci card was simple plug and play.It is a little pricey but it is guaranteed to work with a Mac Computer and it does.

I have spoken to him about hisfuture book recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"He was much better before FAME and EDITORS","review":"I studied the early writings of Mr. Hillman, as a student in Vermont. He was once a real genius, original and gutsy if more incomprehensible. Then, some editor got him to \\"make sense\\" And in the Soul's Code, I suppose he did, in a pablum-ish way. But this book? I couldn't make nor head nor tails of its structure or meaning. Where o where did the gods put this man's genius? Or rather, what price was he willing to take to his great writing to render this mess? Well, because he is a great author in the past, i cannot give him one star. But for anyone else, i'd give this none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I wasted my money","review":"Instead of buying this book all you have to do is read the summary and you'll have the whole idea. He uses about 1000 words for every one that he needs, just to state the obvious, over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very interesting book","review":"Hillman once again underachieves with this one. He wrote some brilliant stuff in the 1970s -- but I guess that was when he was 30 years younger. His writing has deteriorated over the years, and his creativity seems to have gone limp. You have to wonder why the man -- who is, or was, brilliant -- continues to embarrass himself with the string of bland books he has turned out in recent years. An appearance on Oprah Winfrey helped put his previous book on the bestseller list, although the returns of his book to his publisher were allegedly very high and the \\"bestseller\\" status was a fluke created by orders from bookstores (like the one I manage). One of the other reviewers said \\"ho-hum\\" or something like that, and once again it is true. Maybe his next book should be channelled messages from Carl Jung or seomthing -- at least that would be more fun to read than this book. And maybe more inspiration, too, for members of my advanced age group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum","review":"Glad I got this book for free. I would have cursed myself for spending money on it. Haven't we heard all this someplace else before? There are far better books on the experience of aging. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ideas, but....","review":"I purchased Force of Character because a series of things happened that indicated to me that this was something I should do. I heard two radio interviews with Hillman within a short time and found his ideas resonated and were presented very accessibly; and my mother in law, who is having a lot of trouble adjusting to many aspects of aging, was visiting. Great, I thought. This is stuff I need to explore.Having read the book, I still find the ideas compelling and important, but my hopes of being able to give it to my mother in law to gently urge her to appreciate where she is were dashed by the self indulgence and turbidity of the writing. I'm glad I read the book, I appreciate the new outlook on aging it's helped me move toward, I'm sure it will figure in many conversations with friends. But I wish it had been written with more grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy at its best !","review":"This book would make you wonder \\"Where was Gregory Keyes all along\\"? The plot is dark, complicated, powerful and intense. It is adult fantasy at its best.Having seen the rise and fall of many a fantasy writer getting bogged down by their creations, this book is a refreshing and welcome change. The story is unique and extremely well written. It will keep you hungering for more of Gregory Keyes and his other books are equally well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"The journey of a mataphysical hero","review":"This book breeds ancient myths entwined with new ones. The journey of misguided youth turns our hero Perkar into a man with a wealth of experience to confront his enemy, the Changeling. The idea of a river god eating the body of a stream goddess, as the main reason to kill the river god is just wild. The river being absolute power is one of the main themes running through, all around there is a god for every nature aspect around in this world. The background for the gods are nurtured from ancient Indian beliefs. Hezhi, a young heroine, goes through her own journey to discover her true purpose in her life. Two paths that lead to each other and both grow as individuals when they clash together in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is naive","review":"I expected a lot more than I got here. I knew him at MSU as a very bright guy who was a terrific athlete. After he recently died I ordered this book. I'm sorry to say that his scope here struck me as narrow and shallow. It's as if at some point he ceased to grow his human capital concomitant with his enormous potential. Very unlike what we might have expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Reading For Me","review":"Unfortunately, the grossly vulgar language quickly convinced me that this book was not something that I wanted to clutter my mind with.

And then it could be loosely thrown into the 'fantasy' category. Because as it is... it's just sad.Heartbreaking to see one of my favorite actors, Rutger Hauer, involved this production.

I felt it was a big let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Intrigue!","review":"I have to admit that this book started out a little slow, but the minute the pace picked up, it never slowed down until the shocking, surprising ending. If you enjoy suspense, you'll love this well-plotted tale of a dysfunctional family full of hidden secrets!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliches and drama queens","review":"This was my first novel by Ms. Fielding. Quite a disappointment, sorry to say. The protagonist inspires no empathy. I agree with other reviewers that a novel needn't have a saint or role model as the main character, but Amanda is just whiny, self-absorbed and rude. I lost count, too, of how many times she \\"whispered into her coat collar\\" or spoke out loud \\"without realizing it.\\"I can't recommend this book as there are so many well-written thrillers/courtroom dramas/mysteries to choose from. Pet peeve: the references to anti-depressants as \\"psychosis inducing\\" and a \\"nightmare world\\" really irked me. I work in mental health and I hate to see the many beneficial meds lumped in with \\"suicide pills\\". A little research would have helped!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I just started reading Fielding (A friend recommeded her to me, since I am a big Deaver, Patterson, Hoag & Kellerman fan) but Puppet was very disappointing. The ending was a little far-fetched and I expected more realism. I preferred Missing Pieces over this AND Whispers and Lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best Work by any Means!","review":"This book was one of many I've read by Joy Fielding. I've always enjoyed her work. However, this novel was easy to put down and dragged on forever with details of things I could've cared less about. The main character, Amanda, was not likeable at all. In real life, I wouldn't want to be around a woman like her. No morals, values, it's all about her. I agree with the other reviewers. The ending was a shocker, and I was surprised when I couldn't figure it out myself. Only after reading the book did I realize why I couldn't predict the ending. It was way too gross. I'm surprised the author went in this direction. If you want to read one of Joy Fielding's best novels, read GRAND AVENUE. You won't be disappointed with that one. I wouldn't recommend this novel...skip it and read something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely hated this book.","review":"Nothing about this book was appealing to me...not the style of writing, which was fractured at best and tedious at worst, certainly not the characters who got lost in their flaws and the jerky movement of sequences, and the ending was just plain disgusting, not to mention unbelievable. I know you have to suspend your disbelief for much fiction to be enjoyable, but my disbelief just won't stretch that far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Ride","review":"This is from a guy. Actually, I liked the book. I listened to it and thoroughly enjoyed it. Yeah, I yelled at her a dozen times that she was being stupid and a teeny-bopper, but I still enjoyed the read/listen. I am a lawyer and the way she reacts as a lawyer is quite realistic, but being a guy I cannot tell you if her swoon over her ex is real or contrived (it feels a bit much to me). I found the gimmick of the ancient business cards a bit -- well -- gimmicky. Still, all in all, enjoy the read read or, better yet, listen to Hick's reading of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Treat From Fielding !","review":"I have now read several of Fielding's novels. Some of her earlier work remains among my favorites, while \\"Whisper and Lies\\" (see my reviews) has one of the best endings of most books I have read. Anyway, \\"Puppet\\" was a hard one to put down, I read it in one sitting. Ms. Fielding always guarantees a page turner, and this one didn't disappoint in that regard. As usual the author also almost always presents us with a great ending as well, this ending was more than interesting to say the least, however, a little peculiar for most tastes, hence the four star rating instead of the five. I still love you Joy! Next up...Heartstopper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puppet","review":"Although a good novel, it was not as spell binding as her previous. I enjoyed the book, but by no means was it a \\"can't put down,page turner\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychological Thriller","review":"If you can get past the slow start and disagreeable heroine, this is a pretty good read.

They are eighties dance pop mavins from the gay pick up scene (think Pet Shop Boys or Bronski Beat), not surprisingly, there music has not aged well.

I found it just right for my needs. The book is simply and clearly written with sub-subject boxes scattered throughout the book with interesting tidbits of related history. This book is an excellent overview of WWI, especially if the reader wishes to avoid wading through theory and tedious extras found in other historical books. Therefore, it makes for a wonderful light read.The two negative things I would have to say about it is that I found some of the text to be a little opinionated and subjective. I also wished that there had been more scholarly citations to know where particular bits of information came from to aid readers in further research. (The author does provide a \\"Works Cited\\" page.)Overall, I definitely recommend this book, especially to those who just want a light history on WWI."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best value on the market.","review":"These pencils (especially at the $13 they cost me) are hands down the best art purchase I have made in the last year, maybe ever.

I did a side by side comparison with standard prismacolors, as well as prismacolor premiers, and the difference is almost unnoticable.

Not as good as Merlin (my fav out of Lawheads Pendragon Cycle) but still a wonderful book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last, Lawhead comes into his own...","review":"Allright, I have read three of Mr Lawhead's \\"Pendragon Cycle\\" and the first of his \\"Dragon King\\" books. Aside from MERLIN (a pretty good read), I was not altogether impressed. However, after picking this book up on a whim, I found that I couldn't put it down. The story is rivetting, and characterizations were for the most part fleshed out, neither all good or all evil as was the case in his other books. I see now that those works were merely practice for this awe-inspiring story of faith lost, then found again. I unashamedly give this book a five star review. Mr Lawhead, you have finally come into your own as an author to be reckoned with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A faith builder","review":"Having read all of Lawhead's books, I thoroughly enjoyed Byzantium. Though not a fast read, it has all the elements that makes Lawhead's works brilliant - superb writing, adventure, and a spiritual message. Byzantium's story line takes you just about everywhere. And what I enjoyed most about the book was how I was able to relate with Aidan (though I've never faced the trials he had to endure!). Byzantium is a faith builder for the believer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical fiction and adventure at its best","review":"This was not a fast read but so satisfying. When you reflect on all the adventures Aidan experienced you are tempted to say \\"how incredulous\\". Who cares, its exciting and great entertainment. However what makes it really good is the discussion of Aidan's spiritual journey. It's timely and appropriate. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling story, couldn't put it down!","review":"The most shocking part of this engrossing tale is the epilogue... when you discover that it's a TRUE STORY! It reads like a fantastic adventure novel, full of graphic, full-colored narratives that let you breathe the spice of Byzantium's open market, feel the parching wind of the Saudi desert, and hear the thrum and cry of battle. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lengthy, but enjoyable read.","review":"If there is any problem with this book it is its size. I had a hard time getting through it. I am not counting of because this is as much my fault (if not more) than the book's. When finished and after about two years to think about it. IT seems to me to be a grand historic epic in the tradition of War and Peace. It improved my reading skills immensly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Too Thrilling About This One","review":"Stephen Lawhead has hit a flat note with \\"Byzantium.\\" The details as always are vivid; however, the plot is slow and lackluster. The characters are also dull and predictable. The novel was still a great idea, and all in all, not a bad fantasy/adventure. But just too tedious, deliberate, and contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-long and unbelievable","review":"The story told in \\"Byzantium\\" is perhaps the stuff of a TV miniseries, but as a novel it is over-long (at 872 pages!), far-fetched and unbelievable, and in the end, not very gratifying. The prose is pedestrian and pedantic, and the author's attempts at descriptive language often go astray. For example, between pages 682 and 703, the main character, Aidan, has his stomach\\"squirm\\", has something someone said \\"squirm\\" in his head, and has his mind \\"squirm\\". It would appear that poor Aidan, and the poor reader, are in trouble. The novel has Aidan travelling through so many lands and so many adventures, the tale becomes a laundry list of \\"what else can I have him do now?\\" rather than a coherent narative. The novel also does injustice to the real, historical St. Aidan who became Bishop of Lindisfarne in 635. St. Aidan predated the Book of Kells (c. late seventh, early eighth century) and was never engaged to an Arab princess!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another fantasy novel limited by its author","review":"I used to like fantasy novels, but now I'm beginning to realize how flat and uninspired many are. Byzantium is no exception. Perhaps with a better author, it could have been made into something. As it is however, Byzantium wears out anyone with a curious, discerning mind. Stephen R. Lawhead appears to have hit a glass ceiling with his character descriptions: try as he might, they never become real, flesh and blood individuals. Instead they, and the world they travel through, remain two-dimensional and uninvolving. The writing style is inconsistent, and the ending was not well thought through; the author simply does not have the writing prowess to lift his novels to a higher level. Byzantium is a readily forgotten, slow read, indistinguishable from the multitudes of cheap, unbelievable fantasy novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Platic Characters and boring plot","review":"The writing was plastic, the story told with out any emotion, the characters were thinner than a piece of paper. The book is light summer reading at best. I was disappointed and found the lack of depth in all areas of the book. Perhaps my expectations were too high. Read Lonesome Dove if you want a real adventure or read Byzantium by Norwich if you want to learn something about the place. But don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that grows","review":"As a lover of his \\"Song of Albion\\", maybe I expected more. But for me, this book has been unique: Because I finished it, thinking \\"not too bad\\". But a long time afterwards I've found I often think about the story, and in my mind it has grown month by month!How can a book expand like this over time?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey of despair & suffering, faith & redemption.","review":"A beautifully written book. So powerful in language and structure that it is as if each paragraph becomes a verse in a poem drawing the reader into the emotions and wonder of the book, intertwining him with Aidan's experiences. Lawhead presents to us a journey of a boy to a man, naivety to understanding,despair to hope, doubt to faith, suffering to redemption. In short death to LIFE. His prose is so well crafted, it is reminiscent of Eco's The Name of the Rose, as well as great philosophical writers such as Augustine and Aquinas. Entertaining, instructive, enchanting and real. One of best books I have read( and I read alot). I highly recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultmate experience, get the music !","review":"I found this wonderful writer through the music I listen to.Jeff Johnson and Brian Dunning have four CD's that are inspired by Lawhead books. There titles are, Byzantium, Patrick, The Enduring Story and Songs from Albion II. I Listen to music while I read, and Johnson and Dunning's Music made reading Byzantium and Patrick the ultmate experience. Lawhead is a wonderful writer and there are plenty of reviews to this explain this fact. Get Johnson and Dunning CD's and you will really enjoy reading Lawhead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves to sell more than LORD OF THE RINGS","review":"Don't listen to the rather boring old fart below. BYZANTIUM is one of the greatest books of our time, and should be considered among the top of the list of historical fiction and fantasy. Even just Fiction! You won't be disappointed by this fabulous read. Even if he was the Vice-Gerent and not Vice-Regent. Sheesh! Semantics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting story with a successful message","review":"Lawhead's narrative has always impressed me. Contrary to what has been written here, at no point did the writing seem jerky; in fact, events flow very smoothly from one to the next, with Lawhead striking precisely the right balance between telegraphed, satisfying events and surprising plot twists. The ending is not too abrupt, for it attacks the reader as suddenly as the light of truth which dawns on Aidan. Very effective. My only concern was that some of the characters were undeveloped, especially the Arab princess; she entered the story too late and was quite unlikeable compared with the familiar and pleasant-natured Vikings. Still, another triumph for SRL."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH?","review":"Okay, I've read Stephen Lawhead's books before. I've liked them, even. That's why I got Byzantium. While reading it, I thought it was pretty good, if somewhat slow. As I neared the ending, I was wondering, \\"How is he going to finish this up? There's not enough room!\\" I was right. The book wasn't too bad, but it seems Lawhead realized his deadline was the next day and just threw something down to finish it at eleven that night."},{"rating":"2","title":"re: fantastic","review":"I just finished reading \\"Byzantium\\". It was so good, I could barely stand to put it down. It's refreshingly accurate in its history, although the characters are fictional. There was a real St. Aidan of Eire, but as far as I know, he never left the British Isles.I found this book both humorous and serious at once! Lawhead is a clever master of dialogue and description. The passages in which the Danes encounter Byzantium and intend to plunder it had me laughing out loud, while at the same time, I knew they were being serious ...This is a very well written book (a few misplaced commas, but those can be forgiven), and I recommend it highly! It definitely got me thinking about my own faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but...","review":"First of all I must say that I really, really liked this book until about page 560. Then everything just sort of went downhill from there. The ending simply wasn't very satisfying. I also really hated the way that Lawhead would write about someone or something that sounds very important and then just forget about them/it.For example: the dream that Aidan has about the amir cutting his(aidan's) tongue out. What was the meaning of writing about that? I kept expecting the amir to betray Adian and start cutting, but he never does.But all of that aside, the story is very exciting and has a good mix of action, romance, intrigue, fantasy, and moral messages. And unlike some of Lawhead's other novels (namely Taliesin), this is fast paced and hard to put down.So I must conclude that although it has it's flaws, Byzantium is an example of truly great epic storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Gardner's Best","review":"Only book of Gardner I liked.

I was completely wrong. This album is amazingly full of rock out music. I am, I can easily say, a big fan of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana. I was saddened to hear earlier that people were classifying Puddle of Mudd as grunge, but I was defiantely wrong. I would classify it somewhat as grunge, and Wes's voice even has a strong hint of Kurt in it in several songs. This cd is not at all waste, I can also say every song on it can be easily loved. I would recommend purchasing this cd, it really is something to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight out of \\"How to Exploit Trends\\"","review":"Aagh! More simpleton rock. Completely unoriginal riffs, poor instrumentation, and stupid-arse lyrics make up the grung wannabes of Puddle of Mudd, the most accurate band name around. It's sad that rip-offs like these guys, Nickelback, Creed, and others get all the attention while other grunge-influenced, yet far more imaginative, original bands like Local H and modern Days of the New (Travis Meeks is a musical genius) are given the shaft. POM's lyrics are nowhere near as poetic as Kurt Cobain's, Eddie Vedder's, Layne Staley's (God rest his soul), and Chris Cornell's lyrics, nor is the instrumentation anywhere near such bands either. These guys will be nowhere five years from now. They're an example of all that's wrong with modern rock. Boooooooo!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All the bad reviews explain it all...","review":"This band sucks. It seems like when this first came out every single was getting worse and worse. First song I heard was \\"Control\\" and i thought the lyrics were stupid (I Love The Way You Smack My Ass). \\"Blurry\\" was pretty bad too but it was nothing compared \\"She Hates Me\\" which has some of the worst lyrics and vocals i have ever heard. They even copied the riff from an old L7 tune.If you want to hear some real/original music then check out: Mindless Self Indulgence, Deadsy, System Of A Down, OLD Metallica, Marilyn Manson, NIN, Ramones, or any of the early-90's bands that made this type of music way before Muddle Of Pudd did (Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album!!","review":"This is my new favorite album! I first heard them on the radio and the songs I heard were Blurry and She Hates Me which is an awesome song!! I don't know if any one else has thought about this but I think that the beginning starts out like the Grease song Summer Nights which at first I thought maybe it was a remake of that song which would have been wierd! I really didn't think so since it was rock sounding which makes the song great!! I also love all the other songs on this album, Oh and if you got the editon with DVD it has the video for She Hates Me which is awesome too!! So if you're in the mood for some great alternative rock or metal rock than you should really get this one it will make your day!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so much potential...so much screaming","review":"when i first heard Control by Puddle of Mudd, i thought...\\"this is [junk]...but very good [junk]\\"...and indeed it was. i got this cd Christmas 2001, and played it on my cd player constantly. but now, due to my polishing of my music tastes and PoM's over-exposure, i sold it to my friend...the only good songs on there were Control and Nobody Told Me (i'll admit it, it's an eerie echo of Kurt Cobain...). I never liked She F****** Hates Me or Drift and Die, nor Blurry, so when they became MTV staples, my enchantment with Wes and PoM was lost. But those two songs i liked (control & Nobody Told Me) were amazing with fantastic drum hooks by Greg Upchurch and guitar riffs by Wes. i do hope their sophomore effort fares better, because those songs had so much to offer, but the rest of the album was, to put it frankly, [junk.]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best....","review":"I don't think this is the best CD ever. I listened to it for maybe two weeks and then put it away and only listened to it once after that. I bought this CD thinking that Blurry and Control were the two best songs ever. They aren't bad but they get boring really fast....just like all the other songs on this CD. Out of My Head isn't too bad, with its good rock sound but it got boring. She Hates Me is a funny song but I lost interest in it rather quickly. There isn't much to say about this CD. Unless you have nothing else to buy, I would set this aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Nirvana tribute band?","review":"Oops i didnt know Puddle of Mud were actually a band that were all their own!

This one is trying to sound like Creed, who in turn, tries to sound like Pearl Jam. This CD is horrible, and has nothing musical about it at all. None of these band-members have talent. It is all noise pollution that gives you brain damage. We are looking at a rip-off of a rip-off. If Creed is so horrible as a Pearl Jam wanna-be band, then Puddle of Mudd must be beyond that! Creed's lead singer can't sing, and neither can this guy. What is with all these explicit lyrics? Do these bands think that swearing makes them more popular?

Haha, just kidding. If you couldn't already tell by the name, Puddle of Mudd is something to step on. Their single, \\"Control\\" is weak, repetitious and gets old very fast. The rest of the album is even worse. Whiny lyrics and poor instrumentation mix to create an incredibly weak and watered down sound.

Songs like \\"P**s it All Away\\" and \\"She Hates Me\\" are simply an excuse to use explicit lyrics and call it music. Other songs are also childish and not well organized or orchestrated. With the exception of the really fantastic \\"Control\\" and \\"Blurry\\", this sounds like the demo tape of a Nirvana/Offspring worshipping garage band.

They are not even and will never be close to what the Grunge sound really was ( MotherLoveBone, Soundgarden,Green River,Alice In Chains, NIRVANA). Puddle of Mudd in my opinion sounds alot like Nickeback and all of those other wannabe bands of today that have no skills or talent, but fans seem to buy their stuff because they don't have a clue of real music.

Puddle of Mudd is a your typical 80's metal band; big hair, loud guitars, and a sometimes annoying singer. I bought this for \\"Control\\", which I thought was OK, not great. I figured that because I liked all the other bands Devil Durst brought around, I'd like these guys, too. Nope. They are very talented, you pretty much have to be if you are in the music-buisness. The only problem as I see it is their singer. I agree with the other reviews, he does sound a lot like an 80's rock 'n' roll singer. They should just make him another guitarist (he does play guitar, folks) and get a new singer. That's just my view, though. But, there is hope for these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"It is as good as the unedited one inless you like She Hates Me.then thats a problem because it goes She @#%&*$ Hates me."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a Puddle of Crud","review":"Puddle of Mudd is everything a teeniebopper wants in a supposed \\"rock\\" band. Soft, catchy, pop music with no real edge or attitude to speak of, and songs that are very repetitive and make you think \\"haven't I heard this before?\\". Lead singer Wes Scantlin has the most unsufferable voice since Creed's Scott Stapp, and a lot of the songs are contradictory in their lyrics as well. This is packaged, wrapped up, teeniebopper music made up by none other than Fred Durst, so that oughta tell you something right there. There are resemblances to Alice in Chains as well musically and physically, Wes Scantlin looks a lot like Jerry Cantrell minus the talent. Expect Puddle of Mudd to be blasted on TV and the radio from now on until after the holiday season, than in four years no one will know who they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"hey everybodex!!","review":"ok here's the scoop on the MUDD puddle. when i first heard these guys, i have to tell you i was in awe, sheer awe, of how much they blew!. man if you actually listen to this album you need some serious therapy, because if you listen to this you probobly listen to worse crap than this, which can only lead to more crap.There are some things in life that need to die, this is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I saw your mommy...","review":"And your Mommy's Dead!\\" You know, that song by Suicidal Tendencies? \\"She Hates Me\\" has the same guitar riff in it.

That's the question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upstaging Nirvana!","review":"I had witnessed Puddle of Mudd for the first time this summer with Godsmack and the Deftones. I did not know what to expect (...).When they took the stage as the opening act I was immediatly captivated from what may have been one of the best bands, live or not, that I have ever witnessed.Puddle of Mudd blend the harder Nirvana material with the casual Godsmack stuff. Their album truly is one of the best albums released in 2001. These guys make the lame sounds of Nirvana's over-played tunes hip again. Grunge/Metal is back again, and only because of Puddle of Mudd.This album deserves to be in everyone's collection, and it seems to be going there sooner than you can believe. The album is already gold! In my opinion, the catchiest songs are \\"Bring Me Down\\", \\"Control\\", \\"Blurry\\", and oh hell, the whole album is great! Do yourself a big favor this holiday! Pick up a copy of \\"Come Clean\\" (...)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"::yawn:: another run-of-the-mill band, absolutely nothing spectacular about these guys, sounds just like every other new wanna-be metal band, just a group of guys picking up instruments and banging away to make a bunch of unimaginative noise. purely a commercial CD, and a waste of money at that...if you're looking for rock/metal bands with innovation and talent, pick up anything by Tool or the Deftones, you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"(not) WANTED","review":"By large multinational record company: four talentless rock dweebs to fill out band positions.

I mean by the time most people decided to buy the album, they were already sick of \\"Control\\". \\"Blurry\\" and \\"Said\\" are the best songs on the album.

This band should be sent back to the trailer park from where they came.

True fans of music, do not fooled by this \\"band\\". Save it for the teenagers, and/or mentally devoid who listen to anything the radio will play (Blink). These guys are shameless in the way they rip off musical styles, images, and even songs. Anyone heard the song \\"I Saw Your Mommy\\" by Suicidal Tendencies? If you have, you know what I'm talking about. If not, listen to it and be sickened at how similar \\"She Hates Me\\" sounds to it.

But then, the singles start getting played out. The songs replayability wears thin. Then, all of the vocals start to get annoying, screechy and urgent, then you get to \\"she F'in hates me\\", the worst song of all time. When you wade through all of that, you get a decent cd. Basement and Never Change are the best songs. Radio hasn't gotten to em yet. Good for fans of grunge."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw this in a Puddle of mud(d)","review":"Wow, is there a better example of crappy wannabe alternative music than Puddle of piss? Their frontman thinks he can pull off the Cobain look without the Cobain impact, what a jackass. I'll admit Kurt is one of my idols (along with Robert Plant and of course, Ozzy (Osbourne)) but this is just ridiculous, he probably doesn't take showers either. Okay, back to the review. Their guitars are repetative and extremely crappy and lyrics are that of a wannabe grunge band (see Alice in Chains). \\"She F***ing Hates Me\\" gets very, very annoying after 2 listens and the one where they're in the cabin (music video) is very poseur. This is one of the reasons why rock sucks today (most of it) and I hope some awesome metal band comes along to stop this s***."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puddle of Mudd review","review":"Possessing a likable, arena-rock amalgamation of grunge, alternative, and nu metal, Kansas City's Puddle of Mudd are at once emotional and straight-ahead. Indeed, their no-frills lineup puts one in mind of a less uptight Creed. Singer Wesley Reid Scantlin possesses an Eddie Vedder earnestness that on hard-hitting tunes like \\"Nobody Told Me\\" takes on a Cobain-like urgency. Ranging from acoustic-based yet lush midtempo rockers such as \\"Drift and Die\\" to the gimmicky fun of \\"She Hates Me\\" to the edgy Nirvana-esque \\"Bring Me Down\\" to the dynamic and direct \\"Control,\\" the 11-song-strong Come Clean is an assured, accomplished, and varied debut likely to resonate with rock fans of many tastes and temperaments."},{"rating":"1","title":"i bought this when i was a clone","review":"puddle of mud the nirvana of 2000 god these guys try to be tough hiding behind distorted and swearing and wearing their caps backwards OWWWW big men i can't cope with it killing me i think i'm gonna wet my pants at how lame this band sounds after their hit single \\"she hates me\\" has drifted away..and it's replaced with more media twoodle which will get the clones with their hoodies and chains in their pockets and baggy trousers going crazy and wetting their pants NOT COOL NOT ROCK AND ROLL AT ALLare puddle of mudd really trying to re-vive grunge that they have to rip off all the riffs of the great bands i.e pixies, screaming trees etcanother band that nicks stuff just like oasishell i had to wind up the oasis fans aswelli hate puddle of pukeavoided buy anything by the pixies, screaming trees the cult before thisonly if your a ten year old hoodie year clone then you will think it's the greatest album ever madewell i'm a 19 year old and i think it sucks!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gawd this album sux","review":"All they do is rip-off good grunge bands like Nirvana.

Fred Durst has produced great Cds before (meaning Cold:13 Ways To Bleed On Stage & Staind:Break the Cycle), so know he could've made this better.

About 2 weeks ago a unearthed their CD from under a pile of stuff, and was instantly hooked again.

There is a difference between having someone's style, and just ripping off their voice completely.

The similarities do not as much reflect Soundgarden, Nirvana or Pearl Jam but more so resemble the music and styles of Alice in Chains and Candlebox. The music on Come Clean isn't bad but it is highly derivative of a genre that was recently put to bed for what should have been a substantial nap allowing the style to evolve, emerging into its next incarnation. What's happened with bands such as Puddle of Mudd and Creed is really more of a premature rehashing.At the same time, Puddle of Mudd is unquestionably catchy but they just need to find an identity of their own. Oh, by the way, the early '90s called and they want their clothes back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-own CD","review":"This is a superb effort that belongs in every rock fan's collection. this, this is one of the best efforts of the year.

If you're still in love with someone you miss, this song will just about kill you. I usually last about three seconds before tearing up. ;-) A classic, simply beautiful.

If that doesn't scream out \\"this music stinks!\\", I don't know what does. Okay, to be fair, \\"Control\\" and \\"Drift and Die\\" are good songs, but this CD isn't anything you need. These guys try way too hard to be a second-rate version of Nirvana, when they could be more original. If you want to buy this CD, borrow it first if you can. POM does manage to be a rather enjoyable band at times, but I have to wonder about their fans, the ones who say that they are soooo original and soooo angsty, the kind of stuff they put on the stereo when they are angry and depressed. It makes me wonder if they've ever even heard of bands like Pink Floyd, Alice In Chains, or Nine Inch Nails, since their albums seem to be the music I keep turning to whenever I'M angry and depressed.

What this results to is: a hilarious outcome like that of some tribute band out of Hillbilly land.

They are a great new band. Who cares if they get MTV play and may sound a little similar to Pearl Jam and Nirvana. I am a big Puddle of Mudd fan. Their music is fun, heavy, and I had the pleasure of seeing them live and they rocked.I will admit it took me several listens to like this CD and appreciate it and this gets 4 out of 5 stars for that reason and the fact that some of the songs simply aren't that good.My favorite songs on the album are Out Of My Head and Bring Me Down.Control, Drift and Die, Blurry, She Hates Me, Never Change and Basement, are also pretty good.

I know some of the simple songs are best, but \\"She Hates Me\\" is just too simple. I can write it better. As for the album itself, the lyrics [not good], the music is rather cheesy, and the singing is also pretty bad. Avoid this album. It's overhyped and overrated too much.

This album however is ALOT better than most of the excuses for rock music they put out today, case and point Linkin Park. When did hard rock and metal have remix cds and DJs and rappers??? Most people like that stuff though because its like your saying you are listening to \\"metal\\" but in all reality they are just a very poor excuse for anything regarding hard rock! Anyway dont buy Linkin Park, buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUCKS","review":"like the title says....IT SUCKS, blows, honks.....grunge wannabe?save yoru 3 dollars...buy crack instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"come on!!!!","review":"do i really need to take the time to explain why this is so bad??? (...)P>generic rock ala 10 years ago, horrible vocals, no experiments, no inspiration and no reason to exist.the name says it all...PUDDLE OF MUDD???? what???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest musical rip off ever!","review":"First creed rips off pearl jam, now puddle of mud rips off creed how does this work? It doesnt. Both creed and puddle of mud should be shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thats what they are. A Puddle of Mud and crap mixed together","review":"DON'T BUY THIS CD. It's trash, you see any body buying this cd WARN THEM IMMEDIATLY TO NOT BUY IT. The only time i heard this cd is when my friend first got it and popped it in the cd player... you better believe that this cd is trash. Who ever picked up this cd in the first place, and \\"actually like it\\" must have never heard of a thing called good music\\" if i could give it no stars i would but it only goes as low as 1. you people who gave this cd 5 stars, i think you all are mentally ill, furthermore you people keep talking about how originality counts. Theirs nothing original about them. THERE THE SAME AS ANY OTHER BAND OUT THEIR! NOTHING UNIQUE ABOUT THEM AT ALL. one thing i'll give them credit for. They sure picked the best name that describes their music. \\"A-P-U-D-D-L-E-O-F-M-U-D"},{"rating":"1","title":"why do i have to give 1 star ???","review":"Yes, they sound like Creed, but that's a degraded version of Creed. I find Creed okay. But I can't help saying Puddle of Mudd is far far below them. The Vocal sounds like a typical new-age power-pop (no, not rock).These are the 'pop'fied version of grunge. If you mainly listen to pop music and just want to try out some alternative band, then you might like POM. But if you are mature rock listener, then I bet my paycheck that you would hate these copycats.Buy In Absentia, Porcupine Tree.. or any of their albums... THEY ROCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute,magical,fun, and you can read it again and again!","review":"just as above its a great book thats about the toys ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great BCAA stack","review":"I was interested in finding a BCAA supplement that was affordable and low in sugars as a supplement to my protein shakes. This product fit the bill very well. However, packaging can be deceiving and the container is much smaller than it looks. however, it packs the amount of BCAAs it advertises in a great-tasting, low-sugar, grape flavoring. I highly recommend this. There are superior products but they cost a lot more per serving."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I saw this movie and loved it. I think it is a great mystery. Every cast member was brilliant! I've gotten the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"a solid performance by all","review":"This is one of those great who done it murder mysteries. The parents of an autisic boy are found brutally murdered in their bedroom and the boy is walking around the house covered in blood and carrying the knife that was used in the murder. Forensics quickly prove the boy didn't do it, but only he knows who did and he can't tell. Enter a brilliant yet flawed therapist played by Richard Dreyfuss. Relucantly, he begins to tackle communicating with the boy to discover what actually happened.With great performances and well written script, this is a well made who done it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this movie based on the actors in it, particularly Richard Dreyfus and John Lithgow and the reviews posted on Amazon. They are both really good actors. However, I was deeply disappointed. The movie and the acting was flat. It was pretty easy to figure out that Liv Tyler was really the star and thus, the killer. It was not worth the money I paid and will probably not trust the any more Amazon reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"Got these for my husband and he loves them! They work extremely well and make the whole process much faster. After receiving the first one I came back to order 3 more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I purchased the video in the hopes of getting some good chair fitness as the cover so ominously promised, and was severely dissapointed: not even one of the chairs I tried it with got any fitter. I even measured them before and after. My hopes of being able to fit my chairs hidden behind the fridge for when my mother in law decides to visit are gone.One more thing. This \\"VHS\\" thing's plastic box is a pain to pry open, and once you do, the tape unrolls too easily, which in turn is a pain to fit inside my Blu Ray player. I want to think this is a compatibility problem because of me using a PS3 to read the video instead of a regular Blu Ray player and not having been sold a defective product."},{"rating":"2","title":"An evergreen album","review":"Just a terrific album. They are so together and in sync, backed by all star musicians. Incredibly beautiful trumpet by Armstrong on Summertime. An evergreen album. You can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"DC jacks","review":"This product is made so cheap I could not even use it.They are all in the garbage where they belong,thank you china.Thanks Limp"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Out of Print video! If you can find it, give it a go!","review":"Petra Kolber, of other Reebok videos, leads 3 female athletes through a 8 minute warmup, 17 min. lower body (with Nancy Kerrigan), 13 min. upper (with Liz Masakayan, pro volley ball champ), and 9 min. ab (with Manon Rheaume, hockey goalie) and they all reunite for a 5 min. cool down.The level is intermediate, but if you are advanced, each section is broken up with some space inbetween screens to find each section you need easily, to tack onto another workout.The setting is quite unique with a view of planet Earth in the back, hanging window frames, and a hard wood floors. The music has a good beat and is easy to get into. I like to keep this for a lighter weight day, but the leg work would be the easiest to make harder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"This was purchased to obtain the maps of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. The AT is administrated and owned by the National Park Service, If so, then why is it not included in this map set?Had I known this I would not have purchased this set of CDs. The description did not indicate that that 2175 mile long trail was not included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful on many levels","review":"A fabulous book for artists, history buffs, and others. Beautifully tells and illustrates the brief but engaging history of the Malibu Potteries. Along with full color examples of the designs, finished tiles and installations, the book takes the reader back to the time and place through personal stories and archival photographs. Each time I pick up this book it inspires me. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee table book","review":"Not only will you enjoy using this book for reference, but it is a lovely book you and guests will want to look through over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"When I first heard this recording, I was a fledgling organist, but had no interest in choirs. This recording blew me away... the choir sang in tune. And you could understand the words. I had never heard anything like it, and it made me want to become a choral conductor. Now, thirty-five years later, I am about to celebrate my twenty-fifth anniversary as a Cathedral organist & choirmaster.If you only own one recording of twentieth century Cathedral choral music, this should be it. The repertoire has virtually all of the English Cathedral classics... \\"And I Saw a new heaven,\\" \\"Hail, Gladdening Light,\\" \\"Faire is the Heaven,\\" \\"My Beloved Spake.\\" The singing is superb under Willcocks, with that phenomenal blend, energy, clarity, and drive for which King's/Willcocks was so justly famous. And the gorgeous Harrison organ deftly handled by James Lancelot.I might seem an exaggeration to say that \\"a recording changed my life.\\" But this one did. You should get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"Steve Guttenberg and Crystal Bernard have great chemistry on screen and Dominic Scott Kay, who plays her son, Jake, is one of the cutest kids ever. Even though it is about Christmas and Santa Claus, the movie takes place primarily in sunny Los Angeles and is not like your usual Christmas movie. It is one of my favorites. I wish they would show it every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ladyvalerie","review":"Grab your blanket and get all snug on your couch! Steve Guttenbergs' character Nick was so sweet and some of the things he said were so touching that I just get all squeaky-voiced just thinking about it! I was surprised too because I haven't seen ol' Steve since, what, 1985? I was a little skeptical, but I'm glad I decided to buy it. Cyrstal Bernard (Beth) is good on here too. I haven't seen her since \\"Wings\\" and it was nice watching her spunk again. This is a movie about Santa's son who needs to find a wife and comes across an overworked, stressed out widow with a young son. She has a hard time believing in anything that can bring joy let alone St. Nick. The question is will Beth open her heart to Nick and just let go and believe? The little kid that plays her son was adorable! I totally recommend this movie for anyone who loves easy, sweet, romantic movies that are especially Christmas oriented."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"LOVE this movie and would like to find \\"Meet The Santa's\\" can you contact me if yoy have it?Thanks Phyllis Stamey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Single Santa seeks Mrs. Claus","review":"I saw this movie on the Hallmark channel and so enjoyed it that I wanted it in my collection. Now I would like to find the 'sequel' Meet the Santas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Single Santa... gets his Mrs Claus","review":"Oh my Steve and a cute storyline. It got me to smiling from the beginning. I waited a year to see the followup, and waited another year for the first DVD to be released, I guess I will have to wait another year for the 2nd DVD to be on the market for sale. Get, enjoy, share with a friend, it's a fun movie EVERYONE can watch. Thank goodness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbest movie ever","review":"This movie was the biggest waste of money ever. As a adult who likes watching Christmas movies around the holidays, I bought this to add my collection. It's a low budget, G-rated movie that didn't hold my attention for more than 30 seconds, and I can't imagine it would hold anyone else's, young or old, either. The acting is horrible and the plot is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good overall movie","review":"I watched this movie with the TV muted and the closed captioning off. So my review is only based on the visual aspect of the movie.The main thing that \\"stuck out\\" to me on the movie was the growth on Guteberg's lip. I found it very distracting, and I could not take my eyes off of it.I recommend watching the movie with sound on. This way you will not notice the Gute's lip sore.Note: In the sequal it appears that the lip sore was surgically removed. Check it out. Sorry I spoiled it for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel ?","review":"Where's the sequel ? I loved this first movie and have watched it every year since it first aired. I'm happy that the first movie is on dvd, but where the second one, Meet The Santas ? They put out both of the Snow Movies, so where the second Single Santa movie ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Holiday Fun - Where's the Sequel DVD ?","review":"This is a really fun movie and Steve Guttenberg is at his best since Short Circuit. Crystal Bernard does a wonderful job as a single mother who doesn't believe in Santa but hates to disappoint her son. Hallmark really needs to release the sequel \\"Meet the Santas\\" on DVD so that we can enjoy the full story year after year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"The copy I recieved met my expectations. I've read it for a couple of weeks now, and I have to say it's not quite as wonderful as Volume One, which was more of a collection of stellar Christians' reflections on scripture passages. So far this seems to be largely Mrs. Cowan's thoughts and I miss the resonance, to be truthful. But I had read Volume One through about 5 times, so fresh material is by no means a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic but still relevant","review":"Streams in the Desert has been around for years, but it's taken me this long to get on board.

I love this journal. It has Bible quotes and messages from individuals along with a place on the side to write your own notes. The one I purchased is leather and the quality is unspoken.
