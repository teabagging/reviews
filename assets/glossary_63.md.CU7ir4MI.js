I have divested myself of hundreds of books. Mary Stewart's remain a constant. \\"Touch Not the Cat\\" remains a favorite. It tells of a young woman who has been linked with a young man from early years. The link is vivid ie each can 'read' the other's mind and emotions. The link has always been trusted until murder has been done and the woman must shut off her thoughts from the person who evolves into her mental 'lover'. She not only experiences the loss of her beloved father, when foul play is suspected, she can no longer trust even the one with whom she is most connected.

Any hairs that do not stand up are cut at closer to 1/8 inch.Compared to a Philips Norelco T980 the stubble is from twice as long on standing hair to four times as long on hair laying flat.Aside from not cutting close enough for my needs I found for general hair clipping the gyroscopic forces from the motor were quite strong and the cord rather stiff."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's pretty much terrible","review":"I bought this out of pure curiousity.

This tea is better than your usual Lipton tea, but only by a little: The leaves are bigger, and not as oxidized.There are no oranges in this tea, just peaches and mangoes, with natural mandarin orange flavor. As others have mentioned before, the teabags are indeed made from plastic, and if you drink with your teabags in, you risk drawing out a plastic taste in the tea.

I have it every morning and never get tired of it with a little honey and lemon. I actually mix it with the excellentLipton Black Tea, Black Pearl Pure Long Leaf, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)which gives it more body for the AM to make a kind of chai tea mix similar to Constant Comment but with the greater benefits of green tea. I must be square: I confess I really depend on the flavor of Lipton tea.Here's a tip: we used to drink expensive coffee in the morning which would almost always let us down about 11 am. The switch to green tea has been wonderful and permanent. I still like having coffee sometimes at about 3 in the afternoon, but in the morning tea works infinitely better for the middle-aged set. Still gives us a nice caffeine kick for breakfast this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh...","review":"Immediately after opening a box of Lipton Mandarin Orange tea, I had a feeling it would not be good. The smell of the tea bags reminded me of orange antacid tablets (Tums, anyone?). I figured I would still give it a try, since tea doesn't always taste like it smells. I was correct. The tea tasted nothing like Tums; in fact, it had no taste at ALL. I was relieved that I didn't have to drink tums in the form of tea, but the complete lack of taste wasn't much better. It's rare that I dislike a tea enough to actually come onto Amazon and type a negative review like this, but this tea definitely qualifies. I enjoy a lot of other Lipton tea - including the Island Mango & Peach, and Blueberry Pomegranate, but this tea does not fall under the category of good Lipton teas by a long shot.

I liked the short excerpts from each girl's day. Having the excerpts short and switching from one girl to the other made clear the similarities. I liked the theme of the destructiveness of obsession with beauty and youth. The obsession is so prevalent in our culture and in this book you can see the horrible damage it can do to young women. It is great this is a bilingual book. I would have been most impressed if Gary Paulsen had actually written it in both languages, alas, he did not. But he had a wonderful idea though. My only problem was with Traci recognizing herself in Rosa. Realistically, I do not think that would have happened.

Whilehedoes draw the characters in depth, engaging the reader, the abruptending severs the connection which has been established.

Not only are the electronics very layered in FLA's music, but the guitars fit into their sound so well. This is the way industrial should sound. Don't get me wrong, the totally electronic industrial sounds pretty cool too. But when guitars are added, it makes the music sound so much better. I can't understand why this album pissed off so many FLA fans. To me, this is one of the greatest albums I own. For all of you up-and-coming industrial acts out there, buy this album and take notes.

Instead, he goes into long descriptions of how the captain moved the submarine into the proper position to launch the torpedoes. This submarine sent a total of 49 ships to the bottom of the ocean and Mr. Casaway even wants the reader to believe that the captain at one point felt so much remorse for his actions that he offered food and cognac to survivors in their lifeboats!

There is no elevation to this at all, and the water just sits in it until you physically life it up to drain it, which defies the point..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Add My Complaints to the List","review":"I bought it for the same reason as everyone else--I needed a large draining board with the opening on the short side. Because I had looked just about everywhere else with no success, I didn't mind the high price + shipping total (hey, it's a seller's market). But I was extremely disappointed at the lack of quality. It's stiff, relatively thin, and arrived bowed in the middle of the drain area, which prevents water from exiting the pan unless I left it at the other end... which, as others have noted, cannot be done if there are any dishes in the drainer... the pan's just not sturdy enough.

We have just started making remote controls with products that I got at the crafts store.

I have an extensive collection of documentaries which depict specific facets of the Cold War era but none as comprehensive as this perfect DVD collection. It is very informative and well researched. The doccie doesn't focus on over the top reconstructions of the events. It uses fascinating archival footage and experts divulge their knowledge of those decades when the world was on a knife's edge.I found the documentary completely by mistake and I ordered it immediately. I was not disappointed at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Doc's ever.","review":"Have so far viewed the first 8 parts of this epic 24 part series on the \\"Cold War\\". Let me say this is now tied in my opinion with \\"The World At Way\\" as the best historic documentary I have seen. In fact if I did not know better I would have thought this was a continuation of the eariler series. The footage is great and the many interviews with the people who were part of the Cold War are fantastic. In many cases you see footage of someone from the 1950's and that is followed by an interview with the same person. Anyone who wants to know the history of the 50+ years \\"Cold War\\" should run and buy this DVD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"at long last","review":"finally - the best ever series on the Cold War on dvd. I watched this on tv some years ago and wore out my home made vhs tapes of the series after repeated viewing. As far as I can see - pretty much every aspect of the Cold War period is dealt with in fair detail. If you want more - Vietnam for example - you have series like VIETNAM - A TELEVISION HISTORY - so its quite like THE WORLD AT WAR in that regard. I found the last couple of episodes on the collapse of communism and the USSR of particular interest. Again like THE WORLD AT WAR, the interviews with old participants - such as Mikhail Gorbachev - are fascinating. This is tv history as it should be. Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Briilliant","review":"I was dubious about buying this as it was from CNN. I was expecting the normal bang crash, sensationalist presentation that even the BBC does these days. However, what I got was a well presented, rational and entertaining documentary (not a mockumentary so loved of the shot away sound engineers of today). This set of programmes shows how it should be done. It covers almost everything in a relatively objective manner and shows both perspectives of the Cold War. Excellent value - more like this please. I know it was made in 1998 but contemporary programme developers could learn a huge amount from watching this and trying to emulate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST COLD WAR SERIES EVER","review":"I just purchased it today but like everyone else, I wore out my VHS copies (and my VHS player!).

I have been a fan ever since."},{"rating":"1","title":"not quite up to snuff","review":"Although I usually enjoy Linda Howard's books, I found this one to be thin and repetetive. Ok Sarah had blond hair, enough already. That said, there were other details which were just missing, like anything to do with setting. They lived in Houston, but it could have been anywhere as this had absolutely nothing to do with the story. Usually Howard's books have a setting much more integral to the plot which is why I like them.I guess since this is an older book that some of the well worn flowery stock romance phrases have an excuse but they still bothered me.An ok book but I'm glad I checked it out of the library instead of buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracles from Love","review":"Wonderfully writen. Sarah's friendship with Rome is the type of story one can read about and believe every single word. Overcoming the pain of losing loved ones and the miracle of a second chance makes this book one of the best ones. Sarah's patience and love for Rome is the type of love that should be treassured. For most part of the story, I hated Rome for not loving Sarah like she deserved to be loved, but I also understood his pain and his reluctance for not being hurt again. The ending just confirms that we all deserve a second chance and more if needed in this life."},{"rating":"1","title":"egh.","review":"i've liked other books by L Howard, but this was a waste of my time. I really wish I hadn't read it. Totally cliche plot and poor character development.

Roman, our Neanderthal-like non-hero, and Sara, our pathetic spineless non-heroine, decide upon a marriage of convenience. Roman receives sex and someone who worships the ground at his feet. Sarah receives emotional abuse and a selfish, whiner of a husband. Whoo-hoo! What a deal! The story moves along as such; Roman treats Sarah like dirt, and she takes it. Sarah gets pregnant. Roman orders her to abort, but she forgives him (not that he's apologizing mind you). Roman ignores her, and she takes it. Sarah informs him that she loves him soooo much she just can't abort, but won't he stay and screw her so she can take care of him? That's about it, except for him constantly comparing Sarah to his dead wife, and finding her coming up short every time. Actually they aren't a bad couple, they probably deserve one another. As characters they are both worthless, just like this book. Worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves 0 stars!","review":"I love Linda Howard but I hated this book! You have Rome who only marries Sarah so he can have regular sex. He treats her like a hooker (except she doesn't get paid), coming to \\"her\\" room, then leaving when he's done.When she gets pregnant (his fault more than hers) he wants her to get an abortion. A man who lost two children to a terrible accident wants to intentionally get rid of another one? While she's pregnant he won't go near her after she starts to show and never does one kind thing for her. Doesn't rub her back, fix her meals, just basically ignores her. Leaves her to give birth to HIS child alone. Then she is so spineless that she lets him climb back into \\"her\\" bed afterwards. Worse, she allows him to put her in a position where she hides her child while he pretends it doesn't exist.

It happens often enough in the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated the hero in this book","review":"I read this book long ago but I still remember how I hated this book. This was the second Linda Howard book that I hated with a vengeance (the other was 'Independent Wife'). This book seems to be one of those 'hate it' or 'love it' books and it shows Linda Howard's writing ability to be able to pull off that kind of emotional reaction from her readers. In this book, Linda Howard asked a question of \\"How long should we allow ourselves to grieve?\\". The grieving person in this book was Rome. Unfortunately I could not find myself sympathize with Rome at all because throughout the book his treatment to Sarah left me cold. Rome was cold, selfish, and all he cared about was sex with Sarah without giving any thought to her needs. Thank God I didn't start Linda Howard with this book or I wouldn't have continued reading her books to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Short Book","review":"This is an adorable sweet book if your looking for a quick read that will touch your heart and at the same time fullfill the urge for a sex scene or 2 or 3 or ......Though the book was predictable it was still a good read filled with everything you expect in a good romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"I'm a huge Linda Howard fan, and I usually LOVE her novels. But Sarah's Child is a terrible book! The plot was unbelievable, even for a romance novel. The characters are one dimensional, and completely disagreeable. Rome is brute. Sarah is a delusional, needy and pathetic woman. I just cannot fathom how any decent man can ignore his own child's existence, and how any self respecting woman can stay with a man who rejects their child. This was a very disappointing Linda Howard. If you're looking for a good LH, try Almost Forever, or Shades of Twilight."},{"rating":"1","title":"More story is needed here.","review":"I felt like this book was written to write sex and the rest was added to help the sex along instead of the sex added to help the story along. The characters were good and I think a bit more story line would have really made this book worth reading, instead it fell flat and I really didn't believe Sarah's motivation. I'm a sucker for a Happily Ever After ending and so that was appreciated, but come on...enough sex...add more story for us to enjoy...the sex should be like the cherry on top not the main course."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Linda Howard and not my last!","review":"I have read many romance novels from Catherine Coulter to Brenda Joyce. But if there is one romance author that knows how to grab a readers attention and deliver explosive scenes it has to be Linda Howard. This novel represents every thing you can think of: plot driven scenes, unrequited love, steamy love scenes, insecurity, grief, jealousy, heartbreak, and did I mention a dominate alpha male. There will be times that you want to throw the book at the main hero Rome and times where you want to shake some sense into Sarah. However, Linda Howard creates such a credible ending that you actually end up smiling at the end. Although some readers might object to Romes selfishness towards Sarah a bit too much please keep in mind that this was the writing style of the 80s not of today. So if you have been reading Linda Howards recent novels than check this one out. I promise you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Linda Howard, hated Rome","review":"I could not stand Rome, he ruined the whole story.

Feels like winning the SB all over again!","review":"This Blu-ray is worth the price! At first, I debated purchasing it because it didn't show the entire Super Bowl but this is better. It tells a great story going game by game with great commentary from Jim Henderson and WWL radio. I was happy when they showed us winning and still a bit upset when they showed the 3 game losing streak. I choked up a bit (again) when they showed Hartley nail the winning FG in the NFC Championship game.The story is told from a definitively Saints and Who Dat Nation perspective. It's like no one else matters, not even Peyton Manning, he's an after thought (in the film). They do a good job of capturing the spirit of the Saints, season, each game and the Super Bowl.If you are a Saints fan this is a must buy and if you're not you'll still enjoy a great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertisement","review":"I wanted a copy of the Superbowl.

If you want to be able to watch the whole game, don't waste your money; cause this DVD doesn't have it. VERY DISAPPOINTED.I guess I'll try iTunes like a commenter suggested to the other 1 star reviewer. Don't waste your money here like I did unless you're happy with nothing but highlights. I'm not.

Basically, if you want to see a highlight reel to relive the memories of the Saints 2009 season & 1st Super Bowl victory along with the presentation of the Lombardi trophy after the game (best feature of the disk), buy this set. If you want to see the Super Bowl XLIV game, buy the \\"Road to XLIV\\" set.

Wanted the game with the Saints broadcasters announcing, and knew that was not going to happen but, since I do not have television hookup, it would be a chance to see the game. This was not the Super Bowl Game -- IT WAS BETTER!!! It is an overview of the entire season -- pictures of key plays and commenting by Hokie and Jim with occasional comments by the announcers for the opposing team (sometimes comments by both sides on a play). I got all those wonderful statements by Jim (\\"fleur-de-leap\\" and \\"pigs do fly; hell has frozen over\\") AND got to see the key plays -- all the way through the Super Bowl.

It looked like a fun game where you walk around in a mirror, look for keys solve puzzles and maybe use magic but no. Instead there's a little hand on the screen that you move around. All you do is click on stuff. I thought you would control mickey. I mean who the heck thought of the stupid hand clicking. This is not how the game should have been.

Most of the time, the game is in self control mode with you watching the games predetermined game action. You do not control Mickey Mouse but rather are given two or three options for Mickey to move after each sequence. The game takes over after each selection and goes through 10 or 20 seconds of action. Then another two or three move options to choose from. YOU DO NOT CONTROL MICKEYS MOVEMENT!I must confess though, my son enjoyed the game O.K., he is five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun at any age!","review":"I bought this game for my 5 year old triplets. The cursor doesn't always respond well, and is very frustrating. The games \\"childrens mode\\" is actually more frustrating than the normal mode, as it doesn't have the hint icon. The game occasionally plays a cartoon for up to 5 minutes that you cannot move past until it finishes, which frustrated my kids and myself to no end. The childrens mode sometimes moves automatically, and sometimes goes to the same rooms over and over again. The \\"ghost\\" terrifies my kids. We all strongly dislike this game, very very frustrating on all levels. A total waste of $40."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Game Made For Gamecube","review":"When I first got this game it looked fun but when I played it for the first time is was horrible.

It's not much fun. This game is really intended for younger kids.Most of the time you are just directing Mickey to open doors or solve no-brainer puzzles, and the only decent interaction is the mini-games you play now and then.If you're really craving a good Disney game, then buy Donald Duck Goin' Quackers. It's much more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a younger audience","review":"I rented this game and found that it was more suitable for younger game players. Unlike Luigi's Mansion, a child doesn't need to be able to read very much. Older gamers may not enjoy it (as i didn't) because the control is all point and click. You don't actually control Mickey himself, as you do with Luigi. There are numerous movie sequences that get pretty boring and redundent when you have to go back to a place over and over. I might recommend this only for younger kids. Perhaps you might want to rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst mickey mouse game yet","review":"when i bought this game i was so mad that i wasted $... on a game that all you do is go through stupid doors.NEVER EVER buy this game it is fun for 4-6 year olds,but it gets extremly boring as you get olderyou find peices of a mirror,SO WHAT.if you want to get this game rent it first,dont bother buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring for older game players","review":"I do not own this; I rented it and I'm really glad I did. I thought it would be something fun because I've always loved anything Disney related, but I found this boring. With only theh point and click feature, there wasn't much control over Mickey. All you can really do with him is open doors and have him walk from room to room. I was disappointed at the beginning with the story features. The graphics are great, but I found them boring and made me question when I'd get to play the game.The only reason I gave it two stars is because the graphics were so good.If you want to try this out, rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"This was not the live show I was looking for. This has to be the worst produced video ever. How anyone could say anything good about it I can't understand. Belindas performance was average at best. She looked terrible!

It's amazing there are 2 or 3 reviews here actually took the words right out of my mouth. In short, the show was bad, the lighting was bad, her hair was bad, her make up was bad. You can see the negative effect of drugs and alcohol on a performing artist. Although for most other artists it work the positive way!!! She didn't prepare much for the concert. She didn't want to be there. She was just going through the motion. Although the rest of the band was trying a lot harder and wasn't bad. Honestly, I don't see how some can give it a 5 stars. You know a 5 star performance when you see one. ANd this one is far away from being one. But hey, I'm a fun so I got it. That's what a fan do. But I wouldn't mind giving it away if anyone wants it.

This year I've had two Sigma lenses fail. Both were less than three years old. The first had an autofocus problem. The second, an 18-50mm f2.8 EX, had an aperture failure.

We were unable to get any type of support, even through email. To make matters worse, when we finally did get the software activated, it kept freezing and crashing the workstations where it was installed.

The product activation is a real pain and I could not move it to another system after I installed it on the first, after uninstalling it from the first.

It kept causing my system to lock up or crash whenever I tried to create or convert PDF files. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason as to why it would fail. Something else that I found out that seems wierd is that the product was a version 1 last year and then jumped to version 4.X recently. There were no versions 2 or 3.

Any time I tried to edit objects or text, the program crashed my system. It seems like its a beta version, not an authentic product. Overall I'd rate this product as a very poor PDF printer driver.

'The Hand' is pretty bad, actually, but 'I bury the living' is spooky enough. You could choose to watch them separately without the adverts, extras and the drive-in sound effects, but I'm not sure why you would have bought this otherwise - the whole effect is the point of the DVD. If you're new to Drive-in Discs, I wouldn't start here due to 'The Hand' letting the side down a bit, but worthwhile if you're slowly building up your drive-in library."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Bury The Living VHS Hi-Fi","review":"Richard Boone, Theodore Bikel, Peggy Maurer, Howard Smith, Herbert Anderson, Robert Osterlon.80 Minutes.

Although one would think this is some kind of zombie flick, it is anything but. There's a hint of creepiness due to the graveyard setting, but the film plays more like a Twilight Zone episode and winds itself up as an old fashioned murder mystery. Excellent writing, high caliber cast, and good pacing set this film apart. It's a wonder it has been so obsure - it really is a gem of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unacknowledged Classic","review":"This film is terrifying. I expected some hoky fun when I rented it (judging from the cover), but then recalled that Stephen King had listed it (in \\"Danse Macabre\\") as one of the ten most frightening films he'd ever seen. All the same, I figured his memory must have gone foggy.I was wrong. The plot, when laid out bare, sounds ridiculous. A rather ordinary, boring caretaker of a cemetery (accompanied by a hilarious 'Scottsman') happens to gain power over the fundamentals of life and death with a board that lays out the structure of the cemetery--where people are buried, have been buried, and will be buried. All this sounds absurd and very 1950's, yes, but it turns out well. You actually start believing it yourself and can feel the protagonist's anguish. The end is disappointing, but the buildup is more than worth it. Black pin, white pin, black pin, white pin....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drab and Dull","review":"With a title like \\"I Bury The Living\\", this certainly is not what I was expecting - this was basically like a longer, more drawn-out version of one of the less thrilling episodes of \\"Twilight Zone\\" or \\"Alfred Hitchcock\\". The characters were pretty uninteresting, which is really what made this movie unenjoyable for me - very drab, boring, wooden acting. And even the supernatural element in the story was ruined by a terrible \\"twist\\" ending. I like lots of older horror movies, many way older than this 80-minute sleeping pill.

There is not even a space for any religious ceremonies, like baptism. The space for a birth announcement is extremely small, and there is not even a space for Baby's First Haircut.

The music is wonderful, and the game controls are easier to use than expected.Problems: Sometimes spaceships bump on one another in an unrealistic fashion, as if they were infantry soldiers in other strategy games.

I believe it twas the first film to include a 20 minte complete ballet in the film.

Shot in color it looks pretty good with the Criterion touch. Frankly, I didn't know much about it, but it was getting some publicity so I checked it out. I can't recall another movie that essentially stops in the middle to show a nearly full ballet, or at least an act. \\"Red Shoes\\" was a story written by Hans Christian Anderson and is about a girl who tried on red ballet shoes that wouldn't allow her to stop dancing. This becomes the subject of the ballet. In life, it is also a metaphor for our ballerina and her composer husband. Does she stick with him or further her career with the nasty old impresario Boris? I really liked the actor playing Boris, French actor Anton Walbrook. I'm not sure how this movie played in America but it clearly set the stage for musicals to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Shoes","review":"Excellent movie. One of my favorite two films of many I have seen over the last forty years. It was England's best movie from 1948 to 1978.

The two male ballet dancers Masside and Helpman are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-ray","review":"Having seen this movie when it first came out left a lasting impression. I wanted to see it again using present day technology (Blu-ray) I was not dissapointed. Could not believe the color or the clarity.

We didn't really get to know the characters well--especially the downed flyer. I thought he came across as insensitive and extraordinarily selfish.

One of the reviewers who wrote about Resistance said that he/she thought it would have been a stronger book if it had dealt more with the horrors of the concentration camps. I don't think this is necessarily true. I found the juxtaposition of \\"normal life\\" and the horrors of war extremely moving.

I liked how the Shreve told each person's story that led to a critical point. When you learned the other's character's story, the book becomes full circle and better understood. You were able to relate and learn about the characters as the story progressed. Shreve kept you interested in the story and fate of the characters until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book","review":"I've read five Anita Shreve novels. Some I've liked better then others. This one was one of my favorites so far. The characters and Shreve's way of writing draws you right in. You feel like you are with them and in their world.

From page 160 onwards, after Claire and Ted had sex, the pace becomes boring -- the couple gaze into each other's eyes, hold hands, take long walks, had sex again and do other mushy stuff. The ending gets even more boring and I near-abandon my reading. Skimming through the pages, I seem to see long narratives of Gestapo torture (ho-hum) and even longer monologues. I had expected the ending to be a tense confrontation betwen Henri, Claire's husband, and Ted but it deoes not happen.

Now after I apply the product I don't have the itch nor do the tiny bumps come up anymore. It just feels like I never had any hair on my face in the first place.

There are so many reasons to savor this book: the thick precision of the prose, the refreshing, responsible perspective, the adventurous spirit, the places Hemingway takes you. Hemingway shined so brightly in his short stories. It was an ideal form for him.

Primarily, though, it is an introspective look at one's life and the worth that one ascribes to his experiences while he is ready to close his eyes for the final time.Hemingway captures the moment when a dying man's recollections either turn into regrets or points of pride and self actualization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I gave a brief try to Hemingway two or three years ago that didn't stick, though I don't remember the volume. Then, the other day, with full-on earnestness, I grabbed up this book. I thought it was pretty simple stuff. He seems to be write absolutely from the gut. Short sentences, bland sentences. Nothing that is deeply thoughtful or even conscious.He is well-known as a macho writer who nonetheless delivered a genius to mass and critical audiences. But I'm not sure I understand how or why. I ought to try one on his famous novels before haranguing the icon, but there is almost no temptation after reading this collection.I give him credit for conjuring up thick clouds of weird, dark emotion over seemingly fleeting events (one story in this collection, \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber, does this particularly well), but the balance was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"Yes of course, Hemingway is a good writer and some of the stories in the book are excellent.

But somewhere along the line, the writer has to deliver, has to get the reader to believe in something, even if there's an unexpected twist at the end. This novel never makes the last jump. Even at the end, you're left with questions, unsatisfied. The writing is good -- different because its third person, present tense -- but expert. Only the ending, the relationship between the two primary characters, rings false. I would read more books by Mr. Stone in spite of my reservations about this one. Still, a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the Map is on the mark","review":"Once again Chellis Glendinning has revealed her incredible mind at work with her latest effort. Her insights, her parallels of personal and global healing are truly food for thought for those of us not in denial of reality.

This is an ok audience, but I should have read all your reviews and paid attention to the Reader from Alexandria, who pointed this out by calling the style \\"amateurish\\". I don't think this is the case. The style is too consistent. I really think this author is so intent on inspiring young people that his writing reflects this attitude on every level.

My assumption was correct.In this book, Asante adds new and pertinent points of perspectives not before considered in debates or discussions dealing with race. He also discusses the very important issue of reparations. This book is a must-have for those interested in courageously addressing the issue of race in the United States and throughout the world.BNS FOREVER.Tarikh Bandele"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Much","review":"I bought this same item at Staples for less than half this price within the past month - October, 2008!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value - forget the brand names!","review":"I got this little puppy for my Macintosh after researching various USB Smartmedia readers from brand name digital camera makers (that go for $60-70) for my Olympus D-360 camera.

(there are also other animals in the book that she likes to point at).The story line is adorable. I think it is a good way to introduce the concept of a new baby to the family to a young child, without going into a ton of detail about how it happens. We are expecting a baby when our daughter will be 21 months, and right now she cannot grasp that I have a baby in the tummy, but I think with more reading of this book that she will be able to learn about getting a new brother or sister.I haven't read any of the other books by the same author, I have only read this one.

It started off pretty creepy and it was the subtle things that were really intense, but then the movie just got stupid, rather than having interaction with creepy paranormal spirits it turned into your run of the mill low budged horror film.

The music, though peppy and upbeat, was unmemorable. The costumes and sets were beautifully 1960's, but the way people talked and behaved reminded me of sit coms from the 1990's. It didn't charm me.For a film about fighting prejudice, it certainly reinforced a lot of negative stereotypes! Although African-Americans and overweight people were championed, it was open season on high school teachers, fundamentalist Christians, the police, television executives, and beauty pageant winners.The film did have a few good moments. For one thing, that little Taylor Parks sure can dance! She lit up the screen!

Leave this sort of thing to Eddie Murphy who has already perfected it. Additionally, the big deal made over overweight people during the sixties is another nonsensical flim flam. During the sixties people were not so weight conscious as they are now. In fact skinny people were considered unattractive.

John Water's 1988 movie BLOWS this one away! The cast is better, the music is better, it is campier, it is non-stop hilarity! The cast includes Ricki Lake, Deborah Harry, Sonny Bono, Jerry Stiller, Pia Zadora, and of course Mink Stole and DIVINE (the star of this movie)!!! NO ONE can play Edna Turnblad like Divine and NO ONE can play Tracy Turnblad like Ricki Lake. Honestly....no one should ever try to remake a John Water's film. If you have not seen the 1988 Hairspray, please rent it and you will see what I am talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ugly Movie","review":"I can't stand the constant, in your face ugliness of the lead character or John Travolta, who must be desperate to fill-up his personal airliners. Too many sterotypes too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a fruitcake minus the fruit...and the cake","review":"The one and only star rating was for Christopher Walken.That aside, how could anyone NOT notice that what made the 1988 version great was totally missing? -The killer handpicked original music like Foot Stompin by the Flares, Madison Time by the Ray Bryant Combo, the Gong Gong song by the Ikettes and Shake a Tail Feather by the Five Du-Tones.... Plus the authentic choreography that went along with it?I mean the movie's about the influence blacks had on Rock and Roll and how white parents couldn't deal with it - so how's that come across with this Chitty Chitty Bang Bang score by Marc Shaiman?This was more like a Grease remake, complete with John Travolta trying to fill Divine's very high heels- I have bolster pillows that could have given a better performance.Ugh. Poor John Waters. He must be hurling big chunks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull - - I walked out","review":"Maybe a movie can be comedy, ironic satire, and musical all at once, but it's a tough balancing act to pull off.For example, the opening song \\"Baltimore\\" should be hilarious - - the whole idea of singing in delight of a famously dull city - - but instead drags on too long and can't quite decide whether to be serious about itself. In fact, all the songs last too long. I suppose that speaks to the quality of the song writing (\\"is the damn thing over yet?\\").Or consider the domestic scenes, exaggerated proletarian misery in wildly perky pastels. Is it supposed to be misery? Or Disney Channel comedy? or a mockery of misery? In the end it looks like they wanted to make fun of miserable conditions, while still being nice to them, but also not being too scary for the kids in the audience or offending the sponsors (god forbid the movie should have the ferocity of, ahem, a John Waters film).Can't review the entire movie because I walked out after about 20 minutes of this idiocy."},{"rating":"2","title":"hairspray","review":"This movie is great!

I was excited to see this movie especially with the addition of zac efron to an already pretty amazing cast. When the soundtrack was realizes I was SHOCKED to discover that Mama, I'm a big girl now was not on the soundtrack, a staple a felt to the Broadway show. When I saw the movie in theaters it just went downhill. Nikki Blonsky seemed energetic and cute enough but right from the start she didn't do justice to the play. Nobody did. My favorite scene is Ladies's Choice, a scene that was not in the broadway play so there was nothing to ruin. I was disappointed with the movie, it was good enough but the play is way better"},{"rating":"1","title":"ENJOYABLE","review":"fair acting.John Travolta is very good OK story line, an entertaining movie, nothing to get excited over. very fifties............ it is missing something like directing and better story line...........very teenie bopper"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward!","review":"That's the best description for this movie; awkward. Watch the dvd for the 1988 version of Hairspray which is outrageously funny and I would say a cult classic and compare it to this one. Only then will you realize it's an awkward movie because it completely fails to surpass, to meet and to even stand up to the 1988 version for so many reasons I really don't feel like typing so much.Do yourself a favor and purchase the 1988 version and hopefully one day it will come out in BLU-RAY!1988 Version of Hairspray in BLU-RAY AMAZON! : D I've been looking for it for a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star-studded cast makes great remake","review":"This remake of Hairspray utilizes the full talents of the star-studded cast.

In case no one else has noticed the music in this camp version is strictly 70s disco. The 2007 movie is also over-produced.The 1988 John Waters \\"Hairspray\\" is so much better that there is no comparison plus the music in the 1988 movie is completely authentic. Being 12 in 1962, I recognized all of the music and remember watching \\"American Bandstand\\" which it spoofed. Motor Mouth Mabell seems to have been based on Detroit's own \\"Martha Jean, the Queen,\\" even though it ostensibly took place in Baltimore.As for casting: the guys in the \\"lady's choice\\" line up, I could swear I knew in high school, casting did such a good job. From the costumes, to the music, to the casting, to the funny lines, to Sonny Bono's acting the 1988 version blows the 2007 version \\"out of the water.\\" In short, this 2007 camp extravaganza STINKS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch","review":"Fortunately we downloaded this movie to Tivo so we could fast forward to the annoyingly predictable ending.

Yuck!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Insincere","review":"The whole family fell asleep watching this one: wife, 3 kids, family dog, me.We thought it would be fun because we laughed so much when we saw the original (the one with Divine).And it marks the end of the civil rights era as far as I'm concerned. The issues are presented in such a light-weight, ho-hum, humdrum way, by such light-weight actors, that it's practically a slap in the face to anyone who really cares about civil rights.I miss Divine."},{"rating":"1","title":"john REVOLT-A","review":"Why was John Travolta cast in this part?

Divine was the ultimate Edna Turnblad and Travolta fell short in his interpretaion of the role. I thought the movie was watchable, but the musical numbers were long and drawn out. I fast forwarded through much of the music. Here's hoping that the remake of Grease never happens. No one can compare to the original cast of the movie musical!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a biased piece of trash","review":"I agree with another reviewer who stated for a film that is supposed to fight stereotypes it sure took shots at a variety of groups.

The musical was nothing but fun and expected the same in the movie. Sadly I felt it was a bit of a let down.I wish now I had rented the dvd rather than buying it. Some great songs were left out of the movie and the ending was changed to name a couple of reasons I was disappointed. The biggest let down was Travolta's role. I felt his character was totally distracting and all i could think of was there is John Travolata dressed in a fat suit. Why they didn't use Harvey Fierstein I will never understand.Nicky Blonsky was great, as well as Queen Latifah. Just my opinion, but I say rent it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent..","review":"I was hesitant about this movie since I had seen the original and loved it..boy was I suprised!

MY MAC WOULDN'T READ IT!The short explanation can be found in the fine print(!) below the credits: (second line) \\" This DVD will not work in a CD-ROM drive, and the DVD-ROM features are not available on Apple Mac OS\\". Actually, it doesn't only count for the DVD-ROM features, but also for the whole DVD. And, not only are Mac users concerned, but Linux users, too.When I finally got to view both DVDs (with Windows!!!!), it's worth every penny spent and every minute waited for its arrival.

Shame on you to dishonor those actors and actresses that made Gilligan's Island as famous as it is today..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible on every aspect","review":"Now I group up watching Gilligan's Island re-runs and I loved them. We have even bought the remastered DVDs of all three seasons so our kids can watch them, and they love them too. But this DVD is just terrible.First off, the quality of the transfer is horrendous. I mean I can't imagine the original show looking this bad when it aired on TV. There are parts that are so dark that they are barely visible.Second, the plot is worse than any Gilligan Island episode written 15 years prior. Now I recognize that the plots are suppose to be far-fetched, but this was just dumb.Lastly, it was obvious that the actors were dragged into this. It was great seeing the cast aged, but they had all lost their original spark. I felt bad for them because it looked like they were just walking through their lines.

It looks like a 3rd or 4th generation bootleg copy--grainy, dark, low definition, faded color. I really have to question if producer Sherwood Schwartz or whoever holds the copyright actually licensed it for this DVD. The VHS version has to be better. I suspected the low price... was too good to be true--buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rescue from Gilligan's Island Great","review":"Rescue from Gilligan's Island is a great buy. It is faithful and harkens back to the old Gilligan's Island TV show. It is both silly (like the old show) and heart warming as it shows the big heart of all the characters who, apparently have grown a little during their 15 year sojourn on the deserted island together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible transfer still fun to watch","review":"Using the term \\"remastered\\" for this release is misleading at best. The audio and video are terrible. The story is also weak and not up to par with any of the regular run material. But, it's still Gilligan's Island and fun to watch. If you are a Gilligan's Island fan and have a few bucks to spare why not get it. If you don't have the three regular seasons get one of them instead. Anyone waiting for a high quality version of this better not be holding their breath. Get it while you can before it goes out of print or someone decides it is a $100 collectors item. Now if we could just get the Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island, I would be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie......","review":"Does anyone know if this version is of better quality than the version that was circulating a few years ago?

I had recently purchased all three seasons of the show on DVD and wanted to have the entire collection from the initial ship-wreck to when they were rescued.

I watched them all many times and eagerly awaited viewing \\"Rescue From Gilligan's Island\\".What a disappointment (and waste of good money) the picture quality is poor, the sound is poor and the editing looks like it was done by a child.Having said that it was worth watching a poor quality DVD just to see them get off the island.I'm sure a pirate copy would have been better quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quallity and Cut Up Version","review":"As other reviewers have stated, this DVD is of poor quality and several minutes have been cut out.

I just saw RFGI broadcast on cable tv not to long ago and it looked 150% better than the DVD does. I know the source material is old, but thats just ridiculous.Unfortunatly, its a must-buy for Gilligan's Island fans, especially at this price!The DVD also has a bonus Little Rascals short 'Spooky Hooky', which has its own quality issues, but I wont go into that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tape was in poor condition","review":"The story was typical Gilligan's Island fare, so that was fine.

My problem with the DVD is the mastering is TERRIBLE. Imagine taking a film made in 1978, transferring it to VHS about 10 years later (without cleaning the film), then taking that same VHS tape 10 years after that and transferring it to DVD; it really looks that bad. In fact, there are messed-up spots on the videotape that weren't cleaned up so you see a replay of creases in the master tape!BTW, the re-cast of Ginger pulled the movie down a star; what a bad actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUPERBAD QUALITY","review":"I would not recommend this DVD to my worst enemy.The quality of the video is horrible.

But if you are a fan of the original Gilligan's Island series, you will probably be disappointed in it. It takes place away from the pleasureable island where the heart of the original story belongs. Instead, the characters have returned \\"home\\" to face new dilemmas, and the plot was rather stupid. Well, not \\"rather\\" stupid... It WAS stupid! That's only my opinion. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for fans of the original series","review":"I'm a fan of the original series, and generally not too critical of light-hearted movies like this, but I have to say that the writing for \\"Rescue from Gilligan's Island\\" is rather weak, to put it mildly. The jokes and dialogue are sloppy and not very funny, unless you're maybe 5 or 6 years old. Probably the worst scene is where Mrs. Howell suddenly calls out for a dog that she hasn't seen in years during the storm.....and Gilligan's wild reaction. Were the producers trying to give the impression that Mrs. Howell was going senile?? Still, it's nice to see the cast again after so many years, and to watch them get rescued."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD was unplayable","review":"Although I only paid less than $10, it is the principle that counts.

Other things could have been done just a little bit different and been exactly like the old Gilligan's island set - such as their huts. They were all totally different in this movie, making it seem not even related to the original show. I was also not impressed with Ginger's part after being rescued, when they wanted her in immodest dress doing immodest things. It was just such a poor script on their part that it is gross instead of funny. There is another movie entitled The Castaways from Gilligan's Island that has a laugh tract, care was taken to make things like the old Gilligan's Island and is much funnier. Get that one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy the other companies copy of this movie","review":"There is another company that has released this movie on DVD complete with the theme songs and credits.

Unfortunately, too much of the police work here happened \\"off camera\\" and the end went by in a blink. I felt cheated after trudging through the \\"mood of the city\\" descriptions and too many personal details. The conversations were nowhere near the Rex Stout level and nothing humorous anywhere. Especially wrong was the policeman's discussion with the reporter in the last chapter.(SPOILER ALERT)The detective gives the reporter his girlfriend's name and location \\"off the record\\" knowing the reporter is not to be trusted.

You get to meet Teddy when she was still Miss Franklin. You get to meet some detectives who don't appear in any other books (guess why!). Most importantly, you get to see McBain's genius when it was raw. There are a few clanking sentences in this one, and a few little mistakes that would never appear in his more recently written, more polished books. For instance: \\"The room smelled badly.\\" Even so, this is great fun and highly recommended. If you want to order more than one McBain, the best is \\"Ice,\\" with \\"Vespers\\" second and the books about the DEAF MAN also high on the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"oldie","review":"I prefer the newer 87th Precinct stories.

I have read most of them, but I hadn't read this one until recently. Written over 50 years ago, this book still stands up as a great police procedural. The entire series stands alone as great writing and plotting, and as the first one in the series, this one provides a firm base for the rest. I especially enjoyed McBain's foreword where he describes how he created the setting and the characters. Very interesting reading. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic but timeless","review":"I have not read many police procedurals but McCain has clearly created something very special.

As a keychain, it's small enough to fit in the front pockets of a pair of jeans, and yet it's large enough to be easily spotted if the owner is in a hurry. Its solid weight guarantees that it - and anything attached to it - will remain in whatever pocket or bag it's placed in unless the pocket or bag is turned upside-down and shaken, and although it doesn't actually transform into anything, it's just posable enough to create some very funny and very wonderful pictures. In other words, it's great for Optimus Prime fans but it probably won't appeal to other Transformers fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Diamond at his Best","review":"This is King Diamonds first solo foray from Mercyful Fate. The story telling that you will find in later King Diamond work is present here, but not as overblown and word for word as you might get in some later King Diamond work.

Any fan of King Diamond or Mercyful Fate would be foolish to pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Hail King Diamond!!!","review":"This is the first solo album by King Diamond. The album is a mix of story telling (which he would explore further with Abigail, Them, etc) and stand alone songs. The songs on here are pretty catchy, with plenty of dark atmosphere to them. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that IT DOESN'T HAVE \\"NO PRESENTS FOR CHRISTMAS!!!!!\\" Sure, you can find it on the Best of King Diamond, but it came out in this same period. Oh well, it is still a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Candle Must Burn Again....\\"","review":"10 stars all the way!!!! Man, this is a great album!! A perfect answer to Mercyful Fate's untimely demise. Only to be re-UN-born in this eloquent, masterful, brilliantly produced collection of searing and haunting tracks. A new line-up, a new look, tighter sound, better production, man, it's all here. Every track is great-- 'Dressed in White' may be the only filler on here, and it's still very well done. But from the minute you put it on, you discover that inner primal darkness coming alive through operatic wailing vocals, and fearsome, leather winged guitars. After Mercyful Fate, this was definitely King's best, it's follow up- 'Abigail' was good, but nothing could even come close in the years to come... It's as if this album was already written eons ago, like some ancient tome waiting to be discovered once again...If you like Dark and Heavy, then come see what you've been missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite King Diamond album","review":"This album reigns supreme in King Diamond's solo career in my eyes. Songs like the Jonah or the Candle can be catchy and spooky at the same time. It exudes an atmosphere inherent on other albums, but still sounds freshest at this point up to \\"Conspiracy\\". King Diamond has an uncanny sense of melody here, and it shows in his awesome singing. SOme of the stuff is unintentionally funny, but overall the horror schlock entertains in many ways. Highly recommended horror metal from the INSANE master of the macabre, King Diamond."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FIRST .. THE BEST !!'","review":"THis is by far the best King Diamond album. Released in 1986, it's a kind of third Mercyful Fate album. In any casse, is much better than the albuns Fate recorded after they regrouped ( \\" IN THE SHADOWS \\", etc ). It's pure metal, King singing over the top ( or screaming, anyway ).

However, when I wanted to take a second one, I was told that hypnotherapists as well as people practicing any other form of meditation were forbidden to take more than one course. Now if this is not prejudice and intolerance what is it? Isn't it in complete contradiction with the love and peace for all preached in a trance state by Goenka? Having read more since, I also realized that this is a very simplified and hypnotic form of Vipassana meditation for lay men and not at all the real thing advocated by the Buddha.

It is like being with Heinrich and Peter! Such an adventure and such were the lessons I too learned while reading the book.

Heinrich Harrer describes his escapes (from a British internment camp in India and subsequent quest to the Forbidden City of Lhasa. Written in the first person, Harrer paints a surprisingly human account of his journey, as well as those he met along the way - including, of course, his eventual connection with the Dalai Lama. This book is completely unpretentious and pays considerable respect to the Tibetan culture.Note: This book bares almost no resemblance to the move by the same title - it is FAR better than the movie. It's a real shame that the movie deviated so greatly from this great adventure. While one must despise the evil that China has, and continues to, perpetrate upon \\"modern\\" Tibet, Harrer's account may provide the best account of what that country was before the communist destruction of a culture that had so much to offer the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"english translation","review":"very good book.it is enjoiable to the reader and gives first hand info about tibet and surroundings .but there is but: its translations in english is execrable, dissastrous, shamefull; how can u say quote : 'rimpoche, now five and twenty years old' ???? besides this the whole book is full of clear german phrase organizaton; gramar mistakes and german sentence structures with english words.the publishers and translator whom i do not give the honnor of naming should be ashamed they sell such abbominations"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tale","review":"If you are looking for a really good read and enjoy travel, this is the book for you.

THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING STORIES OF OUR TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to The Eye or Abigail Instead.","review":"Ever since I bought Them and heard it in its entirety a few years ago I've been disappointed. I just recently gave it a listen and my opinion of it is still the same. I get the impression that this release was put together and released too quickly or something; the songs just aren't very interesting. Of course I'm not slighting the musicianship. The musicianship is good, it just doesn't matter though when the songs aren't standouts. I think that Abigail and The Eye are good albums, but Them has always been a far cry from those two albums. The album is a bit silly in places also. Try one of his other albums: preferable The Eye or Abigail--those are pretty good albums. Them isn't completely poor, but I think that it could've been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"IN A WORD: PAINFULL","review":"Before I begin I will just emphasise that DON'T BREAK THE OATH is one of the great metal albums of all time. COME TO THE SABBATH is worth the price of the cd alone. However this, King's third solo effort is a total washout apart from WELCOME HOME. The music and lyrics don't go together well, resulting in giving the listener a severe migrane. The sequel, CONSPIRACY is a vast improvement. If you've never heard King Diamond before this is definately not a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Diamond","review":"When I first time saw King Diamond's picture I thought he was some kind of freak! These days I think that he is a genius who has a strange musical character. This album is absolutely one of his best works ever! The Invisible Guests, Mother Is Getting Weaker and Bye Bye Missy are masterpieces for its lyrics and melodies. No one else could ever made songs like Diamond's Them album tracks. King Diamond's charicmatic, deep, sreaming, awesome, extraordinary and funny voice suits perfect for this album. Them would be a fine soundtrack for horror movie! Some people think that Them is an ultimate torturing album. In my opinion, it's a strange"},{"rating":"2","title":"A few things you should know about 'Them'","review":"Although trumped musically by follow-up recording 'Conspiracy', 'Them' has a decidedly eerier atmosphere. The opening shriek \\"GRANDMA...\\" still sends a chill down my spine. The cover sets the mood with its gloomy mansion, only the top floor lit, where the old crone sits thinking her murderous thoughts. King Diamond's vocals would grow more amazing on 'Conspiracy', but even here they attain heights of power no one else in metal could possibly imitate. The musical backing is competent enough in a NWOBHM style (with excellent lead guitar, and inventive flourishes on tracks like 'The Accusation Chair' and 'Twilight Symphony'), but it is King Diamond's glass-shattering vocals and brilliant story-telling that make this what it is - a heavy metal opera unsurpassed by anything other than its follow-up 'Conspiracy'."},{"rating":"2","title":"The crossroads where production and musicianship meet.","review":"This album is quite simply the pinnacle of KD's song writing talent. I was always saddened by the absence of Michael Denner on this album. While Pete Blakk is probably a better technical guitar player, Michael has a certain feel of triumph and depseration in his solos that remind me of Adrian Smith (of Iron Maiden fame). You can actually hear the bass on this one too! One of my all time fave's"},{"rating":"2","title":"THEE GREATEST!!!!","review":"I have been a fan of KD/ MF since the beginning (Melissa, Don't Break The Oath) and Them is by far the best album KD has made. Every song keeps you riveted and bangin your head. Where else can you listen to an album that has 3 or 4 unbelieveable solos in each song. Andy LaRocque and Pete Blakk put together solos that have more feeling and melody than anything you will ever hear. King also went out of his way with his vocal intensity and storyline. If you buy this album and have never heard any other KD stuff, I guarantee that you will be buying every album that he has made. Including the classic Merciful Fate albums that are equally as great. I have turned many people into KD/MF fans to the point that they were as obsessed as I am. Bottom Line: GET THEM, you WILL NOT be disappointed!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of King's best...","review":"Ok, I know I may be a young girl but I know King and I know that this is one of His very best albums. This was the first King Diamond album that I heard, yet after hearing them all, I've decided that this is my favorite. King's vocals on this album are amazing, along with the story and Andy's solos. In short, if You like King/Merciful, get this album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of King's best, second only to Abigail","review":"This, too, is another stunning masterpiece from King. Here you learn all about the demons that own and haunt the house of Amon, released through a ritualistic tea party by King's evil grandmother. It's another horrific tale sung in choral hymns that only King could deliver. My only problem with this disc is lack of bass, it's too drowned back into the mix, and the drums aren't prominent either. Otherwise, this one will chill your spine as much or more than Abigail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just As Good As Abigail","review":"The is a brilliant album from King Diamond, equal to Abigail. You wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's best work","review":"King Diamond is one of metal's best and longest lasting artists, continuing to release amazing metal records to this day. Growing up on metal in the 80's I had the chance to experience these records on their initial release (Roadracer records anyone?). Although most believe \\"Abigail\\" to be his breakthrough record I find \\"Them\\" to be a much stronger release. On Abigail, King found his now signature sound breaking away from the Mercyful Fate thing but Them perfected this new found sound. Every song on this record is strong and the intro song alone should send chills down your spine. Lyrically this record tops them all weaving an amazing story tht keeps you entranced while the music gives you whiplash. An amazing record for any new King Diamond fan to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"this book is perfect for young infants--starting at 3 months when they begin to really enjoy books. it has a good story line with interesting cadences and bright colors that babies enjoy looking at. highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for Something Different?","review":"Looking for something different to make on your scroll saw?

I spent many summers driving between Northwest Kansas and Mexico City. As time sometimes does, this read made me realize how lucky I am to have a background with two cultures. Reading this book was like spending afternoons with my mother and my mexican extended family. Not a page went by that I didn't laugh, wince (I, too got a bad haircut on a mexican road trip,) sigh, or most of the time, cry. I kept telling my husband, this book is me, this book is my childhood. I am in a book club, and was pleased to find out that all eight of us loved the book, but none quite as much as me. Thank you Sandra!! I feel like we could sit down over a warm bowl of fideo soup (which I make for my family all the time) and chat."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved Caramelo","review":"I am a black gay man and I loved this book. It's not just a beautiful trip through Mexican culture, but it's also a story that all humans can relate to. A story of family, perseverance through adversity and a story of finding the way to loving ones self.Extraordinary. I am now officially a fan of Cisneros."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I couldn't wait for this story to be over. I listened to the audio book and I must admit that Cisneros is a fabulous reader - her voice and inflections and reading ability was fantastic. But the story literally bored me. I can't believe I listened to all 14 hours. Granted her \\"poetic\\" writing, with the descriptions and the lists, was interesting... for about the first half hour. After that it was trivial and started to sound like the author was just trying to fill pages. And when she started reading personals from a newspaper written by folks not involved in the story - for about 20 minutes!! - I thought I was going to die. I never got involved with the characters and honestly could have cared less about their lives.So two stars for the first class reading ability. The story alone would have gotten one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book","review":"Caramelo is very Mexican, but at the same time delves into our common human experiences and relationships with a depth that is astounding.

I'm a Chicana, and I don't know why I'm supposed to believe any of this. It reads like a bad tourist vision of Mexico, of Chicanos whose life is just one cheap joke after another. Why are people taking this seriously? The best thing about this book is the cover, but Rosa Covarrubias must be turning in her grave, to be turned into the poster girl for the silly glorification of rebozos and tamales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caramelo","review":"I listened to this book on tape and found it to be the most irritating book I've ever tried to listen to.

No los se, pero yo por mi parte estoy contentisima que lo lei en espanol. La verdad, actualmente lo estoy leyendo de vuelta. Como me encantan las voces de los personajes! Ay, cuando la abuela enojona habla es como si estuviera saliendo de las paginas una persona tan inolvidable,tan reganona, tan unica... casi puedo oir su voz en mi cocina. Y saber mas de su ninez nos ayuda en entenderla mejor (aunque sigue siendo dificil...)La traductora Liliana Valenzuela hizo un trabajo extraordinario con este libro. No hay nada de rigidez ni de torpeza- fluye con gracia y humor.Me gusta este libro bien mas que La Casa en Mango Street. Este cuento esta lleno de color, de vibracion, de gracia. Lindisimo. GRACIAS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A string of pearls","review":"Okay, I confess I have only browsed through CARAMELO and not read it all. But I just want to say that I love that Cisneros has retained the vibrant voice ala MANGO STREET, although more mature, and has structured her expansive tale in short, engaging chapters. Yet they seem to connect together like a string of pearls. I know on each page I randomly opened to -- I could hear the playful, wise, sad voice from MANGO STREET. So many writers of long novels seem to get bogged down. Sandra seems to fly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still stuck...","review":"I was so excited for this book and for Ms. Cisneros. I was first in line to purchase it. However, when I looked through it, I was disappointed by the fractured, child-like chapters. Those would have been acceptable some of the time, but not so consistently! They were like small portions when i wanted a serious burrito. The longer chapters did, however, capture a narrative, but they were akin to the uninterrupted, smooth motor sounds from an otherwise busted up brand-new used Cadillac. There were parts that were moving. There were parts that were annoying (the footnotes, in particular, felt condescending). Overall, I suggest that Ms. Cisneros abandon self-conscious writing and leave that to the wack mid-30s gringos who don't have a rich narrative. Stick to a true, connected plot (that doesn't mean you have to be serious) and ditch the jazzy fonts, and you won't stay stuck for long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"Cisneros captures (most) Mexican and in general Latino families perfectly. Yes she does use some sterotypes but in my opinion they are sterotypes that many times are true and I do not feel that they are all necessarily shameful. I'm mexican American, and I'm not trying to speak for the entire community in any way. I felt she gave the reader a deep understanding of this rich culture even the importance of the reboza does not seem that important but when I thought back to my visits to Mexico I just remembered that many if not most women even from different classes wore a rebozo so it can be seen as an important aspect of many Mexican women's lives. I enjoy Caramelo because of it's honesty and her desire as she says in the novel to simply tell a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliving my childhood","review":"Sanda Cisneros taps into my memories of childhood as a Mexican immigrant growing up in the states and driving back to Mexico in caravan with other cousins, time and time again for our annual vacation. Simply amazing!! Reading this book brought a smile to my face, reminding me of so many quirky qualities of my own family. The family arguments, the mannerisms, slang, etc. Wonderful!! I can't recommend this book enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book","review":"I loved House on Mango Street but I couldn't even make myself finish this book. Too many characters and too much spanish splashed into the novel for me personnelly to be able to complete it. House on Mango was so great and this is so drab - amazing the difference in the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"A first time author would never be able to get this to print","review":"Will Sandra Cisneros always be our token Mexican? Will she always get away with mediocre writing? My suspicion is yes, she will. My husband and I enjoyed bits of the book--Cisneros has a good ear for dialogue--but much of the book was painfully obvious and pointless. It felt self-important with that midwestern writer workshop aura to it and everytime a character enters a room he/she must list the contents of the room. We listened to this on a road trip and it might have made the trip that much longer. I also had a copy of the book--which I recommend over the audio (to avoid the screechy whiney voice). Unfortunately, Chicana lit. rises and sets with Ms. Cisneros when it would do better to spotlight Viramontes or Castillo or even Denise Chavez for that matter. Don't let her kid you. Cisneros is not our Shakespeare, she is our Danielle Steel."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will need all three books in this series...","review":"Well-photographed and highly informative, this book does a good job of covering the historical backgrounds and styles of these glass companies. There is a comprehensive sampling of each company's candlesticks, but the key word to remember is \\"sampling\\". One will not find every single candlestick design ever made by these companies, but one will find numerous examples. Pricing is fairly good (this is a 2003 book), and while the pages of company patterns at the back of the book are helpful, I would love to be able to have the examples organized by design, rather than company, when searching for the probable maker of a mystery candlestick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than worthless","review":"I would hope that a book with this title would at least have its facts straight, but with even my limited knowledge, I found errors in almost every chapter. Where were the editors and fact-checkers?? Some of the errors are just silly: \\"water weighs about sixty pounds a square foot\\" (!). Some of them are confusing: one tablet of Potable-Aqua \\"should disinfect about 16 liters of murky water\\" (the label calls for 2 tablets per quart!). It's not correct that 7.5-minute topos always have 20-foot contour lines (in fact, it varies, depending on local terrain). The advice on overheating is potentially life-threatening, since it doesn't give the simple and clear diagnostics that you'll find in any first-aid manual between heat prostration (pale and clammy... rest and drink fluids) and heatstroke (red and hot... call an ambulance, rather than fanning yourself, as the author recommends!).

It was a fairly enjoyable light read (I used it as a bathroom reader, sorry Robert) but I have in the past and plan in the future to travel to some of these places he mentions and I feel no better prepared for them. Perhaps it is good he does not instill a false sence of security in people by giving them clever 1,2,3 recipies for difficult situations.

Unfortunately, the illustration of the authors' ideas does not work for me. It seemed that they were trying to attach too much emotional energy to a sub-modality which could then simply be re-arranged in one's mind and presto! everything was cured. In a lot of ways the book ended up trying to be a quick-fix. This method might work with getting children to overcome their fears, but I think adults are a little more complicated. It's a nice beginning but the too-nice ending gives the book a 'slimey' feel. Either that or very new-age. Hocus-pocus. Just follow these instructions and out come blueberry muffins!

The translation works very well, although I miss the dialect. The story is just fantastic. About a small village in Norrland (northern part of Sweden) a long time ago. Life and death in a village hit hard by the Great Sickness. The best is, however, how well the form corresponds to content. The real question is how to distinguish right from wrong?

To avoid every illusion, he warns his readers that the book is not \\"a typical self-help book\\" and therefore, does not \\"promise miracle.\\" The fact that the author makes no presumption, makes it possible for him to be down to earth and therefore, convincing. The question whether Enneagram makes sense or not, is a question ones needs to answer after going through the book and after having understood his/her personality type. The only proof of Enneagram's accuracy is to have identified your own personality. And I think this is itself a miracle. The historical survey of Enneagram is objective. Personally, I found the book very useful. Discover your self by discovering the contents of this book.

And totally ignored are evil, neurosis, mediocrity, stupidity, growth, change and personal development.

This extra information is what sets this book apart. When I told my endocrinologist that someone should write a book solely about Graves disease, he said, \\"why?

This album proved me wrong. This album is all slow riffs with possibly the worst attempt at vocals ever. In earlier Sepultura albums, I can actually say I enjoy the vocals.

This album was definitely a new direction for Sepultura, but I think they were good before and after this album. If you like Sepultura, get \\"Arise\\", this album, and \\"Roots\\" and call it a day.

That is certainly evident in this movie. The script is just a mess. But the lead actress' performance boosts this film up from a one star to a two star review. And it's amazing that she never acted a day in her life prior to this movie. You read about all these actors studying acting for years and years, and then learning their craft on stage before attempting films. But Haing S. Ngor was actually a medical student who went to keep a friend company who was auditioning. The casting people asked her to audition, since they liked the way she looked. She read and got the part. Those poor parents paying thousands of dollars for their kids to get drama degrees at Yale Drama School. I'll take an \\"amateur\\" Haing S.

Instead I found it to be an incoherent film with very little organization. I found myself constantly questioning the motives of various groups, for example the Vietcong and their vicious attacks on the village even though they were trying to gain support among the farmers. I found the movie to be overly dramatic and poorly directed. All in all a less then average movie, which may have gained good reviews from its subject only."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is great, the movie is a waste","review":"I loved the book, so I thought I would enjoy the movie.

Quick to read instructions are accompanied by lots of photo illustrations to show you how to insert text, tables, grahics and forms, and then explains how to publish your site to a web, (but unfortunately not how to make corrections once it's online). You can follow along on your computer to learn the basics in a very short time, but since the author has you open a new page each time you practice using one of the components, you don't get a feel for how to design and arrange a page with multiple items or how to move things around on the page.

From Metallica, who consider Mercyful Fate to be one of their main influences to Megadeth, Alice In Chains and Iron Maiden, who have borrowed certain riffs time and again. For example Iron Maiden took the beginning riff of \\"Curse of the Pharoahs\\" and used it in their very popular song \\"Run to the Hills.\\" This one is a classic because it has the popular Fate songs as they were played originally and live; before the release of Melissa. And Satan's Fall is one of the heaviest and longest songs about Satan that exist. James from Metallica refers to the song as \\"12 minutes of Satan.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"great old school black metal","review":"This is some very good stuff.There are many classic songs that can also be found on Melissa and some that are not on that album.\\"Nuns have no fun\\" is a great song.This stuff was a good start for the band but i think that Dont Break The Oath was Mercyful Fates best album.And what is that other reviewer talking about comparing them to Christian Death?He says \\"if you want some real GOTH/DEATH ROCK.....\\".If you think that Mercyful Fate is even trying to be a death rock band then you shouldnt even be reviewing this album.Although Christian Death with Rozz Williams was great.The mention of Christian Death has no place in a mercyful fate review.Anyway,Mercyful Fate is a lot better.Buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"these dvds are bad if your really into skateboarding these are not for you even if your not its not for you the music is really bad they show some of the same clips over and over again the only reasons i gave this a 2 is because sometimes they show some pros somethimes dont buy terrible if you do buy the dvds your going to regret it trust me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good But Not Great","review":"There is a couple really good songs on here but if you're paying more than $5 for the cd you might as well buy the 2 or 3 singles frim iTunes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Latinoamerica: Presente y pasado","review":"It arrived earlier than expected, well ahead of the date I needed it, and was in perfect condition.

Some of them where very challenging that me and my husband had a hard time doing, but they made you think outside of the box. I highly recommend this book for any kid who is struggling with writing. The fun activities take the pressure off of the grammar and helps kids put their thoughts together and in order before they write."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Journal Topic Book EVER!","review":"I LOVE this book! I use it in my 6th grade (in a middle school) language arts block classes - one standard and one essentials (remedial). It is challenging for both groups, and that usually does NOT happen. The topics are so unusual and interesting. My students will start out saying, \\"that's impossible to do!\\" or \\"there's no way I can do this!\\"; but after they start and find that although challenging, they CAN do it. Then they really get into it. They jump all over each other to share out loud, something that can be a challenge to get 6th graders to do.I write in my journal along with them and I find it fun too. I appreciate the \\"sample answers\\" just in case I'm feeling a little less creative. I highly recommend this un-journaling book for the classroom teacher and home schoolers as well. You will love it and so will your students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Class Starter","review":"I have been using this Unjournaling book as bell work in my 9th and 10th grade classroom. The students have enjoyed the off the wall topics. I have heard several times, \\"I love this!\\" And this is coming from my reluctant students. I have added specifics to some of the assignments - like \\"you have to use three of your vocab words in your paragraph and highlight them.\\" Or a specific type of sentence needs to be used.

The \\"answers\\", or examples of written responses to each writing prompt, though, will either limit the follower-type, or encourage the creative writer to think \\"I can write better than that!\\" For teachers, a good book to use for writing prompts - just don't share the examples unless the class is really at a loss.

The store manager opened the package and put the battery in for us to make sure it worked because he said sometimes they didn't.....that should have been my first clue. The first one didn't work properly. That should have been my second clue. He opened a second one and it worked fine. We packed it away in our suitcase because I didn't want to listen to that all the way home from our vacation. He got it out as soon as we got home and he and his sister played with it and had tons of fun. But two days later, there was nothing......the battery was fine and we even tried a new one. But nothing. This thing is a piece of garbage and was a total disappointment. I'm trying to contact the store where we got it to see if there is something they can do for us. But being that they are 1,000 miles away and we paid cash, I'm not holding my breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Japanese Ska-Punk","review":"This is an awesome cd of fast Japanese ska, with a little punk blended in, that features some of the best horns I've heard in ska. The vocals could be annoying for some people because the guy sings in English with a heavy accent,though I believe the accent kinda makes the music sound a little better. I recommend this album to fans of fast catchy ska-punk, who can also enjoy a few slower songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just doesn't get any better then this","review":"When I first heard of the album's genre, I was a little bit of a skeptic. But, any true music connoisseur will appreciate the intermingling of vocals, guitar solos, and magnificient bass riffs. I recommend this ablum to almost anybody with a love of music who's sick of the androgyny on the radio airwaves. As their debut album, this one simply kicks. My favorite is definitely the 10th track, however the instrumental track could use some help. But they do get much better, as followed up by their next two albums, 77 days which has a little more Less then Jake influence and then going back their own sound with a more polished feel in Senka-Senrui. If you love ska with a taste of punk, you'll be hooked by this band. They simply rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album, with lots of good stuff for beginners.","review":"On their U.S. release, \\"Little Playmate,\\" Kemuri shines through as a tremendous ska band. Crossing the tasty rhythm with the hot horn section, they have carved out a niche for themselves as masters of the genre. The vocals, though sometimes muddled (and occasionally in Japanese), have an excellent rhythm of their own, and in times are as much of an instrument as the rest of the band. Particularly check out the track \\"Ato Ichinen\\", one of the Japanese entries. This is an excellent CD to listen to if you are just getting into ska; it will truly win you over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh, funny and a GREAT ending","review":"I picked up this book because it was on the discount rack at a bookstore in Phoenix SkyHarbor Airport, but soon I couldn't put it down. Between Phoenix and Boston I read most of it and stayed up the rest of the week to finish it. I've felt like Siobohn and Ralph many times- stuck in a rut- and enjoyed the really original plot and story.The very different characters weave together so well. I HIGHLY recommend this book and anything else Lisa writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a Guy's World","review":"I simply wanted to say that this book is nothing like Trials of Tiffany Trott or Making Minty Malone(Books others bought). They are humorous and sweet but I found Ralph's Party to be coarse and no fun. As the title implies it is about Ralph but I never liked him and I think the little humor that there is directed more to men. I couldn't even finish it but I did skim thru to the end and I really don't think I missed a thing. Any ladies out there who like Isabel Wolff I think Marian Keyes is more our style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is a great variation on the Bridget Jones/High Fidelity \\"young unmarried Brits\\" minigenre. The characters (with the exception of Cheri) are very realistically drawn, and their motivations are so true-to-life. I agree with many others who think this is a movie in the making! I finished it in two sittings, so driven was I to keep reading. Though the climax does fall prey to a bit of implausibility in order to wrap up all the loose ends, the strength of the characters' thoughts and feelings make you forgive that lapse in order to reach the (happy) ending. I also must say that the interior monologue on fat was absolutely wonderful-- a techinically superb piece of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book!","review":"The title of this book is a bit of a misnomer- when I started reading, I thought that the book would begin with a party, and the rest of the book would be about how the events of that night changed everyone's lives.It was quite refreshing to see that I was wrong! Acutally, most of the book describes the lives of six singles living in London, and the party is just where everything pans out.The characters are very well developed. Sibohan, Jem and Ralph are the ones you learn the most about, but you still learn a great deal about Karl as well. The other two, Smith and Cheri, are not as well developed, but you don't really feel like you are missing any information about them.The plot is fast moving and keeps you entertained. Everything is well thought out- all plot lines are followed through with to their completion.This is the first Lisa Jewell book I've read, and I look forward to reading more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A comedy of errors-style novel","review":"This novel is very funny and makes you cringe several times with what the spanish call \\"verguenza ajena\\" (when you feel deeply embarrassed for the behavior of somebody else - I am sure all the teens will know all too well what I am talking about). The story and most of the characters are not believable at all, they work more like archetypes, but it's only fun fiction, right? So we do not expect the magnificient prose of Ian Mc Ewan here. I liked the more serious One Hit Wonder, was very disappointed by Thirty Nothing, but I am glad that I gave Lisa Jewell another shot with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life of the party","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Lisa Jewell knows how to pull the reader in and believe in the characters, their faults and all. This is a story about 6 people and their 20/30 something lives and their realizations of finding true love. It was funny, magical and witty. Different from other brit chick books, because a least 1/2 of the book is coming from the point of view of some of the male characters. A must read for anyone that likes comedy romances with some twists and turns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray for Ralph's Party","review":"I was caught from page one. I love Lisa Jewell and had read Thirtynothing before reading this book, so I knew I was in for a treat.Ralph is the man in love with Jem, who is in love with Smith, who happens to be secretly in love with Cheri, who has been having a sexual relationship with Karl, who lives with his girlfriend Siobhan. Jem feels fate has sent her to live with Smith and Ralph and fall in love with one of them. She thinks that Smith is the one, but is surprised when she has feelings for another.It's all very twisted, but all comes together for the better and for the worse. A great read- one that belongs in a personal library and to share with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous Read!","review":"I am an avid reader of \\"chick books\\", but that is not how I would classify this one. I really like that you get to see things from both the male and female perspective. I fell in love with some of the characters, felt sorry for others, and was completely surprised by one. I felt like I really got to know the characters, and I felt like I had to say goodbye to my new friends when I read the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one grew on me","review":"Despite its somewhat slow beginning, I was grinning like a fool at the end of Ralph's Party when the boy got the girl and the bad guy got his comeuppance. It's a predictable little treat of a novel, perfect for those who want some relaxing beach reading for the summer but have already read both Bridget Jones installments, perhaps even more than once! I enjoyed the premise of the book -- you follow along the lives of a few people who live in the same building, and they all meet at the end when everything falls together.If you enjoy this genre of chick-lit, I also recommend Marian Keyes, especially Watermelon, her first novel, and Last Chance Saloon, which comes out in the States in August."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, funny book","review":"I read this book in one sitting, restraining myself from peaking to the end to see what happened because I was so curious! It was an excellent book, one that my husband and I both enjoyed, so not just another \\"brit-chick\\" book! I found this book more fulfilling than the author's \\"Thirty Nothing\\", as the characters were more interesting in this one and much more was going on as there were several interweaving stories, making it impossible to put down. If you are looking for a quick, fun, interesting book, this will keep you turning the pages to the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"another british contemporary novel to add to your list","review":"I was reeled into the character's lives immediately.

It is a quick and entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"um.....boring......predictable......stupid","review":"I don't mean to be rude, but I HATED the main character of this book. She was completely pathetic and not even developed by Jewell. This book was very predictable and not a fun read.

I was utterly disappointed. I felt like I was watching a really bad episode of Beverly Hills 90210 set in England! I stuck with it, however, and at least read the only good part---Ralph's actual party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, overly dramatic","review":"I first read Lisa Jewell's second book, \\"Thirty Nothing\\". I found it highly predictable and was about to give up on this author when I read so many positive reviews about \\"Ralph's Party\\", so I decided to give it a try. Well, I was definately disappointed. The characters are shallow, bitter, untrustworthy and unrealistic. Most scenes were overly dramatic, like a really bad soap opera.... by the time I got to the part where Ralph was organizing his party, I had to stop reading it. It was just too much garbage.I don't know how people can compare this with Bridget Jones's Diary. It's not even in the same category! Bridget Jones is funny and witty. Lisa Jewell's novels are stupid, predictable and not even remotely funny. They are just a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"I love \\"chick lit\\" books.

I'm a big fan of brit chick novels (loved Bridget Jones, Getting Over It and Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married), but this book was as superficial as they come. A light, run read doesn't have to totally lack any depth to the plot. Don't assume your readers are that dumb, Jewell. Give us some character development for crying out loud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"After reading some of the reviews I decided to buy this book. I have never been so disappointed. How can anyone even compare this book to Bridget Jones? I have to admit that I didn't even make it to the party. I have never been so bored in my life. There is no substance to any of the characters. It is all about meaningless relationships and not funny at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best","review":"Perhaps I just don't click with Lisa Jewell. I didn't find this book particularly funny or touching. Her characters seem dryly typical and the storyline has been done. At least it felt like it has been done.

I really expected more from this writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun British Chick Lit","review":"If you like British chick lit you will enjoy this book. It is a fun, enjoyable quick read. I really loved the storyline and the friendships in the book but at times I felt like the book was dragging just a little bit.

It starts in the midst of a raging blizzard, and the action hardly ever lets up over the next 180 pages. I won't give away any key plot points, but the hero, Slocum, gets involved in an extensive cave adventure, a Russian duchess, and a small array of villainous and eccentric side characters - one of whom had apparently killed an old friend of his. The book is an engagingly written, action packed adventure with moody and suspenseful cave exploration sequences, complete with pitfalls and stalking gunmen; wintery outdoor adventure scenes with life-or-death peril; and of course some steamy (!!) encounters with western gals, which are well-placed within the story. The end result is ideal escapist reading for cold winter days and (especially) nights.

Well anyway, it's the movie adaptation of the classic novel which is also the basis for Apocalypse Now. It does have some good acting from Tim Roth, the main character, Isaach de Bankole as their black helper who is also a cannibal, Morten Faldaas as the harlequin (the hippie in Apocalypse), and John Malkovich as Kertz (Brando's character). The problem is that the directing is pretty horrible. For most of the movie nothing happens and then the actual exciting part (where he meets Kertz) is way too short. The movie is very confusing and it doesn't really show what's supposed to be so significant about Kertz."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEART OF PACIENCE !","review":"Tim ROth always accepted projects he judged would be different, that would have real potential to show his great talents as an actor.

But I never thought to write them down and then to compile them into a book.David Wyatt did. He noted his thoughts, his observations of other people and discussions. He has combined these into an awesome tale. It is not a tale of the heroic. It is not a politically motivated diatribe dripping with hatred like Fahrenheit 9/11. Somewhat autobiographical, this book is also a reasoned yet emotional and reflective essay on the way our world changed on 9/11.I have the feeling that this book is too emotional, too thoughtful to be the all time best seller on the incident.

It's true.. Melissa is the best old-school metal albumn there is, but this cd is garbage. When it was re-released on Roadrunner they remixed the vocals of the song Melissa (track 7) and is absolutely terrible. If you're going to buy this record (or if you own the new copy) go to a 2nd-hand store and get the one releaed by Megaforce in 1983. (20286-7369-2) It's going to be a tough challange to find an original, but the difference is astounding and you'll have a newfound appreciation for the song."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame","review":"MELISSA is a shame. Such a talented, hard hitting, creative, strong band led by a stupid Spinal Tap-like singer capable of writing some of the most mean, vile, bad tasted and stupid lyrics ever.Musically, MELISSA is metal at its best. The empathy between guitarrists Hank Shermann and Michael Denner is breathtaking. The rhythm section of drummer Kim Ruzz and bassist Timi Graber is also astonishing, all in perfect harmony.But King DIamond ruins it all with his foolish lyrics.Musically, this album is five stars. But as I feel offended when hearing some singer scream junk in my ears, I rate it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melissa is a must have - the ORIGINAL not the remastered","review":"Melissa is an amazing album.That said, this remastered version is very subpar. The songs don't sound right. They sound much weaker and too modern. \\"Satan's Fall\\" has been altered structurally and is far inferior to the original. The changes made simply do not make sense and ruin the momentum of the song. Listen to both versions and you will see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the pantheon of heavy metal's finest works","review":"From top to bottom this album in masterful.

Thanks God!!!","review":"As King Diamon (one of the worst singers ever) did not scream so much here, MELISSA is the best MERCYFUL FATE record. It's a debut with a fresh, tight, strong sound. EVIL is ne of the best heavy metal songs ever, period. The long SATAN'S FALL is amazing, an example for Dream Theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa is one of THE BEST metal albums out there","review":"King Diamond does an incredible job hitting those high and low vocals and that is not even half of it. The guitar is one of the best I have ever heard. Sure Diamond can be whiney sometimes but the guitar is incredible. Especially in \\"Into The Coven\\", \\"Evil\\" and \\"Curse of the Pharaohs\\". I am not sure about Mercyful Fates later music but their music from the 80s still rocks today"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Fan gives nom-biased input. Great Mix.","review":"I bought \\"break the oath\\" and \\"melissa\\" from the recommedations of this service.I'll tell ya why \\"Melissa\\" is the best album. Its because the mix is very centered around the drums, which helps to emphasize the syncapated groove. This is one of those albums where you can really hear the snare and kick-drum clearly, and the whole thing funks it up just a bit more then other \\"washed-out\\" & \\"busy\\" mixes....Not to mention the fact that this is a sophmore effort for this group, therefore, as most early albums are for new bands, means the songs are very strong.If your new to Mercyful Fate or King Diamond, I definately reccomend this album before the others.I will say that I enjoy, \\"Fatal Portrait\\" & \\"Abigail\\" from King Diamond too, but they are more busy & progressive and dont have the same funky drum mix...."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome \\"the original death metal band\\"","review":"this is a classic,if you are a death metal fan ,find out were the roots are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recipes","review":"I could not be more pleased with these recipes.

It is discontinued, there is no support for it, but I knew this when making the purchase.Just trying to make sure nobody else wastes their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk","review":"If there were zero stars...I would rate this pile of garbage with a 0. On the surface it appears to have many positive attributes. In fact, I bought this form my son thinking he would enjoy it and I would save a bit of money as compared to purchasing an iPod. The player broke just outside of the warranty period. I contacted the company and after 4 months of chasing them, they actually replaced the player. Initially I was very impressed. Then the player brake again. Like I said...Junk. I bought an iPod for my son. It has not broken down. He is happy and I am wiser."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIo Karma","review":"This player is the only player I have found that can play back Ogg Vorbis files. I've used that codec to store my entire CD collection, so I really had no choice. It has a vast number of playback modes, good sound, and okay battery life - about six hours or so before recharging.The downside is that as far as I have found, it cannot play legally downloaded song files from iTunes (which uses ATRAC) or Napster (which uses WMA). So unless you only want to listen to MP3s or tracks ripped from your CD collection, getting new tunes (legally) could be a problem. For a few hundred dollars more, you could get an iPod that lets you do both that, and connect to iTunes.Still, I like the Rio Karma, and it works well for how I use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"I purchased the Rio Karma because of the price and for a 20 gig MP3 it was a great deal, but that's where the great deal ended. The player itself is great! It is very user friendly, but it has one extremely bad design flaw, the power button location. It is located on the top of the player next to the headphone jack and it is so dam touchy. The player I purchased powered on and off by itself and when you hold the player in your left hand your thumb is right on top its extremely sensitive power button so you tend to turn it off very easily. I got so frustrated with the dam thing that I sent it back. The bottom line is this, if you want an inexpensive 20 gig MP3 player, this is your baby, just remember, you get what you paid for! No wonder Apple is putting these people out of business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this item...","review":"I just returned the remanufactured version of Rio's Karma. When I purcahsed it, I understood that the term \\"remanufactured\\" means that the product won't be in the best of shape. However, when I opened the \\"well packaged box,\\" I found something that I wouldn't have even payed ten dollars on EBay for.The player was in such poor shape that the LCD was barely visible because of all the scratches. Furthermore, I found the last owner's name still written on the battery cover!The term \\"remanufactured\\" is such an understatement!!! The product was simply purchased from someone who had abused it and placed in a box and sold to someone else. I would think something that was remanufactured would at least have new plastic coverings to make it look presentable.In short, please don't waste your time with this product, you'll simply end up returning it as soon as you open the box!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective on delivery","review":"I've read about these players... and how good they are. I've also read about how bad the hard drives in them are. I recently decided to buy a remanufactured unit from Amazon, hoping for a good unit for half the price. It had a defective hard drive when I got it. It's also very worn out. I think, according to the serial code, it's just about 2 years old.I thought about trying to return it, but I also read about how extremely bad RMA service Rio USA had when they were still in business. Now they've gone out of business, so I won't even try taking my chances with them. But all hope is not out, because you can swap out the hard drives yourself, and even put bigger ones (up to 60GB) in there instead. It's just too bad that the new 30 and 60GB drives are pretty hard to find.So I really don't reccommend this remanufactured deal, unless you're willing to take the chance of having to disassemble the unit and putting a new drive into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You missed the point","review":"The plot is a parody of Hermann Hesse' Siddartha.

Better yet, Country Joe & the Fish appear as bumbling bandits, the James Gang appears for no apparent reason, and the great Elvin Jones is ace gunfighter Job Cain, who cooly blows away the hot-headed upstart then sits down and plays a drum solo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST!","review":"This is a great book on acting. It covers everything you have to know about auditions. It has very valuable information of what to do and not to do in the audition room. It also has scenes and breakdowns step by step so you, actor, can understand better how to do it. It comes with examples of good resumes, interviews with agents, casting directors and managers.

It even caused my platoon sergeant to tell me to take it off because it was offensive. Too bad for him, he didn't tell the guys wearing rosaries to take theirs off too.I love the tarnished look and it's anti-reflective qualities allow me to wear it on my vest and not make me look like a gangsta with bling-bling.My only complaint is that the leather cord it comes with was tied wrong so that no matter how I would wear it, the cross always flips backwards. I just used a different chain and it works fine.It's cheaply made but looks more like dark, tarnished metal, which I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but not durable","review":"The cross itself is very pretty, but unfortunately the hoop broke off just days after being worn for the first time. It didn't take much effort at all, I just accidentally dropped it on some grass and the hoop broke off, so now I have no way of wearing it. It's very cheaply made, but the design is very nice, and there's no denying that's a beautiful piece of jewelry. Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very undersized, but looks decent.","review":"As a three-time buyer from Dan's Jewelers, I know what to expect. I've always been impressed with every necklace I've bought from them but, much like the guitar necklace, I'm disappointed on the size of the pendant itself. I mean, it doesen't look bad when you wear it and there is obviously a lot of detail here but I think it should be much bigger to show that detail. I'd really love to see a bigger version, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. The biggest pendant I've seen from this seller is the bearded dragon, which is borderline huge but it looks great and I think this would be an awesome follow-up.

She loves Grover, so it was an obvious buy in the frist place. I really like it because it made up of mostly 99.9% muppets with very few people in it (which she really doesn't care for). It really holds her attention a lot better than some of the others which have more people in it. She is always asking to watch Grover. Money very well spent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a polemic, and a badly written one, at that.","review":"This is neither a biography of jay, nor a history of his times, but a polemic intended to show that, because John Jay was a Christian, the Founders could not have believed in separation of church and state. As you might expect of one who holds such a thesis, the author writes at about a sixth-grade level. Actually, it reads a lot like \\"1066 and All That,\\" but this author is deadly serious, and deadly dull. I didn't get very far into the book before deciding to return it, and I would give it zero stars if that were possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"River Ran Dry","review":"I really wanted to like this album, especially considering how much I enjoyed the first 2 LOA releases but it is just truly uninspired, bland, downright bad music. The only songs that I can listen to are Weeds, Heroin Dreams, and My Mind Is Dangerous. The rest is garbage in every sense of the word.

SSS, however, simply does nothing for me. I dont consider LOA sold out as some do, but I simply do not find anything of interest in this washed out pop rock. The songs do not strike me as being particularly emotional, to the contrary, they seem empty and mechanical. The lyrics are utterly nonsensical and Keith Caputos voice has steadily worsened with each album, this being his most nausea-inducing performance yet. Apparently, LOA has recently broken up, despite plans for bass player Alan Robert to take over vox after Caputo's replacement whitfield crane departed.

When they started they where originally part of the NYC hardcore scene. Their first album, River Runs Red is a masterpiece which was tapping from the same sources as Northwest bands like Soundgarden and Alice in Chains where at the time. LOA where never copying grunge.

I fill up my daily vitamin cases for a week at a time and leave them on the counter to remind me to take them. But I make sure to leave the rest of the caps in the refrigerator.Update: Sadly Amazon has stopped carrying these on their Subscribe and Save Program...hopefully they bring it back, it's so nice not to have to worry about ordering.

I've been told that you have to be very careful about that.I've done background checks on different companies and Country Life has nothing but the best to offer! They actually have designed many products that I've tried before with GREAT results! This one is no different.I tend to do a lot of product research as there is SO much to offer online.. If you research the different forms of bacteria in this product, it offers specific strains of bacteria that allow an increase of your already exisiting forms as well as introducing new ones.I've had less gas, bloating and more regular visits to the bathroom.I have read that you need to take in a lot more water when you take products like these to increase the effectiveness.

Matter of fact, the same results would be achieved by using an inexpensive exfoliating scrub. This product doesn't even come close to other peels, esp. those containing beneficial and safe amounts of acids within this same price range. Not sure what \\"CelluZyme technology\\" consists of formulation wise but it isn't making me do cartwheels in excitement for this product or its claims, that's for sure.

This album was made back when sheer speed and horribly detuned guitars were NOT the norm. The ability for the musicians to play their chosen instruments well and the incredible COMPOSITIONS on this disc are what will keep me listening to this great album for many more years to come. King Diamonds voice is a little too much for a lot of folks, but if you want to hear songs that rival the compositions of band like Led Zepplin, but with a truly HEAVY sound, this album is a MUST HEAR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Black Metal","review":"This is an excellent heavy metal album. The production on this album is crisper than Melissa, with better separation and clarity.

(MAKES '9\\" SOUND LIKE A JOKE!)","review":"This album is pretty damn cool. The singing gets annoying but the music makes upfor it. Its too bad that there's only one musician from the original Mercyful Fate (Hank) still in the band today. Compared to this one \\"9' is a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD","review":"Except for the ridiculous Satanist lyrics, I must admitt the guitar work in this CD is one of the greatest ever recorded!

Stunning riffs, blistering solos, melody and speed:a record that will have roots in guitar history!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Foolish...","review":"This CD portrays a sad history.... Strong and creative riffs, amazing guitar playing by Shermann and Denner, precise drum playing by Kim Ruzz, great metal music.... All that arsenal at the disposal of one foolish singer called King Diamond, who, for this album, wrote some of the most pedestrian satanic lyrics ever. Seldom have I heard such a quantity of [junk] coming from the mouth of a singer.

King Diamond's voice has a Halford-esque quality to it when he hits the high notes, but is still original in its own right. The music itself isn't dark, but the lyrics certainly are, focusing on demonic incarnations and meetings with the devil. Obviously, you can't take that sort of stuff seriously. Just don't play this at your grandmother's 80th birthday party...In summation, this album kicks. A necessary listen for the devout metalhead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Satanic Metal","review":"Great satanic metal without being thrash. If you haven't heard King Diamond's voice before, you you may want to listen to it first as his voice ranges from very high pitched falsetto to guttural from one bar to the next. If you don't like falsetto voices then you probably won't like King Diamond. What really makes Mercyful Fate great is the talent of the musicians. Great talent all around with alternating lead guitars. Although I find 'Melissa' to be superior in terms of music, this album still delivers quite a punch. Every song on this album rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stickiness!","review":"I had high hopes for this product as I LOVE the Bumble and Bumble line and I also LOVE what the ocean water and air do to my hair.

The way he sat there in the audience watching the trio, but mainly looking at his son Oscar, face filled with pride. Oscar was happy that his father had got to see him climb to fame.

It is now hard to give it as a gift when it was given to someone else, and that's written inside the book. Had I been told this at the time that I ordered it, I would not have gotten it from this seller. I am not happy with the seller that I did not get all the information at the time of my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eternal Journey NDE Experiences","review":"Excellent reading material if you are interested in Near Death Experiences (NDE). The authors of this book do not try to decipher the subject into the depths of medical science which could easily sour the subject such as many other authors have done. The experiences written of those who have had the NDE are to the point and share both the bad experiences as well as the good which enlightens the reader into the depths on the NDE. It is quite easy while reading this book to have the feeling that you are in a private room with the person and hearing their story. I have recommended this book to many people and am quite satisfied in owning the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book without guile.","review":"I've read this book twice, and I intend to read it again. This is simply the best organised, straight-forward, most scholarly account on the nature and purpose of life that I have ever read. Yet, at no time did I feel that I was being \\"sold\\" a particular dogma. There was nothing that I had to sit down and struggle to accept or rationalise;it just simply had the ring of truth. One look at the table of contents reveals the clear, logical organization of the book- there is no fuzzy minded pseudo- mysticism here. Everything from the nature and purpose of pre-earth life, life on earth, and post-earth life is right here. You find definate information on everything from angels, bewildered spirits, pets; to the big questions like the purpose of life and the nature of suffering. If you've been told that you can't possibly understand the great mystery of God's will, try reading this book- it gives some satisfying and comforting answers in clear and simple language."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eternal Journey","review":"Insightful, informative and to be believed.

I found the author to be out of touch with reality and very sexist. Evidently (given that I'm a man), I sit around doing nothing but watch TV and expect my wife to wait on me hand and foot. Yeah, right.Even looking past the obvious sexism, I couldn't find much that could be considered practical regarding new ideas for organization. About half the book talks about the psychology of what the author calls \\"messies\\", and the rest was just common sense. Nothing new. Nothing of value which I didn't already know.Very disappointing indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy Book","review":"This book itself is in need of decluttering. It's a mess! If there are any real organizing steps, I never found them It seems to be written exclusively for housewives with lots of kids. I waded my way through an explanation of right brain left brain theory followed by a silly short story. I skipped chapters about the husband and kids I never had. I finally gave up in a chapter about my dream house. At least the price was right. I paid nothing and got nothing in return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your mileage may vary","review":"Quite a range of reviews for this book; it seems to have different appeal to different types of people. I enjoyed the writing style and her approach very much and will probably re-read it. My only problem with the book is that the testimonial letters are written in a script font that is a little difficult to read on the Kindle.There are many books full of organizing tips, and some great Kindle blogs as well.

However, there were very few de-cluttering/ organizing tips and loads of excuses as to why messy people are messy. Sorry, I don't care if you are right or left brained... just give me nice, simple tips about how to organize/ de-clutter. This book enables messy people. Epic fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted money","review":"This book is essentially a regurgitation of numerous other tomes on decluttering, but provides few tools to realistically make it happen (for me anyway). Flylady [...] provides actual tools, rationale, and gentle encouragement free - plus has a mailing list with reminders and stories (also free). Idiotic to pay for this book and waste the time reading it when far better FREE material is readily available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Worth The Price As A Free Download","review":"Unfortunately, this book was worth exactly what I paid for it - zero dollars and zero cents. I actually plowed through the entire thing on my Kindle, which took tremendous discipline (and stubbornness).The author gets bogged down for a few chapters on the right brain/left brain psychology of who is a \\"messy\\" and who isn't. Then she punishes us with an extremely long, completely unrealistic story about a kid whose room gets so messy that he literally cannot escape his room. Neither credible nor relevant.I was expecting and hoping a more disciplined approach to the topic - with concrete suggestions and tips.I'm going to live organized by deleting this from my kindle.If this is still free for the Kindle, have at it - you may disagree with me, but if you have to pay for it, consider what my review and others have said first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete let down","review":"There is not real constructive advice in this book, just rehashed theories with no real advice. It takes a great deal of reading ( 50% in fact ) to get to any methods and then they are only a few pages long, then it's back to the silly stories theories. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speaking about clutter....","review":"This book spent a great deal of time talking about why she thinks people are messy (about 6-9 chapters, depending on whether you consider some of the chapters in part 3 useful - not really tips, a sort of pep talk). I say \\"she thinks\\" because I cannot find the psychology/scientific references for behaviors in the book. The editor should have make her keep to 1-2 chapters, and make most of the book about how to fix it. If a messy person picked up the book, which I suppose was her target audience, they may have put it down, because it takes too long to get to the help sections and to find the tips for organizing. However, it was free on Kindle, so what can I expect?"},{"rating":"2","title":"luuuuuv it!","review":"I am shocked at the bad reviews. This book changed my life.

Instead, I found a lot of information about why certain people are messy and why certain people are tidy - nice to know, but it did not really translate that into tangible tips to transform your house. Like other reviewers, I felt this book was a salespitch for her other book \\"Messies Anonymous\\" - whenever she referred to it, I thought \\"why didn't I just buy the other book??\\"... but that quickly translated into \\"why did the author bother to write this book if her other one is so good?!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated Sources and Colonial Attitude","review":"Marrin's book makes significant use of outdated sources, many before 1970, as well as romantic photographs and illustrations. Although the book is impressive for a young adult audience, with its bibliography and textbook feel, the lack of current scholarship on Sitting Bull is apparent as one reads through the chapters.I would not recommend this book to any age group. The perpetuation of colonial attitudes is prevalent in Marrin's book. As well, the lack of Native voice is apparent. Marrin often negates Lakota spirituality and projects the romantic, utopic Indian with phrases like \\"Oh no! He was none other than the buffalo god!\\" The heavy (and skewed) emphasis on war and killing in the middle chapters begs for historical qualification- and makes for barbarism for children who have little frame of reference.This book suceeds in keeping American Indian people in the colonial time warp and does little to portray Sitting Bull in an humanistic fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from a \\"Hidden\\" book","review":"We had a fabulous time on the French Polynesian islands with \\"Hidden Tahiti\\". That book took us to out-of-the-way natural beauties, great local-style restaurants and shops, etc. So, when we were set to travel to Belize, we expected more of the same.Hidden Belize was NOT the same. We found nothing hidden in the book that wasn't over-publicized by local tour agencies, hotels, etc. The great little local-cuisine restaurants of the Tahiti book instead was replaced with all the expensive restaurants catering to wealthy US citizens wanting gourmet dinners. We found great local establishments featuring great local cuisine and culture all on our own. We actually used the recommendations of this book as places to stay away from.The one redeeming feature of this book was a good overview of the geography of the different areas of the country.So, as I said, my wife and I like to experience a lot of local flavor on our trips, and this book showed us none of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have no problems what so ever","review":"great, fast, works, perod.using it with canon powershoot s20 (3 megapixels), happy as can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work","review":"I bought this to upgrade my toshiba notebook.

Allen West's music is kindergarden metal. His riffs are so simple and boring to listen to. Trevor Peres is the better guitar player and should have done more of the music on this album. I've only listened to this album once and I've cast it aside (far aside). There are two songs I can tolerate on this album, and I know they were written by Trevor. The difference between Allen's music (how dare I even call it music, shame on me), and Trevor's riffs is like day and night. Allen west has probably never even taken one guitar lesson.

Don Tardy and crew are right back on top of the Death Metal scene. With a two meaning title, they came back strong after a 3 year wait and have a catchy Death Metal theme. The different recording style (recorded with a live like sound instead of dubbed over each other) adds a more realistic sound to the album. I've seen Obituary live many times and must say they have a power about them on stage. This was a big factor in accepting \\"Back from the Dead\\". The orignial style of the vocals and crushing sound of the music has also returned. No effects from machines, just the bands raw talent. Obituary will rule the Death Metal scene as long as it continues releasing albums with the extreme sound and brutal lryics found in \\"Back from the Dead\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Obituary seems to follow an every other type of format, that is to say everyo other one is really good.

It's definitely a must read book for everyone who rides bicycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great.","review":"I found this book disappointing, especially after reading the rave reviews of others. This book tells the story of Harold Wagoner's bike ride from Seattle to New York. While I admire him for the adventure, most of the book is just reporting mileage, temperature,and meals. It is more a log book/journal than a travel story. We see little insight or growth from the author as he makes the trip and when it is offered, it is all Archie Bunker and bumper sticker slogans. By the end of the book, I was ready for the trip to be over.I gather this book is published through the modern day version of a vanity press. There were some enjoyable moments and the author has writing talent. But jarring typo's, punctuation errors, and spell check errors like using \\"they're\\" for \\"there\\" reduce the enjoyment. He could have benefitted tremendously from the help of a good editor.I don't think this book was worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"This book has inspired me to do a cross-country bicycle tour.

Personally I like the drama of seeing real guys fight a fire and that's what I saw on this disk.I liked the scenes where you can see the firemen take down the really big fires. Their equipment is so antique that I got very tense and worried that there would be no way possible to take the fire out.When they do, I practically applauded in my seat.What you should be aware of is that this is seriously vintage footage - so don't expect Hollywood cinematography.Instead just sit back and check out the flames."},{"rating":"1","title":"This does NOT work!","review":"I figured I'd save money and purchase this battery instead of one of Canon's for my S45 camera.

It wasn't polished as far as guitar and drum tones went, but overall this album is 100% Deicide; putrefaction and annihilation. Guitarists Brian and Eric Hoffman rip out plenty of guitar solos on here, Steve Asheim's punishing drumming echoes throughout the heaviness, and Glen Benton's deep monster-like growls and bass roar like a beast awaken from a slumber. Best songs are \\"Blame It On God\\", \\"Slave To The Cross\\", \\"This Is Hell We're In\\", \\"Father Bakers\\", and \\"Serpents Of The Light\\".Another great death metal release from one of death metal's all time greats. Buy it now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Release Yet!","review":"This is my personal favourete.

This CD is a waste of satanic, sacreligious, trash. Don't get me wrong, I love death metal, but none of the ones I own put down God like that. I happen to be a born again Christian(although I'm a metalhead) and I have never seen such lyrics like these. Anyone who listens to this needs to go to church BADLY! Try something not so evil like Cannibal Corpse, Obituary, Morbid Angel or Napalm Death, but Deicide is a bunch of evil pathetic losers."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this crap ?","review":"A guy bashing god for no reason and no talent musicians--this isn't true deathmetal by a long shot!

Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sacreligious mess","review":"I simply hate Deicide. I might be a metalhead, but I agree with many of the other reviewers. Death Metal is probably the best genre out there, but these guys are evil and really mean it. I'm a Christian (weird, because I'm also a huge metalhead), and I just can't believe the stuff I hear on this and all of the other Deicide albums. If you think Slayer or Slipknot are Satanic bands, just wait till you hear these people. Slayer's most recent album, \\"God Hates Us All\\", was a schitzophrenic mess which proved to me that Slayer no longer has the talent they used to, and Slipknot's most devilish cry yet was \\"people = S***\\". Any band like Deicide are living demons. I can't see why a band wants to be so evil. These guys want to be evil, so let them. They'll just fall victim to the scathing critizism they deserve. If you want good death metal, check out Cannibal Corpse, Napalm Death, Death, Carcass, Meshuggah, or Arch Enemy. Deicide belongs in a category all of their own: blasphemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good band.","review":"Regardless of their tired boring subject matter, Deicide is just not a good death metal band."},{"rating":"2","title":"chico!","review":"This cd is real slower than there early ones.

The vocals are equally uninspired. It looks to me to be all about touching a nerve to get publicity, like an anti-Stryper. I threw it away and used the case to store a copy of BOOTDISK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"If you like this band, you dont know what death metal is.

What do we have here. The same ole same ole satanic lyrics, written quite terribly and unpoetically by Glen Benton, only this time, the music is just as bad. Take a bunch of disconnected guitar riffs that do not fit together, poor musicianship and songwriting (technical or not, it's a poor piece of music), generic growls, and an overall uninspired sound, and this is the album you get in the end. This won't scare anybody. The only thing \\"scary\\" about this album is that people paid for it and enjoy this generic piece of trash.Try Krisiun's new album, or perhaps Immolation's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than plastic loom!","review":"This metal loom is much better than the plastic loom.

Being their second release, \\"Holy War\\" is not as polished as Under the GB, either musically, or in production. However, it has some interesting moments throughout the CD and has the unmistakeable Dragonland sound.Unfortunately, the CD purchased from and created by Amazon, doesn't play properly on any player I own. They issued a replacement, but sadly the result was the same and I had to return it. If you can get an uncorrupted release elswhere, then I would suggest it is a worthwhile buy, but it is not outstanding in any particular area, just solid power/fantasy metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AN OFFICIAL RELEASE_WATCH OUT","review":"Please don't buy this CD.

Perhaps someone should cash in and write a \\"Heel Hate\\" book real quick.This book could be helpful to the few idiots in every fan base who post on team message boards around the clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent view of the best rivalry in sports","review":"I purchased this book intending to give it to my UNC grad father-in-law. Before I could get it in the mail I started reading it and could not put it down. I am neither a lover nor a hater of either Duke or North Carolina, but that hardly matters. The writing is clear, mostly free of sports cliches and in many parts funny and insightful, especially when the author writes about his mother and deceased father. Thankfully, the author spends little time with game summaries and much more time dealing with the personalities connected to the Duke-UNC rivalry, both past and present. My only criticism is that the Duke bashing is a little over the top at times, but the author is a UNC alum after all. This book reminded me in a lot of ways of \\"Rammer Jammer Yellow Hammer\\", a look at obsessive Univ. of Alabama football fans. Both books are well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a damn good read","review":"Any intelligent fan of Carolina basketball will probably enjoy this book. I think most fans of Duke basketball could enjoy it too, despite Mr. Blythe's obvious dislike of their team, their coach, their players, and most everything they stand for. However, since I agree with Mr. Blythe, I'm not the most unbiased reviewer.I can say this book captures North Carolina in a way that few books do, via the sport of basketball. It's a classic rivalry that does seem to represent two fundamentally different ways of life. Since I tend to sympathize with the left, the Tarheels, the locals, I've been on the losing side of late. Here's hoping they all make a comeback. And that Mr. Blythe's book sells quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carolina Blues","review":"Blythe's TO HATE LIKE THIS reads like an old-fashioned SI closing feature article. Entertaining, funny, informative and well-done. That's its strength. It's also its weakness in that it doesn't quite add up to a book. Still, who outside of Durham doesn't slightly smile at someone talking openly about Duke's pretensiousness. And yet, Blythe acknowledges that his own bias as a NC lover is out of whack also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice addition to the UNC b-ball book collection","review":"A nice complement to my collection of Tar Heel basketball books. Less academic than \\"More than a Game,\\" not as historically informative as \\"Blue Bloods,\\" and more honest and personal than just about every other UNC B-ball book, including Dean Smith's (collaborated) memoir.

I read this one to him for bedtime and I got a kick out of it myself. It was kind of predictable from an adult perspective but the kids didn't seem to catch on and were surprised as the story progressed. It's wacky and bizarre enough to appeal to young preteen males and fun for girls too with the medieval setting and the girl in disguise character, Erica AKA Eric.

Diseases discussed and broken down extremely well, with everything actually being explained rather than simply stated. His method of delivery is to break things down by effects on organ systems. The book also serves as an excellent guide to the treatment of those diseases... being basically a pharmacology text as well. Its an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing conclusion","review":"Although the animation and storyline faithfully follow along the same timeline. This production was made without any of the original voices from the previous two series so I felt like these were strangers. Like many people, I have fond memories as a child watching this cartoon series but as I watched the Bolar Wars series, I couldn't get into it because I didn't believe I was watching the adventures of Wildstar, Venture, Sandor, Nova and the rest of the crew. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The first two Star Blazers series' are disgraced by this addition to the collection. The dreadful voice characterizations, along with the inane dialogue, ruined the already weak plot. It's not just that the voices are different from the original cast...it's that they are BAD voices period! Poorly chosen voices made this almost unwatchable. Not even worth renting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern view of history","review":"This looks to be just another look at the Northern re-write of history after the war. I would not recommend this to anyone wanting anything different than the standard Post-war Nothern view. If that \\"New York\\" view of southern history is what you are looking for then this is probably something for you. Otherwise I would recommend a much better and more informative and well researched book by Paul R. Peterson on the topic which includes 500 pages of well done research from several points of view. It is not boaring and offers a refreshing alternative to the politically correct and \\"parrotted\\" version that we often see re-published every few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death metal with the qaulity of Bach","review":"Who ever thinks that death metal is written by morons with no talent is mostly correct. This album by Obituary is actually intelligently composed and artfully executed (no pun intended). It shows a level of artistry that is way beyond the strereotypical death metal album. Even though it of a qaulity that would please any music critic, it does not mean it is a light or commercial recording. The rythems are absoloutely bone crushing, and the drum work is mind blowing. The album is flavored with sound effects that give me nightmares, and the vocalist is pure evil. This album is not for the faint of heart! Totally awesome even after listening to it for 8 years now, this classic will survive for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Obituary's album","review":"I think everybody agree: this is the best Obituary's album...very well structured songs, good sound, powerful riffs and guitar solos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obituary's best","review":"This is definitely Obituary's coolest album. Don Tardy's double bass is perfect, the guitars are super heavy and John Tardy's vocals are wonderfully sickening. Who cares if you can't understand the words..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute masterpiece","review":"The reason I like this cd so much is because it is simply one of the heaviset records i have ever heard. The drummer donald Tardy, and singer John of the same name do great things on this record. Along with the other members they make a great album, which after all this time since it was released in 1990, sounds very good. It's remastered now so it even sounds better. Hope you like it.Although this genre is not my ideal music listening, you cannot ignore it. Obituary will split your head in half while listening to it because it is so heavy and so well played.People could do comparisons w/ other groups of this genre like Slayer, but obituary is somewhat above Slayer. Slayer is good, but Obituary is much more extreme. It's like a comparison between Led Zeppelin and P Floyd. Zeppelin is classic r&r, and Floyd is MUCH more."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets","review":"This album sets the standard for death metal; that's how good it is. In a genre where far too many bands opt for all-out speed at the expense of power, Obituary keeps the pace down and gains unmatched crunch. The production is absolutely fantastic, vocalist John Tardy is in top form and guitar mercenary James Murphy adds som nice melodic touches to the wall of sound. The bite of \\"Chopped in half\\" and \\"Find the arise\\" have yet to be topped by any later release by any band.The only metal album better than this one is Slayer's \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\", and if you want just one death metal CD in your collection, this should be it. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good price, separate switch for fan/lamp, a little loud","review":"For the price it is ok, but it is a little loud(3.5 sones). Bought a 250W lamp, which is quite good for mild winter such as here at northern california with a tiny bathroom. I bought it because I dont need to upgrade my electric to support a 1500W heater anyway, with that limitation I dont have much choices for light/lamp combo. Having separate control is a big plus: I hook up the fan to a timer switch and have a separate switch control the lamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indicitive of the times it was recorded","review":"This is perhaps one of the greatest albums of the 70's and it is by far the best album by Marvin Gaye.

When I bought the 1998 Remaster CD release, however, all the songs had been cut up to play continuously instead of individually. For half of the songs this works ok, nothing is lost, but for two songs in particular--\\"Save the Children\\" and \\"God is Love\\"--lyrics, dutifully printed in the insert, have been cut from the end of the song. (\\"Save\\" loses 2 lines, \\"God\\" loses a whole stanza.)

If you don't own this album, you must get, any other review on here will tell you why this is a masterpiece. If you own one of the first generation CDs of this, replace: those sound terrible, as the result of using a 3rd generation tape to master it. The reissue Motown released a few years ago was a vast improvement, but it is irrelevent after this. The sound is great, the extra 2 hours of tracks (including live performaces of all original tracks) is genius. Possibly the best reissue I've ever seen, definitely in a long time. Well down Motown and Tamla."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the century","review":"Marvin Gaye's brilliance reached its summit with this album. The album evokes images of society in music never before seen before and, in my opinion never since. Gaye's abilities to triple track his voices to the amazing array of musical arrangements is surreal and really takes the listeners into what Marvin is conveying with his songs. With this, the album moved me like no other and i am sure that people who have listen to it would agree. Those who haven't, should since they are listening to a musical genius and can really experinced what great music really is. I recently read somewhere that marvin said that he did not really feel like he was the one writing this album but that God was writting it through him, Marvin may have been right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic album with amazing sound quality...","review":"We all love this album or else you wouldn't be reading this but with so many versions out there which one should you buy?This hybrid SACD (also playable on any CD player or computer) is the ultimate version pertaining to sound quality. The new Mobile Fiselity Sound Labs (MoFi or MFSL) has been hitting things out of the park lately. This release is about as good as it gets. Their new mastering engineer Rob LoVerde mastered the SACD and vinyl editions from the original master tapes and presented us with a clear and dynamic disc. I'm not sure how you could make these tapes sound any better.Thanks for another fantastic release MoFi!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"As I am a big fan of Marvin Gaye, it was difficult to give this recording only two stars, but 1st of all there was no warning on Amazon that this was a stereo only sacd, which I don't buy usually. That said, I have an SACD by the rock band Boston, which is recorded in stereo only and the sound quality is leaps and bounds better than the standard CD version.This Marvin Gaye SACD, I compared to other recordigs I have of him on CD and I can detect little or no difference.I was disappointed by this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Gone on For Way Too Long","review":"In my opinion this ranks as one of the most overrated recordings in the history of popular music. Sure, it's plenty good...and made a big impact at the time of its release. But, there are several weak songs, and it has not aged particularly well. I can think of a dozen soul records that deserve greater accolades: Prince's \\"Sign of the Times,\\" The Isley Brothers' \\"Brother, Brother, Brother,\\" three records by Stevie Wonder, a few by James Brown, Curtis Mayfield, Al Green, Ann Peebles, Otis Redding, Smokey Robinson, Aretha Franklin...and others.

Every inch of his talent and qualities is to be found on this Motownalbum."},{"rating":"2","title":"A God Send.","review":"A masterpiece. There is so much worth discussing within this album, I hardly know where to begin. There are so many metaphysical and psychological issues at play that one could write books about the implications in these songs.

This was a challenge to better our lives and communities.

This was the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" of Marvin Gaye's career, only here the \\"show\\" is a dark allegory of strife and protest. It's theme draws an eerie parallel to Gaye's murder.

Firstly there are only 9 songs compared to a whopping 17 on the Very Best of the Lighthouse Family, so it's easy to see where to go for value for money. Secondly, Mr Gayes' anti war sentiments seem somewhat nave and foolish in today's political climate. Thirdly, Mr Gaye can't sing and has to resort to shock tactics such as singing in a high voice like a lady in order to sell records. No wonder his career ground to a halt in the early 80's! Verdict: avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so.","review":"This is supposed to be a 'classic' album, but I must admit to some disappointment.

What a disappointment! It seems to me to be an uninteresting pile of mush. Crooning and strings, crooning and strings - no hooks, no beats, no dynamics, no arresting melodies, no actual SONGS. It just plays and plays and plays and plays, kind of the way my wallpaper just sits there on the wall day after day. I found myself forgetting the songs AS THEY PLAYED. I tried it twice and nothing left the slightest trace.I read all these glowing reviews and I have to think that I have been listening to some other greatly inferior album!

All the rave reviews here on Amazon inspired me to buy this album...but having listened to it very few of the songs in this album are anywhere near a 5 star rating.

Buy e.g. Otis Redding instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"I have had this album for over 10 years now and I am still trying to work out what the fuss is about. I adore Marvin Gaye and his work, but this album leaves me cold. It is a hotch-potch LP of classical and jazz. I go along with Motown who didn't want to release it at the time. If I was to direct somebody who has never heard much of Marvin, this is not the album I would direct them to. It is a very depressing album, however it gets one star because it is produced well. Other than that...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic?? Right On!!","review":"This is one of the most profound releases of all time. Not only is What's Going On a collection of some of the greatest R&B; music ever, but it is simultaneously an American history class and, over thirty years after the fact, a thorough summary of current events that tells it like it is more than any recent State of the Union address.With themes that deal with the ecology, the economy, struggling to make ends meet, and war, Marvin Gaye's lyrics in What's Going On are perhaps more relevant today than they were back during its release in 1971. Unlike so much of today's media and their commentators, Gaye got to the heart of the matter and gave insight to what is important in this country.If only America would wake up and see where things are headed. Listening to this material would be an important start, for it is no Dog and Pony show that seems so pervasive in what has seemed to become a less enlightened, less civilized culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, but don't be tempted to upgrade","review":"An utterly classic, highly-recommended album, but if you have the previously-released remastered version you don't need this.

This is the sequel to Julie and Romeo, another charming fast read. While you could read this one first, why would you?You do care about the characters and want everything to end happily, but there's no surprises or narrative tension.

However, this book has been printed with pale blue letters on white paper, so the contrast between the text and the paper is minimal, the standard norm is to print a book with black letters on white paper. After having read the first two pages with a powerfull lamp my eyes were burning with pain, this lasted two days. So I have layed this book aside as being unreadable. Such a pity the publisher used an amateur - probably a diciple of Yogananda - to design this book.

Even if the book was a hard copy I would not pay ten bucks for it. But let's talk about the book content now. Every chapter is so irrelevant, so outdated, and you have to search the internet to find the knowledge gaps that the author leaves. Also the book doesn't include examples that could complement the theory and the problems of each chapter, just hold on, this is incredible,the chapter problems are the most ackward, rare,irrelevant, clumsy that I ever seen. Oh, and you don't get to see at the end of the book the answers to the problems, so you will never know if you got it right. Honestly, I feel I've been robbed, the first days with this book I thought this was a joke or that someone made a mistake and printed other thing.I've seen a lot of bad books in my career but this one is by far the worst.

What I was expecting was something similar to the condo part of a Molly and Friends model 36 cat tree (which I'd be satisfied with, even if it didn't have sisal on it). What I received doesn't have sisal, has dimensions of around 14x14x11.5 inches, and doesn't have a hole on the top (which is important, if you have a multi-cat household and don't want a cat to be trapped by one of the others).

Hitchcock's movies ultimately made sense---this mess wanders aimlessly to a contrived and flat climax.Poor Brittany Murphy looks totally lost and her performance is surprisingly dull.

With Adams' permission, the staff had a few prints made with the idea of exhibiting or publishing them.

Please stop.\\" [Quoted in Mary Alinder's bio of Adams, pp. 382-383.]I can guess at the motives of the people behind this book (who knew Adams, and had to have known of his opinion regarding this aspect of his own work), and they should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for inspiration","review":"This book uses photographs by one of the century's greatest artists. Not just photographers. But the sad part about it is, and this was made perfectly clear by him - there is no mistake - he DID NOT want it to be published. Why? According to his nurse/assistant/friend/biographer Mary Street Alinder he did not wish them to be published because the color photographs were not good examples of his vision.Sophistry will never be able to compensate for the point that he didn't want it published. No amount of money made will justify it. Historical value yes. Ansel's vision on a new level? Hardly.At best it's a curiosity. Like listening to Beehthoven plink on the piano coming up with another passage. A symphony it ain't. And Ansel, of all people, is the lesser for it if it's ever put forward as art, and not simply as history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight About Color Photography For Ansel Adams Fans","review":"As a photographer with over 50 years of experience with cameras, I found the color photos by Ansel Adams interesting and enjoyable to peruse. But, the most important aspect of this book for me were the quoted passages from Ansel's letters and other writings regarding the challenges of making meaningful and art-level color photographs. Ansel envisioned the coming world of color photography and even foresaw the post negative film era that might happen as he wrote many years ago when color slide film was his choice for its stability and vividness. But, when he wrote his book, the color films then available to the photographer did not enable the degree of post-camera manipulation and fine tuning of photographs that we enjoy today with digital photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"My princess is thrilled!","review":"Who thought a pillow would be such a hit with a 5-year-old?

And to the readers who actually want to find something out about this game I'll tell you. This is a great game for kids who can't have dog or are too little to take care of one. These dogs never age, so they are always a puppy, and you can keep it as long as you want! It never dies, never ages, it's the perfect pet! I have golden retriever named Daisy. You can do all sorts of things and have up to eight dogs! In most states that's is against the law! You can keep three in your home and 5 at the hotel. See the game packet for more details. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game Very Educational Durable Toy GREAT OVERALL!","review":"I think Nintendogs is a very good game if you have allergies to dogs, this is a great way to care for, train and even take your puppy for walks. You can also buy stuff at the stores and meet other dogs to play with at the park and while you take your dog for walks. Nintendogs Duchshund and the two other nintendogs are mostly all the same.

I bought the game with the understanding that it wouldn't become a substitute for more important activities, and now we can't even put it away for a few days because bad things will happen to these virtual pets. I absolutely hate this. The dogs seem pretty real in ways and the child grows to care about them. To be punished for not turning on a video game is a revolting concept--I would never buy anything with a similar feature again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good game!","review":"This game is one of the most fun ones I have ever played!

WAIT FOR THE PSP PORT OF NINTENDOGS. Why buy 3 Nintendogs DS cartridges to get all the breeds when, from what I've read and heard, the PSP version of Nintendogs will have all breeds on one UMD disc?!? (that's the beauty of optical media, all 3 breeds can fit onto one UMD disc rather than having to use 3 SEPERATE cartridges, as is seen in the DS version of Nintendogs).So my advice is wait for the PSP version of Nintendogs. You'll only have to buy one UMD disc rather than 3 seperate cartridges (as is seen in the DS iteration of the game)....thus you'll have spare money to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORED STIFF","review":"FIRST FEW DAYS WAS FUN NOW IM BORED ALL I DO IS WALK THE DOG PET THE DOG WALK THE DOG PET THE DOG WALK THE DOG PET THE DOG WALK THE DOG PET THE DOG YOU GET MY POINT ITS REALLY BORING AND I HAVENT PLAYED IN A WHILE AND I THINK MY DOGS ARE DEAD AND WHEN I TURN IT ON I EXPECT TO SEE A PILE OF BONES WHICH IS SAD CUZ I LOVE DOGGIES GET A REAL DOG THEY ARE MORE FUN THNKS FOR READING IM BOBBY AND IM 7 YEARS OLD AND I DONT LIKE THIS GAME"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the PSP port of the game....help the victims of Tsunami Katrina instead!","review":"Hello, people!

Video games are supposed to have action and adventure in them. I don't see any acion or adventure in changing ur dog's water bowl. Training an imaginary dog? What an adventure!!

It uses all of the DS's controls, especialy the MIC (and of course, the touch screen). In Nintendogs you get the reel feel of being a dog owner, both responsibilities and rewards. You can train your dog, clean it, play with it, pet it, walk it, and buy accessories for it. You may also enter it in contests to earn money. You can buy up to six dogs (I'm not too sure). Really cool game for the DS. You'll definately get your money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good game","review":"I have had nintendogs dachshund and friends since christmas and I still play it. Though the game has lost the excitment that it had when I first played it. If you love dogs and are over 7 then it is most likely that you will like nintendogs. The game has fairly good graphics and there are a number of things to do. Though you will probably get fairly bored of it in 1-2 weeks. In nintendogs as you probably already know you can get up to 8 puppys. They rely on you for walks, feeding and watering, brushing, bathing,and lots of love. In return you get a puppy(s) to look at you with love in it's eyes and hours and hours of fun and entertainment. There are contests that you can enter, but they only last about 60 seconds and you can only enter 3 per puppy. These contests are agility, obedience and frisbee. Overall I think that nintendogs is a pretty good game and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Nintendo DS Game for Kids","review":"This is so far the best Nintendo DS that I've seen and bought for my daughters, 9 years old and 11 years old. They have marvelous time playing it cause it's easy and challenging too. At the beginning, it's quite tricky to use the voice recognition to train the dog to follow your order. But with a little practise, without the help of parents, children will easily learn their way.Now they are collecting money that they win from the competition and busy buying many things for the dogs from the money that they earned. You could adopt more dogs when your dog is well trained already. One downside though: it is very addictive that you'll have difficulty telling your child to stop playing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STOP READIN AND BUY IT ALREADY!!!","review":"NAME:ADRIEL RAHMANAGE 12NINTENDOGS IS 1 OF THE BEST DS GAMES YET.THE DOGS HAVE DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES.

By the way, you can have up to three dogs at your house and 5 at the dog hotel! This game lasts a very long time and I am still playing it.

I would just like to say how much i love nintendogs. It is such a great idea. I think that it interested tons of young people and older people as well. My uncle has one and he loves it. Thats the first thing my bro wanted for his birthday and soon I am gonna get one. I love it so much. I play my bros all the time. I think it is great for the parents as well becuz it keeps children busy but in a fun way. Some people cant have dogs and if your reading this and you cant have dogs then you should ask your parents this minute if you can have one. Make sure to tell them that it is fun and keeps you busy. That i think will make your parents go out and by you one right away.(maybe not) But anyway, nintendogs is great for anyone.

Would rate in my Top 10 albums of all time. Burton C. Bell is in my opinion the best Hard Rock/ Metal vocalist at the moment. His ability to go from scream to sing is unbelievable and he complements the pulsating guitars and drums which make Fear Factory unique. There are still a few fillers (Body Hammer, Flashpoint)but the rest of the album is unbelievable. Demanufacture, Zero Signal, Replica, New Breed, Self Bias Resistor and PissChrist are all incredible songs. A great album. Must have"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE WAY HEAVY METAL IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE!","review":"THIS IS YET ANOTHER BAND THAT I HEARD OF THROUGH THE MORTAL KOMBAT SOUNDTRACK. THIS IS STILL FEAR FACTORY'S BEST CD. ALL OF THE SONGS, FROM THE WICKED ''H-K [HUNTER KILLER]'' TO THE INTENSE ''RESISTENCIA!' ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF WHAT REAL HEAVY METAL IS. EVERY METALHEAD SHOULD OWN THIS CD BY NOW. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS CD BY NOW, SHAME ON YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, and i forgot...","review":"If you like this, be SURE to check out Meshuggah, particularly the album Destroy Erase, Improve. Same sort of style with better vocals, tricky polyrhythms (which make it more interesting) and a better guitar sound. Those guys have the Machine-sound down pat.

But that won't happen, right? :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Er...um....more like Suck Factory!","review":"Bland, trite, growled vocals, repetitive, unmelodic chugging guitars...the worst kind of 90's alt-metal.

Definatly a must have for all metal fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic That Everybody Should Own","review":"Fear Factory is one of the best industrial/aggro/metal bands out there. This CD proves it. I cannot stop listening to \\"Replica\\", the best track on this CD. When I downloaded that song, this introduced me to Fear Factory and how great of a band they are. These guys know how to make the most brutal industrial metal out there. You will not regret buying this. Other great tracks are \\"Zero Signal\\" and \\"New Breed\\". Fear Factory kicks ass and you know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really impressed me.","review":"To be completely honest, i don't like this \\"electronic-metal\\" fusion that some bands like Rammstein do. But i have to tell you, this album is greaaaaaat! go buy it and give it a try, you won't be disssapointed at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album for getting your blood pumping","review":"Demanufacture is an album which always leaves me with an excited, angry feeling after listening to it. The percussion work is top-notch and the guitar work is fast and furious. The use of keyboards/synthsizers and sequencers are really a great feature because they add some atmosphere to it all. Bell is probably the best singer for what he does. He can bellow and growl and switch back and forth between the two with ease. The strongest tracks on here are Demanufacture, Zero Signal, Replica, Pisschrist (definitely a great song), and A Therapy For Pain. A Therapy For Pain is quite a drastic, and wonderful, change in the mood. It's a droning mood piece, clocks in at nearly ten minutes, though only six of it is actual music. The extra tracks on here aren't really the best part of the album, but they sure don't hurt. The remixes are no big deal either. Overall this cd is worth it. Any metal or death metal fan won't be disappointed in this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electro Death?????-----who cares......its FEAR FACTORY!!!!","review":"Max Cavalera once quoted that this band was the future of death metal. Now....I do not see any great death metal shades here....but the music is aggressive and is very intriguing. This was my first Fear Factory record and I am proud to have it in my collection. Burton C. Bell is an incredible vocalist who has a lot of intensity and soul in his larynx....and Zero Signal, Therapy for Pain are ample proof of his vocal capabilities. Self-Bias Resistor, Replica, H-K, are smashing and oppressively heavy songs....one listen and u will feel ur brain dribbling out of your ears. This is one helluva record....a must buy for every rivethead on planet earth. Fear Factory are demanufacturing metal, in a truly unique way."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Demanufacture did not exist, someone would invent it","review":"The King's of Cybermetal, Fear Factory, came out with this fine opus of pure cybermetal. Burton C. Bell intelligently left his death metal growl behind and properly showed us what a fine voice he carries. With songs like Replica, Pisschrist, and the title track, Fear Factory has already cornered the cybermetal genre. Where the band truly outdoes itself is in the monster track Zero Signal. With this song, Fear Factory sowed the seeds of this brand of music forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really cool metal CD","review":"Before hearing Fear Factory, I thought that they would be pretty bad, but when I heard song two on Demanufacture, I really liked the band. The CD is even better when the bass is cranked up. I recommend it if you like Static-X, although I like Static-X better"},{"rating":"2","title":"The FEaR FactORY CD to have!","review":"Well to start off this cd is badass! If you like Death Metal, Industrial Metal, and Harcore Metal you'll love this CD! With songs like Demanufacture, Zero Signal, and Replica it's headbangers bliss. The band is also very orignal with Dino (the gutairst) doing those machine gun riffs (best example of that would be in the beginning of PISSCHRIST) and Burton (the vocalist) when he changes his voice from that real deep voice (something like the guy in Cannibal Corpse) to that softer more melody like voice is sweet and kind of odd. And Raymond (the drummer) at how he uses those foot pedals to make the drums keep up with Dino. To put all this simple BUY THIS NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Industrial Gothic Techno Death Metal-Brilliant","review":"I really enjoy this CD. It is very brutal, but FF inject quite a lot of melody into their songs (I.E. chorus of Self Bias Resistor) This is arguably their best CD to date. Highlights include Self Bias Resistor, New Breed, Pisschrist. A very nice CD, these guys have a lot of talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE NEW BREED","review":"This album starts off with some killer tracks, DEMANUFACTURE and SELF BIAS RESISTOR. Those 2 songs alone are reason enough to buy this CD. FEAR FACTORY is full speed ahead music in your face that just hits you and knocks you off. BURTON C BELL has the voice that not only can sing melodies, but he also has the thrash screaming voice that metalheads love. The guitars are straight in you face with some fast killer riffs. YOUR MISTAKE, ZERO SIGNAL, DOG DAY SUNRISE, NEW BREED are just a few of the killer trakcs that make up this album. I would recommend this album or DIGIMORTAL for listeners just getting interested in FEAR FACTORY. Also dont forget to give FLASHPOINT, H-K(HUNTER KILLER), and PISSCHRIST a listen. If you can find the digipak with the bonus tracks, I recommend that u buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of their best songs","review":"If you are a fan of fear factory this album is a must have, some of their best songs. The album starts of really really strong, but starts to fade out about half way through. Those songs on the first half make it a must have though. Also check out \\"Remanufacture\\" which has really good remixes of the songs from this album. Zero signal one of the best songs on the album was on the Mortal Combat soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Second Go Around With These Disposable Underwear","review":"This is a good product.

At best it will help you avoid errors that turn off producers, at worst it will have little to help an advanced writer.The only way to really 'make it' is to have contacts, write good stuff, and have a personality that ignores rejection, accepts criticism, and has a driving desire to get your work out there. This book will add to your ability. If you've never written a script the book is a good beginners lesson on how to do it. I've written about 15 scripts and there were a few tips that I could use. If one tip helps you get in the door, well, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read!","review":"This guy is funny. I burned through this book in short order. A little heavy on the inclusion of other writers work, but it does illustrate his points. That is the only reason I didn't give it five stars.He claims that the screenplays he faults are actual screenplays. It's not hard to imagine somebody who bought this book recognized their work. Not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent workbook","review":"So happy I purchased this before starting my screenplay so I didn't have to do endless edits.As a reader of many bad screenplays Mr. Flinn certainly knows the pitfalls that will keep a screenplay from even being finished. excellent workbook.Barbara Gilmer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I liked this book because it points out the things that Hollywood readers will see as showstoppers. Following their tips might get your screenplay past step number one and at least get it to the next step, being read. There's no guarantee that your screenplay will be read, but this will help get the format and general story so that it doesn't appear to be unprofessional."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute must read for aspiring screenwriters.","review":"This book is a MUST READ for those of you out there that want to write a screenplay. It is not a book on how to write a good movie, it's a book on how not to write a bad movie (big difference). There is not a single page about outlining or prewriting of any kind. There is no preaching about how any story with X plotline won't work so you should make a new story. He doesn't not talk about good or bad plots, JUST GOOD OR BAD SCRIPTS.This book motivates one to write efficiently. It successfully helped me weed out overwriting from my work. If you've read other screenwriting books before this is still a must read. He talks little about the art of screenwriting and relies almost exclusively on the science of it. It made me aware of flaws in my writing no proofreader or editor could spot and that is completely invaluable. Best eleven bucks and change I ever spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good team game","review":"I got this game as a Christmas present in 1990 or 1991. It still gets played occasionally. Here's how it works. Four clues are given to famous person, place, occupation, movie, etc. Your team has to bet on how many clues it will take for the other team to get it. Clues are worth 10, 7, 5 and 3 points, respectively. If you guess correctly which clue the other team gets it on, you move the same number of spaces that they do. There's also a \\"bet you can't\\" choice where if you correctly guess the other team will bomb out and not get it, your team moves ahead six spaces on the board. The first team whose piece crosses the finish line wins. Teams alternate guessing the answer and guessing how the other team will answer.Overall, a fun game with a diverse number of subjects, are there are some stumpers in there. I hope they come out with an \\"updated version\\" of this game someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I read and enjoyed \\"Ben Hogan's Secret.\\" I too read the first chapter on the website and decided to purchase the book.

I recommend adding this book to any golfer's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Double Bogie","review":"The first reviewer gets it right. This book is a double bogie, lacking both depth and scope.

There should be no debate as to who was the greatest golfer of all time. It is Ben Hogan, hands-down.

I ordered the book instantly. As a member of the growing golfing public in awe of Hogan's mystique, I have read and studied everything about the man and his swing I could get my hands on. This refreshing account reminds me that sheer will, refusal to fail, and love for the life God has given us can drive us to achieve incredible goals. Historical? Who really knows! As an inspiration though, Thomas's presentation ranks with Hogan's one-iron, at Merion, in the 1950 Open!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd","review":"This has to be one o the most absurd books I've ever read. The very term \\"fictionalized biography\\" is a literary abomination. Other than the name Ben Hogan and some basic events of his life this story has nothing to do with the complexity of the man. There is no evidence at all that the author's made up \\"secret\\" has anything to so with the real Ben Hogan. The author never met him, never interviewed him, yet he builds up a whole touchy-feely new-age persona for a man whose whole life screamed out the oppsite. This is the worst kind of revisionism and one suspects that the author's family and friends have written most of the reviews that appear herein, as it is hard to imagine how an unbiased reader would find anything of value in this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable!","review":"I can't believe the good reviews this book has gotten here on Amazon. In my opinion, this book is so far fetched it's laughable. It vaguely hits upon factual events in Hogan's life and it is written as if by (and for) an elementary school child. I know it is a fictionalized story, but it's based on a real person and therefore must remain somewhat grounded in reality. Unfortunately, it does not. This book is incredibly trite and simplistic and makes Ben Hogan appear as an insecure, confused little boy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Curse you, Red Baron!\\"","review":"This book features cartoons from late 1966 to early 1967.

My anticpation grew until finally Ugly was realeased. I bought Ugly the day it came out and sampled it with my friend who also loved River Runs Red. Dissapointment. Ugly just did not have any power.

I am not going to get into too much detail because I don't want to ruin it for other people, but I will say the trademark TPB humor is here and also the special gives a little history of the characters. What seems to throw off some people is that the special focuses more on values, family, and the true meaning of Christmas.

The bezel scratches easily ( I am hard on watches, the good news the crystal still looks good) 2. The automatic movement does not seem to be compatible with watch winders.

This book deepened my faith in my belief system and helped me to understand it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mild Disappointment","review":"I have found Grimassi to bo one of the more aggravating Pagan authors out there. He does have some interesting ideas and theories, but the rather questionable scholarship he uses to support those ideas subtracts from the book. The dogmatic tone (which sometimes borders on self-righteous) running throughout his narrative is grating in the extreme. I wish the book would have concentrated on exploring the inner workings of the Wiccan mythos instead of desparately trying to prove the antiquity of these teachings."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books available on the Craft","review":"This book is important, because it grounds modern paganism in a tradition that goes back to the earliest humans. Grimassi makes it clear to anyone who actually reads the sections on history that this tradtition changed and grew, but its core values such as reverance for Nature remained. His sources includethe scholarly segment of the Goddess history movement, and the view of the older, matrifocal societies is balanced, rather than romanticized. History, however, is not the main focus of the book. The real intent of the book is to expose the roots of the Wiccan faith, whether one beleives it to be a genuine survival or a reconstuction. Grimassi touches on everything from the Watchers to chakras (universally percieved energy centers NOT uniqueley Eastern)as well as examining the sacred texts of the Craft in detail. I enjoyed this book and reccomend it to anyone interested in the deeper aspects of the Craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but it repeated its self","review":"I liked The wiccan Mysteries but in some parts the book seemed to repeat its self. Other wise the book was great with lots of good information"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I've found yet~","review":"This is the most informative and enlightening book I've yet read on Wicca. It is based on carefully traced history and proven beliefs of past civilizations/cultures. Grimassi gives a general overview on many metaphysical topics - the reader learns a lot, but is left somewhat unsatisfied. It's as if you're teased with knowledge as he dives into a topic, then quickly pulls out of it. Also, he sounds dictatorial in many places throughout the book and \\"dogmatic Wiccan\\" is supposed to be an oxymoron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scholary Yet Readable! Buy With Confidence.","review":"Raven Grimassi would be the first to say that Wicca has no established sacred writings. Yet she makes a bold contribution to the field with this fascinating view of the history of the Craft from pre-history through the modern era. Nonjudgmental (or not much), and thoroughly researched, this book is a history of the \\"olde religion,\\" its myths and archetypes, its myriad beliefs and practices, written with style and verve. This book is a history, a reference, and guide to the path of the Wiccan. Although the illustrations are a bit crude, they do not detract from Grimassi's witty prose and knowledgeable style. A must have for every student of the Craft and its history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched, poorly presented.","review":"I was hoping for a book with some depth that explored some of the roots of my practice in Wicca. What I got was a poorly researched piece of trash. I wept as I thought of how many poor new pagans read this book and took his information as fact. I think I was laughing in that mocking way loud enough for the whole block to hear when I read him refer to the Charge of the Goddess as an \\"Celtic Wiccan Mystery Text.\\" (Has he never heard of Doreen Valiente? Or Aradia? Certainly in all of his research into Strega, he must have come across Aradia.) Speaking of Doreen Valiente, I was appalled when he attributed her work, labeled in his book as the \\"Witches' Chant,\\" to Lady Sheba, \\"Witch Queen of the USA\\" and well-known plagiarist.I didn't throw this book in the trash for one reason - I'm keeping it so I can teach my seekers why they should not believe everything that is in print, and how to detect BS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another pseudo-pagan potboiler","review":"Words cannot describe the level of dissappointment I felt after reading this book. As a practicing pagan, I expected an in-depth and concise examination of Wicca and it's origins in pagan practices but instead received a unapologetic piece of revisionist tripe. Though Grimassi treats a variety of Wiccan and Pagan related subjects, his analysis is often topical, consisting of little more than a page (often times, less)of discussion on various subjects such as priests and priestesses or altar tools (sujects that require more than a few paragraphs worth of reflection), and often times he does not bother to cite sources to back his statements. When he does cite a source, it is more often than not of questionable validity. If your looking for a mystical piece of Wiccan fluff, this may be the book for you, but for the serious pagan scholar, I would suggest searching elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same drivel in a new shiny package","review":"I agree with a number of previous reviewers. Grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between \\"wicca\\" and \\"witchcraft\\". Wicca is not an old religion, indeed it is not much of a religion at all. It has always lacked definite theology (what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you'll get four answers...) and Grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non-scholarly lights. In fact, the book is poor on all accounts. From confused terminology to \\"chopping\\" of source materials. This is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent","review":"I bought Chaos A.D. and loved it. Loved the whole album and every song in it. Thats what I think makes a great CD is the quality of each songs regardless of lyrics. After listening through the album over about four times it isn't too bad.

Since I like to buy my records in chronological order, I was expecting something like \\"Arise\\", \\"Chaos A.D.\\", or \\"Beneath The Remains.\\" This album is way to Nu-Metal influenced, and is pretty repetitive. There are some good tracks, such as Attitude, but there are many weak tracks that are either, too repetitive, boring, or just plain [bad]. If you want a good Sepultura album, get one of these: Morbid Visions/Bestial Devestation, Schizophrenia, Beneath The Remains, Arise, or Chaos A.D.

The CD flows wonderfully, opening with the energetic and pounding Roots Bloody Roots, then into more heavy songs. Then just as you get pumped up from all that kicka** metal, the tribesmen come in and play bongos and other tribal drums for 5 or 6 minutes, it's great! You can just sit back, relax, and enjoy the mellow beats. Then just as your about to enter a state of complete relaxation, the crunchy guitars and jackhammering double bass blast in and all hell breaks loose all over again! It's a wonderful listening experience, and nobody, metal fan or not, is better from not hearing it! BUY IT!

The album \\"Beneath the Remains\\" has a good aggressive thrash sound to it, if you are going to dislike the band you might as well hear their best album first.Now to take care of the people that like this album. I implore you to track your way backward through their albums instead of listening to this and graduating to Soulfly to follow Max. The previous album \\"Chaos A.D.\\" should be enjoyable if you liked this, and may serve as an even better transition to their early thrash metal albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sellout","review":"This is a sellout.

All the songs are almost the same , the voice totally changed and you can bearly tell what the guitars are playing .

How much of the assumptions about how Dorothy Putnam felt or how she really reacted in her status as a publisher's wife can a reader believe? Surely, there is a story in Amelia Earhart's life for all time, but this book seems to be a sort of self-promotion for the author's distant family connections -- the (yet-unborn) great granddaughter of the (already deceased) Amelia Earhart. If the book were written based on Dorothy Putnam's own version of the story or Amelia's version, it might be more believable. Still, it is always interesting material to delve into anyone's personal diary -- famous or not...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable and Inspiring","review":"I love love love this workbook!

I was not disappointed--nor was he.He and I spent hours testing one another (yes, there were some questions that made me wonder if I really WAS smarter than a 5th grader!), and enjoyed every minute of it.There are a variety of topics, including Math, English and Social Studies, and there are varying levels of difficulty. This is very helpful because, as your child develops mastery over a specific level on a topic, he can advance to the next level with a push of a button. The included cartridge adds an extra element that pushes kids a bit further on their quest to 'test' their brain.Very durable, easy to carry along on family trips, and fun to play, I would recommend to any adult wanting to help his/her young student feel more secure in the classroom, simply by playing a game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"puro guero o puro muerto","review":"Worship Satan and buy this album, you're on the right way to the millennium.....

Over the years I have kept a small library in my home and under my bed to read at night, prior to retiring. The book by Mr. Buchanan is a detailed, accurate account of this man and his relationships to the men around him and his world. Being a product of the Mississippi Delta, I can see Holt Collier in the deep bayou's of the old Delta, hunting the bears. I admire the writer's style in his ability to place me there beside Holt all along the way in this book. There, in the realities of Holt's world, the reader walks his paths, thinks his thoughts, and feels the anger he feels.Finally I would like to thank Mr. Buchanan for this effort and look forward to seeing more of his work in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The rooibos is fine but the Early Grey flavoring is far too sweet and heavy handed.

Just gets better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knocked Up","review":"\`Knocked Up' is a pretty decent comedy following a couple as they get to know one another when Alison (played by Heigl) becomes pregnant after a one night stand with Ben (Rogan).Alison is a pretty career girl and Ben is a slovenly, unemployed man with a severe case of arrested development. This mix throws up some sparks and plenty of hilarity.There are crass jokes a-plenty here, but nothing so outrageous that it is distasteful and the relationship between Ben and Alison is genuinely touching despite all it's flaws.The supporting cast are great as well with Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill adding extra humour to an already funny film. Judd Apatow has made a funny film that doesn't take itself too seriously and whilst it isn't the best film I've ever seen, it is good enough entertainment for a couple of hours. Worth a viewing if you've enjoyed other films of this director or with these actors.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining at best","review":"I don't honestly get the appeal of this movie. I'd heard a lot of good buzz about it while it was in the theaters, but in truth, I watched about 20 minutes of it and gave up throwing good minutes-of-my-life after bad.Part of it is that Katherine Heigl's recent interviews on this movie and on Grey's Anatomy have left me with little respect for her, making it kind of hard to listen to her shrillness.The general plot of the movie isn't believable (since when does a successful woman decide to date the high school drop out, even if she does get pregnant by him?) and believability is forgivable if the comedic potential is realized, but here it is not, which simply leaves me feeling like it's trying to be absurd but somehow failing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Crude","review":"Maybe I'm just old - and I certainly don't consider myself a prude - but I cannot believe the vulgarity in the dialogue in this movie, especially in mixed company. All us guys talk \\"locker room\\" when by ourselves...but crude references to oral (and other kinds) of sex in front of women? If this is really the way younger people talk nowadays, our society is headed for extinction. I watched this movie strictly because of Katherine Heigl whom I think is adorable and whose looks remind me of the pretty girls from the 50's and 60's. It was disappointing to hear her use such vulgarity. I know she's a professional actress and it's her job to read the script. Hopefully she will get much better films than this to work in as she's very appealing on screen and a decent actress. The story itself is good, but hardly believeable. Nowadays, few women that attractive would hook up with such a geeky-looking guy like that for one night, much less fall in love with him and bear his child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be A Sucker...

I also thought that a lot of the scenes with the lead guy (curly hair fat schlub from 40 Year Old Virgin) and his roomates to be really 'unfunny'.

They date star atheletes, musicians and wealthy businessmen.2. the comedy- a few chuckles here and there but not a ton of laughs. Simply being crude is not funny- there needs to be some humor attatched to the crudeness.So it scores poorly in both areas.

Maybe this is a \\"guy film,\\" but I seriously don't think that being endowed with male anatomy would have made me enjoy it any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"stunk","review":"I watched about 15 minutes of it and had to turn it off, it was so bad, and so boring.

Even no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Perhaps I'm too old for movies like this. Perhaps I should have known better - I gave up on 40 year virgin after 15 minutes. But the reviews were good so I watched it. The movie (to me) was utterly boring. I found little to laugh at, but perhaps the jokes belonged to a different culture. The characters were amiably pleasant but a bad situation was made worse by the continuous stream of bad language. Is this how young people talk nowadays - I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knocked Up, aka Why Stupid People Should Never Procreate","review":"This movie is an insult to women everywhere! Not that I expected an epic tale of chick lit from the director of The 40 Year Old Virgin, but come on... it's so crude and unintelligent, how can anyone have enough respect for these characters to want to sit through to the end? I sure as hell didn't. Absolutely horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly better than superbad ???","review":"Again, Jonah Hill seems to be the common thread in a recent string of nonsensical movies.

It wasn't. It was actually pretty painful. It was funny in spots, but it was slow to start. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too serious","review":"Why does every comedy have to \\"teach me a lesson?\\" It's really annoying. That's why The 40 Year Old Virgin was great. Sure, it had a few serious moments, but overall it was just a silly comedy. After a promising start, Knocked Up devolves into a preachy mess, which is ridiculous given its completely unbelievable premise. Come on - a hot chick goes home with some tool who gets her pregnant. Either A - she'd get an abortion, or B - even if she had the kid, she certainly wouldn't feel obliged to try and fall in love with the guy and make him the daddy. What is this - 1950? I don't want my comedies to ever get serious - with a plot like this, it makes it even worse. They should have stuck to making fun of the guy with the beard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who doesn't love this movie?","review":"I can't believe anyone would say this movie is anything but hilarious. I could watch it over and over again. If you liked 40 Year-Old Virgin, you'll laugh just as hard at this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie misses out.","review":"I watched this movie for the first time on DVD. I was apalled by the language - when will writers learn that real people DO NOT talk that way 24/7. None of the movie's contrived situations made sense. It was gratuitous from the opening credits.This is not a story line that is untold. There have been many before it, which were told much better. It's a shame, really, because this concept did seem to be a fresh, modern take on an age-old problem. I was eager to see its variation.And then I watched it. I was ready to stop the DVD and hurl the disk into the nearest landfill after 30 minutes, but stayed through until the end. I had heard the movie was a hit in theaters. I still don't know why. It never misses an opportunity to be vulgar.It is said that the right amount of spice enhances a dish and too much spoils it. This dish is uneatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a Minus Rating - One Star is There Because Amazon Made Me Do It","review":"This movie is not funny, not artful. It is a vulgar, disgusting movie about sex and the sex act, not about relationships. What a waste of my life's time watching it. I don't see why any actor would have wanted to play any of the parts. I see no redeeming value to this movie, not even simple entertainment. Frankly, I can't think of any other movie I have seen that has been in the theatres that I feel so strongly negative about. Sure, I don't like some movies as much as others, but this one isn't in that ballpark. It belongs in the sewer. My husband says this is a movie for pigs. If this is what our country's culture embraces, then we surely are seeing the end of a wonderful country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar","review":"Watching this film made me think of how I feel when I see things like the Jerry Springer show, or My Sweet 16 Birthday Party on MTV, or the like. This is the image of the USA going out to the world. This is how we are seen. Sad.Not only was the movie rude, crude, and vulgar, it was also unbelievable. This gorgeous, upward-mobile woman has sex with an unemployed, unattractive, foul-mouthed lug, but then proceeds to fall in love with him? Even after he is horribly mean to her?? Absurd.A few funny moments, I will admit. Just a few.Otherwise, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"I truly hated this film, and I am a big Paul Rudd, and Seth Rogan fan. The part with Paul's nose in the strippers rear end was the final straw in this truly abysmal, lousy, depressing movie. If a man wants to watch something that makes parenting look like prison, then go it. If a woman wants to hate men, same deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated - not funny","review":"Finally watched this after all the hype. It was not funny and only marginally interesting. The 2nd half was a little better than the first. The fact that Alison, who is hot, successful and interesting would even acknowledge a boring slob like Ben made the whole framework of the film fall apart. Add to the fact that Ben was not the least bit funny made it worse. Usually in these cookie-cutter films, the sidekicks steal the show. Not in this case. What a bad combo, a boring/bad fit leading man whose buddies were NOT even 1% funny! Ugh! What a waste of time.To put things in perspective - I thought 40 Year Old Virgins and Wedding Crashers were hysterical!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Execrable Moviemaking","review":"I don't normally review movies unless I really like or dislike them. I can't remember a similar disconnect between the critics' favorable reviews and the utter banality and wretchedness of the movie. Inane humor, disgusting characters, gratuitous F-bombs, preposterous plotting, you name it.The only reason I sat through it (while picking up a book) was because my wife can't begin a movie without finishing it. In the end, she thought it was almost as infantile as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"What next, Eva Longoria and Carrot Top?","review":"Synopsis: An irritating slacker, with no job or money, goes to a club he would never be let into. Once inside, he meets a woman beautiful enough to be an anchor on a Hollywood TV show. This woman, who probably avoids anything stronger than water, gets so drunk that she has sex with this son of Harold Ramis.She gets pregnant, he spews some of the most hurtful, foul things one person can say to another and she responds in kind. Finally, after a series of these unpleasant exchanges, she decides he's kinda cute and, of all her options, he's the guy for her. And of course, there are the usual stereotypes of people, saying things real people never say. Its a side splitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"I don't understand how this film gets recommendations. It is not funny, clever, witty, well written, or remotely entertaining. I had read some stellar reviews of this movie and was disappointed not just because it wasn't very good, but because it goes to the level of inane. Good comedies are tough to write, but I know some sixteen year old boys who could have done a better job than the one who must have put this one together."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG LET DOWN","review":"NOT MUCH 2 SAY THE BEST PARTS OF THE ENTIRE FILM ARE THE BEARDED GUY AND HIS GIRLFRIEND THERE ACTING IS BETTER THEN THE ENTIRE MOVIE DONT BUY IT RENT IT FOR A BUCK AT YOUR NEAREST RED BOX OUTSIDE MCDONALDS ALTHOUGHT YOUL BE DISAPOINTED THAT U SPENT THAT MUCH MONY ON GAS ON SUCH A WAST OF TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen","review":"I couldn't believe how puerile and bad this movie was, I just couldn't make it to the end.

Apathy is tacky. Humor that makes fun of the most vulnerable in society should be unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knocked Down and Dragged Out","review":"Knocked Up is billed as a light romantic comedy. However, it is neither romantic, nor funny. This movie is unrealistic, juvenile, and dreadful beyond words.There is absolutely no chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen, or their characters, Alison and Ben. The entire premise is completely unbelievable. There is absolutely nothing in this marginal plot to indicate that Alison has any attraction to Ben, or why she ends up sleeping with him. Throughout the movie, the two were completely unbelievable as a couple.The \\"comedy,\\" if it can be called that, is infantile, crude, and at about the middle school level. Maybe boys of that age might find it funny, if the subject matter and the language were not so completely inappropriate. Middle school girls, and ANYONE over the age of about 17, would just find it disgusting.I absolutely cannot recommend this film to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG WIDE LOAD","review":"What a crappy rude vulgar in the worst way movie, i liked 40 year old virgin but this thing is plane stupid and over long Seth Rogen what a putz of an actorHow does some one get money to make this junk?

I highly recommend this movie for an evenings entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, not funny, and gross","review":"Perhaps this movie is funny if you've been in this situation, had kids and can empathize with the situation these characters are in? I found it nothing but depressing and not at all funny. The unrated version shows actually shows a head crowning, and I have to admit I was not ready for nor expecting that. I found nothing entertaining about this movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this crap what all the hype was about???","review":"I'll be honest, I haven't watched this movie. But I swear I tried. I managed about 30 minutes, waiting for something either funny or exciting. Nothing at all.The movie's title made me fear the worst initially, but with all the rave reviews, I had to give this film the benefit of the doubt. Surely, 90% of critics cannot be out of their mind. Well guess what, indeed they can...This is a sad load of rubbish about rubbish people (yes, that includes blondie). Its only redeeming feature was that I only allowed it to waste 30 minutes of my life, rather than the intended 90 or whatever.There's this uninspiring joke of a guy who gets to sleep with a just as uninspiring promotion-happy Hollywood Barbie girl or something. She becomes pregnant, and I have no idea what happens after that but couldn't care to watch. Boring boring, annoyingly boring. 2 out of 10 just cos I only wasted half an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BAD BAD THING","review":"THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG,LONG TIME. THE PREMISE IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY WERE BOTH REALLY DRUNK AND HAD SEX. IT IS CLEAR THEY COULD NOT GET THE BARTENDER TO WAIT ON THEM. THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THEY HAD MORE THAN ONE DRINK.THERE ARE A LOT OF DISGUSTING UGLY DUMB GUYS INCLUDING THE \\"STAR.\\" IT IS HARD TO MAKE A ROMANTIC COMEDY WITH KATHERINE HEIGL, BUT THEY HAVE MANAGED. THIS MOVIE IS A BAD, BAD THING. WHAT WERE THE OTHER REVIEWERS THINKING OF?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very funny - Not very good","review":"I've enjoyed previous films by the actors/director but this was awful. Not very funny at all and extremely hard to believe. Paul Rudd and Kristen Wiig were the only two bright spots in this awful film. My husband and I talked about turning it off serveral times but kept giving it a chance to get better. The only good parts: Kristen Wiig's limited appearances and Paul Rudd in the vegas hotel room. But that didn't make it worth watching. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"So glad I did not go to the theater to watch it","review":"I could not watch the entire movie...that is how bad I think the movie is.I read the other movies and rented it because of those reviews. Sorry but I did not think the first half of the movie was funny at all and I can not comment on the second half cause I deleted it. I think the movie is a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Apart from about two jokes in this film, I wish I could get back that 2 hours of my life.

Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring, not funny!","review":"I watched half of this movie at a friend's house the other night and we couldn't even finish it.

NOT FUNNY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time","review":"I'm white and i was offended as to how white this movie is. the dialogue was terrible and had gratuitous language. Terrible writers.

I was real excited to watch it-Love Katherine- but I was very unimpressed with just about everything in this movie. Very unbelievable that someone who is as successful and beautiful as Katherine's character would ever have a one-night stand with the doped up, dirty mouthed male lead character. Then, to top it off, once she finds out she is pregnant, actually hunts him down and forces him to part of her world and adapts pretty well to his. Not funny. Not fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross, void, depressing and repulsive.","review":"This movie (the characters and the dialogue) is just void of any type of class at all. I turned it off halfway through. A total waste of time. The lead male has absolutely no charisma or screen presence at all. Depressing,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragedy of our Time....","review":"This movie was funny when it made a joke. Unfortunately, it made two throughout the two and a half hours during which I suffered. The only two jokes that they planned to make they showed in the trailers so there was really no reason for me to see the movie. The sister was horribly annoying and I wanted to shoot her, and most of this movie was so horribly random, like the Cirque du Soleil sequence....both of the only quasi-stable relationships in this movie got together because they got pregnant. The fact that there are still accidental pregnancies in this country is a tragedy. Don't buy this movie. Judd Apatow should be shot and stick to producing movies that Will Ferrell star in and help write. If it wasn't for the genius of Paul Rudd, I would have walked out of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up ! ! !","review":"Great comedy for adults. All of our worst nightmare a one night stand ending in pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great extras!","review":"What's best about this DVD is that Director Judd Apatow believes that the extra, behind-the-scenes commentary and footage are really important components; they help the viewer appreciate the film more fully. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny Movie","review":"I thought this movie would be a sleeper...but I was wrong. I found myself laughing out loud.Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply brutal","review":"The dialogue alone is so unrealistic (seriously, who swears that much ALL THE TIME!?) and unfunny, I gave up. Yes, a doofus can score with a cute babe but when I heard these people speak I just thought the scriptwriter has no clue at all. It's one thing to throw stuff in to parody couples arguing but another to just have people go off on rants.Too bad this was not a horror movie as we could have killed off the annoying Seth Rogen in scene one. Then we might have a decent movie or at least have gotten Doughboy off the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just ok.","review":"I think this movie could have been so much better. Some of the characters were much more interesting than the two main characters and it tended to drag on. If you don't have much going on and want something to watch while you are doing something else this movie is fine. You won't miss anything by having your focus elsewhere. But if you are looking for something to sit down and really watch, keep looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and True","review":"Lots of laughs, good acting and several \\"oh, so true\\" scenes on differences between female / male quest for the good life!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude and Disappointing","review":"If you like stupid, inane, and bad language, you will love this movie.

Yes the antucs are too vulgur and sickening. Just stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a few things to like","review":"There are only a few things to like in this movie. First, two charming co-stars, unfortunately saddled with an empty script. Second, the movie depicts an unmarried couple who decide not to abort the baby they unintentionally conceive. That is a huge positive. Third, the reconciliation of a difficult relationship between these two people from vastly different backgrounds. A very good movie could have been built around these three positives. But, alas, the downside in this movie is that there is very little interesting or funny for anyone 17 years or over, as most of the dialogue is filled with gutter language and most of the \\"jokes\\" are scatological or drug-centered. If you are less than 17, you might like this movie, but you will have to attend in the company of an adult -- and that adult will not find much that is interesting or funny. Is this what entertainment has sunk to?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?","review":"Oh my. Those were the only two words I could think of to say about this garbage after I saw it. I was thinking it would be a light romantic comedy, but no. It was more of the Seth Rogan type overplayed and tired humor. I swear I don't know how he or \\"McLovin\\" became so cool, but it is just wrong. It had 100 too many f-words, some parts were downright disgusting and made me want to puke, and the story line was far fetched to say the least.The only reason I watched it through to the end was to see if it got better, but no it didn't. It is really a shame Katherine Heigl was in this movie because I think she lost some brain cells while filming it. I just can't recommend this movie to anyone who has ever been a part of a partially intelligent conversation, had any proper schooling, has any respect for women, or anyone who doesn't sit at home all day/everday on the couch eating chips and drinking beer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comedy ......and with a touch of reality","review":"I love this movie.

Not the exactly the same way..but you catch my drift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as 40-Year Old Virgin!","review":"I saw the \\"40 Year Old Virgin\\" and the first thing I thought of was, what a concept: a comedy film that is marketable to both men and women! If you are a man, usually you prefer the Three Stooges-type humor of banging other people over the head and if you're a woman, you like a good old romantic comedy. Both the \\"40 year Old Virgin and \\"Knocked Up\\" (same director on both films if you didn't already know)mix both successfully. The stoner/slacker friends of Ben are hilariously real (is this what guys really do when we're not around? Yep!) and Alison and her sister play the long-suffering women that put up with the men's crudeness because, well, because we all do to some degree! It's realistic, outrageous, crude, rude, totally un-politically correct and a riot!Bring your friends or a date-either way, you're bound to have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long","review":"I bought this movie because I heard from a lot of people that it was hillarious. About two hours into it, yes two hours, I was like \\"is this still going\\" and \\"Is this over yet\\". The movie wasn't very funny and was a waste of over two hours of my life and twenty bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"My wife wanted to see it, but hated it.","review":"Normally, my wife likes light silly romantic comedies. So, she thoughtthis would be the ticket. She hated it. (I only watched it to eat somepopcorn and because I remembered it having generally positivereviews.)Anyway, my wife thought it was \\"infantile\\" with too much obscenity, andwhen it was over she thought....so what? No interesting dramatic twists,no surprises, She also thought the prosthetic fake belly was obviouslyfake.I would agree with my wife on this one. A waste of time. Not very funny.One other thing. I checked out the special features. Some of them are,well, interesting. One of them makes the director look like something ofan obnoxious jerk. I wonder how they got included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halirious","review":"I went into this movie expecting another funny but also to leave disapointed, simply because thats usually how it works for comedies anymore. The just have a few funny scene's to crack a smile and thats pretty much it. This one however left me not only laughing but left me doing something I have not done in many many many years, and that is laughing out loud in a movie theater. Once this happened not once, not twice, but about the third time I was satisfied. I then thought to myself well it has been good so far but before long it will fall flat. Again much to my suprise, i was wrong again! This is a very very good movie, a very good comedy also. I would recomend this movie to anybody wanting a good laugh. I really dont think you will leave in disapointment.Dont listen to the critics.

Cross-cultural British vocabulary evokes a few queries as does his start in darkest Peru to a home in London, England -- which is good for more than a few trips to the map on the wall.

I'm not even sure we can claim it makes more than a single sound, which is one identical to a police car's siren.Giving it two stars if only because we still play with it every once in a while, and it remains part of our young toddler's music instrument collection (along with the above-mentioned drum, a glockenspiel, a guiro, etc.), but probably just for novelty's sake.

I don't think a pretty sound is the point, I think it's just supposed to be fun for a child to make noise in the first place. My daughter enjoys chewing on this and rolling it around. I'm happy we have it.The placement of the hole could be better, but I don't think anyone would put their hand flat against the ends, you more cup the ends, thus allowing air in and out of the hole."},{"rating":"2","title":"you must get this cd","review":"I'm gonna get right to the point. This is one of the best cd's out there. Any metal head absolutely needs this. Coal chamber were probably the ones to (lame analogy time) leave the biggest ripples in the goth metal pond (told you so). Dez fafera is amazing, ranging from a creepy mutter to an angry scream. The band has tight music, and deep lyrics. The one thing keeping this from getting 5 stars is that sometimes (on very rare instances) the lyrics don't seem suitable to the heaviness balance of the song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy, but...","review":"Horrible lyrics. In my opinion, the worst I've ever seen. metal is all about thought-provoking lyrics, and this has none. Buy \\"Dark Days\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good CD.","review":"This is an excellent CD, but Chamber Music is better. Its still good though. This band has an awesome sound. Too bad they can't capture it in their live performance. The bass seems to go nicely with the Heavily (and I mean Heavy) distorted guitar. And the drumming adds a little twist to the sound. Dez has a great voice. Most singers scream, he growls and sings. My favorite tracks are I, Loco,Sway, Big Truck, and Oddity."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S A GOOD C.D.","review":"I bought this, along with Chamber Music, a few weeks ago. Both are great & worth buying, but if it comes down to one, Chamber Music is better.The best song on this album is by far, \\"Bradley\\". It's one of the only songs on here that has good riffs. Really, the only other good songs on this are \\"Loco\\", \\"Big Tuck\\", \\"Sway\\", and \\"Oddity\\".So, if you like heavy music, and you want to try Coal Chamber, than I would recommend getting both of their albums, since they're so similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"COAL CHAMBER RULE","review":"They kick ass an all but they need to make another album to make them skyrocket more as they are doing now I like the cd i own I should like but anyway the kick ass I like LOCO BIG TRUCK BRADLEY WHICH IS DEZ\\"S REAL NAME FOR ALL THOSE BUMS OUT THERE WHO DONT KNOW THAT"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best things to happen to Rock","review":"Coal Chamber is one of the best things to happen to Rock.

Drop tunning or a female bassist. Really Coal Chamber has made a sound all their own. The so titled \\"Spooky Core\\" style is the freshest sound i've heard from metal in a long time, and if you ask me it couldn't have come at a better time. If you love metal, this is definetly worth checking out. If you love the album check out the live show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock on","review":"If you like korn, Napalm death, Sister machine Gun or pantera, this is the cd for everyone. I would pick this cd over anything. they are hard Raw and have there own style of words. But the best is they take alot after Korn. What a combination. To annoy the heck out of parents and other adults alike this is the cd for all the rebels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album that could of been dreamt of!","review":"Coal Chamber is a band that many people compare to the Deftones and Korn, but Coal Chamber can stand on their own two feet. With Dez Fafara's vocals like on \\"Loco\\" and \\"My Frustration,\\" there is no need for anyone to criticize them for stealing a sound. But it doesn't stop with the vocals, Coal Chamber also can play instrumemts. Coal Chamber's instrumental sound, created by Meegs, Rayna, and Mike Cox, could make Kiss trade in their high heels for a pair of slippers and a cane. Coal Chamber- a sound that will change rock forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is definitly worth it!!!!","review":"This is one of my favorite Cd's! All of the songs are interesting... I especially like the songs Loco, Oddity, Sway, and I. If you like Korn, you'll like Coal Chamber. This Cd is filled with awesome roaring vocals and fast-paced guitars. Each song is unique, making it fun to listen to. I am looking foward to their next Cd... I hope they come out with one soon! Oh, and this is great to listen to while playing 3-D shooters(like Quake2) on your computer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Debut CD","review":"Coal Chamber has been a favorite of mine for years, and, in my opinion, this is their best CD. The opener, \\"Loco\\", got me addicted to this band. Think of it as Korn on speed. \\"Sway\\", another title track, has the infamous \\"the roof is on fire...\\" opener to it and is a great track as well. \\"Big Truck\\" tends to take on Korn's direction with its mellow points at first, and then exploding right towards your face. \\"Oddity\\" takes sort of a hip-hop beat with it, while \\"Clock\\" explodes right into your face. Recommended for those who like alternative metal but want to dig deeper.If you like this, you will also like:\\"Korn\\" by Korn\\"Sevendust\\" by Sevendust"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dino was wrong...","review":"If Dino C. (from Fear Factory) hadn't forwarded their demo, this band never would have made it. It had to do with \\"being at the right place at the right time.\\"I will give some credit. The name of a death metal band, the appearance of goths (a 'la NIN,The Cure, Smashing Pumpkins, etc.) and music which sounds like a mixture of Ministry,Sepultura, and Prong. With such a selection of influences you think you'd be in for something special; Beg to differ:It's difficult to be taken seriously. The music is bland, repetitive, and the harshness is about as potent as an episode of Pee Wee's Playhouse. If you like repitition, this CD is for you. If you want to know what I mean, take one word from my review, and repeat it several times under a bunch of abrupt guitar riffs and sloppy drum work...The three bands that I mentioned earlier are a better way to spend money...this is not authentic metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I used to listen to this","review":"I recently popped in this CD after letting it collect dust on my CD shelf for 2 years and after listening to it, I wish I had left it sitting there to grow fungus. I can't believe that this is what I used to listen to! It's SO LAME! Dez's lyrics, well, they flat out stink! There is absolutely no thought or emotion put into these lyrics. All it is is him repeating the same phrase over and over again. Take \\"Loco\\" for example, all he does is scream \\"Me Loco!\\" over and over again. You could change the song title to \\"Hungry\\" and he would be screaming \\"Me Hungry!\\" over and over again. The riffs on here are such knock-offs from Korn's first album. Anyone who says they don't sound like Korn is just fooling themselves. This band is Korn without any passion or innovation... I don't quite know who these guys are fooling, but it ain't me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. The worst of the worst.","review":"Simply put, this is trash. Not a single redeeming quality to be found. This is heavy music for people who don't actually like heavy music, and this band doesn't deserve the success they're currently enjoying. Weak lyrically, weak musically - just ultra weak in general. I would give it zero stars if I could: avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring wannabes who need to learn a few more chords","review":"Coal Chamber do a 2nd rate Korn/White Zombie impersonation. Low-tuned groove music, complete with 2-note riffs and semi-rapped vocals. The grooves and riffs just aren't good enough. This album bores me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chamber rock","review":"Lets get this out first,the Chamber aren't Antichrist and if they were they can jump off a cliff but they aren't.If god boy wants to pick on satanic music,which I hate,there is always Slayer.It's funny how heavy music is evil all of the sudden huh?Anyways... Coal Chamber rock and should be left alone besides the line about God doesn't question God but is Dez questioning himself .Remember just 'cause you have tattoos and piercings and look goth doesn't mean they are antichrist it just means you're ignorant.Check into the matter first than say what you will if you must judge someone.BTW that 'Heavier than your Aunt Mary' bit is funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"::coughsuckcough::","review":"This cd is pretty crappy.

The vocalist sometimes howls agonisingly about a 'big truck', and sometimes creates a good song like 'Bradley'. The riffs on this album are too slow and not catchy enough. I think Coal Chamber are just trying to catch the attention of gothic fans who have got sick of Marilyn Manson. One song stands out from the rest and that is 'Sway'. I think that for people with no previous gothic music experience they should stay away from this album. Pretty average, with a few good songs and a few memeorable moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"No big deal","review":"This band needs to get a little more creative. The CD is okay, it has heavy riffs and vocals, but they sound too much like Korn. All the songs seem to run together because they're all built on the same guitar riff. And in the song \\"sway\\" he says: \\"The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire...\\" I swear I heard those same exact lyrics on a song by Bloodhound Gang. Just be careful and listen to it before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh...","review":"I have to agree with pretty much all of the songs sounded the same. I really didn't see much in it. But if ya like punk/rock bands (ie: KoRn), then this is for you.

The guitarist hasn't done anything innovative (unless you count playing the same riff over & over agian groundbreaking). The lyrics are stupid & without meaning. The only thing interesting about this band is the fact that 4 Manson-ites decided on covering \\"Blind\\" & \\"Bored\\" instead of \\"The Beautiful People\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive as Hiawatha!","review":"I wanted to like this album, just look how sweet Rayna is. As cute as the girl from White Zombie. The music was hard, angry, fast, Loco, \\"Don't F*** with me! Me Loco!\\" Almost like Korn, \\"C'mon, F*** with me!\\" from Reclaim my Place. All the songs sound almost exactly the same with only a few minor timing differences, except for Amir of the Desert which did culminate a curious grin. Coal Chamber has taken elements from more recognized bands from this genre and spliced them together into this potpourri of seeming madness. I cannot blame them though, I bought the record after buying into all of the hype my friends had cast upon it. Now it sits at the very bottom of my CD collection, never played while real metal bands like Sepultura are listened to on a daily basis. The only saving grace was the recorded outtake that was on after the very last song finished, where Dez, or Bradley I guess, was offering \\"Two pigs for a camel\\" and the band had an imprompteu jam session."},{"rating":"2","title":"coal chamber the best band in the planet","review":"i have the 2 cds of coal chamber and what can i say is the best band i ever heard, korn,deftones all that bands are not even half of coal chamber i dont know why korn its more famous than c.c all the cds of korn are the same. c.c should be in the place of korn and limp bizkit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little Korn never hurt anybody...","review":"I freely admit that the first thing I thought to myself when I first played this album was \\"Wow, they sound a LOT like they want to be Korn.\\"A year later, I don't think that anymore. The more you listen to this record, the more the originality of Coal Chamber strikes you. They aren't as emotionally gut-wrenching as Korn, but there's a certain amount of playfulness in each of the songs. \\"Sway\\", \\"Loco\\" and \\"Pig\\" all have plenty of humor in addition to tight playing and songwriting. \\"Oddity\\" is a killer song, showcasing Dez Fafara's vocal stylings from the hypnotic, spooky whisper to the straight-ahead gravelly scream.\\"Bradley\\", \\"Unspoiled\\" and \\"Dreamtime\\" slow the pace down while raising the hair on the back of the listener's neck. Coal Chamber are heavy, spooky, funny and talented musicians.

Korn has better lyrics and a way better bass player. Fieldy is the man. Coal chamber just wants to be like Korn too much. They need to work on their lyrics, and change their guitar riffs.

Doesn't come with a case but if you're buying macro lenses you most likely already have a carrying case for you body and lenses. It's a sturdy lens, quick focusing response, smooth manual action.

The only use left for my my kit lens \\"AF-S NIKKOR 18-55mm 1:3.5-5.6G ED\\" is as an 18mm wide angle. This Sigma 50mm f/2.8 prime lens is very sharp. I use it as a portrait lens on my cropped DX sensor camera (eq. 80mm on a full frame FX sensor). It also works great in low light. For portraits, I set f/5.6 if I am only 3-4 feet away. If I am 6-9 feet away I use f/4. You can try to use f/2.8 close-up but you are taking a chance, as the depth of field is so narrow that you might have the eyebrows sharply in focus and the nose and ears blurry. This lens is also very durable. On the negative side, focusing is not super-fast, but that didn't bother me, so I say go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great macro sigma lens","review":"Sigma 50mm 2.8 macro is a very nice lens. as soon as I received it, I have took some great photos with it.

I have a Sigma 35mm camera and it has rock solid construction. This lens matches that same quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Sigma makes nice lenses, what can I say?

I am a watch collector and enjoy taking pictures of my collection and I knew I wanted to get a macro lens. After some research I decided on this one and was actually able to get a Mint Condition one for under $200. I've been very happy with it and it takes amazing pictures.I know sometimes it can be a gamble going with third party lenses but this Sigma is a true workhorse and definitely deserves consideration. It can also serve as a straight 50mm lens but the macro capability is fantastic and takes very sharp pictures. I'm trying to get more into Photography and hope to start doing some Model shoots, I've done Video for about 10 years now, and I know this will take great shots with that type of stuff as well.I know I'll need to add some other lenses for versatility but I am SO glad I decided to get this as my Macro lens and would definitely recommend checking one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give the new mayhem cd a chance!","review":"I just opened this cd and yes it is a bit weird sounding at times, because of the use of drum machines etc..

Mr life takes us on a journey through his own head, which starts at his brains and ends up at the tips of his nappy roots hair. After this journey we all feel like we've had a rough time but are glad for the opportunity that Mr Lif would let us be in his head for just under 55 minutes. In the end we all realise that we should be working 9-5 jobs in a safe office where we are off the \\"streets\\" and safely working for a nice boss in a comfy grey cubicle. As a tribute to all the street kidz that used to beat him up on the way home from the chemist, Mister Lif used 11 random street scum to do his production for him. And boy does it show!

Lif creatively weaves hood struggles, hip hop battles, self definition, troubles at work, family matters and even how the white man conditioned the native americans as well as a nuclear war. and he does it all and keeps the listener's head nodding in interest. the guests all do their thing as well; there was no misplaced crew member on there, each appearance compliments the track well and adds his or her perspective. this album is just brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, the story's back on track!","review":"Last Blood is Volume 14 in Mr. Samura's revenge-quest manga, Blade of the Immortal.

Anotsu has been systematically cut down, but now he will regather his forces (what's left of the Itto-ryu) and strike back at the Bakufu! Likewise, Rin reunites with Manji, and however briefly their time, she makes a long-awaited confession....Needless to say, I lapped up every single panel: this series is very very well plotted.

I don't see how anyone can read a book like this and take its themes seriously; especially when coupled by all its discrepancies between fact and fiction, starting with the foremost and largest falsehood...Sexuality is a predestination, and for all but a very small few, never changes!This book defends a falsehood and therefore lies to its readers. I would not recommend that anyone waste any part of their life reading it, especially young or otherwise adults struggling with their own sexual identity, because many of the aforementioned are rendered unstable by our society and resort to hoping for any chance of changing themselves. A book like this could only destroy people who are insecure about their identity.What our world needs right now is a book about recognizing homosexuality and embracing it, instead of rejecting its truths as this book does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Respond appropriately","review":"Cleverly disguised as concern and professions of faith, this book will teach you to loathe your gay child and to don a mantle of silent, superior suffering.

You will be told to grieve, not celebrate, when your child is honest with you. Censure, kidnapping, ostracism, brainwashing -- these are the \\"appropriate\\" responses that this book will teach you all because your child trusts you enough to say, \\"I'm gay.\\"The appropriate response to this book -- full of discredited \\"research\\" -- is not to buy it.

Having known Jeff Buckley a bit from 'round the neighborhood during that magic Sin-e summer of '93, I knew that a dual-bio with his father Tim would have been among his worst nightmares. But Browne has artfully woven their stories together with an admirable degree of distance and sympathy. Though Browne is very even-handed in his treatment of the elder Buckley, Tim's actions speak for themselves: often a fearless and innovative musician, he was also horribly self-centered, indulgent, and selfish. Jeff comes off as the sweet one, which (mostly) he was. His loss was immense and breaks my heart to this day, and I'm glad that Browne has avoided the bottom-feeder approach of his contemporaries (like Victor Bockris) and written a book that is caring, accurate, and moving. If you like either or both Buckleys, this is a bracing read that will enrich the experience of listening to their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and researched dual biography.","review":"This book was an excellent read and gave a lot of insight to the music business as well as the lives of these two artistic musicians.

Personally, I was looking for a book about performing acupressure on someone else!First of all, this book includes Acupressure, Shiatsu, reflexology and a little bit of yoga (Very briefly). For a 386 page book, it is just too many topics to cover, and it's understandable that nothing is in depth. Secondly, the pictures are just as brief as the writings. Finally, the A-Z guide covers a lot of topics from Acne to tinnitus to impetance to PMS, it takes up the book from page 78 onwards.My conclusion is, this book is no where detailed enough for someone who is serious about acupressure, and for someone who wants to do a little acupressure on themself, unless you suffer diseases from A-Z, you'll only find 10 pages of this book useful.

I am not saying that a person should not seek professional medical help when needed, but for things like headaches, needing a boost of energy, reducing urges to eat, and the like, this book and the techniques taught inside are for you.

Bought the MH-61 charger and like that it doesn't involve the camera to accomplish, and charges the batteries in only an hour or so...much quicker than when using the camera to do the charge.

This is not music for the faint of heart, nor is it music for those who still hold faith in human nature, because this CD has one message that stands above the rest: Humankind is a slave to evil because evil is an inherent part of his being.

At first listen back in 2004, I didn't care much for this album at all. I thought it was a typical Cannibal Corpse cookie monster album. When I heard it again a few weeks ago, I found a great, sludgy, monster of a metal album. It is very hard for me to classify this album to one major metal genre so I will call it death grind for lack of better terminology. Anyway, this album (and band, for that matter) blow Cannibal Corpse and its pathetic ilk out of the water by having a deeper sense of musicality. Granted, the vocals are indecipherable but as a whole, this band is not cartoony or gruesome for the sake of being gruesome.

I think that they're boring and devoid of any form of creativity. The drumming while technical, is completely lacking as far as heart and soul goes. It just sounds as if Doug Bohn is going through the motions. Oh, and Frank Mullen is nothing special as a Death Metal vocalist. In my opinion, he's just a gruff, bear chanting vocalist with a little more clarity than say, Chris Barnes of Cannibal corpse.

They are from the Stillman fire collection. Most of the films are from the 1940's. There are scenes of ships ablaze, individual buildings burning, dock fires etc. A few famous fires, such as the LaSalle Hotel fire and the Winecoff Hotel fires (both in 1946) are included. Also there are scenes of people who perished in fires, and may be disturbing to some people. I give this four stars because of the musical score. Not too bad in itself, but it gets repititious and annoying. Otherwise, it is a fascinating set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome. Simply Awesome","review":"This DVD set has some of the \\"hottest\\" documentary footage I've ever seen. What you get is tons and tons of huge fires in black and white. My favorite is the munitions plant that not only catches fire but also keeps exploding as bombs inside blow up. Each fire is cooler than the next and I'm shocked that photographers were able to get close enough to some of these to catch them on film. Overall it's one of the most exciting documentaries I've ever seen in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was hoping this program would give my kids some extra learning for their homeschooling, but was a complete waste of time and money. The program is not divided into grade levels and the scores cannot be used for other children. Most of the material covered is stuff my kids already knew and they were very bored with what there was. There is basically no math, just one example of each problem, that's it. Don't waste your money or time on any of these products."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST MODERN DAY MOVIE FOR HK EVER","review":"This movie is great and very original.Jingle Ma will always make great movies like HOT WARS, making HK movie look internation. The movie is well lit and its on a MATTED 1.85 widescreen,Dolby 5.1,and kool extras. This movie will get 4 stars for a reason,the ending action sequence is not as big as the beggining.(Maybe thats my opinion). Also you will get into the action sequence making a MATRIX style of editing,along with some kool LATINO style of MOMBO music that make this a Millenium Classic as 2000 A.D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good idea","review":"This is easier to store than the large round bumpers and it really stays in place.

I can't pick a standout song on this because they are all outstanding! Tunes that will stick in your head without being hook-laden.

He is a well developed character and this is his background information. He draws on his military experience to pursue logical investigations with great adventure.

I liked the other ones, though I haven't finished reading them all just yet. The plot sounded good when I bought the book, however this didn't turn out to be the case. Jack Reacher is a great character, so I was disappointed that Mr Child didn't use him to his full potential. Jack is best when out on the road moving from place to place and helping people, kind of like the Incredible Hulk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reacher rocks","review":"Just finished this one. Five to go to finish the Reacher series, which I have come upon far too late. Are there any bad Reacher books? NO. Every one I read is my favorite until I read the next one. Tripwire is another Reacher classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on Reacher","review":"This is the first Reacher book I've read by Lee Child and I think I'll be reading them for a long, long time. Didn't start with the first one in the series because I wanted to let Child develop the character a bit first, now I'll go back and start with the first. Reacher is a real man's man, and the plot is just complicated enough to keep you interested and simple enough not to lose you in too many characters. And there's plenty of action to go around throughout the book. You really don't want to put it down. I only wish they would bring the price of the earlier of this now thirteen long series to a lower price. Doesn't seem right to pay $9.99 for even the first ones out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some interesting premises, but too many errors...","review":"I really enjoyed the first two Reacher books, but this one had far too many errors involving travel that got in the way. For example, Reacher frequently buys airline tickets with no identification--this is impossible today. All airlines require a picture ID when buying a ticket, and they would be especially suspicious of someone paying cash. Likewise, he travels business-class on domestic routes, but virtually no airline currently has business class sections on their domestic routes. Finally, he describes buying a first-class ticket and flying from Dallas to Honolulu. Coincidentally, I was in a first-class seat from Dallas to Honolulu as I read this section and, while it was certainly nice it was no where near as luxurious and spacious as it is described in the book. Perhaps the author just needs to do a bit more research next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it","review":"I didn't get this book. I like thrillers where I can put myself in the protagonist's shoes, suffer with him through the book and eventually win with him/her (why not? I like happy endings). Being a normal guy, I find it easier to sympathize with the protagonist when he is an ordinary guy as well. Well Jack Reacher is no ordinary guy. Gigantically tall and mostruosly fit, he comes from nowhere and has no friends, nor family ties. Highly unreal. He is a tough guy who is not surprised to see people shooting at him for no apparent reason. in other words, he is a comic. And my problem is that I don't like comics. Even his relationship with Jodie - his former mentor's daughter - is so stereotypical....No, I didn't get this book, nor did i enjoy it. I gave it up after 280 pages with no regrets except for the price of the book. Shame, considering that it is not badly written after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three down, more to go...","review":"I enjoyed the first two Reachers and I have to read them all in sequence. This did not disappoint me.The action and plot sequencing was different from the first two with Reacher playing more of a supporting role -- the main emphasis seems to be on his opponent. The character development for all the characters was remarkable; you weren't aware that these people are being developed as you read. I really appreciate the art that Child is able to put on paper. Every now and then you realize that Child is not an American, but English. How many of you refer to your cell phone as a \\"mobile\\"?A bit more character development for Reacher. We learn more about his mentor and the mentor's relationship with him. Geez, I wonder what's in store for me next?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"A big disappointment. I enjoyed the first two Jack Reacher stories but found Tripwire hard to finish. The plot was not believable. I know that it is necessary to suspend your disbelief somewhat to enjoy a thriller. But I found most of the book to be filler, just a means to get to the next violent scene.Two people wonder into various government offices across the U.S. and get treated like VIP's? Underlings are actually running to get information for these outsiders? It doesn't work that way when I need something from the Feds. Seems like 60 Minutes has stories on all the time describing how uncooperative these agencies are.The bad guys are too evil to be believable. But we are supposed to believe that the baddest guy in the whole wide world is put on hold by a rich housewife? He holds her captive for two or more days and nights, he fancies her, she is prancing around in next to nothing, and a guy who is so evil he tortures people to death for fun doesn't take advantage of her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad OCR Software for kindle version! does anyone proofread??","review":"The story was great. Typical Jack Reacher what I have come to expect from Lee Child. My poor rating isn't due to that but my annoyance at paying $8.99 for a digital product that once it is produced costs the publisher and Amazon essentially nothing and it seems that just about nothing is about what they put into producing in. It seems they just scanned the print copy of the book and used OCR software to change it into the Kindle format and then no one ever did a thorough proof read of it. I have never in my life read a published book with so many typos. Some of them occurred in the same words throughout the book such as \\"corner\\" would be \\"comer\\". Instead of \\"I\\" there would be the numeral \\"1\\". The list goes on and on. I don't think I made it through five pages without a typo, and it just annoyed me. This is a published book that I paid for! Amazon or whoever is responsible: Do better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Massive loose end totally ruined it","review":"I was enjoying this book (thoroughly) until I got to the denouement. The plot twist (which I won't reveal) left an impossible-to-fix plot hole relating to American dollars. Others have mentioned it here, so if you care to go and delve into the other reviews, you will find a discussion about this. Although even there, the point has been missed. If you read the book, and you're alert (and you don't have to be VERY alert!) you'll catch it. It made me livid. Had I been reading an actual physical book, rather than an electronic one, it would have been thrown across the room. Overall, I like Jack Reacher, this is the 2nd Child book I've read and I've been disappointed with both endings. I detest loose ends, I detest plot holes, they're just plain lazy.

Tripwire was my first introduction to Jack Reacher, and I don't think we will be getting to know each other better. The mystery wasn't very mysterious and the romance was dull, cliqued, and filled with sophomoric angst.The weak mystery is covered over with an overly complicated plot and hodgepodge of fluff characters. The two characters that hold any promise of being interesting, Tony and Marlin Stone, are either ignored or given up on in the last several chapters. The only real surprise comes in the end when we find out that Reacher is really Superman and his only weak spot is his head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish book...","review":"One more mention of the skinny,blonde woman and I would have thrown the book across the room.

I have watched Reacher grow and learned more of his backstory. This is a good read in a series that just keeps getting better.

This is one of the best books written by Lee Child. I can't wait for his nest book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child missed on this one.","review":"Having read KILLING FLOOR and DIE TRYING, I eagerly picked up a copy of TRIPWIRE. It is easily the weakest of the three. The villian, Hook Hobie, is like something out of a Marvel Comic book. Every time a character meets him, Child describes him all over again in the same terms, from the half burned face, to the J shaped hook where his hand should be.Reacher's relationship with Jodie seems rather strange. Especially when Reacher admits to being attracted to her when she was a child, it sounds downright creepy. I was,however, glad to see him ready to give up his paranoid, wandering lifestyle.The plot was barely interesting and any avid reader of mystery thrillers will figure it out long before Child tells us. I was glad that I picked this book up from the library. I would have felt cheated if I actually paid for it. I hope this isn't the beginning of the end for Mr. Child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing so far","review":"This Reacher novel is somewhat overwritten. Too much unnecesary writing, too many romantic interludes. I find I'm skipping about 60% of the pages. Also, the terse writing style is beginning to wear thin.The smarts and snappy dialogue are still there, with one exception - his pontificating on the Vietnam War. For some reason, rather than his normal informed and independent opinion, he simply regurgitates popular myths - the wrong war, the wrong time, etc. Hey, Reacher, tell that to the millions who were killed by the Communists when America pulled out. Funny, because in another book, he gets upset about people hunting *animals*. Other Hollywood facts he trots out: soldiers paying for souvenir ears and shrunken heads, and so on.There's an interesting parallel track where a smart woman tries to con her (and her husband's) way out of an awful situation. Then pages of kissy-talk between Reacher and a long-lost sweetheart. Overall, not the best Reacher novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is my worst buy of the year.","review":"Page after page of descriptive detail that has little to do with a plot that is not plausible and characters that are completely unreal."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great Jack Reacher","review":"recommend this product to all who have finished the WEB Griffin series as I have.

Trying to avoid spoilers here: For no reason he visits a horticultural exhibit (no previous interest has ever been shown, and no explaination as to why he would go there) and because of that he solves one of the pivotal puzzles in the story. This is just one example of the many unbelievable situations that the book revolves around. If I want fantasy I will read D&D fanzines. There are too many books with well thought out plots and solutions to waste time reading poorly written novels such as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eillien Lee child Tripwire","review":"Enjoyed this character very much. The tension was palpable. Altogether a fun and exciting read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy on the Sadism","review":"I love the Jack Reacher novels. Having said that, I was less than thrilled with Tripwire. In previous novels, Child uses a few deft scenes to describe his vicious, soulless villains. In Tripwire, Child structured his story in such a way that a lot of time had to be spent with the villain. Therefore, there are numerous scenes of sadistic cruelty. Their repetition, while stylishly written, left me feeling fatigued and frankly bored. Yes, we found out the villain is bad. A bit later, we realized he was very, very bad. By the time Child convinced me the bad guy was very, very, very bad, I no longer cared and simply wanted the character put out of my misery.Having lodged this complaint, however, I found the overall plot wonderfully complex and entertaining. I still think Jack Reacher is the finest hero since Travis McGee."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book to test the farthest limits of credibility.","review":"Visualize Jack Reacher as ole' Stoneface, for these books read as if they are custom written for films starring Arnie Swartzie himself -- if he would stoop to it. This book is particularly dreadful. The hero stops a .38 bullet coming at him from the other side of the room, with the thickness of his pectoral muscles? Come on, Lee Child! Even if it were possible, it is socially irresponsible to point it out. Too many kids think it is possible to get up after a hail of gunfire already; don't compound the situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 bad plots don't make a good one","review":"I really hate it when authors take multiple mediocre plots and braid them together with feeble constructions or coincidences and call it a book. That's what we have here - a 400 page book that's really 3 x 133 page books braided together, none of them could stand alone.

The cheapskate side of me did not want to throw money down the drain. There was a profound lack of intrigue and suspense for a \\"suspense thriller.\\" The characters lacked depth and were very one dimensional. The antagonist of the story has a hook--I find this to be very comical. Jack Reacher is a character without any real human flaws--every pseudo flaw the author tries to introduce is quickly rationalized or explained into niceness--thus loosing the attempted effect. Practicaly every other chapter described how big and manly Jack is and how small, and petite his lady partner is. This is a \\"Harlequin\\" style story for men. The story did not inspire me to care about what happens to any of the characters--which is critical in a suspense novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tripwire","review":"This book was very entertaining to read as it was fast paced and with excellent twits and turns in the plot.

Reacher grows before our eyes in this extraordinarily personal story.The plot sizzles and TRIPWIRE is impossible to put down. 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerks the reader around","review":"I picked this book up at a modest discount at a Borders Clearance sale. It kept me reading but really, it's not significantly better than quite a few of the 99-cent potboilers you can get on the Kindle. Food for thought, that.I expected better of a namebrand author like Lee Childs. The characters, including Reacher, are smart when the plot needs them to be and stupid when that's required, which is fairly often. Information gets withheld often--at one point, Reacher asks another character to repeat some key information, on-camera, three times, and never tells it to the reader. The various character breakdowns and suspensions of disbelief don't really add up to setting the book aside until near the very end and by then why not finish it?It was an okay poolside read, but if I'm looking for thrillers, I'll try Dennis Lehane, Michael Connelly and David Morrell, whose craftsmanship is almost always impeccable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps getting better.","review":"Glad I stuck with the series because after 1 and 2 I was on the fence. But the writing improved A LOT. There weren't so many 'shrugs' which were plentiful for 1 and especially 2. The whole attraction between him and Jodie was nice enough...though the description of her physicality was bordering on perverse...him being so big and she being so small...yeah, we get it. It was just overplayed.Anyway, the story is typical Reacher and if you're a fan, you'll be happy with this one. Still room for improvement (could he please take more showers, lol), but I'll keep on reading em and enjoying his travels...or is he staying in Garrison for awhile? A loose end or two; but, I like that and it's not a 'cliff hanger' just a 'what's next'. He's smart, intuitive and a bit sexy in his nonchalance (even without all the shrugs) The geographic details are accurate too...this book at least, as it was set in my old stomping ground and was nice to follow the roads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack Reacher is boring--book TOO long and goes TOO slow!","review":"I am on the second book and am tired of everyone SHRUGGING!I can't imagine little Tom Cruiseplaying Jack Reacher in a movie.Reacher is at least a foot tallerthan Cruise.

Could have left the big lug alone, leaving him happily hand-digging swimming pools on undersized lots in Florida's Keys. But no. Reacher tracks down the clues, finds a young woman he was crazy about growing up and nearly loses everything to this creep.

Eventually he gets a chance to finish off the lumbering hero and his annoyingly perfect girlfriend but guess what? Reacher cleverly turns the tables on him.

Descriptive yet not too dragged out, the book lures the reader in. A sure read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting thriller - hard to put down","review":"I have read all of Lee Child's thrillers featuring Jack Reacher and found this one to be very entertaining. While maybe not quite as good as \\"The Killing Floor,\\" it nevertheless was very well done. The character of Reacher - loner, very tough, somewhat laconic - is a pretty stock one and his ability to escape tight situations stretches credulity.

It sounds like a small thing, but it's distracting. Also, Reacher buys a plane ticket in Miami without id. When did this story take place?!The one that killed me: Reacher goes shopping with the girl, he doesn't remember the name of the last store he bought clothes in - Hole? Gap? Come on! Was this guy in the Army for 13 years or was he a frozen caveman??? Lee Child - show me an American serviceman who doesn't know what The Gap is!!Lee Child has some talent, but sometimes you can tell he's English writing an American story. He's cleary fascinated by big American vehicles and automatic transmissions. And he slips sometimes and uses words like KIT to describe military equipment. Very British. Not a big deal - but sometimes he's a little out of touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the last one I read from Child","review":"Long and boring just like most of his novels. Once again he ran out of ideas before he ran out of ink. Also, thanks for stereotyping Texans again you arrogant, ignorant Brit.

You can skip this aspect of Montgomery's collection easily and not miss much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I've read the majority of LMM's books, and have liked to loved most of them. This is the only one that I've really found to be a disappointment. I agree with many of the other reviewers; the characters were flat, the ending was too predictable, and the book itself was overly sugary. It wasn't a horrid book, because LMM is too good of an author to write a horrid book, but it definitely wasn't good.

In her other major series (Anne, Emily, Pat, Story Girl) the heroine is never really beautiful, and something goes wrong...it seemed to me that Kilmeny was a book Montgomery wrote for fun. There is no real tragedy in the story, everything resolves itself nicely, and the characters are pretty much perfect. If you read the story bearing all this in mind, it's a very easy, enjoyable read.

It is not an adventure book, and it is not meant to be. It is beautifully written and soothing to the reader's mind. As a musician, it is also nice to see music entwined into a love story like this one. It is refreshing to find a beauty like Kilmeny who believes herself to be unattractive. Some readers have written that they are upset by the fact that their love is only based on looks. Eric fell in love with more than her beauty. Her mannerisms and innocence were a major part of that love. Her good looks only inspired him to look closer at the woman inside.

It has the usual wonderfully descriptive nature passages that we expect from the PEI author, but that's where the similarities to her other novels end. Her heroine is a beautiful, violin-playing cardboard cut-out. She is actually waiting to be rescued instead of actively searching for her destiny. Her earnest young suitor is also conceited and condescending. As for the ending, it is wildly dramatic, and would be laughable if Montgomery were any less of a writer. In short, the book is beautifully written, but has no substance. I felt as if I were reading a gothic novel that had somehow found itself unfolding in Canada, and it made me wish Montgomery had taken Mr. Harrison's advice to Anne: \\"Write what you KNOW\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual POV for Lucy Maud Montgomery","review":"Kilmeny of the Orchard is unusual in that it is written from a young man's pov.

My only problem with this book is that it is simply too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Classic","review":"Montgomery's wonderful skill in writing really shows in Kilmeny of the Orchard.

Along the way he meets beautiful Kilmeny, a young woman who cannot speak. Eric falls in love with Kilmeny, but will Kilmeny return his love? Kilmeny of the Orchard is a touching story that one will treasure in his or her heart.

For those that say that the characters are too 'goody' to be true... perhaps they are, but aren't most movies too action-packed and full of good-looking people to be true? After all... how many of us really want a book to be just like true life? No, I like my books to be fairy-tales... of course they couldn't come true!

It said it was a special edition - see that cover picture? I bought it for my boyfriend, who had the movie but not the special edition. The \\"special edition\\" cost significantly more than the regular edition, might I add. Well I got it in the mail, compared the two dvd's, and they were exactly the same. The cover was even like the regular edition, which is not the picture you see attached to this product on Amazon.Anyhow, I contacted the seller, who asked that I return the dvd for a refund (I also don't think I ever got that refund, but enough time passed where I just figured lesson learned, buyer beware, never again), but they did not reimburse me for shipping and made me pay for shipping it back.Again - BUYER BEWARE"},{"rating":"1","title":"A European history atlas in disguise....","review":"This atlas represents editorial laziness at its best. Instead of actually giving us a world history atlas, the editors have resurrected an older, narrowly-focused work. It's decent, to be sure, and I used it when I went to college, back in Stone Age (well, almost). It's still largely focused on the history of Europe, and I would use it in European history courses, but it doesn't serve us well if we need to teach world history. Try again, folks; just a little bit of effort now...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pendant was just as expected","review":"The pendant was just what i expected and i am very pleased with my purchase.

The diversity of tracks and the emotionally charged lyrics will no doubt secure more fans of this unusual yet beautiful musical style.There is definitely something for everyone on this album - rock infuses with melodic ballads - up-beat american 60's style pop, goes side by side with hypnotic spanish guitars and strings to create an album for all tastes and ages.This album will appeal to everyone who feels music and is stirred by honest emotion through song. It is a lesson of love and life - something to enjoy and treasure!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Pieces","review":"Received this very quickly after ordering it, however, it was missing 3 pieces.

When I put it in the camera and tried to zoom in, next thing the screen shows that 'Battery exhausted\\". I plug it again in the charger, didn't take much - 10 min maximum - showed that battery was charged. I put it back in the camera, same thing happens again!

The need for me to resist looking for a job that I may be good at, but don't particularly like, in favor of looking for a career doing something that I am passionate about. It is incredible how many people I've contacted who try to shove me into the same pigeonhole I've been in before. My challenge is to try to communicate better about what I'm really about, what I need to be looking for. 2. The other is the concept of the advantage-driven résumé.

Based on the author's coverage of places that I know quite well, I'd say they've done as thorough a job as possible considering the size of this country. The largest cities get plenty of space and helpful maps also, but even smaller places get their fair mention. The book covers most major monuments, parks, and attractions, but also gives some good local flavor suggestions for lodging and dining. Lots of history and essential info- phone numbers, websites, hours/ months of operation, etc. Not too many pictures, so if that's what you're looking for, then look elsewhere. If they included pictures, this book would just be too big. I definitely like this one better than Lonely Planet or some of the others- it just has a little more info than some guides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for baby and dad!","review":"My 4 month old loved it and so did his dad!

This one was one of the best I have read yet!! Romance, murder, mystery and love all set in a small, southern community. Who can ask for more? The plot has plenty of twists and turns and not without humor! You will think you know who is doing the murdering around Innocence, but you are definately in for a shocking ending! A great read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give us more!","review":"I have read many of Nora Roberts' books and loved most of them, but this stands out even amongst her best work. The secondary characters are all incredibly well developed, and Tucker Longstreet is one of the most charming heroes she's ever written. I'd love to see more along this line."},{"rating":"2","title":"One terrific book!!!","review":"I don't think I have enjoyed a book more since I read Sanctuary. I love how she ties in a murder mystery along with the romance. I love most of her books but this one held me captive right up until the surprisre ending.

The characters are wonderful, the story is so intense that I could not put the book down. I read this book about 3 weeks ago, and still find myself thinking about the characters. I truly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and hard to put down","review":"I just finished reading this book and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Nora Roberts seemed to capture the pace of the South and she wrote an incredibly charming lead in Tucker. Caroline was also a pretty good character but she was less fully developed than Tucker and even a couple of the others. I like to guess \\"whodunit\\" and this time I did guess -- less than halfway through the book. However, having an idea who the killer was didn't remotely diminish my enjoyment of reading it -- I just wanted to see if I was right. A recommended read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't wait to get to the end","review":"I love Nora Roberts. I \\"think\\" I have read and enjoyed everything she has written. Carnal Innocence was so long and boring. I mean realy, it took forever to get to the end. Great ending, but by the time you get there you're like \\"oh ya I get it\\".

Now that's a Nora Roberts book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carnal Innocence","review":"Loved Loved Loved this book - I have read just about everything by Nora Roberts and her alter ego J.D.Robb.

But Nora remains one of my favorite authors!!Gene Smith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!","review":"I liked this novel because it held my interest throughout the entire book. I thought Tucker and Caroline were great, very realistic and fun to read about. I liked Caroline's frustration with Tucker on those occasions when she thought he was just a lazy guy with no brain.I wasn't thrilled with the actual killer, as it didn't seem plausible. I would think a vicious killer would at least show SOME type of unusual behavior, but this one did not. This killer seemed to genuinely love most people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page-turner!","review":"Nora weaves her magic spell again with this novel. I was hooked with the first paragraph and didn't put it down until I read the last paragraph. I really felt for Caroline, but it took a while to warm up to Tucker. I'm usually very good at guessing \\"who-dunnit\\" but this one surprised me! A keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora Robert's BEST","review":"Don't hesitate. Buy this book today.This is Nora Robert's best book. The characters are warm and funny and realistic. I have spent enough time in small towns in Missouri that I can see many of those townspeople in the characters in Carnal Innocence. I find myself going back and reading it again once or twice a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw the movie...","review":"I saw the movie last night on Lifetime at it was great. Even when I was having problems with who the killer was, I changed it like three times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced, funny and unfortgetable","review":"This is one of Nora Roberts best. An older story but a wonderful one. It is fast paced and contains some extremely funny scenes woven into a plot within a plot, within a plot! Ms. Roberts carefully disguises her villans and the heros are foggy at best in the beginning. But when the plots thickens and the fog clears the story unfolds into a dramatic, romantic and sometimes funny original saga of the Longstreets. If you are a Nora Roberts fan, I know you will be thrilled with Carnal Innocence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mississippians should be up in arms.","review":"I am a Mississippian. Very few people have names like Edda Lou or Billy T unless they star on HEEHAW! Nora Roberts' fans, as I have been, should know that people are not as backwards in Mississippi as this book suggests. I kept reading to see if the ending made my $5.95 worth it. Roberts was really verging on a great plot but the characters made the book laughable. Mississippi may be guilty of \\"Innocence\\" but it is certainly not stupid. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous, sick plot","review":"The main character insists on staying alone in the house right near where they keep discovering raped and tortured, murdered girls that she knows. Right? No, I need to assert my independence. The plot twists just get more and more ridiculous as the book moves along. This must have been a book Nora Robert's publisher pushed her to finish for a deadline. Only reason I didn't give it zero stars is because generally Nora Roberts is a decent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora Roberts Never Disappoints","review":"This was very enjoyable reading and was really well written. The characters for the most part were very likable. The book consisted of romance which Nora Roberts always does well and a mystery intertwined in the story. The mystery although not a sit on the edge of your seat experience, was not at all predictable which always makes a book worth while reading. Not outstanding but very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"NORA ROBETS AT HER BEST","review":"Wow!!! This book is incredible. It is well written, well thought out, and a must read. Nora Roberts combines her beautiful romance writing with her sensational suspense writing. The character development of the two main characters: Caroline and Tucker, is so spot in and great that you feel as though you personally know each one. The love story written about these two is tremendously sweet and sincere. All their conversations and actions are purposeful and sweet. When they finally fall in love you will not be able to help but swoon. Aside from the romance, the mystery and suspense in this novel is remarkable well written and well executed. There a twists to the plot and the characters that is just so good. I recommend this book for anyone who loves Nora Roberts and for those who need to be introduced to a great novelist. Buy it, Read It, and Pass it along :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Carnal Innocence- Not for me","review":"Sorry Nora,, not this time for me.Drags along- with too many people and drove me crazy with the southern drawl. To me, it was overdone( too long) and would have liked to learn more about The Mother and Daughter ending. I skipped to the end so maybe I missed that, it just went on and on for me. It did have a surprise ending though. I liked Genuine Lies By Nora.JMO"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silhouette Meets Stephen King","review":"This book was explosive. A perfect mix of a little romance and a lot of mystery. You get so attached to the characters but never in your wildest dreams will you expect the killer to be who they were. It was hard to put down and when it is over I assure you, you'll be stunned. Compared to some of Nora's other books like Geniune Lies or Public Secrets it may seem gritty or maybe even scary but I loved it and if you like mystery I think you will love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora's Best to Date!","review":"I'm going to go out on a limb and say that as far as I'm concerned, this is Nora's best book to date.

Give us more like this one, Nora!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Nora Roberts is the best! This was very hard to put down. I fell in love with Tucker! Where are men like him?

There are many characters, and the plot twists and turns. It is fantastic! Very very relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"obvious display of self-parody","review":"Although I do enjoy this album, musically at least, I seem to find it rather obvious by the introductions of the band members and the ridiculous lyrics that Type O Negative is creating a parody of themselves and every other sappy, oh-so-depressed goth band in existence. They are blatantly in the business to make money, and to enjoy themselves, both of which they do. I don't think anyone can really take this album seriously. That being said, I think that this album is rather good, despite its rather obvious shortcomings. The music is very beautiful and makes great background music to introspection or a get together. Overall, definitely worth purchasing. Just don't get carried away by calling this authentic gothic music."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is this?","review":"ok, im not sure about some people, but this is not what i thought it would be...different..some tracks are just noise...there was one i liked...my girlfriends girlfriend...however, ill give it two stars for that, and i respect the work they put into it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland Goth Metal","review":"This is a bland goth metal offering especially with all the hype surrounding the band.

Unlike Bloody Kisses, October Rust has nothing to offer the listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Can I Say Other Than....AMAZING!!!","review":"I just got into ToN since June of 2001, when i bought World Coming Down, Recently i received Bloody Kisses (Digipack), today i received October Rust and I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THIS ALBUM!! This album is so great it has sounds of Sadness, Love, abd Great Dispair. My fav tracks include, Love You To Death, Red Waters (Christmas Mourning), Burnt Flowes Fallen, and In Haunted!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Type o Negative is by far the best band in the world","review":"If you are a fan of Goth type music, Type O Negative is the band to listen to.

Forget the whacked out views of simple album sales. I go by how a band sounds and how they make me react internally. Type O Negative is an extremely talented band, and October Rust is a great litmus test for those who have never heard them before. The sound is rich, thick, and powerful. It is thunderous in volume and yet at some times it is slow and serene. The songs themselves have no weaknesses. My fave song has to be \\"Bad Ground\\", although as I have said EVERY song on this CD is awesome. And best of all, metal fans, even your significant other will end up digging Type O Negative. Every woman I have dated within the past six years started out hating metal.....now they all love Type O. This album ranks among my Top Ten, as in fave albums and how many times I have played it in any CD player that I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless classic","review":"This CD is Type O Negative at their most accessible and also at their best. I have enjoyed all of TON's albums, but none more than October Rust. It is the kind of album that demands your full attention - you just end up missing out if you have it on as background music. Right from the start with \\"Love You to Death\\" you can tell that this one is going to be something special. Other standout cuts include the captivating \\"Green Man\\", \\"Die with You\\", \\"Burnt Flowers Fallen\\", and \\"Wolf Moon\\" to name but a few. Peter Steele's baritone has never sounded better than on this album. It's a long album with long songs that sound better and better with each listen. If you are reading this review and don't own it - well, you should."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST ALBUM TO DATE","review":"I have been a fan of Type O Negative since their inception onto the music scene. This is by far the best album they have ever made. The smooth melodic music is enough to put you in a trance, Peter Steele's vocals and Bass playing are perfect. Kenny Hickey attacks his guitar with a new found vengeance, Josh Silver is a musical genius on his keyboards. And the \\"new\\" drummer Johnny Kelly is an excellent match for this band. All together this band has gone through some very hard times, and they have perservered. I recomend this album to anyone who can tolerate using their brain. This band is like a fine wine, they only get better with age! I also recomend their new album \\"World Coming Down\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Follow Up To Bloody Kisses","review":"October Rust, the follow up to Type O Negative's breakthru release Bloody Kisses, is excellent from start to finish. While the album seems to lag a bit in the middle, when these tracks are listened to in isolation they are actually quite good. While this album is not quite five star material it is chock full of great tracks like the atmospheric Love You To Death, the humorous My Girlfriend's Girlfriend, the spooky Wolf Moon, and the haunting (pun intended) closer Haunted. This is a more consistent album than it's predecessor but overall I find Bloody Kisses just a tiny bit better. The songs are more streamlined in their arrangments and the production is exquisite. This is a great album to acquire for the Type O novice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satantric Musick","review":"Beautiful music carrying elements of dark erotica and romance awash with the scenes and vistas of natural wonders of the seasons in bloom, one to another. One song to the next blends into the other gracefully like the seasons themselves, speaking of lost love, the hues of the emotions as varied and intense as the characteristics of Autumn, Winter, and Spring.Peter Steele's darkly melancholy voice intermingles, accompanied gracefully with choral bliss, with the typical use of heavy instrumentation, strings, the sounds of nature on a Spring afternoon, really works well together, like a spot of black amongst the greenery overgrowth surrounding.Again, Type O Negative presents a darkly erotic opus ideal for romantic encounters with a beloved."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"This is one of my top few favorite albums. I have owned it for nearly six years now and the feelings conveyed are the same now as they were when it was new. The first twenty or so times I listened to it, I was confused and perhaps ashamed of some of the lyrics, but not anymore. The lyrics are without a doubt the best part of this music. Steele's vocalization of his words is truly unique and exquisite. I have rarely seen a songwriter who has so much to say and says it so well. He does not play games with you or get stifled by himself. I love this album because I assosicate it with so many raw emotions and experiences, and it never fails to take me back to places and times and people. Track number eight chokes me up every time and I hate that.The lyrics from Green Man read like Whitman and the melodies are many things at once. Beautiful, naked, dark, intelligent, and haunting all describe them perfectly. October Rust is as un-fluffy as anything can be and it has a lot of power. I love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"only heard one song but...","review":"I saw the video for My Girlfriend's Girlfriend and it was absolutely the worst music I've ever heard. The lyrics were terrible (not that I could understand them) (and lyrics about polyamory have to be pretty awful for me to say something bad about them ;), the music was boring, the voice tried to be creepy and atmospheric but instead wound up clichéd and uninteresting, and the singer had an aura of fakeness. But maybe it's just me. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drastic dose of death","review":"TON are like the Sigur Ros of death metal, which is why Steele and company made so much other distortion-laced doom and gloom seem uninformed and meekly irrelevant. OR might not appease the group's most meatheadishly metal demographic, but I can guess you one thing: this colossal release of darkened melodic embrace sure helped make more female fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely spine-freaking tingling!","review":"I'm sure all you TON fans will agree, the depth of October Rust is incredible. To absorb it to the fullest, you have to listen over and over again, each time discovering a whole new essence of the music. Any critic who would criticize October Rust is just a plain f---ing idiot.The diversity in style from song to song, let alone album to album, is something that the majority of bands today couldn't begin to grasp if there lives depended on it. Type O seems to do it with ease.From the spooky/bee-bop sound of 'My Girlfreind's Girlfreind', to the sorrowful roar of 'Love You To Death', to the album's pinicle song 'WOLF MOON' October Rust is a definate must for any 'true' music inthusiest. The bar has been set high by the band themselves for there upcoming release to measure up to October Rust."},{"rating":"2","title":"5,000 stars wouldn't be enough","review":"I bought this CD one week after it came out in '96. It didn't come out of my stereo for almost a month. I have loved TON from before the Carnivore days. I would follow them down any road. Oct. Rust is simple genious music, it truely looks into the pits of human thought and desire. I will own World Coming Down on Sept 21. I would never wait when buying a band like Type O Negative. Oct Rust will not dissapoint anyone!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Excellent. Bloody.","review":"Some of the best music created. Like it or not. They are different, follow the beat of a *different* drummer. Gothic attitude and lyrics that won't die are the heart and soul of this group and they have successively proved once again that they have what it takes to blow away any other person who even comes within realms of competing with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"October Rust is the first CD I've ever heard by Type O Negative, and I was extremely impressed by it.It's haunting melody and interesting guitar/ piano work gives it a sound all it's own.I've had this CD for almost a year now, and have only taken it out of the player a few times. I just never get bored of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what type o negative's music really stands for...","review":"When i think of type o negative i usually think of their slow gothic metal sound that no one else seems to have. October Rust really stands out from all other type o cd's. FOr one, the material on this cd is what i would normally think of as type o negative's music,it's slow, hard, and gothic. I think that if your intrested in buying any of type o negative's music then this is the cd that really shows what type o's music is, or at leat what it should stay as. The whole idea of Type O making faster and somewhat harder music, which they have done, just dosent work out. This cd truly stands out as what Type O Negative's music is, or should be. Type O Negative has a certain sound in their music that no one else can ever have. Me and most other fans aggree that Type o Negative's music really ... when they try to make it fast or anything different then their type of music which is shown in this cd. thats pretty much why suggest that you buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little tamer but just as good","review":"I've followed the band since slow... and each time they get better. Bloody kisses is the best and if I could give it 6 stars I would. Rust is very well done also though it is a little less gothic the guys still are able to make a love song depressing as hell. Just what we need."},{"rating":"2","title":"I haven't listened to anything else in a week!","review":"This album has a cross between driving rhythms and beats, sensual ballad tones and psychedelic undertones. I was incredibly pleased with all of the tracks, especially the two untitled, in which the band thanks the listener. The sounds of Peter, Josh and Kenny's voices meld with the music perfectly. If you liked Bloody Kisses, you'll love this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4,5 stars Their best album","review":"This is definitely their best album. It has amazing atmosphere and very good gothic melodies. Its an album you can hear it overall in <>. I recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melancholic Masterpiece","review":"Everything comes together perfectly on this album, there really isn't a weak point or song anywhere. This is one of the best gothic albums I've heard, though I wouldn't neccassarily classify Type O as a gothic band. Pete Steele is an amazing singer and gots a real deep voice. He's one of five singers I've ever heard do the extemely deep vocals really well, Johan Edlund of Tiamat, Dust of ...How Like A Winter, Nick Holmes of Paradise Lost and Dan Swano of too many projects to list being the others. The music is dirgy, slow and ambiant, almost like someone threw Black Sabbath, My Dying Bride and Paradise Lost in a blender and Type O is what came out. If your into gothic or interesting music in general you'll probably love this album. I also recommend checking out Tiamat, Katatonia, Paradise Lost, Lacuna Coil, and Anathema in addition to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orgasm in a CD case","review":"With a splendid mix of quiet melodies and thrashing punk guitar, Type O is really one of the most original and best gothic rock band in music today. I recently went to see their show with Spineshank and Simon Says, and they were the highlight of the evening. Peter Steel's deep rhythmic voice coupled with biting guitar and eerie keyboard effects drive home the spiteful lyrics that make this cd a great example of the ckings of gothic rock. A worthy investment for anyone who has the slightest interest in rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLY SH|T","review":"This has to be one of the most amazing goth cd's out there. It combines Beatles lyrics with Black Sabbath riffs. It shows the stages of a person's life through Pete Steele's eyes. Now this guy is a true visionary. You don't know how many times this band has amazed me. There is of course your love ballad (Love You To Death), Gloom rock (Haunted) and cover song (Cinnamon Girl). If you like any type of music you'll love this. seriously. ANY music fan can enjoy Type O Negative."},{"rating":"2","title":"October Rust","review":"Type O Negative, October Rust. There are many reviews already, so I won't say much. This album is truly fantastic. Nothing quite compares. It's a CD that has been with me for years (in several incarnations), and I don't know who I'd be without it. If you don't already have October Rust, do yourself a favor and procure this bit of recorded magic! [R.I.P.

The story is just a little bit dated, but not too bad.... most kids who are sports fans will probably enjoy this book.Rusty Ryan loves to play ice hockey, and he's pretty good. The problem is, he KNOWS he's good! When he moves to a new town and joins the high school hockey team, his big ego and tendency for selfish play don't make him any friends and gets him in hot water with the coach. Can he learn to put his selfishness aside and do what is best for the team?A good lesson about fair play, selflessness, and putting the team first."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you like your erotica strange . . ..","review":"I was totally put off by this collection of short stories.

Kind of a poor movie considering a lot of plot elements seemed to be introduced, but go nowhere.Characters where flat, very static. It is like a book, with a great first chapter, but it just kind of falls away like some kid trying to finish a short story for English class.If your choosing between this and a good movie you have seen before, just watch something you know is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good sequel to the first, and even better in some parts.","review":"I thought \\"S.W.A.T. -Firefight\\" was a pretty good sequel to the first film (in my opinion), and better in some areas too.

And of course, Shannon does a great job and isn't bad to look at either!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Man Flick for Women","review":"I am a huge Gabriel Macht fan for alot of reasons. I normally hate this kind of movie, but honestly, I am addicted to Suits and wanted to see how he performed in another story. This is definitely a guy movie with all the macho posturing and gun play, but I have watched it three times now and it isn't just because of Macht. The movie grows on you. It doesn't hurt that the female leads are strong and interesting...It isn't the best movie I have ever seen, but it is well worth the money and the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie made me want to eat my own face","review":"Where to start? The plot line is so full of holes it's painful. The 15 second backstories quickly get tiring. The cameras on the guns is just nauseating.

This cd has two good songs: When Satan Rules His World and Trick or Betrayed. The rest just aint that good. For death metal, i prefer In Flames and At The Gates. Those guys are creative. Deicide is just bland, boring, and monotonous for the most part. Oh yeah the extremely satanic and blasphemous lyrics start to sound old and lame very quicklyBottom line: If you want truly great metal, go with Iced Earth, Venom, In Flames, At The Gates, Death, Type O Negative, Emperor, or Cradle of Filth"},{"rating":"1","title":"A small step back for Deicide","review":"I personally like the sound of Deicide though the lyrics aren't always too clever. And this album doesn't change that...There's still the brutal sound of evil, but unfortunately evil does seem to be a little bit more stereotypical on this album than it was on their debut-album \\"Amon - feasting the beast\\". The originality and newness of the previous albums seem to have been forgotten a little bit which is also witnessed in their live performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deicide's worse...","review":"As a big fan of deicide i must say that i was realy let down while i heard \\"Once upon the cross\\" by deicide. I gave two starts because its deicide and both songs \\"once upon the cross \\", and, \\" trick or betrayed\\" are two good songs but the rest of the album is boring and not the deicide i know and love even the lirycs are a joke on this album. Im glad deicide did get their act together and kept releasing other good albums except this one... All in all ? Deicide is a great band and i love their music but once upon the cross is just horrible. Not recommended as a fan so dont buy it. Get serpents of the light and deicide's selftitle insted and the rest of deicide's albums but skip this once upon the cross!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn Mean","review":"This is not for the squemish or the Godly.

I have actullie given them a chance and bought every single release by deicide and heard it all but not one song sounded good but weak!Im not a christian but some one who is actullie atract to evil and satanic music but well deicide just dont do it for me at all.

Glen Benton has a good voice I do admit, and it blends well with the music. But the music is very offensive, really the lyrics are very offensive, and yes this album once you hear it will scare you, and i am not making this up. Listening to this will make you feel that Satan is sitting next too you. It scared me, and i am being honest. Glen Benton with all the respect should just focus on secular music. stuff is very deep, i dont recommend this at all.

Not to mention that they're the most blasphemous band I can think of. Ignorant lyrics, boring guitar riffs, monotonous drumming. It's the formula for a stupid band called Deicide.

Don't waste your money on this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEIR HEAVIEST ALBUM.","review":"I cant believe how aggressive and heavy this album is.The guitar work is really good and bentons vocals are very heavy.The detuned guitars make this release unforgetable and the production is also good.Deicide fans should already own this because this is one of their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection, thy name is Deicide","review":"Death metal fans take heed. This is the quintessential Deicide album. This is the music that made this band legendary. They (somehow) expanded on their earlier music and had a great production to create this masterpiece. Benton's voice is deeper and darker than his earlier recordings, and the Hoffman brothers' guitar playing is less choppy than on Legion. If you are really offended by Satanic lyrics, then this album really isn't for you. Benton is about as subtle a nuclear bomb when writing about his beliefs. If you can get past the lyrics and listen to the music, then you are really in for something special. This album is about as good as death metal gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falls short of Legion","review":"OK, possibly the heaviest Deicide release, equal with Insineratehym, this is probably Deicide's most celebrated album, but IMO Legion is the greatest Deicide release. Glen is furious as usual, the groove is there, some of the hooks have improved, but unfortunately, the brutality has dripped a little bit. It is a great release, don't get me wrong, but some of the songs are a little bland and drop off in places, whereas Legion was perfect. Once Upon the Cross has Spawned classics such as the title track (one of my fav. Deicide songs!), Kill the Christian and They Are the Children of the Underworld. It's not as technical as Legion but more technical than Deicide.It's kinda hard to describe this cd, its good in places but falls short in others... Know what I mean? It's good stuff though, not a really essential buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deicide - 'Once Upon A Time' (Roadrunner)","review":"How many of you actually realize what this band's name means? I will say the depth of this satanic metal almost scares me. With track titles like \\"Christ Denied\\", \\"When Satan Ruled His World\\", \\"Kill The Christians\\" and \\"Children Of The Underworld\\", you can tell these evil henchmen mean business. Problem is very few will probably take them seriously. Might appeal to some fans of Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, King Diamond and Death. Speaking of which, about their name,'Deicide' apparently means 'the death of God'. That alone would keep me from supporting this band. The music is okay, by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is there best album","review":"This is the most foccused deicide album completely brutal and brillant there albums since this have sucked so bad i think they have lost the plot and its only on the backing of this album that i have continued to listen to there albums..

If you want to get into Deicide, buy Legion or their s/t. Don't even bother with this piece of (censored). This is where Deicide sold out, and anything beyond this is pure bullcrap. The lyrics have gone from constructive blasphemy to low brow vulgarity (\\"I will defecate on your Bible\\"? come on!) These guys have great musicianship skills, but they show no signs of songwriting or lyrical talent that was in their first two albums. This is a disgrace to death metal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My First Deicide Album.","review":"And my last.

A killer tight (but loose) band playing their eclectic mix of southern rock-funk-jazz-blues with passion and playful virtuosity. There is no mistaking this band's sound, the funky groove and sinuous slide. This may not be a recording for all moods (Truck's tends to sound like he's working a large power tool when he gets warmed up), but it is great for what it is. (Look online at the Hittinthenote website to order more cheaply and easily)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This double live cd shows DTB at their finest. The band's singer, the recently added Mike Mattison, has a great voice and fits in perfectly, but the focus of the band is still on Trucks's amazing slide work. He is truly unlike any other player out there right now. This is a band that's not afraid to be creative and as a result they've done things that are truly unique. This album is an incredible bargain because it contains many new and unheard songs that you won't find on any DTB studio albums. Highlights are \\"Volunteered Slavery\\" \\"Feel So Bad\\" \\"Joyful Noise\\" and \\"So Close, So Far Away\\", but all of the songs and improvisations are played with great energy and passion.

I can't agree with those who rate the sound quality of this otherwise remarkable set. To these ears, there are too many vocals (and some flute) that sound a little off mike, and the balance between instruments is sometimes poor. Although it's not, it sounds to me like a live broadcast mix.That said, I'd walk across broken glass to see this band play.This set has a weird retail history, being touted first (I believe) as an iTunes-only release.

This product DOES NOT last the life cycle that Ricoh claims (not even close), which is why I gave it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upsetting.","review":"Maybe this game is better on Wii, but I played it on Gamecube and thought it was horrible. The game moves slowly, which isn't an egregious crime for an RPG, but something I could have done without. My main problem with the game is the horrible controls for Gamecube players. I'm referring mostly to the combat system. It never feels natural, the camera moves around in ways that make it hard to see and the aiming system doesn't work. This game felt more like a chore than fun.I miss Zelda on Super Nintendo. That, to me, is the best Zelda ever. This game just doesn't feel right."},{"rating":"1","title":"When did Zelda become lame?","review":"Graphics are bland and there is little detail in most areas. I feel things just don't flow together at all either. The story seems very choppy. I search each map extensvely and sometimes there is just nothing there at all, why bother having huge area with nothing in it. The music gets very tedious after awhile; everytime an enemy approaches you get the same annoying music. I expected a graphical and musical extravaganza, but received mediocre graphics and sound. I guess I just expected more. Dungeons are very aggrivating, until you figure out what to do. I just don't see the fun in this game and that's unfortunate since I'm a fan of the Zelda series and it feels as this game was rushed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our cube could not play the game","review":"When I bought this game my son was very excited about playing the last of the Zelda series in our Nintendo Game Cube. This game starts the introduction but a few seconds into the game, it the Cube is not able to read the CD and must re-start. It makes it so that this is the only game CD we cannot play. He was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the Zelda name.","review":"If this game was anything but a Zelda game it would be good, but its not worthy of the name. Way too much plot like a final fantasy and not enough freedom to run around, too many open spaces with nothing in them, why not put in some creatures that are fun to kill or secretes and upgrades. Being the wolf is just boring, why not just stay link, it serves no purpose, you cant use any objects as the wolf. The graphics are WAY TOO OVERRATED. They are muddy and some times you can't tell an object from the background. Why not build some art inbetween OOT and WW to stay traditional instead of something that looks like LOTR on PS2. I love the other Zelda games, but this one is not a Zelda, hope it is not a sign of things to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Zelda game ever","review":"This is the best game ever made for Gamecube.

Overall, VERY good game."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in Zelda Heaven","review":"I am absolutely loving this game. When you ride on Epona, you can actually tell that she is running really fast. The landscape I have seen so far is so vast and filled with enemies, that there is no way you would be able to walk on foot across the entire land without Epona. I also love how Midna has her sassy little comments and attitude; however, I get this strange feeling that deep down in her feelings she really is a good-hearted being. Will I get the Wii version of this game? Probably not because I don't own a Wii yet. I may rent the Wii version to try it when I eventually do get a Wii. To sum things up, if you are a Gamecube owner, a die-hard Zelda fan, and do not own a Wii yet, GET THIS GAME!!! You will not be sorry!

The final battle was boring, very unclimactic You are forced way too much into a pattern of fight against all of the enemies, especially the last guy. perhaps I've outgrown the zelda series. sad day. nevertheless I will always want to be a tree dwelling, pointed green hat wearing, sword wielding, hero!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job, Nintendo!","review":"This is excellent. I was very impressed with nintendo's extra work on this title. It really does combine many of the previous titles element, such as for example the twilight which reminds me of a Link to the Past. It also reminds me of both Ocarina of Time, and Majora's Mask. The moutain dungon, and the lakebed templefor instance. the forest temple is like Wind Waker. There are some new elements as well, like the city in the sky. To end, it is really like I am in there. I just love riding Ephona and battling the wild boars.

It has great graphics and a wonderful story-line.-julie"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite games, period.","review":"I first started playing Zelda when ocarina came out for N64 and my dad got me the game. I loved that game and still do. It's probably my favorite game of any system. However, this comes in at a close second.The graphics are spectacular against any previous Zelda game, but it is not about the graphics like some games are, which is fine with me.-- 4 1/2 /5*The sound and music extremely well done. The soundtrack is pleasing to hear on an ipod or computer by itself. I do have one small thing against it. Ocarina, Majora's Mask and Windwaker all had instruments to create all different songs, and each song had a different function. This game, not so much. You have Epona's Song with the grass, and that's it. The music puzzles were taken out of the game and I liked those.-- 3 1/2 /5*The gameplay is spectacular, and probably the best rendition yet. The horseback fighting spots are extreamly fun and addicting.-- 5/5*Replay value -- 4 1/2 /5*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Zelda Game!","review":"This is the best zelda game I have ever played, and I've played all of them.

It just doesn't leave much room for error.Buy it if you like the other Zeldas. Not for impatient players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as Ocarina of Time!","review":"The Legend of Zelda series is known for its trickery and puzzles, and this one has tons of them.First off you start off as a young farm boy in a small village. You are asked by the Mayor of your village to go to Hyrule castle and deliver a present/gift. They do this every year, it's traditional, but this year he asks Link to deliver it for him. When Link sets off with his horse, Epona, he sees that the land is filled with some sort of weird twilight, when he enters it he turns into a wolf. Midna, a short person seeking power helps Link bring the light back to the land of Hyrule.Not as good as OoT, but it's close. So in a few words: It's a great game!

The electronic handheld is good for people on the go. The docking station/board is not really that portable. It is als not very sensitive. The square has to be pushed a bit to get it to register a move when playing against the computer. Over all I would reccomend it for novices.

I don't see how. The story is very simplistic. An American is caught up in political intrigue in Spain. It smacks of a very bad James Bond plot. Some of the characters are interesting, but they are never fully developed. You are left with a sense that something is going to happen ...then it never does.

Richard Roundtree reprises his role as the tough, sexy private eye who manages to make the ladies swoon and the gangsters look for ways to eliminate him once and for all. The action scenes are good but the final chase sequence, while entertaining, drags on a bit too long and runs out of steam before the explosive ending. O.C. Smith sings the theme song but one wonders what happened to Isaac Hayes and his great vocals and instrumentals? Still, this picture is one of the best blaxploitation films that were quite the rage back in the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting if you're a fan of Stones history","review":"Though all the songs here can be found on various other Stones collections- \\"Hot Rocks\\" and \\"Forty Licks\\" to name two- this hits compilation is particularly interesting because it was the last to be conceived while original member and resident musical genius Brian Jones was still alive (\\"Darkly\\" came out in Sept.'69; he drowned in July). The cover and inner sleeve photos were taken at St. Catherine's Dock,Tower Bridge, London, and Jones, already distant from the band due to drug problems and Keith Richards stealing his girlfriend, was ordered to attend the shoot or risk being fired.

They never sound fully commited. The playing is still very good, but it lacks a certain amount of passion. The sound is very good, as expected here. I think though that this was the start of where MTT started putting too much of himself in and leaving Mahler behind. This is in full effect in the 8th. I still prefer the Barshai version with the Young German Philharmonic. Both conducter and orchestra sound fully committed there. While this MTT-SFS recording is good, it does not move to the top of the list for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Byzantium","review":"I loved this program when I first saw it on VHS. I'm so pleased to have it now on DVD. The programs, hosted by John Romer, are fascinating travelogues as well as historical investigations into the once great Byzantine Empire. Romer visits far flung outposts of the empire where tantalising evidence remains of the civilisation that once dominated much of Europe and parts of the near east.A poignant air of melancholy persists throughout the programs, as Romer finds tantalising bits and pieces of Byzantium that were carried off or reused by her conquerors, both Christian and Muslim.I've watched this series of programs many times, and always find something new in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Byzantium the Lost Empire","review":"This is one of the best documentaries ever made on the history of the East Roman (or Byzantine) Empire.John Romer is a brilliant historian and presents the material in a truly magnificent manner.

It's pricey but worth it, and from time to time turns up at very reasonable prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Byzantium, The Lost Empire","review":"This DVD provides a rather brief introduction to Byzantium. The photograpgy is good. Unfortunately the commentary by Romer occasionally is drowned-out by unnecessary loud music. A few place and name subtitles would be helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject made painfully dull!","review":"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan historical documentaries and have been to many of the sites shown in this film, but \\"Byzantium, The Lost Empire\\" is basically just hours and hours of the host (who isn't particularly charismatic) droning on and on...and then on some more. The overall impression is that it's low budget and outdated; furthermore, the picture is grainy so it isn't even visually stimulating. I can only liken it to being stuck in the classroom of my least favorite teacher in school for half a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda?","review":"This is an infuriating film. I suppose that it must have been made with the cooperation, and perhaps under the supervision, of the Turkish government: never, not once, is the term \\"Patriarch of Constantinople\\" used. Even Patriarch Gennadios, who was doomed by God to be the Patriarch when the Turks conquered Constantinople, is referred to only as a \\"Greek theologian\\"!!! I guess that the Turks insisted the proper respect not be shown him, for that would undermine their current campaign to force the Patriarchate to flee their stolen capital. The film's treatment of Orthodox theology is also very poor. Latin terms inappropriate to Orthodox ideas are used throughout, and ideas such as veneration are never distinguished from the more familiar worship. Maybe the writers assumed their audience would be at a rather low intellectual level. Still, the film should have been, could have been, much better. I give it two stars only for the visuals; turn off the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful filming, but no organization","review":"I am surprised to see so many postive reviews for this programs. It could have been so much better. I was a disappointed with Romer. He seemed to pontificate without much substance. While the filming was beautiful, I thought the progam generally lacked any structure or organization. Rather than being a good overview of the byzantine empire, it was a hodge-podge of details and anecdotes. I finished the program without any greater understanding of Byzantium than when I started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little known history - brilliantly done","review":"Mr. Romer is a wonderful historical guide and if he had been my history teacher in school I would have learned so much more than I did. He brilliantly illuminates the Byzantine empire and makes it come alive on your screen. The thing which I believe makes all of Mr. Romer's series so enjoyable and enlightening is his own sense of wonder and his ability to communicate that sense of wonder to his audience. That is what makes history (and most other subjects) so enthralling to some people while the majority find it boring and uninteresting. Please continue producing wonderful videos, Mr. Romer, and I will continue to share your sense of wonder with my family! Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!!!!!","review":"I could not wait for this DVD to arrive. Almost every review given on this site was positive. Now I must believe that all positive reviews must be from friends and relatives of Romer. This is one of the most boring documentaries I have ever watched. I was two hours into it before I finally gave up. I just could not believe something better wasn't on the horizon. I kept wondering if I had received the right DVD. The only reason to watch this documentary is if you need a really good nap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Hollywood mangling","review":"Typical Hollywood mangling of a good book.

Robert Redford did a fantastic job in bringing these works to life and has done exceptional work in bringing the Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn partnership to screen. The stories work because not only do they cast two excellent actors in Adam Beach and West Studi, who have exceptional chemistry, but the supporting casts are excellent in their own subtle ways.I would recommend this anyone who enjoys Tony Hillerman and who enjoys the history and culture of the southwest.

The acting and dialogue are of the quality seen in an elementary school play. The background music is loud and sounds like someone is playing a tape to fill in the many empty spots. The sound is so poor that it's often difficult to make out what the actors are saying, not that it matters.In the middle of the movie, we're suddenly shown new characters who come out of nowhere, have no meaning to the movie, and are not seen again after their brief appearance.I don't always expect a lot from gay themed movies, but even the worst ones I've seen are better than this.

First, the production value of this film is extremely poor. The sound is awful, and the soundtrack which never seems to end gets to be so loud at times that it drowns out the dialogue. Second, the acting is, for the most part, atrocious. I have seen junior high school productions which had better acting than this movie. Third, the plot made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Aside from the inexplicable relationship between the old man and the wealthy young guy, two people appear in the middle of the movie, hang out, make out, and then disappear--they are never tied into the movie's plot whatsoever! There are many, many excellent low budget gay films out there. I highly recommend \\"I Think I Do\\" instead of this movie.

You are supposed to hate the skinny best friend. But, the heroine is so whiney, cluelss and spineless it is hard to care about her at all. We are supposed to be proud of her-spoiler alert-because rather than have the guts to confront her best friend and tell she has turned into a self absorbed, selfish brat, she instead humiliates her in front of all the guests at her own wedding. That kind of mean, cheap shot does not seem very empowering, just nasty. The book is also not particularly well written or clever, it just seems like recycled chick lit drivel. I would skip this one.

There is not one thing that makes the least sense in this movie. Start with day one when Stallone supposedly loses hearing in one ear bashing out a car window with his head. Don't hurt yourself but try putting your head against a wall or something and even getting your ear to touch it.Keitel and buddies go around murdering any police officers who make any mistakes, presumably it tarnishes the image of their perfect community. All put together, this movie is a series of dumb actions by people who had no real motive to do such dumb things.Another stupid movie good for nothing but insulting intelligence. Another movie I am glad I only paid a quarter for, for a used VHS, and even that was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very impressive cast in a very good cop thriller","review":"Aside from Sly Stalone, this film could have been called Scorsese Land. A handful of the great director's usual actors make appearances such as DeNiro, Keitel, Liotta, and Cathy Moriarity. It is a great cast too. James Mangold's film is an impressive thriller about a sheriff in a New Jersey town full of corrupt New York cops. Stalone's performance is really good despite the weak written character. The supporting characters are great esp. Keitel's chracter who is played with a very sinister style only Keitel could do. DeNiro and Liotta are both very good too. The films seems to drag at times and the dialogue can be weak too at parts but the cast and the directing keep the film just where it should be. It is a very good film overall and should be viewed by those who enjoy good thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of stallone's best","review":"I like Cop Land because of the ensemble cast of great actors and actresses. you got your Stallone and your DeNiro and your Keitel and your Liotta and your Berg and others that really put this movie to the level it should be. Stallone I think is great in this movie, period. his career got a little down hill when he made Driven and others beyond that but you look back at his other movies like this one and Daylight, Cliffhanger and the Rocky movies and you just remember the good roles. DeNiro is always sparking the screen with his big roles and this is another for his career. Liotta is great also and he's had some fine movies as well like Narc, Unlawful Entry, Turbulence, Identity and a whole lot of others. but anyway, this one is dynamite and it explodes at you. lots of action and mystery really connect the dots and I enjoyed the ride"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blu ray transfer","review":"Cop land looks great on blu ray.This film is very underrated.I was very pleased with the picture quality of this blu ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cop Land (Director's Cut) DVD","review":"A very well-made movie with a great cast and fine score by Howard Shore.

But in this exploration of dirty cops and the small-timer who can't get where he wants in life, Stallone plays a good, solid, dramatic role as Freddy Heflin, a small town New Jersey sheriff who looks across the river at the big apple, and what he wants most in life: to become NYPD. The big problem that arises is that in his small town, there are plenty of dirty New York cops who think they can slip by the slow sheriff, but Sylvester Stallone feels that something is happening from the start. This films shows Stallone's good acting skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than you expect.","review":"I always liked this movie and when it became available on blu ray I picked it up. it was filmed in edgewater n.j. a little town just south of the George Washington bridge.

I can't comment on the quality of the audio as I listen through external speakers from my tuner which is only in stereo. The aspect ratio is 1:85:1 which I don't really like.

I enjoy short films, but this stretched my patience too far. With the exception of \\"The Job\\" each of these short films are pointless drivel.

The ending was a litle hollow for this time, but it was in keeping with the emptiness of the anti-hero Nemo. This is a strange tale revolving around not a hero and a villian, but a hero and and an anti-hero. Both men are in a sense empty, Professer Anarax has spent his studing the world, but not living in it. Captain Nemo has lost everything that gave his life mean, and in the end he discovers that even revenage is meaningless there by losing his will to live. The professer abosorbed by all that he has seen and experianced now has a reason to live. And so he now tell the world the wonders of the seas. A fun read, it is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adventure","review":"I had always heard this was a good book and it did not disappoint.

Fogg is an English man who is very calm, generous, kind hearted, and precise. He is a man who never rushes, and always on track. Even though, the journey might seem impossible for him, but he is full of confident that he will make it in eighty days.The journey was full of excitements and problems. The main problem is that Mr. Fix suspects that Fogg is a bank robber and tries to stop him during the journey. Throughout the story, Mr. Fix tries to get help from Passé partout who treat him opium and alcohol. Which caused the relations between Fix and Passé partout went bad. However, there's a twist that Mr. Fix decided to help Fogg out after he rescued Passé partout from the Indians.I think the ending of the book is kind of peaceful and amusing.

Phileas Fog is a very precise man and hates unpreciseness. He takes along his newly hired \\"servant\\" along with him for the journey. The story is full of there travels and bumps along the way. So do they make it. Well you will have to read it and find out wont you.Well I have to say this is definately not one of my favorites and will not read it again in my near future. This book is crammed full of detail you dont need! You could skip all the detail and you'd be fine on they story line. I found it really hard to read because the details made it boring for me so I had no desire to pick this book and read it they way other books make me do. I wouldn't recomend it to anybody however amidst the detail the story line and plot is pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Around the World in 80 Days","review":"I found this audio book very boring.

I still enjoyed reading the book as much as I did before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Around The World In Eighty Days","review":"This book was pretty good. The main characters, Phileas Fogg and his servant Passepourt make a wager of twenty thousand pound that they can travel around the world in eighty days. Along the way, they have to travel as fast as they can while somehow they have some crazy adventures. Such as meeting a beautiful indian princess, they get arrested because they look like a thief that a detective has been looking for, and all sorts of crazy stuff.

I never read it as a child and had only seen it on tv or in class or something. But I seem to remember something on the cover of the movie about them in a hot air balloon. I have avoided this book. I did not want to read it. No interest what so ever. But then I started to read other Verne books and really like the way he writes. More, I like the detail that he provides. So... there is THIS book. I went into it quite hesitant. It did not take but a few minutes and I was in this fun little world for the next few days. If you are a JV fan, then you will enjoy this book.For the uninitiated, don't worry, there is no silliness about floating off in a balloon. It is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Classic","review":"I read this book several years ago in middle school and decided to read it again.

This is a \\"classic\\"? Everything is viewed from afar. Verne never let me feel as though I were right there. There is almost no dialogue, and even the action is related as though it were second-hand. Although I didn't expect it to be in Jane Austen's league, from its reputation I was hoping for something in the range of Stevenson, Tolkien, and Wells. It's not. This sort of storytelling is more of the Edgar Rice Burroughs or Stephen King variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 year old likes this","review":"My son (6) got this as a gift but his 3 year old sister prefers it for the game to find Pal.

Greer Garson and all of the other stars are really wonderful in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay! The X-wing series lives!","review":"Yes! I knew the X-wing series wouldn't die! I was so pleased when I found this book, I laughed hysterically and got some very strange looks from other library-users. I love all the characters, with maybe the exception of Myn Donos. I like him, but he bugs me. I can't explain it. Oh, I just love what you've done with Janson! I liked him the first time I saw tESB, I know I just love him! This book totally rules, and I'm giving it a six out of five even though this stupid computer says I can't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books in this series.","review":"Although this book only features Rogue Squadron in the beginning, I completely forgot about them as I continued reading throughout the whole book. The way that the pilots deceived the Admiral and the Warlord was the best kind of trickery I have ever seen. I was impressed by what they did and I admire the way that they did it.I can't wait to get book #6 and pick up the story where it left off. This book is a must for any Star Wars fans who like this kind of stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yub, yub, Commander!","review":"For all those people who though Corran Horn was two steps away from attaining God-hood.

NOTHING went wrong(okay maybe a couple things went wrong)!I am So #!%#^$@* sick of female New Republic HUSSIES, who go there to spy!!!! One good thing, YUB YUB commander! \`"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been better if not for the first four.","review":"Although Aaron Allston did a good job on this book, It wasn't even close to the quality of Stackpole's first four. Throughout the novel I constantly compared Stackpole's writing style to Allston's and, as a consequence, found myself missing Corran, Tycho, Mirax, and Stackpole's much broader vocabulary (Including his ability never to have the word \\"said\\" appear in his novels) Although I realized different authors shouldn't be compared in such ways, I guess I couldn't help it. So, if you don't mind making the transition from Rogues to Wraiths or from Stackpole to Allston, you'll have no trouble with this book. However, if different authors taking over have annoyed you in the past,(ex. KJA for BH in Darksaber,) you might want to skip to I, Jedi right now while you're waiting for the 8th X-Wing book.(which is going to be written by Stackpole)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty typical X-Wing series stuff.","review":"This book is not all that good. There are still some serious problems with the number of characters involved, and the characteristics of the ships. Some of the tactics are a little questionable, and some of the jokes are a little lame. The plot was pretty weak, which is characteristic of the series as a whole. I would rather have the Jedi Academy Trilogy instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book overall","review":"This book was OK. The Imperials are kinda dumb , and Admiral Trigit , called at the back of the book , \\"the Empire's master of guile and deception\\" is a complete idiot. Also Warlord Zsinj is depected as having only his SSD Iron Fist , while in Courtship he had allot more warships. overall a good read and explains how the New Republic managed to catch Zsinj."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wraith Squadron is the best i've read so far","review":"This a great book. Action filled as well as a couple love scenes. The plot is very original. It's basically about Wedge Antilles trying to start up a of commando's flying X-wings. Most of the pilots are washed out. The 3 main stars are Wedge, Wes Janson, Wedge's scond-in-command, and Kell Tainer, a former commando. Kell thinks he's in love with one of the other pilots, Tryia. Well you read it yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not quite like Stackpole though","review":"This takes place shortly after The Bacta War. Wedge is setting up a new X-wing squadron, that is instead of Pilots that have commando capability, this squadron is comprised entirely of commandos that have pilot capability (they still do more flying than commando things, but act more as commandos. This is a really good book, if you can get over the fact that Wedge is the only person on this squadron that was mentioned in the previous four books. I think Mr. Allston showed a greater sense of humor and jovialness within his book, as opposed to Mr. Stackpole's subtle jokes. He also explores the trauma of being a pilot- losing friends in battle, and the mental struggles to overcome that. This is really a good book, and at 403 pages lasts a little longer than most Star Wars books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? Stackpole why did you leave us?","review":"This book is an insult. I read the first four because I love space combat. When I found out that Aaron Allston wrote the next one, I bought it and read it anyway, hoping for the best. BAH! He uses far to much slapstick humor, and everyone is a bad pilot(he makes Wedge seem like one!)Wes Janson was funny, however.(everyone else thinks they're funny, but really not)He did have fairly good characterization, but Stackpole's eighth book was an incredible relief. Allston came right back around and insulted Wedge Antilles with the ninth book, but at least I could get through that one. The Rogues could beat the Wraiths hands-down--in the air OR on the ground(where the Wraiths are supposed to be really good)If you're reading through the series, read it, but otherwise STAY AWAY!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn, It's had to say who you love more, Rouges or Wraiths!","review":"This has got to be one of the best Star Wars books to date. I first thought the X Wing series couldn't be topped. I was wrong! This was the first Star Wars book with a well written ending that tied up everything, read well and still left room for the next installment! Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss Rogue Squadron","review":"This book was alright but Wraith Squadron can't compare with Rogue Squadron. A few of the characters were ok like Face and Grinder, but they just don't compare to Gavin,Corran and Mirax. Please come back Rogues!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Star Wars books I've read","review":"Wraith Squadron is definitely one of the greatest Star Wars books I've had the pleasure to read. I think that this book does for Star Wars what Ghostbusters did for the Horror genre. In other words, it is kind of a parody, but it still falls under the classification of Star Wars. One of the things I like about this book is that I can really identify with some of the characters. And I know people that are just like other characters. I know that Kell Tainer is supposed to be the \\"hero\\" of the book, but my favorite character is Face. Oh, and to the reviewer who said there is \\"too much\\" humor in this book, let me just say that there is no such thing as \\"too much\\" humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tradition of great X-Wing books is carried on","review":"This book greatly deserves the name X-Wing. It has even more action (if that's possible) than the previous books by Michael A. Stackpole. I think it was great thanks to a new addition, humor. The only problem is that the second primary charecter, Kell Tainer, is annoying, and not someone you will enjoy as much as Corran Horn. All in all it was a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"YUB YUB\\" THIS BOOK WAS HILARIOUS!!","review":"This book was the funniest book that I've ever read. Ton and Face are a great comedy duo. This book has a lot of action, and unlike Rogue Squadron, the pilots aren't serious all the time. There are so many pranks in this book. The little undercover operation they are doing is also really good, especially when they face off against the Implacable."},{"rating":"2","title":"It combines a love story with action and some drama!!","review":"It's an excellent book for young readers that like adventuresome books. Or even a person who enjoys a good story line. I would recomend this book for any star wars fans. Even if your not a star wars fan now you will be after reading this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One great book for all starwars fans to read","review":"I am a great Star Wars fan and i can tell you now that this book is worthy of the name of Star Wars. When I saw that the new X-Wing book wasn't about the Rogue Squadron characters I took it as an automatic downside. But now that i have read it, I think It is one of the best books I have ever read. The story line is so good, so intense and is action packed right to the rim that I am hanging out for the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The M*A*S*H of Star Wars!","review":"I won't bother to compare this book to the Stackpole cycle, except to say that it blows it away in every category.This book is, to quote a previous reviewer, \\"a novel about people in war, not just war\\", which is how so many Star Wars novels strike me. In all of the novels from Zahn's Thrawn trilogy to Stackpole's Rogue Squadron cycle, I have never been so attatched to the characters as I am in Allston's Wraith Squadron trilogy.Overall, the best comparison I can give is to say that Allston's trilogy is like the M*A*S*H of Star Wars; the characters have life, depth, and personality, with conflicts and friendships forming every step of the way. They aren't superhuman, invincible and emotionally distant like so many other characters. Again, this is \\"a novel about people in war, not just war\\", and as such WILL make you laugh, cry, and occasionally cheer out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and funny. A must-read for X-wing fans.","review":"In the original four books from the X-Wing series we got a fresh story with completely new characters to whom we soon felt attached. Wraith Squadron continues that tradition by presenting us an unusual group of upstarts who have to battle their own personal problems at the same time they help in the fight against the Empire, proving their true worth. Being a silly guy myself, I especially loved the duo of Ton Phanan and Face. Don't overlook this book, you'll find yourself laughing and maybe even feeling a knot forming in your throat as you enjoy this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"the book i've been searching for","review":"besides the excellent history and care sections, this wonderful little book has great photos of pieced and applique quilts made in the 30s and the templates and instructions for them.most of the quilting books i've found that claim to present 30s designs offer traditional 19th century blocks made with feed sack prints or simplified 30s blocks that lack the true 30s character. some of the designs in this book are challenging to sew but many quilters like a challenge.i would recommend this book to any quilter. it's a great value for the price and better than many more expensive books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quilt Designs from the Thirties","review":"I was very disappointed in the book.

I ordered it right away, and received the usual good Amazon service, and quick, free shipping, and have not been disappointed. Gregory Peck is one of best actors, and makes the movie, playing the bad guy this time, instead of his usual hero role. I can personally recommend this movie, going against a number of the negative reviews that are posted here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth seeing...sort of","review":"Jennifer Jones was absolutely gorgeous. Beyond that, this film is...well, kinda hard to watch. Gregory Peck's character, \\"Lewt\\" (or \\"Lewd,\\" IMO), is suitably repulsive...the plot is weak...Miss Jones overacts painfully, contorting all over the screen...Joseph Cotton appears tranquilized (or perhaps alcoholized, which is understandable, considering what he had to work with here), the script is at times unbearably corny...one longs for someone to put Barrymore out of his (and our) misery...in fact, it's hard to come up with much of redeemable value...I derived some masochistic enjoyment from it and spent much time with my mouth hanging open in disbelief at the campy awfulness of it all.I was grateful when it ended, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is HARDCORE!","review":"This ain't no Sepultura wannabe, I dont' care what some 12 year old who don't know nothin' about nothin' has to say!

I picked it up cause of the great reviews. Its ok, the lyrics are a bit weak, the only real good riff in the album last about 6 seconds and is written by agnostic front. It has grown on me slightly over the last year, but in the end it's still weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"RE: GREAT NYHC RELEASE","review":"Great album! Ferocious enough to kick you hard in the nuts once you press play on your cd player. This in my opinion only, is the last great old-school Madball re-lease. If Metal-core is your bag, check the newer stuff. If insane psychopathic angry old-school hardcore is your thing, check this, Ball of Destruction, and Droppin' Many Suckers out. You won't be dissapointed!! The only negative is the hip hop sounding Down By Law...sorry can't do the hip hop and hardcore mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliverance and Healing Go Together for Optimum Health","review":"This book looks at attachments of darkness, spirits, and how they suppress the body and mind. There is good and powerful information here. I have read many books on the subject, and have been trying to fit in where alternative medicine and these \\"things\\" that I know fit together. If you want to go even further, about where these things come from, and more precise methods to \\"dis-attach\\" them, pick up Dr. Snow's book on alternative medicine, hands on healing and prayer power, called The Power of Divine, a Healer's Guide on Miracles. The changes that occur often include \\"undiagnosisable\\" medical and emotional problems disappearing. Jesus did also - deliverance right along side healing. Many of the illnesses that conventional medicine can't get rid of are actually demon infestation. Read these books, and keep learning where ever you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome guide","review":"This was a great guide for those of us with deliverance ministries. So much so that I found a place in myself that was unrepentant and required healing. It has helped me in my ministry and assisted me in going to the next level.

Yes, it is as good as everyone says it is. LOA evolved musically with their later work, but this is where it started.

From the stack of years between now and then, I can see where this album is where he really found his voice, moved a little past \\"gosh I'm tryin' for country\\" and made Americana Music his own. His lyrics are funny, quirky, sometimes unsettling, and speak truely. \\"Corpus Christi Bay\\" is one of my deep all-time favorites, and \\"Paint The Town Beige\\"...well, anyone of a certain age can appreciate what he's saying.His voice is a little raw, a little not-perfect, just like you and me.

It is unfortunate to find so popular a writer as Ms. Johnson mocking the efforts of Dottie, the feminist writer in the novel, as if Ms. Johnson had no idea of the extent and variety of difficulty feminists have had in trying to get their work staged. It seems that males are given license to treat women's writing as if it were unimportant because writers like Pamela Hansford Johnson mock women writers. It is probably not a very important loss, however, because she writes rather poorly and has little story to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, sucky cd.","review":"Just got this CD not knowing what i was getting into.

Some of the photos reveal stuff you would never have thought of? Why a picture of a pushup or a neckroll. I am a USPTA tennis pro (from Bollettieri's in Florida) and some of the exercises in this book are not tennis specific. Here's the big problem: Exercises with weights can often cause erratic stroking. Too many bicep curls, for example, often cause an upward swing forward. Remember: You only have 17 degrees left/right before you hit wide shots. Dumbell fly's can cause you to hit too far forward, which for right handers will pull the ball wide on the left when it crosses the net. I was annoyed at: NO index.

Perhaps, too, there is something about her personality which is infectious, which doesn't quite come across in her writing.

Only by pointing out injustices can things be made right, and this book should help with remembering the past and ensuring it never happens again.

For people out there searching for real emotional content in their music, I suggest they give bands like Joy Division or The Chills a good listen.

This \\"notorious\\" album pales horribly to associate with the bands inevitable growth.

The vocals though, play a large hand in ruining anything this album had. Yes, yes, it's not just the fact that it's your typical death yips, but also that they sound really, really forced and repetitive -I don't know who can sit through more than the first few tracks. It's as if he lost his voice, but they went ahead anyway ...and, man, must have been burned out by then end of the whole ordeal. Not only this, but the lack of variation in the vocals seems to have somehow lured the rest of the music into the same dulling-down pattern..?As an instrumental album, this would have scored better...with a dynamic vocalist, this could have (dreamingly) been something pretty good. Because I've liked some of the ideas of Chuck Schuldiner, I'll give this more than one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece of melodic death metal","review":"If you like melodic but powerful music, you have to buy this cd, this is excellent...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical death metal","review":"I picked up this cd, only hearing of Death. I have to say, i was suprised by what i heard. I had expected your typical death metal. But what i found was something very different. It seems to have a progressive feel to it. All the instruments can be heard well (even the bass, which is uncommon in death metal). Ive heard people call this 'technical death metal', and i can see why. The music is seemingly very technical. The guitar solos' sound as if Chuck is tearing out is very soul and placing it on a fretboard. I will never tire of this album. RIP Chuck Schuldiner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Birth Of Death Metal","review":"Chuckj Schuldiner is the man. I recently read an article about him in Decibel where all the crazy line-ups in Death talk about Chuck. He just wrote lyrics like this because that was how his life was to him. This album is the height of their progressive music. Every song is layered by Gene Hoglan with a sick drum part, especially the jazzy intro on the title track. Crystal Mountain is a classic song, and every song has a distinct part that makes it its own. Losing Chuck was a horror to the metal world, but luckily the music is still here for us to enjoy and play.

Now if you come across this book at a book consignment shop, yard sale, or a book discount sale, then definately get it. I would not spend over $5 on this book. Also I didn't like reading a warning on every page to make sure that I didn't delete any important information or practice with a disk that might have info I would want to keep. Well DUH! I have a little more common sense than that! The warnings make up, no kidding, about 10 pages of a 104 page book.In summary, save your money for a book that you can use with today's operating systems. This book did not even mention Win.'98.

There's a rougher, harder edge to him on this album.There were a couple of songs that were good, but definitely not in the Pharcyde-style of music. It sounds like a completely different artist.

This was a piece of fluff that superficially touched upon select aspects of the book, leaving the vast majority of the subject completely unexplored. There were a few interesting things included, but nothing was covered sufficiently. When it was over, I had the feeling that I had just watched a trailer, instead of the whole video.

The great GWTW producer reportedly spent more on \\"Portrait of Jennie' than he did for Gone With the Wind. He demanded countless takes, re-shoots, at one time starting to refilm the movie in technicolor, then opting for that final, surreal shot of the actual portrait in stunning color. This is a glorious \\"mood' movie--filmed in lush silvers, shadows, charcoal with a power ambience of the supernatural. Selznick interfered so much in the script writing and revisions that none of the cast knew what was going on story-wise. The uncut version ran as long as GWTW. What's crazy is that \\"Portrait\\" was supposed to be a \\"modest\\" little film. But like everything Selzick touched after GWTW, it mushroomed out of proportions.

This is as much the story of the survival of the space held so dear for so many decades to a nation as it is a study of the collapse of Communism and a candid look at the life and work of Valery Gergiev, the Mariinsky's artistic director, a mighty, magical maestro whose life is populated with artists, politicians, financiers and socialites.

Theoretical knowledge is the only thing that billionaire Charles Morse has to go on about living in the wild, and when he is stranded in the woods with a fashion photographer, Bob, who has had hunting experience, it's a great show to see Anthony Hopkins remain calm and intellectual while Alec Baldwin constantly cuts his throat (figuratively speaking) and freaks out. Hopkins shows in this film that if you are smart and you think, you can pretty much work your way out of any situation; that, and if you look where you're going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Adventure Film","review":"I don't really like outdoor adventure movies very much but have to say that The Edge is quite powerful. A more of a good guy role for Anthony Hopkins to play since he usually plays just the opposite, at least from the movies I have seen him in. It should keep your attention well from the beginning to the end and maybe even touch you personally or make your emotions run some.

After a plane crash the main characters are forced to find a way to survive in the wilderness as they make their way back to civilization.

Alec Balwyn and Anthony Hopkins, adversaries for the same woman, render splendid life/death performances. And the Kodiak beak? He deserves an Academy Award nomination, I believe.

The instant download from Amazon which I streamed through my Blu-Ray player while waiting for the disc to show up had better colors, but not picture.I've come to expect better quality and more features with Blu-ray although that is not always the case as The Edge proves.3 stars would make it average.

But the grizzly isn't the only danger. Hopkins has a pretty, model wife that seems to have become an obsession of her photographer (Alec Baldwin).

At the very end of the Blu-ray version, immediately prior to the credits, the close-up of Anthony Hopkin's face fades to black prematurely. It robs the ending of some emotional resonance, since originally, the camera lingered on his sadness for a few seconds longer.

Unfortunately, that promising start went nowhere. Next thing I knew, THE EDGE leaves Elle behind as Anthony and Alec get chased through the forest by a kodiak bear, who, I might add, proves smarter than the average bear. (They should have brought a picnic basket.) Anyway, I kept waiting for THE EDGE to get back to the human drama with which it began so well, but it never did.

Wits. Remember those little cells, gray in hue, perfect in a pinch? As written by playwright David Mamet, The Edge comes across as a slightly goofy Jack London story, where jet-setters and shallow business types take the place of grizzled codgers and naive hikers.

I guess if you count the dialog, which ends up being quite funny, you've got an average bad movie.

As often is the case with the works of Henry James it is an exegesis on how people use other people. Often times it isn't exactly clear who is using whom more. The Aspern Papers is an excellent introduction to Henry James for those first approaching The Master's work. It is a novella, approximately 100 pages in length. The writing style is elegant and clear, unlike his style in later works like \\"The Wings of the Dove\\" and \\"The Golden Bowl\\" which tend to be convoluted and vague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Venice in a Different Time","review":"I found this story/novella to be a real page turner. In my busy life I am ashamed to say that I can not seem to get through many longer books, but this was just the right size to provide an escape for an evening. James writing style is wonderfully evocative of a different time and place. The reader is transported to Venice in the 19th century where he meets, and becomes quite intimate with reclusive characters of former renown. The story provides a good deal of tension and suspense as the main character tries to manipulate his hosts to get what he wants - the Aspern Papers.

In essences, the male narrator wants to steal the text of this woman's life while exerting control over the woman's identity by constructing the text as narrator. One gets the sense that James is not aware of the sexism in his writing (he always uses the language of patriarchy), but the sufferings of women at the hands of such males makes an interesting (and telling) story of oppresion of women in the 19th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite episode","review":"This is my favorite episode from this show.

These things don't work with deaf rodents. Since the rodents lived near a munitions factory and bombing range, most, if not all, had lost the use of their hearing. They would infest the barn I slept in, often biting or nibbling me during the night.Rodents are especially problematic during the hot, sticky summer months, as they breed like rats. They carry fleas (often with plague), urinate and defecate on food crops and are a nuisance.The traditional Russian method is to sleep with a hammer but with so many rodents, it's impossible (and tiring) to kill them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rob Halford is Judas Priest and he is back with a vengeance!","review":"After being a Priest fan for 20 some odd years myself. I am glad to say that the Priest is Back once again like the days of old. Halford \\"Resurrection\\" showcases the talents that have been sorely missed during the years of JP substitute vocalists. After leaving Screaming, Rob Halford is back with a Vengeance showing us that he still has the sounds and range of yesteryear. This is the best album I have heard in Y2K. The bonus tracks are awesome songs that should have been on the domestic release. Every metal afficianado should own this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This 2 pack game is a great value.

The fact that this was made by Universal but then sold to PRC because the new owners of the studio didn't want to be associated with films like this is plainly evident from the sheer look of the film, as well as the list of names in the opening credits. One example: Makeup by Jack Pierce. (Of course, within a year or two, he would be kicked out of Universal-International just as this film was.) Rondo Hatton's tragic personal story lends a sad aura to this production. He was very much a \\"used\\" person who comes across as a sweet, kind man who was dealt a terrible hand by Fate. The film isn't a horror film in the usual sense of the word, but is perhaps, as a result, the most horrible film Universal ever made. Very sad, very moving, beautifully acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic album for anyone into hardcore/pop punk","review":"Even 10 years after its release No Reward is still a classic.

BTJ stood out among the punk/hc genre at the time by doing it differently than most others, and doing it well.Merska, get your facts straight. This band came from the breakup of Token Entry but was never meant to be another Token Entry.

WHITE HORSE INN belongs to a group of late Viennese operettas that attempted to combat the popularity of American jazz and musical comedy by intermingling these styles with traditional operetta music in their works. What results is uneven in quality but always charming and at times a little bizarre. Think of it as Irving Berlin meets Franz Lehar. The orchestrations used on this cd are very different from two recordings of highlights of WHITE HORSE INN I have (Benatzky did not orchestrate his own music) and a bit more traditional than is usually heard. I should also add that the singers are first-rate (as with all of the EMI Viennese operetta recordings) and the dialogue is thankfully kept to a minimum. Overall this is a fun if not particularly operatic light opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Davies' humour at its best","review":"The great aspect about Davies' triogies is that each component is a stand alone novel. I read Leaven of Malice and simply enjoyed it! Davies being an editor and publisher, writes with material from experience in the editing buisness. Davies stays true to a Canadian based setting and Canadian characters. He also suggests a dignified proper tone to the book through his diction. It is amusing how these proper characters can act so immature (in their dignified way) and provide so much entertainment to the reader. Davies has the art down of conveying believable characters who do and say outrageous things, and at the same time creates characters that are used in the form of satire. This book is #2 on my list after Fifth Business...this one is a definite read. You will get a lot out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unraveling Loose Ends","review":"Book 2 of the Salterton Trilogy. Following up on loose ends from Tempest-Tost, and immediately beginning to unravel even more.

It is a compelling comparison and worth reading. I didn't know much about the Titanic sinking to begin with, so the book was very edifying from that viewpoint. The warnings to the modern church also seem very applicable. For a person not in leadership, it should serve as a warning that each person is individually responsible before God to study His Word and learn what God says rather than depending on leaders to do it for you. For an ecclesiastical leader, it is rather cutting. However, leaders do have more responsiblility and therefore should be held accountable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christ Community Classic","review":"About two years ago, when I first started going to Pastor Sabella's Church ([....]), I took the interest of \\"checking out\\" the friendly mustached fellow.

It is true that many Adventists may follow a vegetarian diet, may not wear jewelry, etc but that does not mean they think they are working their way into Heaven. All those things are just ways they try to be righteous.Secondly, the church does not think that Ellen White is the final authority on doctrine. She herself said to look to the Bible for the final authority and that she is a \\"lesser light\\" than the Bible.So, this book does not expose a cult, it exposes that the author is a liar.

If he truly believes in the principles that he says, he would never have taken it upon himself to write a book like this. I have been a SDA all my life and while there are some people who behave in the way that Mr. Slattery says, that is not the experience that I have had with a majority of the church. I also feel offended as to how he assumes that he can tell me what I supposedly believe.

I spent a lot of time and made numerous calls to HP's tech support with no avail. They finally agreed to send a replacement unit.The replacement unit came in and had the exact same issue. I called customer service again and literally had to argue for an hour to get someone to agree that sending another of the same model to me would probably not be satisfactory.

The printer (with the additional color cartridge) actually prints my photos much, much better than the VERY expensive printers in the darkroom.This printer's dpi is as high as any all-in-one printer under $600.

Two chat sessions and several hours on the phone with HP didn't solve the problem. It took 4 (FOUR!!!) more calls before they agreed to send me another installation CD-Rom (for which HP was going to charge me...) and guess what, it's still not working. So now I have to return it, which means a) more of my own money spent, b) all the time I put into making it work is wasted, and c) I still don't have a printer!

This series is mediocre in many regards - Bruce Wayne comes across as a weak, forgettable character, and the villains are nothing to write home about (although I did like the fact that they re-designed many of them, they just don't seem to work in any regard).

Please parents (and kids) go buy those dvds (or superman the animated series, or justice league, or batman beyond, or x-men, or even teen titans) instead of wasting your money on this crapola."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic Saturday Morning Fare","review":"If you're looking for something groundbreaking like B:TAS or \\"The New Batman Adventures,\\" you'll have to look elsewhere. \\"The Batman\\" is nothing new. In fact, it's the kind of Saturday morning show you might have seen in the late-80's. This re-imagining abandons many if not all of the conventions that made the other animated shows great. No longer are the villains multi-layered and complex; rather they are the standard cardboard cutouts that exist solely for the purpose of fighting the hero. Further, Batman mythos mainstay James Gordon is abandoned in favor of two \\"hipper\\" more \\"kid-friendly\\" replacements that serve the same function. On the plus side, the animation is good; but it is still not enough to make up for the series' shortcomings. I understand the second season was better, but if so, they must have made some major changes. All in all, a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This show is horrible.","review":"Batman is supposed to be the dark knight. This show reminds me of the Batman movies of the 90's which made batman \\"happier\\" and more \\"friendlier\\". The dialog is also lacking for this show as well. Plus I don't buy the excuse that the reason that this show is dumbed down is because its for kids. The original batman cartoon had just as many toys and had just as many kids watching it and still managed to pull off excellent characterization, intelligent dialog and a great story. You actually felt for the characters. Plus, you don't need to have seen the original animated series or even be a fan to see that 1.)this show is plagued with horrible dialog. 2.) batman is mis-characterized and 3.) that theres absolutely no depth to this series or any of the characters. Just my 2 cents on this show, but go ahead and watch the show and make your own judgement."},{"rating":"1","title":"KIDS HATE THIS SHOW!","review":"This version of Batman is for morons! My 12 years old cousin came to my house to stay in Christmas week. He told me that he watch this miserable show on TV. He told me about the atrocities that criminal producer Sam made with Batman.I told him that I have Batman cartoons in my DVD stand and he told me he wanted to watch it. Immediately, I picked up my two seasons of the 90's Batman TAS serie and my four animated movies for him to watch. So I put him to watch the first season of Batman TAS. And guess what? He LOVED IT! He also told me he wanted a copy! He told me as we was watching \\"Uncle, I like this cartoons more than the ones on TV\\".Do yourself a favor: avoid like the plague this DVD and buy a Scooby Doo cartoon for your kid, instead of this. He will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the 1990's series","review":"No cartoon will ever come close to the Batman 1990's series (this is coming from a fan of Spider-Man and the X-Men). That cartoon had many adult themes and excellent plots. This cartoon, like many other remakes, was dumbed down for Generation Y. Instead of the complicated machinations that were present in the 1990's series, every episode consists of Batman stopping a villain from his lame, predictable scheme. Even the intro theme song sucks. However, there are some watchable episodes in this series (especially in the later seasons). I liked the Batman-Superman team up (when all else fails, that's a good way to get ratings). In conclusion, this is not the worst cartoon ever, but the 1990's series puts this to shame. And why does the Joker look like Bob Marley?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No jokes from the Joker","review":"This is the worst version of Batman that I have seen lo these many years.

For the most part, all of the songs anre highly soulfull (with the exception of the fun song \\"Number One Camera\\").

And out of the ones that I seemed eligible for, many came back with no forwarding address. While online searches are a good idea in theory, it doesn't work if the information isn't updated. I found this book much more useful. I was able to look up in the index what I qualified for, and only one place I wrote to came back as a wrong address.

The better performers make more decisions, ask more \\"why\\" questions and dig deeper in their analyses. They also tend not to blame others and they test their hypotheses. In addition, they stress thinking over action. They also understand the world is made up of innumerable interrelated subsystems and approach tasks with a systems mindset.

Caleb Carr's new novel is, however, a crushing bore--a thrill-less Holmes thriller, if you will. There is tons of TALKING and very little ACTION. Well, you get the picture. The first 100 pages are background material. And Carr's prose is so dense and convoluted; I'm really having trouble concentrating on the story, it's so dry and wordy. (And you've got to giggle at the author's \\"poseur\\" photo on the back cover, replete with a bad '90s-grunge look...and a shotgun!)There are many other authors who have taken the Sherlock Holmes' stories to new heights. I highly recommend Laurie R. King's series. They're amazing. \\"The Italian Secretary,\\" however, is a waste of good reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Holmes of Conan Doyle","review":"This book was extremely disappointing. Holmes' famous ability to make deductions based on observation is almost totally absent. The few attempts are ludicrous. See particularly the mystery of Queen Victorias's tooth extraction and the \\"observations\\" leading to the identification of the plainclothes military escort. The plot was ridiculous. The villian(s) shallow and poorly developed. The detection leading to the identification of the villians poorly developed. The supernatural aspect(s) of the novel did not work. I admire the previous work of Caleb Carr. This one astonished me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than expected","review":"I was an avid fan of Carr's Alienist and Angel of Darkness.

With little or no dramatic tension, even this short novel felt like an unending tome. Carr does an excellent job recreating the time period, but the character development is flat. In the end, you simply don't care if the characters live or die, let alone who is the guilty party. Please - back to the Alienist and the drama within!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Sherlock Holmes Mystery","review":"Not many authors have the talent to follow in Conan Doyle's footprints, but Caleb Carr does a fine job. Written in classic Conan Doyle form but with enough of Caleb Carr's style shining through, it follows a mystery which is centered around David Rizzio's 1566 murder and possible ghost(?) in Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. It was a bit dry at first but once it got going I was swept into the plot. How can you not like a mystery set in a castle in Scotland?

You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass This One By","review":"'The Italian Secretary' is the latest big-name pastiche in the world of Sherlock Holmes. Unfortunately, it is not very good.Carr's writing style is ponderous and his sentences and paragraphs are wordy. This tale originally started out as a short story for inclusion in 'Ghosts in Baker Street' and the author turned into a seperate novel.It was a poor decision. There is barely enough substance to make a novella, and it certainly is thin for a novel. The plot is rather simple, with Holmes' belief in ghosts flying in the face of the original Doyle character. There is nothing about this book that makes it stand out from the glut of Holmes tales on the market.There are much better pastiches out there, such as books by Richard Boyer, Larry Millett and Frank Thomas. I doubt I will ever take this one off the bookshelf again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Carr that I love?","review":"I loved the Alienist and Angel of Darkness. I love novelsabout Sherlock Holmes e.g. The Beekeeper's Apprentice. ButCarr managed to disappoint me on two levels. While this wasa novel about Sherlock Holmes, it was so boring to me.

I was not disappointed. The book is fast paced, witty, and suspenseful. Other Customer critics appear to have read the book with a prejudice. This is not, nor does it claim to be, a book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. And Caleb Carr did not write the book in the same formula as he wrote The Alienist or The Angel of Darkness. But it was done very well. I look forward to reading further adventures if Caleb writes them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Sherlock Holmes We Know and Love","review":"There are a few people who have been able to match the genius of Arthur Conan Doyle when trying to write Sherlock Holmes books. Sadly Caleb Carr is not one of them. His portrayals of Sherlock Holmes, Mycroft Holmes and Dr. Watson are far wordier than any of the characters ever were in the book, and their protracted conversations are too complicated (and boring) to follow.I quit the book about halfway through as it was not holding my interest. Because I wanted to give Carr credit for at least trying a different character than the one he made famous in The Alienist, I'm giving this two points instead of one, but if you want to read a Sherlock Holmes story, pull out your Arthur Conan Doyle books and read from the pen of the master."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly boring","review":"I'm a Conan Doyle fan and found The Alienist to be a pretty good read, so I made the unfortunate mistake of buying this book in softcover without taking a gander inside. Carr seems to think he can ride his reputation for 316 pages without putting much thought into whether anyone along for the trip will get some enjoyment out of it. The dialogue is flat, the plot uncompelling and Carr relies on the near-endless use of exclamation points to inject some excitement!!! into this tale, which left me skipping pages at a time as it neared its conclusion because I couldn't bear to read the mangled sentences. This book has no climax -- just, thankfully, an ending. Spend your money on something worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"The Italian Secretary has a silly premise, gee whiz language, and it turns Holmes and Watson into cartoon characters. The book reads like the fever dream of a teenager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing and boring.","review":"Caleb Carr tries very hard in this book to have the reader believe that the game is afoot with Holmes and Watson, but there is only one Conan Doyle and this book is a longwinded flop. Holmes believing in and seeing ghosts - total nonsense. Watson comes across as a thick witted dill and Holmes as a boring, arrogant know all who loves to instigate sibling rivalry with his poor brother Mycroft who is portrayed as an intellectual hillbilly when compared to Sherlock. The plot is poorly developed and the book seems to drift in an aimless and sterile prose.I recommend A Slight Trick of the Mind by Mitch Cullen which is about the great Holmes in the winter of his life to any reader who would like to read more about the man post Conan Doyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"\\"The Italian Secretary\\" is a failure both as a novel and a pastiche.Carr's attempt to capture the flavor of Doyle's prose flounders amid a flood of long-winded and boring verbiage.Holmes himself comes across as an arrogant, insensitive know-it-all while poor Watson is reduced to an obsequious, thick-headed toadie.There is no real depth to any other characters, who come and go like cardboard cut-outs.The story starts out at a snail's pace and doesn't really get going until about half way through.At that point the author makes it fairly obvious who the true culprit is, making the rest of the tale rather anticlimactic.In the hands of a less floridly verbose author this might have made a good short story.As it is, it is a struggle to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong on atmosphere short on substance","review":"I just finished this novel and I have to say it was not as good as I thought it would be. Caleb Carr takes the Holmes novels and puts his own spin on recreating a new adventure. For Caleb his writing style is both intricate and deft, but that was all. The Mystery was neither hard to crack or exciting. This is a novel dealing with the residence of the Queen of Scots in the 1870's, Holmes and Watson are summoned to solve to murders and along the way we find out clues and interesting characters as to why the murders occurred, even thought he novel was short is seemed endless. I know many people will like the Holmes atmosphere which this novel is strong with, but I just didn't think there was enough here to satisfy my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I slept, I turned over, I slept","review":"I love Caleb Carr's books. I am reasonably attracted to Sherlock Holmes. Why do I find this book plodding, top heavy and a general all around snooze? Carr got the flavor right; the language and tone are impeccable. But he seems to have spent all his energy developing his dialogue facsimile and forgotten that detective stories were supposed to be exciting (sometimes even Conan Doyle's). On the merits alone of creating such an able carbon copy I give Carr points, but this book is almost unreadable for any other reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Caleb Carr, the author of The Alienist and The Angel of Darkness, treads on sacred ground with The Italian Secretary, which is a Sherlock Holmes mystery. Taking on the Conan Doyle mantle always riles hard-core Holmes' fans and this book is no exception. I read the Holmes/Watson mysteries years ago and enjoyed them, but I am by no means a \\"purist\\". This may explain why I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.Holmes and Watson are tasked by the Queen herself to tackle a case which involves some history, a little of the paranormal and a diabolical villain. I found the writing captured both time and place with its descriptions, characters and dialogue. And even if the mystery itself is not the tidiest, I still found the story-line engaging. Plus we get to meet Sherlock's eccentric brother.If historical mysteries are your cup of tea - you'll enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to Mr. Doyle","review":"This did not hold my interest very well .. which says it all for a mystery fan. Slow developing and plot rambles quite a bit. Author tries to combine both the metaphysical beliefs of Sir Doyle with Sherlock and it does not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Pastiche","review":"Carr's previous novels are unique works of art. He has created here the best full-length pastiche yet (and I dutifully try to read them all). It reads truly like a lost work of the canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"the italian secretary","review":"Received quickly. In perfect condition. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Thank you so much!! Cost was very reasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elementary, my dear Watson!","review":"I am a big fan of Carr's and I am a big fan of Sherlock Holmes. Carr's earlier works - The Alienist and The Angel of Darkness were true masterpieces. But The Italian Secretary is boring, has little plot and I must say, has a very dull climax unlike his earlier works. Sherlock Holmes powers are under utilized and Mycroft's intelligence is not employed at all. It is impossible to believe that an average Scotland Yard officer could not have solved this mystery. Moreover, the role of David Rizzio, the Italian secretary is over emphasized. The book could have been smaller by a hundred pages but for the unnecessary long sentences.I am being very harsh in the review but I expected a lot from Carr being a great fan of his works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish, my dear Watson, rubbish!","review":"Is this the same man that wrote The Alienist, Killing time, etc? Unbelievable! What a waste of time and paper. This book is not a pastiche, it is a disgrace. Tedious, boring, infantile, with absolutely nothing in common with the image of Sherlock Holmes and/or Dr. Watson. What a pity Mr. Carr decided to turn away from the stories he writes so wonderfully. He should be ashamed of this .... thing out of his pen. In Spanish, we have a saying: Shoemaker, to your shoes. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boredom Abounds","review":"I've never read a Sherlock Holmes novel so if the excercise of this book was to get as close to the original as possible yet provide a new adventure for the old slueth and his fans, then I have no idea if the author accomplished his mission. But if I were reading this for pure entertainment, as I was, then I'd have to say that this book was a real yawner. The best thing to say about it was that it was relatively short. I just don't see Sherlock having any relevance in todays world. His deductive reasoning, his thinking process and jumps of reasoning are talked out with his sidekick Watson, and seem like self-fulfilled prophesies. He deduces it so it must be true. I'd like to see him be so wrong that the result is somebody close to him bites the bullet."},{"rating":"1","title":"too elementrary","review":"carr ain't no doyle, is about all you need to know about this book. the basic 'scheme' of the book is childish, and the outcome is quite stupid. it is really quite outlandish to find out that no one is actually threatening the royal family, but rather ... oh well, you read it if you want, but it is not worth the time or money.however, it is well written in the doyle style and could have been so much better. it is like that twit who wrote 'scarlet', the sequel to 'gone with the wind': she really wasn't up to it either.i suspect they will get that tall idiot from 'friends', schwimer or what ever, to play holmes in this 'thriller' and maybe jim belushi for watson. dgs"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!

Even with a perfectly balanced adapter, the increase in the length of the shaft will place a greater lateral load on the bearings and the shaft, possibly resulting in a catastrophic failure (think 'ballistic'). Every router I've ever owned (6 or more) or used is designed for wrench access from the side not from the bottom (or 'top' in an inverted position). Your router table should allow this access negating the need for an extension (unless the base plate is not flush with the tabletop).

Daniel Baldwin stars as a crack special operative called upon to ring in a renegade agent played listlessly by Richard Tyson. Tyson is in possession of Pandora, some kind of weapon of mass destruction which can be used in restricted areas, kill the people but leave everything else intact. It never says exactly how it kills anyone, but the writers must have thought that unimportant. At any rate, nothing surprising happens, and the supporting players, including Steve Franken, Tony Todd and even Erika Eleniak are wasted in poorly written roles. The climax is pretty lame considering Baldwin's character was never told how the Pandora device works but he uses it like it was an old friend.

Leia learns of her family past, unwillingly at first, through meeting the friends of young Anakin, and then through a video diary created by Anakin's mother. She comes to some terms with her father's past and her future by doing so, becoming fond of her grandmother through the video diary.Denning does his usual workmanlike job, no real flair, no real disappointments. Her beginnings of an acceptance of her heritage though causes some minor continuity problems in my opinion. Such as her reaction in the Thrawn trilogy to being Lady Vader, and the whole White Current being her destiny as laid out in the Black Fleet Crisis.All in all, a laid back adventure that serves the purpose of a decent book about Leia. Solid, slightly above average Star Wars fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Star Wars Novel","review":"Troy Denning's Tatooine Ghost is a joy to read!

What makes this novel worth reading is the connection between the classic trilogy, expanded universe, and the current films. The Force is with Tatooine Ghost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Pace","review":"I've read almost every Star Wars novel so I consider myself somewhat of an expert. Troy Denning is one of my favorite Star Wars novelist but I have to admit that this story was slow and boring. I suppose that is was the lack of Jedi duals and use of force powers--aside from a few visions experienced by Leah. It is worth reading because it does fill in some gaps but only by serious fans. I wouldn't recommend this novel to the casual reader as I'm afraid it would turn them away from reading more, better Star Wars novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...the trilogies and prequels weaved in together","review":"I enjoyed reading the book..Troy Denning did a great job of weaving Episode I and II into the story. Leia and Han have only been married for 6 months in this story..As far as I can tell, this is probably right after \\"The Courtship of Princess Leia\\". They're on Tantooine to recover a painting which if the Empire gets it, will spell doom for rebel agents that are within the Empire.Leia is given a a journal. The journal opens her eyes to the kind of person her father was growing up. I thought this was really neat, but I had to start wondering about how this book might be out of sync with other books. I just started reading the Black Fleet Crisis now, cause I'm wondering about Luke finding his mother's people may have problems with this book.The plot to get the painting back was interesting, but the portions of the book where Leia was reading the journal had me glued. The chases and such were to me just not keeping me entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"Tatooine Ghost is the best Star Wars books ever!!! I've been waiting since The Truth at Bakuna (when Anakin tries to ask for Leia's forgiveness) for this book.

She meets his old friend Kitser, goes to the old podrace track and recieves her grandmother's diary.It was neat to learn exactly how Shmi ended up meeting and marrying Cliegg Lars. I loved how Watto behaved in the diary after Anakin left. How much he missed him. Chewbecca was still alive and better then ever. Han and Leia are still newlyweds and its nice to see them with a little romance.I liked how Han agreed with Anakin and how maybe Shmi's dreams about her son did come true.Now how about some books about Padme? How about Han, Leia and Luke head over to Naboo? Imagine Leia's reaction to learn how her mother helped get Palpatine get to be Chancollor?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good mixed bag","review":"Tatooine Ghost is a mashup. It has layers of backstory on Shmi and Anakin Skywalker. This book does have a new story to tell. The problem with it is that it just isn't that interesting.

It just gets overshadowed by the superb way in which Denning reveals the backstory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I thought the book was good and it explored the skywalker side real good.

In other words, you have to flip the book upside down to see the other half of the trains. The flaps are flimsy and tear easily. Compared to other flap books, this one is not very robust. The flaps are also not very interesting. My son grew tired of the book very quickly as the text describing the trains is not very engaging for his age group.

Tell Radiohead to include a chorus in their songs and a memorable melody then maybe I'll give their work a second thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOWN WITH COMPUTER MUSIC!","review":"This band is so lame. They are trying way too hard to emulate Coldplay's sound. I don't get the lead singer, all he does is whine and moan. And this isn't even music, it's just sound effects. Coldplay and Starsailor paved the way for this band, but that doesn't mean it is any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious!","review":"Probably the most overrated recordings of all time. Having lovedPablo Honey (4 stars) and The Bends (5 stars), and after readingall the '5-star' reviews of this CD, I figured 'Hey...I gotta getthis CD'! Well, I'm trading it in tomorrow. As another reviewerstated, it's very 'tedious'. Second-rate Pink Floyd. This stuffwas being done in the seventies! Anyone remember Tangerine Dream?This CD is better than maybe only two or three of all of PinkFloyds recordings. The only decent song on the CD is Karma Police. What was Radiohead thinking after making a great CD like The Bends, and then following up with this? Why all the glowingreviews? All I can think of is the standard/bar for a great CD has been lowered tremendously. How else can you explain the popularity of rap, hip-hop, Eminem, Creed, and yes...even Nirvana?I highly recommend Pablo Honey and The Bends. I don't recommendOK Computer. If you want this type of music, buy any one ofabout eight Pink Floyd CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG how can ppl think this is good!!!?!1","review":"the singer is really ugly and this band is just sooooo bad!! go buy an avril lavigne cd, shes like the biggest thing rite now, and sooo talented and pretty!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you compare this to REAL classics!","review":"I'll make this short and sweet...listen to this drivel, now go listen to London Calling by The Clash...NO CONTEST ! London Calling is a masterpiece...OK Computer is pure garbage. 'nuff said. Leather Beatle Boot"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is more like this in the world!","review":"First of all, I think this is a great album. It is a shame that there are not more bands achieving the degree of fame that Radiohead has, considering the type of music performed on OK Computer. This CD is a sort of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" for the 90's, it's music that is atmospheric, well performed, and makes you think. But to the reviewers who think that this music is alone in a sea of mediocrity, you obviously have some digging to do. There were releases by King Crimson in the early 80's (\\"Three of a Perfect Pair\\" and \\"Discipline\\" to name a couple)which, from a sonic/atmosheric standpoint, bands are only now catching up to. More recently, Saga's \\"Generation 13\\" and \\"Brave\\" by Marillion could seriously give this album a run for its money. I give \\"OK Computer\\" only four stars, because all four of these other albums exceed do what \\"OK Computer\\" is aiming at, but did it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best album mankind has ever produced...","review":"I may only be 15, but when I listened to OK Computer for the first time, to be honest, I was a little unsure of Radiohead. I didn't know whether I liked them or didn't. Yet on the second time listening through the album, the melodic tunes and the tense progression of the album really started to shine and I started to realise why everyone seemed to love this album. By now I must have listened to this album at least 5 times through and it gets better every time. Radiohead don't rely on catchy tunes and mediocre lyrics to get you hooked like so many bands that you like for only a short period of time.Radiohead are truly the best band ever and their songs keep you coming back for more. Kid A will have to be incredibly good to surpass OK Computer and I'm sure that will happen. OK Computer is a definite purchase for anyone who has a stereo. GET IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best cds i have ever listened to","review":"this cd is one of the best, most unique cds i have ever listened to. i believe this is in the same class as the great nirvana unplugged album. the progression of the songs is unbelievable, and it is inredibly easy to listen to the whole cd in one sitting. is like nothing i've ever listened to before."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Album Of All Time","review":"This is the greatest album of all time. Genius, honest, paranoid, depressed, angry. Those are just some of the words that could begin to explain this album. I knew about Radiohead before I purchased this CD. I've heard the song 'Creep' on the radio about a BILLION times and seen the music video for 'Knives Out' but those songs are nothing compared to what's contained on this disc. This album truly changed my life. I can relate word for word to the lyrics. This is an artistic statement more than it is a mere \\"compact disc.\\" This album is to me what therapy is to others. It helps me to come to terms with and understand my feelings. This album gets me through life. I don't mean to sound like some obsessed freak but it's true. The people who give this album bad reviews are the kind of people who can't relate to the themes of alienation and frustration with \\"the norm.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the essentials of the 90's","review":"\\"Ok Computer\\" perfectly conveys the \\"double dual\\" that is living in the most technologically advanced time in history, amid all the power and the wealth, while also struggling to understand and express our emotions in a meaningful way. Indeed, I believe this one is for anyone out there who has been alienated by the \\"wisdom\\" of our times. Truly a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful","review":"My first radiohead album, and I can't put it down (well I put it down after a while, everyone gets bored of albums after many listens).

It is a classic and THE best Radiohead album. What other album sparks this much controversy (besides maybe Sgt. Pepper)"},{"rating":"2","title":"RADIOHEAD pushes the envelope in the right direction","review":"I recently found myself compiling a personal CD containing cuts from the four most recent RADIOHEAD albums (The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac). I was not surprised to see that I wound up with no less than five cuts from OK Computer. I enjoy all four albums immensely (as well as Pablo Honey, the first RH CD I ever owned), but I must say this is the ONE to have if your are limited to one. RADIOHEAD is the perfect combo of retro and avant garde. I can only salute what they have done to reinvigorate modern rock music! My personal favorite, \\"Lucky\\", has to be one of the all time masterpiece four-minute songs ever written in a rock style. I think you will be pleased with this album even if you have never even heard of RADIOHEAD but are a fan of the genre. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i like radiohead","review":"theres nothing i could add to praise this album that hasn't been listed already. u just have to see that theres seven hundred and fifty five reviews on this album and i'd say ninety percent of them are five stars. i just had to review it because it IS that great of an album. one of the best, nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not saying anything new","review":"Ok anything I could say about the album whould just be covering ground already covered. So I won't. However I will say that this album changed: the way I look at life, my musical interests, my passions, my creative endeavors, and the way I spent most of my free time(listening to this album instead of anything else). Also, I used to wholeheartedly believe that the Beatles were the best band of the 20th century. Now because of this album I don't think I can honestly say that anymore. Buy this album and cradle it like a baby--or let it cradle you--either way."},{"rating":"2","title":"This kicks so much arse","review":"Oh my god, this album is so good. From the first heavy electronic notes on \\"Airbag,\\" to the last sung phrase, pleading for us to \\"slow down,\\" this is the most musically profound popular music album that I've heard in a long while. The musicianship is outstanding, and it never gets dull. Just when you begin to think that a melody has been done to death in repetition, another melody comes in, or the tempo suddenly changes, but everything holds seamlessly together at the same time. This is especially apparent on songs like \\"Exit Music\\" and \\"No Surprises,\\" and the cheerful \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien.\\" The lyrics are a bit obtuse for me, but that's part of their charm. They can be interpreted so that the album, contrary to popular belief, can be enjoyed as a collection of diverse songs and not as slave to some overarching theme about technology or the perils of modernism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be swayed by the ignorant!!!","review":"Read quite a few of the other reviews and they're all going to say the same thing.... you have to listen to this album a lot before you can fully appreciate it.When I bought this album the first week of solid listening made me wonder whether this album was that great at all.Then it happened. After about a month and a half of listening to it on and off It finally clicked. And now I'm pretty damn sure this is one of the best albums ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Q: What do you get when you mix the best elements of rock, techno, and classical music with one part raw talent and two parts artistic genius?A: OK Computer: the best album ever"},{"rating":"2","title":"a terrific album","review":"After going through the high that was The Bends, I must admit there was a slight letdown when I first listened to OK Computer, but as the years have gone by, I am starting to rank this album right up there with The Bends.

An essential album for anyone with a flare for inventive and explorative musical tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that makes you smarter","review":"This had the same effect on me as the Beatles had on an earlier generation; it opened my head to what music could be. It took me to the limits of my intelligence, maybe even raised my IQ a few points. If you had an infinite number of me's with an infinite number of typewriters, we could never come up with it.

Radiohead is one of those rare bands these days that is actually CREATIVE, making new, unusual, thought-provoking and beautiful music. After listening to constant re-makes of older songs and outright stealing of songs by today's rappers, it is so refreshing to hear this CD. Other favorites by this group are: \\"Kid A\\" and \\"The Bends.\\" Support true artists!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Album, I'll admit","review":"I can understand why this album is difficult for some to love or often like, but it just fit for me. If anything its worth a try for anybody who loves music, and you might just fall in love like i did. Or you wont. This disk is sprawling, layered, and diverse if anything, and it resonated with me. I found it deeply absorbing. Highs...Exit Music (for a film), Let Down, Karma Police, most of the album, for me, actually... though I admit i found Electioneering a bit too roudy."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're so good it just isn't fair...","review":"I can't think of a group that compares to them. No one can sing like Yorke, and by that I mean his structure and style. His voice sails over the band, at times barely eclipsing them, only to be drowned out by the instruments. It's an amazing thing to hear. You will realize how bland and basic most groups are, and why they lack the lasting power that Radiohead will always have. So go buy the CD. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A private pleasure","review":"I saw Radiohead touring OK Computer in Auckland - and though they were good it didn't thrill me in the way that REM or Pulp live. The reason, I think is that this album is such an intensely personal experience, and needs to be appreciated alone - probably through headphones. its the music of our darkest most lonely moments, like Thom is opening a direct conduit to your soul. Somehow, sharing it chespens it, and they become just songs - its like the illusion that these songs have been written for me personally, that the album creates so well, is shattered by the communal experience of a gig. Live, the songs from 'the Bends' work much better.This album is art. Not 'art-rock' that hideous mess perpetrated by the likes of ELP and King Crimson in the 70's, but real art - like Yeats or Dali or Stravinsky - something truly special that will be with me always.Wondrous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype in my opinion","review":"I got this cd after hearing how it was possibly the greatest cd of all time from shows like Vh1 \\"The List\\" and other places. Don't believe it, unless you really enjoy radiohead. I do not particularly enjoy this cd or their other cd that has been big titled \\"The Bends.\\" I do feel there are some good songs on the cd like \\"No Surprises,\\" and \\"Karma Polica\\" and \\"Parnoid Android.\\" (I do feel that karma police and paranoid android are two of the most brilliant songs of the 90's and that is why this cd receives two stars) Other than these three songs, I would not recommend this cd, and would recommend downloading the three mentioned songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why aren't these titles remastered?","review":"I cannot believe that the 3 Radiohead \\"Collector's Edition\\" titles are NOT remastered. CD remastering technology has come a long way since these CDs were initially released. OK Computer is twelve years old! It would have been nice to hear these titles with improved sound quality, but instead EMI (assumably with the band's consent) have just repackaged the same CDs with the various B-sides.To be fair, the price is good versus having to buy all the EPs and singles to get these tracks. But these days, when classic albums are reissued, it is expected that they are remastered (The Cure, Depeche Mode, New Order, Pearl Jam, etc.)These non-remastered titles just make Radiohead look as out of touch as The Beatles."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest of all radiohead albums so far","review":"This, seriously, is my favorite album of all time. No other compares. I can listen to it in any mood and enjoy it. I think it sounds alot like Coldplay.

It was then that I discovered jazz and I didn't buy a rock album for 15 years. A couple of years ago I heard jazz pianist Brad Mehldau play Radiohead covers (Exit Theme and Paranoid Android)so I bought OK Computer. What a revelation! OK -I can do without the teenage angst lyrics, but the music is wonderful. Now I've come back I hope some Radiohead listeners give Brad Mehldau a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite album of all time","review":"listen to this first at home on your stereo.then with your headphones after getting highboth times it will amaze youlyrically, musically, and cohesively their best album so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"ELECTRONIC KEYBOARDS ARE BETTER","review":"I got an electronic keyboard in the third grade that made more innovating sounds. Radiohead relies on small scraps of mildly interesting electronica to appeal to bohemian types. Without a little squeaky noise here and there, Radiohead would simply be a the voice of a seemingly angrily retarded individual set against very bad pop tunes. This band copies too many cool bands that came out several years ago.(Portishead, Bjork......) Their Saturday Night Live debut was so funny I almost wet myself. What is this new rag doll dance? Even little Fiona is doing it. It is the most ostentatious way to feel music. It is also relatively easy. I can understand and sympathize with Radiohead's method of feeling music, but there is nothing there to feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"About 4 and a half good songs, a lot of filler.","review":"I guess I just don't \\"get it\\". OK Computer is NOT the greatest album of the 90s. \\"Exit Music\\", \\"Karma Police\\", \\"Electioneering\\", \\"No Surprises\\", and maybe even \\"Paranoid Android\\" are fairly alright songs...but they are not the be-all-end-all of modern day rock music. I usually find myself skipping over most of the tracks on this album...just too dull for my tastes. In all honesty, I find Pablo Honey to be a more fulfilling listen than OK Computer. Sorry, RH fans, but I like to enjoy my music, not fall asleep to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok Radiohead","review":"Well, here it is, the most overated album of the 90s, along with that godawful Mellon Collie thing by the Smashing Pumpkins. I have no doubt the same people who [dote] over this boring overproduced [stuff] also think Billy Corgan is a musical genius. So about OK computer, i'll say that it's not nearly as bad as Kid a. This album though is all about the production. The music wouldn't sound anywhere near as good if it wasn't for all the sonic tweaking and other studio tricks. Underneath it all the music is cold, boring and lacks identity. It sounds like they're trying to be the Pink Floyd of the 90s. Granted, some of the songs deserve merit, mainly tracks 4, 5 and 6. But the first 3 songs are so boring, i really struggled to get through them to find something worth listening to. I don't know what the concept of Ok Computer is suppose to be, but if it was for Thom Yorke to sing and write songs like a computer then he sure did succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-leeze","review":"Having listened to this CD over and over I can only say that this is the most over-hyped CD to come along since the CD format started.

I have a few of them from some imports but It is nice having them all on one CD.My favs from the second disk are: Polyethylene (Parts 1 & 2) [Paranoid Android], A Reminder, Pearly*, and especially Climbing Up The Walls (Zero 7 Mix) [Karma Police] Zero 7 being one of the most overlooked bands was great to see in collaboration with Radiohead!

All this compostion also blends so sonically that one might not notice the overpowering themes in this piece of art as music. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Cold and True","review":"This album really grew on me. Although I do not consider myself a Radiohead fan, I liked this album as well as their previous effort, The Bends. I go back and forth over which album I enjoy the most. This album's concept, to me at least, seems to be the depersonalization of the postmodern world, with hints of the impending apocalypse. I would say that the production is really what makes it for me. Most of the songs have musical quality, but it is really the sci-fi sound production that puts this album over the edge. \\"Exit Music\\" has one of the most spine-tingling finales I have heard in a long time. \\"Paranoid Android\\" is an epic reflection on the current state of man, and \\"Airbag\\" is an excellent and grandiose introduction to the world of OK Computer.

People like to focus on its sadness. But much of the album is tongue in cheek. Dont lose sight of the humor in the record as you pass through tones that are sublime or jangly, insane or intense, melodic or atonal. It is filled with moods, but we tend to focus on the morbid ones. Also, if you do purchase this CD, (I highly recommend you do) keep listening deeper into the music. It is filled with little touches that reveal themselves to you slowly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best of all time. . .","review":"\\"OK COMPUTER\\" to put it simply, deals with modern day society. As ROllingStone said, it reveals the terror, boredom, and agony of today's world. And it does a superb job of it, tapping into emotions and desires buried in our own denials.\\"No Surprises\\" reads like a poison lullabye--describing the horror of routine. \\"Exit Music\\" sounds like a hopeless ode to escaping home life. \\"Let Down\\" is a beautiful ballad to all of us who are losers at one point in our lives. \\"The Tourist\\" closes the album on a more positive note, painting a placid picture of modern day life in your head.I bought this album and listened to it incessantly in 1998. Everytime I listen to it, it still takes me back, and transports me forward. It is truly a beautiful album--a work of art to be treasured for decades to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Genius!!","review":"A great album and still my #1 album since I purchased it back in 1997. The album seems to transform as the songs continue to play. The theme of the overall album is a transformation from the human perspective to a technological/computer based theme. The songwriting and concept is pure genius! The album takes a turn that becomes more gradual after track #5 \\"Let Down\\" and \\"Karma Police.\\" Both songs have electronic/synthesizer harmonies and give foreshadowing of changing musical themes throughout the album. This album never gets old. The end song The Tourist has a haunting chorus with Thom Yorke yelling \\"Slow down, Slow down.\\" This is Radiohead at their finest. Kid A and Amnesiac took a different approach to music and then came back with Hail To The Thief. OK Computer is the most interesting and artistically written album I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soundtrack to everything","review":"This is by far the best Radiohead CD I've heard and I am a fan!Ok Computer is like the soundtrack to everything--cross country car trips, books (especially The Phantom Tollbooth), and any number of weird internationa movies. Every single track is great and the whole CD has a definite mood. It is different from The Bends album but fans will see a progression from one to the other. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might appeal to fans of space 1999","review":"horrible trash...whiny, whiny, bohooo, bohoooJust shut up and sing. Radiohead are the worst band ever..this album is the ultimate proof why."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel better now :-)","review":"Like every wannabe hip student, I loved this album back in 1997.Slow depressing electronic pop and coooool artwork were the key to radiohead success on the campus.Since then, you have seen and heard them everywhere and many british bands have followed in their trail: muse and placebo being the most annoying of the bunch.Now I am sick of all the guys who say this is the best album of all times.Open up ! listen to some jazz, hip hop, classical music... and don't forget that less is more."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated soft rock......boring","review":"Despite the fact that all of my friends love this album and rate it as a breakthrough in rock history I must state my honest opinion. Radiohead has always been and always will be boring. If you are a true rock fan I recommend the Hives, the White Stripes and the Black Keys, and Electric Six. This album is something to go to sleep to and maybe if I was more of a dud and disliked alternative music I would enjoy it. I'll say one good thing about Radiohead; Creep was a good song."},{"rating":"1","title":"poser music","review":"Anyone who thinks that this album is in any way innovative, experimental or avant-garde needs to stop trying to impress people with how cool they are and instead listen to anything by Fantomas, Mr Bungle, Thinking Plague, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, or Spiral Architect. THAT is progressive, innovative, groundbreaking music. This is just easy listening pop that ignorant posers think is avant-garde just because it doesn't sound like Britney Spears. Well, people, expand your horizons a little and move outside the mainstream. This album is about as innovative as Muzak."},{"rating":"1","title":"radiohead crawled into my mind; now a microchip lurks there","review":"Anybody who eats food should not listen to this album because it will make you choke. Stay away from this material. It is hazardous to our health. Don't eat the soylent green. Meeting people is really really hard. Go ask alice; she swallowed bill gates ( who is, by the way, the most parrrrrannnnnoid man in the galaxy). Read \\"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\\" by Paolo Freire. Then read it again. Don't be frightened. We hope that you will find this record just as delightful as the grammy committee (who are those people anyway?).Voice One: you shouldn't ramble--people will stop listening to you eventually. Just get to the point, OKAY?!?!Voice Two: Okay......daddy hurts me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does everybody like this album?","review":"I loved The Bends. I'm a fan of slow, melancholy music and self-indulgent concept albums. I even like Roger Waters' solo albums and Brave by Marillion. Why don't I like OK Computer? Maybe it's just the fact that everyone else likes it, but it does nothing for me. I've tried to give it a chance, listened to it a fair few times, but it just annoys me. It's as if the band have forgotten how to write decent songs like Creep from Pablo Honey, and have tried to create something groundbreaking like Dark Side of the Moon. They've failed utterly."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want interesting music try Tool or Alice In Chains","review":"No this album isnt 1 star. Yes practically every radiohead fan in the world has rated this album 5 star. No i dont like this style of music. Yes my two favorite bands are Alice In Chains and Tool. Yes Tool is also overrated. Yes they deserve to be. No radiohead does NOT deserve to be. Yes Radiohead are a pretentious band. No Tool are not a pretentious band. Therefore TOOL and ALICE IN CHAINS are better than Radiohead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Some Real Music","review":"This is garbage.Real Music = Bruce springsteen, Nirvana, the beatles, led zeppelin, rolling stone, Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Jimi hendrix, James brown, Little richard, Ray charles, The beach boys.Take your pick, any of them is better than Radiohead."},{"rating":"1","title":"two of the same!!!!!! :((((((","review":"I received two of the same record!!

Filter Happier is the best track and makes up two stars, please don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring non-innovative rock","review":"Perhaps if this had come out well before \\"in the court of the crimson king\\" or \\"dark side of the moon\\" this would be some kind of innovative work. Instead, it is just a very derivitive mope-fest with little charm. There are a couple standout tracks, but those are quickly bogged down by Floyd-lite numbers with no punch.Radiohead does a nice job of mixing their influences, but goes a little overboard in directly lifting passages from Pink Floyd's Live Ummagumma disc.The record now sounds tinny and dated. It was nice to see Radiohead learn from this and produce the organic Kid A, which is easily their best work and well worth owning. This one is utterly forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The -->BEST<-- album EVER!!!!!","review":"the most brilliant album yet!...even better than \\"the bends\\"(there second album)OK computer is a masterwork woven by guitars,drums and the stunningly great voice of Thom Yorke. the only thing better then it is hearing it live..it blows my mind away. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"The epitome of the \\"mediocrity rises to the top\\" theory.","review":"Allow me to be the voice of dissention/reason here. Perhaps my expectations were too high after all the hype about this album, but this is some of the most bland, reconstituted swill I've ever heard. This sounds like watered-down Beatles and Pink Floyd with some U2 thrown in. I don't mind music that is somewhat derivative, but this music is just nauseatingly formulaic. This album is one of the most glaring musical examples of the mind-boggling 70's retro movement. It's strictly for those who are still pining away for a \\"lost\\" Beatles album, or can't get over the old \\"British invasion\\" days. I guess it's okay if you want to like this album, but its idle to pretend its some sort of instant classic, or stroke of genius. Blahhh."},{"rating":"2","title":"The long awaited return of Art Rock","review":"This never has sounded like Pink Floyd to me, and although there are some Floydish passages, there are also sections which remind me of U2, The Beatles (White Album), Porcupine Tree, and Islands/Lizard-era King Crimson. The greatest album ever? I doubt it. Although I think it will go down as a classic, there are many similar recordings which have been around for years but never received recognition. Progressive Rock (never a darling of the critics) has produced many influential and conceptual landmarks of the same quality as OK Computer. Since, i don't see this as a \\"revolutionary\\" piece of music, I only give it 4 stars...but a very strong 4 stars. If you don't own this, buy it (as well as Kid A)...if you already own it and are just perusing the reviews, check out the following recordings: \\"Signify\\" by Porcupine Tree, \\"The Visitor\\" by Arena, \\"Brave\\" by Marillion, and \\"You\\" by Gong."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say?","review":"Read any and all positive reviews here and you may very well get an idea of what kind of effect this album has had on an entire generation. The very first time I listened to this album I stopped everything I was doing and just sat down and listened. I was immediately enthralled, and subsequent spins have revealed loads of emotions and superb songwriting. Why this album does not have a solid, collective 5-star-rating is absolutely baffling to me. I could note specific songs that I like more personally, but seriously, this whole album is outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uuuuuuuuuuugh","review":"Thom Yorke's incessant whining and moaning prevent me from enjoying this album. I like the slick production and neat guitar tricks, but the singer just doesn't know when to shut up and let the music speak. I enjoyed the first couple of Radiohead CDs, but I do believe Mr. Yorke has fallen victim to the same syndrome that ruined Bono and that big-lipped what's-his-name guy from The Verve. Yorke is obviously in love with his voice and so we must all suffer the non-stop groaning. Too bad, because there's some half-decent music on here. Maybe I just don't feel sorry enough for myself to get into this. Get The \\"Pop is Dead\\" single if you prefer your rock with some backbone. Or, you could just get The Pixies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Couple of Excellent Songs","review":"Here is an honest review from someone who ISN'T a diehard Radiohead fan. Whenever talking about Radiohead, you have to watch out for the rabid fans. I suppose most bands have them, but those of the Radiohead variety seem unique in their ability to dismiss all listeners who think Radiohead is anything less than the best band in the history of sound as illiterate, moronic heathens.The third track; \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" is breathtakingly beautiful, airy and melodic. It's worth the cost of the album for that one track alone, no joke. Two tracks later, the listener is blessed with another gem, \\"Let Down\\". Subdued at the start, this track builds force as it goes, a desperately driven melancholic reflection. Depressing? Yeah, a bit. But also wonderful.The rest of the album has its moments, to be sure, and will not disappoint most listeners. However, unless you're of the frame of mind that if it's not Radiohead, it's crap. . . well, it's just a decent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, Simply Brilliant","review":"Radiohead started out as your average British Alternative band. Then came \\"OK Computer\\"; no one had heard anything like it before, and no one ever will. With this album, they carved their own niche in the world of music and inspired a ton of bands in the process. There's nothing on earth like the combination of Thom Yorke's voice and Jonny Greenwood's innovative style of guitar playing. \\"Paranoid Android\\" is well worth the price of the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for the musically mature","review":"I cannot begin to comprehend the level of musical genius responsible for creating a work of art like this. For those musically mature enough to appreciate it, this is simply a masterpiece of modern music. This and \\"Kid A\\" are probably my two favorites, followed by the rest, in no particular order."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just music..","review":"Words cannot encompass what this album means to me. When I heard it, I knew right away, that it was what I had been waiting my whole life to hear. Its taught me so much. Every song is laden with meaning and a powerful message. I genuinely pity those who are too shallow to grasp it. To me, this album is more than just music and Radiohead is more than just a band; they're the soundtrack to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great record","review":"This has got to be my favorite Radiohead album ever, and the sound quality is superb on the re-issued vinyl. Thanks for helping me complete my collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Without a doubt one of the best albums Ive ever heard, cannot say its the greatest because Radiohead does have other albums which are as great so buy them all you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is awsome","review":"This CD is Awsome and definitly Radioheads best CD. Also, i noticed in one of the reviews that the kid says Tom Yorke is trying to imitate Avril Lavigne. Where the hell do you get that from? Radiohead has been around for much longer than Avril Lavigne. BRING THIS BACK TO 5 STARS!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant!","review":"The only two words I can use to describe this inovative alubm is simply brilliant. I'll go as bold to say it is the best album I have ever listened to. Please don't hit me, yes better then any of the Beatles albums;White Alubm,Sgt. Pepper, Abbey Road. I'm a huge of the beatles,so that's saying alot. I've had this C.D. since it's release last summer, and it hasn't left my C.D. player once. This masterpiece gets better and better each listening, no kidding. There's not one bad song on this album and every song is vital as this album sways you along on a 60 minute emotional journey that has you asking for more. This album is MUST add to anyone's C.D. collection. O.K. Computer is not just music album, it's an experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Ever Created","review":"Some of you might think I am going out on a limb when I say this, but I am not. It is definitly the best album ever created. There are 12 tracks on the CD, all of which are strong in every area, muscially and lyrically. If you are to have only one CD in your collection, make it this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK COMPUTER","review":"The best song on this album is easily track 9, 'CLIMBING UP WALLS', its an amazing track and is emotion provoking, as is most of Radioheads good songs. Of course Paranoid Android, Karma Police and No Suprises are amazing pieces of work, but aren't as good as track 9.I also think that this is their second best album, behind the masterpiece that is 'The Bends'. Also check out Sigur Ros, they are amazing and easily as good as Radiohead, and don't let the fact that they sing in a made up language put you off, it honestly sounds better than english."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Cd I've Ever Bought","review":"This is, simply put, the best cd I have ever bought and am likely to ever buy in my life. From \\"Airbag\\" to \\"The Tourist\\", every song is beautiful and emotional, and the songs only get better every time you listen to them. I listened to it so many times I wore my first copy out and had to buy another. Buy this cd. Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing break from \\"refrigerator buzz\\". Mind-blowing!","review":"This cd will blow your mind. The hard guitar and contained, matured voice of Thom York is so intense that sometimes you can't even handle listening to it. Certain songs are very light in guitar and drums, but the power that they have is indescribable. Radiohead has definitly matured in a lot of ways. The different instruments blend perfectly on this album. The only way to describe it is pure genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the \\"dark side of the moon\\" for the new millenium","review":"This is quite possibly one of the greatest CD's ive ever listened to, and trust me, i work in a radio station, i know. Radiohead is the Pink Floyd of the modern era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Influential Album of My Life","review":"I was a stranger to Radiohead when I purchased Ok Computer, and upon playing it the first time I skipped through the songs and put it up for months. Not very impressed. I then learned that it was nominated for a Best Album grammy so I dug it up and gave it another chance. That was the same day I was born. I have always been a huge fan of Indie rock. My musical taste was and is always against the grain somewhat. This album changed the entire was I looked at music. I blossomed into something completely different. These lyrics, these melodies, and these songs do so much for me as a music fan. I have experienced this album so many times, and still it hits me as it did the second time. I feel privledged to be a huge fan of Radiohead now. And never want to think about what my music collection would look like had I never picked this album up. Kudos to Thom and Co. for creating something that can actually change lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok Computer","review":"Radiohead have stayed alive by keeping diffent, and new. Ok Computer is no exception. Though this isn't all \\"experimenting,\\" its just pure brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Get IT","review":"Quite honestly, there probably isn't much I can tell you about this CD that hasn't already been said. Just review the facts. Radiohead is quite possibly the best band since the Beatles. This is their best CD. If you've taken the time to get this far in the buying process, then you have to be somewhat interested. Assuming you are interested, there is no way that this CD can disappoint you. You don't have to buy it on this site - just make sure you get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Soul of Alternative","review":"You have heard the hype from your friends and maybe read all the great reviews; but until you have heard Thom's vocals at the end of \\"Let Down\\", how they soar and blend, or the simple guitar at the beginning of \\"No Surprises\\" you won't understand. This is so elegant and calming; it's like classical music with vocals and feedback."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insight through the meaning of life","review":"I've been a Radiohead fan for a while and their music grows on me day-to-day.OK Computer is without a doubt a classic album. Nothing will ever sound like it. Just the booklet art is worth the money.And the sounds, the noises, the melodies are all very well arranged and put together.This \\"trip Album\\" It's amazingly sad and melancholic and to me it signifies the world, peoples behaviors, and the fact that you're never happy until you figure out the meaning of your life.This CD is in my collection, i hope it's in yours too.Thanks for reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazing","review":"I bought this album shortly after it came out in 97, and loved it then and love it even more now. Not only is this in my opinion Radiohead's finest album, it has to be considered among the greatest of all time. You know the old question asking if you were stranded on a desert island and you could only bring 5 albums with you, which would you consider? Well out of my 800+ albums from many differant artists and genres, I simply could not live without this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance.","review":"If you don't like this album, you're pretty much an idiot. Sorry. The truth hurts. Take a look at the musical tastes of all one-star reviewers if you want a huge laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you need a laugh...","review":"First of all, Ok Computer is, and will (probably) always be my undisputed favorite album. As for the best album of all time, the extraordinary number of 5-star reviews you beautiful people have contributed speaks volumes. I am not an authority on music, but I can recognize musical brilliance, and Ok Computer is the finest example out there.For a laugh, if you find yourself frustrated by those sporadic negative reviews sullying the Ok Computer reputation with a fragrantly low 4.5 stars, check the sources. For instance, Illmatic's 1-star dismissal of OK along with the claim, made 8/3/05, that Springsteen's Born to Run is the greatest album of all time. After you recover from some spasmodic laughing, check out the rest of his reviews. You'll soon realize that those negative reviews lend credibility to the greatness of Radiohead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spectacular Piece of Work","review":"This third studio album continues the progression of the band into more subtle, ambient, electronic experimentation. The mood of the cd moves from low grade paranoia to euphoria to utter indifference. It's definitely something that needs to be experienced, and can't be accurately described. It needs to be listened to in entirety at least 7 times before one can get a handle on the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's what you do:","review":"You get yourself a copy of OK Computer, you lie down on the floor with a speaker on either side of your head, maybe a foot or two away. Turn the volume up a bit and the lighting down a bit. Get the remote into your paw, one finger on the \\"repeat\\" button so that you won't have to move much. Get comfy. Not too comfy; just comfy enough. You close your eyes, andPlay track five. All done? Great. Now, please play track five again. When you have finished, I recommend that you play track five several times. Repeat this process until you can feel something sinking down through your bones and into the floor underneath you. Kind of like the floor collapsing. Weightless.THEN come back here and give this album one star.I dare you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Important Album To Come Out In A Long Time","review":"It is definetly the best and most important album to come out since Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.

All of these other bands will make a mediocre single and put it on MTV. All of the MTV crazed fanatics will go out and get these CD's only to find that no effort was put into any of the other songs. Radiohead is the savior to all music left with a few acceptions. OK Computer is a very good CD that also gives chills down my spine. It seems like every song had been worked on equally long. It blends all of the right essentials to good music and does not abuse using a heavy metal style through the whole song. That is what is great. All types of styles are included in making these masterpieces. I reccomend this CD along with The Bends and Pablo Honey."},{"rating":"2","title":"It may take time to fall in love but it's worth it","review":"From the opening guitar crunch of \\"Airbag\\" to the final chime at the end of \\"The Tourist\\", OK Computer plays out like a masterpiece...it's utterly brilliant. I've heard people often list it as one of the best albums of the 20th century, and I think that's a pretty accurate description. It's one of the few perfect records that I've heard. The reviewer who gave this album 1 star must not have ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs! Incredible!","review":"Radiohead is probably the best rockband i\`ve ever heard of. I listened to \\"street spirit\\" from \\"The Bends\\", and i\`ts such a lovely song,yet i never bought the album until now. That\`s when my facination started. Everyone has got to listen to their albums, because their unlike any others. You never get tired of listening to this music, you\`ll only love it more and more. Listen to \\"No surprices\\", I\`ts so wonderful vocally performed! By this album, you\`ll never regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate British rock at its best.","review":"Radiohead have been by far one of the most innovative sounds of the British music scene, apart from Lamb and Portishead. The almost art-rock feel that is generated by Thom Yorke and company has been contributed largely by the three-guitar attack. The beautiful intertwining guitars of 'Letdown' is reminiscent of The Byrds while 'Climbing Up The Walls' is hauntingly effective in recollecting nostalgia. Credit should not only be given to the songwriter(s) of the band, but also the quintet as a whole for successfully being able to create another masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotta match your taste!","review":"The album has a few (not many according to me) excellent tracks. But i think I was kinda disappointed probably after all the positive feedback this album received. As said by several reviewers the album has to speak to you. If this is not the case, you probably will not enjoy most of the tracks. This is pretty much my case. But this is only a matter of opinion.My recommendation is to try to listen to the album before purchasing it coz you could either love it or hate it.Still the track \\"No Surprises\\" is super famous and really really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Simply a Good Album","review":"I love Radiohead.

This music is very boring and drab. People think that this band is genius, but I think that it is a bunch of whiny garbage. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because everyone in the world seems to love this band. Oh and I seem to see a few people (Amazon editor included)comparing Radiohead to Pink Floyd??? This is Blasphemy! Roger Waters has more talent and creativity in his stool sample than Thom York could ever even dream. I hate to say it but their only good song was \\"Creep\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"is there a \\"no stars\\" option?","review":"Some call Radiohead's music inaccessible. I call it intolerable. Just as people learn to live under Third World regimes, people learn to endure Radiohead. Note: endure, NOT like. Those who claim to like Radiohead are only kidding themselves. It's quite admirable, really: they've learnt to tolerate the intolerable.Radiohead have gained such an enormous fan-base amongst college students precisely for this reason. Nobody else can understand their music - it's dischordant, it's headache-inducing, it's lyrics are patently meaningless. Thus, it's exclusive, it's cliquey! It's not about the music, it's about the identity they derive from listening to the music.Music-lovers beware! Don't fall into the same trap! Stick well clear of this piece of glorified garbage. Any praise it has received is simply self-aggrandizement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooo.....boring.......","review":"ughhh.....even hearing Radiohead's name makes me drowsy. I have to give it you Radiohead fans, your a hardcore bunch. I cant imagine how tough it is to stay awake during this album. You must all inhale a couple of lines before even thinking about listening to this.As for you non-Radiohead listeners, dont believe the hype. All because MTV, your best friend, and mommy and daddy tells you its good, it doesnt mean it is.I suggest Tiamat and Omnium Gatherum over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sour, discordant and mostly boring","review":"I was lent the entire Radiohead discography. I hardly kept about 10 songs which are indeed quite good : \\"Sail to the moon\\", \\"Nice dream\\", \\"Creep\\"... but the rest is a proper disaster. I was appalled by the live stuff : the guy just cannot sing properly unless he is backed by studio effects. He just has no voice, just a dismal creaking off-key whine that just make ears cringe. But apparently not everyone has ears. No to mention very poor melodies for most songs.The fact this band is so popular is not very encouraging. Creaking off-key whine lovers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERATED","review":"I am a Radiohead fan and this album is overated. KID A is by far the best Radiohead album.

PABLO HONEY (does not get enough critical acclaim)3. THE BENDS (average follow-up to PABLO HONEY)4. OK COMPUTER (way overated)5. AMNESIAC (I wished for KID A part 2 and got this?)6. HAIL TO THE THIEF (beyond SIT DOWN, STAND UP this album weak)Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"not quite that good. don't believe the hype, with ideas and riffs stolen from better artists (not to be mentioned due to radioheads bandwagon following who prodably check this page religiously) radiohead has fooled a lot of college kids and other self nominated intellectuals into thinking this is original work. save your dime and check out. . . well . . . anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sound from an amazing band","review":"I can only give praise to this amazing album. From start to finish, the sound keeps you wanting more, the mysterious and vibrant sound of the band, capped off by the mesmerizing voice of Thorn Yorke defines this great album. It would be pointless for me to go over every single one of the songs of this album. Some of the highlights of this album:Paranoid AndroidNo SuprisesKarma PoliceThe TouristElectioneeringAlthough every single song brings a different element to your listening experience, I must say these get me excited everytime. If your an alternative rock/british rock fan, this album should already be in your collection. Too bad iTunes don't feel the need for Radiohead in its music store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album ever","review":"A truly masterpiece in every way. Seems like everyone hate it after the first listening, which I may understand, as it is very complex in terms of both melodies and the use of instruments. Actually, I hated it myself. I thought it sounded noisy the first time I heard it. But I listened to it again. And again. Belive me; It really grows on you. I belive that melodies that are hard to like, also becomes hard to dislike when you first like them. It takes time before the melodies on OK Computer hooks, but when it does, they'll never get out of your head.Although the album is perfect as an album, it also works as individual songs.My favoritte is Airbag. It's Probably the best song on the album, if not Radiohead's best ever. Wierd melody that really hooks when you have heard it for about 20 times, and the guitar-solo in the middle is just amazing. Inspiration from early Pink Floyd?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like nothing else I've heard.","review":"A transcendent piece. Other radiohead albums offer a lot to the listener, be it illogically catchy tunes, smashing rock riffs, or wildly successful experiments. This album is a little beyond all that. Some of the songs come together in unexpected ways. The complexity of the music is the reason it requires multiple plays before appreciation. The songs just don't make logical sense at first. But the consistent mood, the imaginative and yet oppressively powerful lyrics are what will make you love this piece.The lead singer's voice is like a weapon against pop culture in most songs. Virtually incoherent until you read the lyrics. Yet used in a way not often seen. To me it seems like the voice truly is another instrument in the song, and conveying words is secondary. Yet it yields that much more emotion when you understand the lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible Album","review":"This is a great album! It's the best of their first 3 albums, and a great turning point for their next two.

Hey, \\"I'm back to save the universe' sounds pretty upbeat, right? Ha. It's the perfect album to accompany a suicide. Some of the songs on this album actually hurt to listen to. But the pain feels so GOOD! 'Exit Music (For A Film)' makes me cry. 'Electioneering' makes me mad. 'Subterranean Homesick Alien' is the perfect song; I would buy the entire album for the part where Thom Yorke sings, \\"I'd show them the stars, and the meaning of lifel; they'd push me away. But I'd be all right.\\" That line kills me every time I hear it. 'Fitter Happier' makes me physically ill. At about the 'smiling baby in backseat' part, I feel as if I'm going to throw up, but I can't because than I'd have to stop the song. Like I said before, the pain is so GOOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OK Computer - One of the best of all time","review":"This CD is brilliant it has it all. This is the freshest CD I've ever heard except for perhaps Dark Side of the Moon.

I listened to it twice, the first time it gave me a headache, the second time I just skimmed the disc across the room. How can anyone compare this to Pink Floyd?! Listen to Wish You Were Here, Dark Side of The Moon, even Echoes if you want concept albums. There are many good bands coming out of the British music scene, in my opinion Radiohead are not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moaning, Miserbale music.","review":"Wow what a great album.Actually its fantastic musically, but for the rest of it, what a horrible moaning noise.You'll be so bored you'll wanna shoot yourself in the foot mid way through.Oh and \\"Fitter Happier\\" is rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Floyd They're not.","review":"This has got to be the most overrated albums of all time. The production is bad(you can hear the compression, and it's irritating), and the songs are a weak attempt to turn '70s classic rock into '90s alternative.What really gets to me is how anyone could compare this album to Dark Side Of The Moon. DSOTM was a masterpiece, this, is a travesty, a sham, and a Mockery.. It's a Traveshamockery."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is lame...","review":"Where's the rocking solos?

A few of the songs on here, like \\"Karma Police\\", \\"No Surprises\\" and \\"Exit Music for a Film\\" are OK, but I find Thom Yorke's singing voice to be really irritating. The lyrics are for the most part flat and obscure, and I don't find any \\"deeper meaning\\" behind them. The actual instrumental parts of the songs aren't bad, and I do like the experimentation with different sounds, but it often fails epically, like in \\"Fitter, Happier\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped Trash!","review":"How people can compare this piece of garbage to any pre-1987 Pink Floyd is something I will never understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explain why.","review":"Not a big brit music fan but was compelled to listen because of the buzz. Explain to me why this is so great. If there's a theme here i don't get it. Some decent guitar playing but that doesn't really make it a \\"Classic\\". I guess standards of excellence have to be lowered due to the lack of any real intelligence or passion in modern rock music. Buy a Shellac album instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people like this?","review":"Hey, I'm a big music fan. But this CD stinks. It's true It's true. I mean writing a song about how an airbag saved your life? Who cares? Tell me? Is there anyway an Android could be paranoid? It doesnt have feelings like humans and other animals. What about the other songs? Well, they are just filler. I mean this CD is pretty good but not as good as others. I think it deserves a spot on the top 100 records of the 90s, but you guys really overrate it with your biasness monkey boy. If you want real music get something else like heavy metal or hip-hop. That's emotional music. This is for college kids and softies."},{"rating":"1","title":"It seems 5% of people dont get it","review":"It seems 5% of people dont get it. Reading the 1 star reviews is quite fun but they dont get it. I think what OK computer did was took a conceptual non popular style to the masses, and people liked it. Good on emI'm sure it's not as conceptual as some music, and I'm sure that music is far less popular.Comparisons to floyd? Well i'm sure in the 70's their music was considered conceptual, but I'm also also sure they weren't the most conceptual around. Pink Flyods a great band, so are Radiohead. They both took a conceptual sound and made it pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn, Yawn, Yawn","review":"This band is nothing but hype. All of their songs are boring and this album is no different. For some reason a lot of guys buy it thinking it will somehow make them appear to be a little more intelligent than they really are and know a little more about music than they really do. In reality, it just proves that they are insecure and bought into the hype.While it is obvious a lot of time and money went into the making of OK Computer, music was not meant to be formulated this way. There is no substitute for raw talent, no matter how much time you spend on producing the album. This is the Backstreet Boyz and N'Sync without the dance tunes. It's factory-produced commercialism, believed by the music industry to be an instant money-maker so they gave it their stamp of approval and sent it on its way.Music is supposed to engage you, it's supposed to evoke emotion and pleasure. OK Computer is as bland as a blank computer screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just dont care for it","review":"I have tried many times to get behind this album. I have even tried to buy the hype. It just isn't that great. I dont even think it is good. I like the song Karma Police but that is it. One reveiwer is pointing out how we who give it a low rating must be musically immature. I disagree. I dont care for the album. Get over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha!","review":"That last review is a perfect example of what stuff like this will do to you. People who praise the hell outta this and tell people they're crazy for not liking it, are just as bad as the corporate pop fans they condemn. This band is by no means bad or untalented, I just really dislike them. But you certainly won't catch me listening to Top 40 pop anytime soon. For me, this album is not as good as people say it is. Neither is Dark Side of the Moon. Get Piper at the Gates of Dawn for a true Pink Floyd classic. And as for Radiohead, well I can make no reccomendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.......do yourself a favour and stick with 'The Bends'","review":"I got this album when it came out, and I thought it was amazing. I was wrong. You get to like this album very quickly, but, like a good old dance song, you get tired of it. Sure I think there are some good tracks but too many fillers.Most people I know who own this album for a while all say the same thing - the don't listen to it any more. Stick with The Bends - in my opinion THE album of the last 20 years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get it yet","review":"I don't get it yet.

I have listened to this over and over (I was told I'd have to in order to like it), and still do not consider this the brilliant work of art it's been made out to be. While this album has it's moments, I would definitely not consider it worthy of all the praise it has recieved. If Radiohead are considered so hard to like and get into, then why is it that they are as insanely popular as they are? I'm thinking that just because all the critics love them, the wannabe hipsters will naturally follow.

However, if you cannot appreciate very slow, melodic, and sometimes depressing songs, this disc isn't for you. While most of the disc is of the aformentioned style, there are a couple rockin' songs, one of which is Electioneering. But the meat of this disc is the beautiful, sweet sounding melodies that Thom Yorke and the gang have put together for the rest of the songs. No Surprises, Airbag, Exit Music, and especially Let Down, are all beautiful songs that you want to hear over and over again. A great disc from a great band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This album is my favorite. It works as an entire piece or song by song.

Seems as if they had been building up the sound in previous albums and released that sound at full magnum on OK Computer. Radiohead's sound captures the modern age (clean guitars, ufo like keyboards) and compliments their themes: alienation, isolation, control, society's many problems.Thom Yorke's voice is at its most effective, multi-tracking, soaring, the choir boy with an oppresed soul and his lyrics work with minimalistic defined depression. All the songs are of high quality and I especially like Subterranean Homesick Alien because of the effects and Electioneering for its power.Something has got to be said about Radiohead's use of artwork for their albums. Machinery, motorways and cold colors grace OK Computer but, in general, the point of each of their albums is highlighted by the artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely OVERRATED and OVERHYPED!","review":"I've heard 'OK Computer' enough to realize how utterly overrated, derivative, and hyped-up it is! This CD is anything but 'groundbreaking' or classic. All the sound schemes and progressions are nothing that hasn't been done better or with more passion and talent by progressive bands like Pink Floyd or The Church, who by the way, paint much more musical and moving soundscapes than the very mediocre Yorke and company! Besides, his drony, whiny voice gives me a migraine, much like the overrated bloke in 'Oasis'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money and wait for the new Janet Jackson","review":"This record is more than bad.

I know Dark Side of the Moon, Dark Side of the Moon is a friend of mine... trust me, OK computer is no Dark Side. There isn't a single memorable song on this sleepy bore. There is more memorable music in Time's guitar solo than this whole cd. The band sounds like they're on thorazine as they slip through one echo drenched yawner after another. that echo stuff gets old as it is listening to U2...why build a whole career out of copying it? wildly over-rated by those who haven't heard stuff from the 60s and 70s.

I would almost go as far to say that it is on a level that few albums or better yet few bands have ever reached or will ever reach. It paints a wonderful post-modernistic picture of what the world will eventually become. I must say that Radiohead has perfectly captured most all of the tension building themes in life that it takes sociologists and psychologists years to find and interpret. I am anxiously looking forward to a new album by this group. These past three albums have shown a wonderful evolution of this amazing band into something that is almost metaphysical."},{"rating":"2","title":"hyped trash???","review":"someone down the page called this hyped trash. i think that the backstreet boys are what \\"hyped\\" really is.

(Most of the other tracks are also truly great, especially, in my opinion, \\"Lucky\\" and \\"Karma Police\\").But I should warn you: it took me a few \\"listens\\" to really get into this album. Because it's so different (I mean original) and groundbreaking, you'll have to be patient. Listen to it three or four times and I garantee it will get to you.

EXCELLENT!","review":"I have heard OK Computer for two years now and, believe me, it feels like the first time you are listening to it. Some say they have some Pink Floydian influences (I think because it is, in some ways, a \\"conceptual\\" album, and because od the melancholy it spreads, like, for example, that great album that is Wish you were here).

Whilst there are some good songs on there, such as the melodic 'Karma Police', the rest of them are either dull, slow or just painfully average (\\"no surprises\\", \\"fitter happier\\" for instance). Maybe it deserves some credit for its poetic content, but the surrounding music is at times infuriatingly boring and similar. I like good music, and can appreciate a good work, but this, despite it's many positive reviews is one album that does not deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I like Radiohead","review":"This is for all the people that don't quite understand what the hype is about Radiohead and why I think they are great. The music is about lots of things and of course it will mean different things to different people and with that said this is what I get from them. Isolation, sick/affraid of technology (more apparent on latter albums) and all with unbelievable singing with great instruments playing along.So if you want to listen to something that doesn't take a brain to enjoy than by all means watch MTV and listen to the radio. Radiohead has something that most people will never get; they have talent. All that is needed is an open mind and repeated listenings. Peace and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"After listening to this cd and reading the bad reviews....","review":"I couldn't believe my eyes.

Radiohead have proved themselves better than the losers messing with their genius and high above them. They're pure genius and whether you like coldplay and startsailor and all that, I think they're the biggest posers next to the mainstream rock thing but still, if you like coldplay and all that you could easily but radiohead higher. Radiohead are my favourite band and this is probably their best album. Starting with airbag which get's you pumped to go the length of the rest of the cd with it's mean messed up style.

I didn't really enjoy listening to radio or buying cd's, but when I heard this cd I was so moved that it led to a renewed interest in music. Now, I can't stop exploring new artists and expanding my musical horizons, and I owe it all to this album.

I do not feel like describing this CD in great detail, my suggestion to you is to JUST BUY IT (or burn it if you have a CD burner)! You will be glad that you did. Frankly, I do not think Eric Feckzo listened to this album (at least not carefully), the entire CD is definitely not mellow and slow as he mentions. Just listen to Paranoid Android and Subterannean Homesick Alien, they all speed up and one point, Electioneering is also a somewhat fast song itself.

OK Computer is definitely solid throughout, but I would say that \\"Airbag\\", \\"Paranoid Android\\", \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\", \\"Let Down\\", \\"Karma Police\\", and \\"Climbing Up The Walls\\" are the standout songs. It would definitely not be a mistake to pick this album up."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"Breaking from the traditional guitar rock sound that followed from Radiohead's first two releases, Pablo Honey and The Bends, OK Computer is a beautiful and dark commentary on the sterility of computer technology and modern life.

I was a HUGE HUGE fan of THE BENDS. This album was more of a statement. It was an attempt (a successful) one to jump into the mind of the computerized society with the buzzing warmth of SUBTERRANIAN, the complex guitar lines of PARANIOID, and the obvious computer-boy in FITTER. My favorite is EXIT MUSIC. But if your looking for really beautiful, mood-enhancing (many moods, that is), and a full, mind-enchanting musical experience, get THE BENDS.

So, I figured I'd catch up with Radiohead. I'm listening to \\"OK,Computer\\" as I write this, and, honestly, wtf? It's gotten such great reviews. What am I missing? Sorry, but it seems like a mediocre album to me, one or two good songs (I really like \\"Karma Police\\"), but nothing like \\"Bends\\" (maybe nostalgia?, but this doesn't do anything for me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"People say it is good for a reason","review":"I must admit that as recently as year ago I would have been one of those people who would have complained endlessly about how over-rated Radiohead was. But then one day something magical happened, I actually listened to them, and I was utterly disgusted with myself for my ignorance. RADIOHEAD DESERVE EVERY BIT OF CREDIT THEY GET. Ok Computer is probably not their most accessible album but it may very well be their best and well worth ANY attempt you must make to realize this (buying every other Radiohead album just to get familiar with the band would NOT be too much).Although I would be the first to say that this is not an album to be listened to for any one song, anyone who doubts the musical brilliance that is Thom Yorke and Radiohead need only to listen to the song \\"Karma Police\\", quite possibly the best song I've heard since this album was released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gangsta Rap Is Born","review":"If you ever want to know where hot artists like Dre, Eminem, or Nasty Matthew got started, this is where to look. 2003 yall"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album for me","review":"It's one of these great Radiohead albums and the best !

If it never had gotten the attention it did, all those same people who diss it would have shrines for it & pray to it daily. It's the elitist way of life. But if you are a person who's actually interested in music & not social status, I'd advise you to get a pair of headphones, put this in, sit back & let it take you. Headphones work best if you want to get the full affect of such an amazing experience. Creativity & muse leap boundlessly from song to song & suck you into it's sprawling sonic entrypoint. Each instrumentally eclectic song is a work of art all on it own. There are moments of such intense beauty (Namely: The climax of \\"Let Down\\", The bass line of \\"Lucky\\", etc.) that it's almost unbearable & will send chills pulsing through your body. I once again emphisize using headphones oppose to a stereo or a computer, & turn the volume all the way up. Ok?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just here to boost the overall rating.","review":"I don't need to go into detail, I mean read some of the reviews that do. This album is the best from the 1990s and better than anything from the 80s or first half of this decade too. It's simply unbelievably good.Oh, and everyone buy Joy Division records."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Album in 1997","review":"When I heard this album at first, I fell asleep before all track ended. Listen to the verve's urban hymns. It is really PERFECT. OK Computer is the worst album in 1997. Of course, Radiohead is all-time the worst band. Frankly speaking, this album never have to take even 1 star. OK Computer is 0 star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album sickens me!!!","review":"I had to literally hold back vomit 10 seconds into this cd. I was afraid that I had somehow been infected by this trash and had to cleanse myself by listening to N*Sync. Only people trying to look sophisticated will buy this album. (look at meeee. I listen to radiohead...I'm sooooo coool!!) Thom Yorke tries so hard to imitate Avril Lavigne, yet fails so miserably. If you want a good album, buy any of N*Sync, Justin, Britney, Avril...you know, good music. I would give this a negative infinity stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bono gone flat","review":"It's got the keening long vocal style of Bono, but without the uplifting attempt at optimism. It's sort of Bono gone flat. No bubble, no tonic... It would be ok if it were *trying* to be dull but it's not, it's trying to be \\"significant\\" in the way Bono does. I don't like Bono at all, he postures and so does Radiohead. But in a less inspired way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This is a dissapointing album.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Rock","review":"Sorry everyone who's into this music but call it whatever you want , It ain't rock not by a long shot so how everyone calls themn the world's best Rock Band is beyond me ,This CD is an absolute snoozefest , This music was doen 25 yrs ago and WAAYYYYY better by Pink Flyod , I mean 10000x better with more talent creativty and feel , RadioHead is a very Boring , Overatated and pretentious band that appeals only to Yuppie Music Critics and wannabe \\"intellectual\\" college kids , Now Guns N Roses , That was a REAL rock n roll band ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"This is a very boring record by a very boring band. Radiohead are not good songwriters. I work at a record store and nobody I work with nor serious music listening customers like Radiohead. Who likes them? Yuppie music critics who write for corporate mags. and the yuppie college kids. I don't know. Nor do I care. I suggest passing on Radiohead and listening to music that has well crafted songs and exciting to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"The great sedative of the 90's","review":"I have never got the popularity of radiohead there music is about as exciting as a maths lesson because i actually put this on my cd player in the middle of a maths lesson and ended up turning it of because it was so BORING. I am sure they are talented but there albums are way overated especially this one which is no where near as goods as (What's the story) morning glory by oasis,parklife by blur which are classics brit-rock albums not this which is a perfect sleeping pill every song ploddes along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one of those \\"Let me expand your Mind\\" albums..","review":"Please skip this trash and buy some good music.

Old tricks copied from older bands. You will be disappointed if you only set your eyes on all the reviews that you hear and read here. The music is very pretentious and full of used tricks to cover up for their lack of skills. Newer rock music listeners they are easy to trick. They like this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Computer is not the real Avant Garde","review":"I recently listened to OK Computer, then I listened to some of John Lydon's stuff with PIL (Johnny Rotten), and PIL's music is vastly superior to Radiohead's music. PIL's music is the weirdest and most innovative music I have ever heard. The instrumental part of the music is far out, and so is the vocal part. OK Computer sounds like bad pop music by comparison, it is just whiny 90's shlock pretending to be Avant Garde. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but listen to PIL and then Radiohead doing OK Computer and you will see what I mean. I don't think the people who like OK Computer have good taste in music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thom Yorke Michael Stipe-What's the difference?","review":"If you're the type of person that ejacualtes over unoriginal, mellowdramatic, lackluster \\"music\\" , OK Computer is for you... but if you're the type of person that scoffs at the whole \\"troubled thoughts concerning the rich, angry lead vocalist vibe\\", then you will think this album wanks it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great work of art of the last 2000 years","review":"The last cd this good was Slayers Reign in Blood or Poison's Unskinny Bop.

ITS BRILLIANT!!!","review":"This guy played me the Bends and I thought it was great. Then he played me OKC. So I bought it. This album is beyond incredible. Its heavy, soft, fast, slow its everything. What Im trying to say is that this album makes you feel every possible emotion. From every line that is sung, to every note that is hit and to every drum that is pounded on, this album will stick with you till you die. The only album that I can think of that made me feel this way is GENESIS \\" the lamb lies down on broadway\\" and the pink floyd's \\"the piper at the gates of dawn\\". By the way, get these albums too. so in conclusion I believe Radio Head is one of the few bands of the nineties that will be producing quality music for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally original!","review":"I have found that this CD is like some kind of evil organism that at first you have to get used to, but before you know it, it's crawling deeper and deeper into your mind, making you obsessed with listening to it! I am absolutely amazed by this CD and I have never heard anything like it before. Everyone that I know who has listened to it has experienced the same effect...well...except for the teeny boppers who prefer Britney Spears classics like \\"Email my Heart\\"(don't ask how I know that title). If you're looking for a totally new kind of music, give this CD a spin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best albums of the nineties.","review":"Radiohead have come a long way since their debut. It does'nt get much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of the 1990's.","review":"There is no better example of a tighter, more creative, and more complete album produced in the 1990's, period. The flow of the album is incredible, and listening to it is an experience. It works well seperately - \\"Let Down,\\" \\"Karma Police,\\" \\"No Surprises,\\" and all the other songs can be great single-shot pick-ups in the middle of the day - but when placed all together in its designated order, it transcendes your usual music experience. And \\"OK Computer\\" heralded a complete redefinition of what rock 'n roll could be; rock was twisted, bent, reshaped, and emerged as a glorious and mind-blowing being in a way it never had before. \\"OK Computer\\" simply does no wrong: there is no \\"bad\\" track, no \\"stupid\\" or \\"frivilous\\" song. It is as close to musical perfection as could be attained in 1997, and has only been topped by subsequent Radiohead releases. Perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late Bloomer","review":"It would be easy to sit here and blow RH like countless others before me, but the truth is is I dismissed RH for YEARS as childish, self-pitying 'college rock' (in part because of an ex-girlfriend who loved pablo honey).Well, I was wrong. On a second listening to kid a i finally got it. Then came amnesiac (kid a II), and then o.k. computer. o.k. is not a flawless album (see fitter happier) but damn near close. what is amazing is the unabashed emotion that comes through RH wihtout ever sounding overly sentimental, and at times the sophisticated harmonics are nothing short of breathtaking.bring on the bends..."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO questions","review":"Perfect Album... even though it's not Radiohead's best... that title belong to The Bends"},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"Suffice to say, this is a beautiful recording. One can only hope for more quality music like this in the future from Radiohead. They can create sounds only other bands can dream about, and all the songs are very sincere. Maybe British people do have souls after all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great, album","review":"For my money, OK Computer is a good but overrated album. I personally feel that the Bends was a far superior album, which was demonstrated in the last Radiohead tour. Live, the Bends songs simply have a much more compelling presence; the OK Computer songs seem to confirm that this third album is better designed for late night contemplation than afternoon glory. However, I will grant that OKC has a few songs that will be all-time standards: \\"Paranoid Android,\\" \\"Let Down,\\" \\"Karma Police,\\" and \\"No Surprises.\\" If you don't have this, get this--but only after you get the Bends."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album Ever Made","review":"This is simply the greatest album ever made. I bought it in christmas '97, and within a few months, I bought Pablo Honey, and the bends. I am now a HUGE fan of radiohead, and can't wait for the new album. In the couple of years i've had it, i'd say it's been out my CD player for about a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earthshattering","review":"This is undoubtedly the most important album of the 1990's. It is majestically, eerily beautiful. The musical textures are exquisite; the lyrics are tragic and insightful, and the performance is flawless. A perfectly articulated alienation permeates this oeuvre and lends it an obviously timeless quality. Although my dad calls it \\"music to slit your wrists by,\\" I feel much the opposite: that humans can create art of this magnitude is quite heartening. Highlights include Paranoid Android, Subterranean Homesick Alien, Exit Music, The Tourist and Electioneering."},{"rating":"2","title":"This group is amazing!","review":"I'm new to Radiohead. The first CD I heard was The Bends, which blew me away, to say the least! Then I heard this one...wow! The whole thing is truly excellent, especially Lucky! Wow..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure brilliance","review":"Radiohead has outdone themselves this time. Their albums have gotten progressively better, OK Computer being the pinnacle. I do not know of any other CD composed as well as this one while maintaining originality and creativity. They have become my reference to good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one CD better . .","review":". . .and that would be Automatic for the People, REM's masterpiece. And this is a close call.Not that it matters.Automatic and OK Computer are, far and away, the best CD's ever recorded. So far above everything else it's scary. I buy/listen to everything under the sun. The drop-off is steep.The high water mark may have been reached. If you really get into this record, everything else - even decent stuff - sounds lame by comparison.Get this now. Do not pass go, do not collect $200, just go get it, listen, and marvel."},{"rating":"2","title":"strange, but not bad","review":"This album is much different than the kind of music that I usually listen to, because I tend to be into more straight-forward rock. However, I gave this a try, and it's got some very good qualities. It's a bit too haunting for my taste, and it's a bit depressing, but there are many songs here that surpise you, and that's something that hasn't happened in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Of The 90s","review":"The first time I heard this album I wasn't crazy about it. The next time I played it it still didn't strike me as being anything special. Fast forward one year and probably 75 listenings later, and I can safely say that this is my favorite album of all time (barely surpassing Pink Floyds' \\"Dark Side..\\" and various Beatles LPs). How good is this album? How often does a rock band, much less an \\"alternative\\" band without widespread acclaim, get a Grammy nomination for album of the year, as OK Computer did? This album takes the listener on a majestic audio road trip filled with soaring highs(\\"Let Down\\") and dark, haunting lows(\\"Paranoid Android\\"). As has been stated in other reviews, as great as the individual songs are, it is the collection as a whole, and the emotional peaks and valleys that go with each listen, that is the most satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK Computer, Radiohead","review":"OK Computer..what can I say? One of those albums where nothing is wrong..there are few of those..Besides this album is like a lot of years ahead...first i thought i would write about each of the 12 songs..but then i thought that it would be better if you download a song and listen to it. any song..and you won't be disappointed.. you'll probably order ok computer after that...thanks.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I just stumbled upon Radiohead, after hearing that they were \\"amazing\\" from a friend. I, out of the blue, decided to give OK Computer a try, and since then, my musical life has changed. Ok Computer is probably the most beautiful album I have ever heard. The vocals are incredible, even though they may seem drawn-out and tired-sounding. OK Computer has many layers thoughout, not to mention quick changes in the tempo. I am not really sure what the overall message of this album is, but I do know that it is one to check out. You won't wanna miss out on this delicate listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Masterpiece","review":"In a time when things seem cheap and nothing seems as brillaint or delicate as what the masters of composition have done, this proves that recent generations have something to offer the world besides cheap manufactured pop tunes.This is such a dynamic album. There are so many emotions and messages displayed and there is a song for every mood.The production on this album is in a word, gorgeous. I have this album on heavy rotation, and trite as it may be, think it totally rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever British Rock Recording?","review":"Probably yes.Multiple subtle layers of melodic story telling, without ever being soft, or fake. New sounds and rythems emerge every time you play the record after some time.This one goes straight into your heart & mind, for most songs never to leave again. And most songs are getting even better by the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is superb","review":"This album is very well made, I admire the aura Radiohead gives off. Not one of hope, but not one of despair. Brilliant. And to those who feel us Radiohead fans are being the kid that worships the abstract because it perfectly describes our thirst for understanding... you know you're wrong, and you knew you were wrong when you wrote that. If we wanted that, we would have wrote reviews for simple plan, but of course we didn't. Radiohead fans are past this stage of \\"understanding\\". We don't look for comfort in miseducation, we look for comfort in music. Real, sensible, sculpted music. Keep looking for excuses, we'll keep laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe it's a good album","review":"This actually is a good album. For the people who gave it bad reviews, well you aren't listening close enough. Radiohead isn't the kind of music you can just kind of play in the background and like and understand. It takes a few times of actually buckling down and listening to it. A lot of people have said this...and as snobbish as they sound, they are right.The other thing is, a lot of people like to compare the four bands: Radiohead, Travis, Coldplay and Keane. Then a lot of other people like to say they have totally different sounds. But I can certainly hear the Travis in this album especially, and the Coldplay shines through too...only Coldplay is catchy-er and easier to listen to. Lastly, don't give up on this album- it's great and you'll appreciate it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Overrated Album","review":"The few dissenters who can't believe the hype this album got are bang on - this is one of the most overrated albums that I can remember. A good album, but not great ... and definitely not of \\"legendary\\" status as some would have us believe (and yes, I did give it the compulsory 10+ play-throughs on the CD player). Their previous album, \\"The Bends\\", is a far, far superior album - no question about it.If you are looking for \\"Album of the Year for 1997\\", I would suggest looking past this album, and on to Catherine Wheel's \\"Adam & Eve\\". There is NO comparison - listen to each album 10+ times, and I challenge anyone to disagree with me on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most intelligent album EVER!","review":"Yeah, I'm a teenager, I listen to the kaiser chiefs, i dont think the arctic monkeys are over rated and i dont mind fallout boy. But if there's one thing i truly DO appreciate, it's OK Computer, possibly the best album ever created, yes everyone says it, but it's true.But how can you not fall in love with this album? there's so many things i love about it! the anthemic karma police! the energy of electioneering! no surprises! subterranean homesick alien! and of course, the seven minute paranoid android, which makes bohemian rhapsody look like britney spears. It's just so dark, so epic, and i love the lyrics.Yeah, OK computer's on 4 1/2 stars, but who cares? we all know it's amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not going to be very popular for this...","review":"but radiohead is simply not as good as they should be. And before you all go off half-cocked, telling me that I \\"don't understand\\" or \\"don't see the hidden genius,\\" let me explain something to you: There is a fine line between hidden genius and a Brittish man crying into a microphone. Radiohead is, unfortunatley, the latter. And believe me, I tried to like them. I bought this album, painstakingly listened to each song, and it just didn't do it for me. I am giving this album two stars, however, because \\"No Surprises\\" Is a wonderful song, and I'd hate to condemn it along with the rest of the garbage on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"beyond great...","review":"quite possibly the greatest album ever, but definitely one of the greatest albums of the 90's. very rarely in my life have i heard a record that flows as this one does. the songs are incredible. the moods they create through the lyrics and music are simply amazing. the passion in thom yorke's voice is breath-taking and he really pulls you in when you listen. highlights on this album include 'let down', 'exit music', 'karma police', 'no surprises', 'the tourist'....basically every song. purchase the record...you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radiohead is the worst band on earth.","review":"Radiohead sucks. The lead singer looks like a retard with his head bobbing around. Their music is boring too. You can tell how bad a band is when they are worshipped by rock critics and pseudo intellectuals who think they are on \\"the cutting edge of rock music\\" just because they like Rdaiohead. Stay away from Radiohead folks. They are BORING. BORING, BORING, BORING!!! I can't stress that word enough.If you want to listen to something more entertaining than Radiohead, here's what to do: go turn on your TV. Change it to a channel with nothing on it. One of the channels with \\"snow\\" on it. Just turn that up and listen to it. Even that is more entertaining than this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"no redeeming qualities...every song sucks","review":"No redeeming qualities....every song sucks.

Some of your songs are so bad I started laughing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree..should be packaged with NoDoze","review":"I listened to the samples and that was enough. It sounds like it would be a decent album, but it only has this many stars because of the fans. Right off the top of my head, I can think of 3 albums from the 90's that are better. Tonic - Lemon Parade, and Stone Temple Pilots first two albums. It's a shame...this generations music is so unfortunate. There are no musicians anymore. Try some 70's and 80's. Those were the best decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of the end...","review":"This marked the beginning of the bands, \\"hey... let's try anything regardless of how obnoxious it is\\" style.

From the opening song \\"Airbag\\" , to \\"paranoid android\\" to \\"Karma Police\\", it takes you to another world, then back, then to a different one. There is no way to describe this record or catagorize it. THe only way is to sit back, pop it in and push play. Listen from begining to end and dont skip anything. Its unlike anything you have heard, or ever will hear. It is my 2nd favorite album of ALL time. Not an easy accomplishment might i add. I have three words for any doubters out there. Buy This Album.

Music for the heavens. It has a few under achieving tracks , but the're by no means bad, and help make the brilliance that is 'OK Computer'. You guessed it - 5 STARS!I think in 2035 this album will be regarded as the Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" is now.A spectacular timeless piece of music, and a perfect mirror (or witness?) of its time.What more can be asked from a \\"pop\\" album?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another review.","review":"I'll keep this short and sweet- this is one of those albums that you you'll be proud to have in your collection. The first time you listen, the album seems to have a depressive ambience, but after you listen to it a couple more times, you realize that this album really is a work of art. The lyrics are awesome, the guitar playing is awesome, Thom Yorke's voice in Exit Music seems to come from inside your head. It's hard to pick a favorite song out of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"No other CD I'd rather review","review":"There is no other album that has affected me as much as OKC. Yes, that includes Dark Side of the Moon (Pink Floyd). You get lost in this CD, the way you expect music to take you away. Yorke's voice is operatic, and the crescendos are magnificent in each of the songs. The structural changes are bizarrely different, yet make total sense as you hear them.This is my favorite album of all time. For good reason. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must have it","review":"Vinyl is an excellent way to hear Radiohead, a band wich deserves be heared with a high definition and clarity in each sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Single best CD of The 90's.","review":"Some say 'Nevermind' by Nirvana is the king of the 90's hill, but my vote goes towards Radiohead's brilliant 1997 release OK Computer. Though nearly 3 years old, I'm still listening to it. The cd is just so amazing in it's simplicity, and yet overwhelming with it's technicality. Every instrument in the Radiohead arsenal is brought out and used to it's best extent, whether it be the atmospheric strings on 'Climbing Up The Walls' or the acousic crescendo of 'Exit Music [for a film].' The album plays like an epic, an examination of post modern society that isn't as 'post modern' as we'd like to think. This album further continues the experiment they began with 'The Bends.' Radiohead has progressively became the greatest band I have ever heard. [This coming from a guy who used to say the same thing about Beck.] Radiohead is now one of the most vital entities in music today. And I'm already obsessively gathering info from the band's official site about the next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"a truly great album","review":"having not listened to popular music for the second half on the 90s, I missed on this.

I just dont get it. There are 2 songs I do like on here, 'Paranoid Android' and 'No Surprises'. In fact, 'No Surprises' is probably the most beautiful song I've ever heard.

Now, I will admit, there's a song on here with a cool animated video (not sure which one) where a little kid and his friend shuffle around town and climb up a flagpole and harass a fat guy and stuff, and I like that aspect of this album! But otherwise, it's pure overblown and overindulged garbage, for people who attend college only!Another thing I don't like is the whiny lead singer who needs voice lessons, or maybe some therapy.I liked this band better when they were grunge, as on the first album.Well, I'll talk to you later."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be -100 stars if i could","review":"Radiohead=crapThank You to those A-holes who rated it well and made me buy this cd.

The editorial on Amazon even compares it with the major works of Pink Floyd. But don't let them fool you. Just like the rest of these bands of the 90s, listening to one would mean listening to all. There's basically not much difference between them. These bands have no soul nor any creativity and frankly they don't even the slightest trace of the spirit of rock. hype about these bands were just created by media for commercial sake. They are totally overblown.

Some may dismiss radiohead as just another loud alternative band, but this is truly a thoughtful, mature album. Every song is enjoyable and special in its own way. \\"Lucky\\" is my favorite song on this album and is one of the best they've ever done. \\"No Surprises,\\" \\"Paranoid Android\\" and \\"Karma Police\\" are other standouts and like the Foo Fighters, radiohead also has several excellent videos, including the ones for these four songs. One publication voted this as the best album of all time, which the band, and myself included, thought was stupid. I think it was just a popularity contest at the time. However, this is ONE of the best of all time and I highly recommend it. It is the band's masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"I loved this CD so much I bought it for my cousin for his birthday so he could listen to this great album.

Many things, but you just know an album is great when it is consistent and puts out more than 2 or 3 amazing tracks. I count nine memorable songs in this album that are not filler songs; they are each unique, amazing and have their own following of fans who argue over who's favorite is the best song on the album. If any one of these songs were made by a new band it would instantly be that band's \\"Creep\\" one-hit-wonder.Another thing I have to say about the artwork: nothing short of spectacular. Several pages of post-modernist abstract and figurative excellence are packed into the booklet and enhance the experience of the album.

Saxon were a fist-pumping, headbanging heavy metal band from Britain. They never really hit it big in America, like most of the NWOBHM bands, but attained a large following in England. I feel this band is terribly underrated, and this album is one of the best albums of the early eighties. The title track is a true headbanger's anthem, which gives homage to the club beginnings of Saxon themselves. This is one of those headbanger's albums that will always live strong in the hearts of metalheads, even though they were not a commercial success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Saxon","review":"I can't be bothered to explain why I think this album is so good.

The sound is poor. This does not sound remastered to me at all, very low volume, you really have to turn the sound up and it's very thin with too many highs.Save your money on all these 80's reissues from Saxon 2009.One star for the sound Five stars for the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denim & Leather","review":"I've been a Saxon fan - really the first seven albums - since about 1981. It is refreshing to listen to vocals and music that retain the realism of music that hasn't been polished to the point of unrecognizability. I was thrilled to find CD replacements for my vinyl and cassettes. (Those were the things on which old-timers listened to music, they weren't even digital).Saxon's 4th album, \\"Denim & Leather\\", came out in 1981. The song \\"Denim and Leather\\" received quite a bit of air time on the radio stations back then. It seems to be the only song that a lot of aging metal-heads remember from Saxon. The rest of the album is pretty good too. \\"Denim & Leather\\" comes in at #4 on my Saxon top 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saxon rocks","review":"Saxon is not a well known band but they rock in the same tradition as ACDC, Airbourne, UFO etc. Dont buy this album unless you really feel like rocking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fianlly got rid of the bottle","review":"My daughter(2) and nephew(3) loved it since the first moment they saw it...

At first when dinking they would leak but it's becasue since the tip is not flat whatever milk that came through and not drank by the child it would spill, but my daughter got a hang of it and won't take it out until she clears the milk that it left on the tip of the sippy so now that is not a problem any more.

The 4th of July parade appears perfectly real because it was real - you couldn't have staged such realism. The rodeo scenes are beautifully terrifying. The humor is nice and easy, not over-the-top. And Steve is in fantastic condition, spry as a young cat, though he was in his early-40s when it was filmed.Make popcorn, sit down with your kids, turn it on, and get your mind off the whole world for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"need some enhancements","review":"The book is not well organized even though the organization is very important for such a book with a lot of contents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good textbook","review":"As a computer engineering senior with a strong interest in image processing and vision, I found this book very helpful.The exemples are varied and interesting, the maths are easy to understand and the design is very clear. Obviously, it supposes the reader has some mathematical background, but nothing impossible for an undergraduate student.It is also very complete: it goes from very basic image processing concepts (defining pixels, the RGB format) to more complex topics like pattern recognition and wavelet compression."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK book for 1st or 2nd year undergrads","review":"I am giving this book 4 stars because it's quite descriptive and easy to follow. It covers some of the basic concepts behind digital image analysis and touches on the more general signal processing concepts, but it doesn't go very deep into the actual math. This may be what you want, but for me it was an assigned text for a 4th year undergrad course I took in college, and I found it inadequate. I felt like I could have written this book before I even started the class. At the same time, though, I think it would have been a great text for a more entry-level course.If you want a text that goes in further detail and provides some math to chew on, I have to recommend the \\"Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing\\" by Anil K. Jain.

MUST BUY!","review":"Where to begin, first I have wanted this cd ever since I got into SOULFLY, SEPULTURA, C.C. So for about 4 years, and finally got it. It sounds like a mix of Godflesh+White Zombie. I read the reviews on amazon and most were right on. H E A V Y AS HELL! If you are a fan of any of the bands I listed so far pick it up. Its Sepultura Godflesh style! Not a bad track on the cd, I usually lift weights to metal so as long as its loud and angry it works for me and this sure does it.Wish they made more albums like this.

I along with the other classmates I have spoken with, do not think this is a useful book. It presents few examples, is not consistent with variable symbols all the way through, and overall if used requires supplemental materials. It is not aesthetically pleasing AT ALL!! For example, Lesson 7 on Validity uses the three varying symbols of theta to mean multiple things and they are not the same font (theta with a hat is not bold and bigger than the other theta's and the two other theta values are bold and small). Also, make sure you get the third corrected edition or it has multiple mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"copy of CD","review":"This text is not much more than a black and white copy of everything on the companion CD. It's most useful as map to help you wade through the CD, which is too confusing for words. If you buy the CD, you'll probably need the book to help navigate the mess (there are so many things to click on each screen that you never know if you've found everything). On it's own, it isn't a great text. There's no glossary of terms, which would have been great since terms are poorly defined in the text. Throughout the book all explanations and discussions center around one case (Sydney Beach Users study), which makes it hard to understand how the concepts apply outside of that one case. This book moves along too quickly without taking the time to really lay out what each concept is. Also, some terms are used interchangeably or for more than one thing, which becomes confusing. Horribly confusing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Epi Book","review":"This book is relatively basic.

The heavy metal beats and riffs are mixed with the easily transitional vocals of Rob Flynn. His coarse voice sends out the strong lyrics with tremendous power and his skilled guitar playing adds to the music. This CD has the incredible Logan Mader on Guitar, Adam Duce bringing in the bass and pelting out backup vocals, and Chris Kontos banging on the drums with quickness and style. This CD shows that metal bands can incorporate thier own style into the music to give them difinative originality and style."},{"rating":"1","title":"tomato plants","review":"These tomato plants arrived quickly and unharmed.

Newman and Taylor shine in the lead roles as an alcoholic ex-athlete and his money grubbing sexpot of a wife.

Sounds like Foghorn Leghorn channelling Leon Redbone. I broke up laughing at how bad it was.Agreed, this is much better than the Taylor-Newman-Ives Hollywood piece.

Taylor and Newman have to be the sexiest stars to ever light up a screen and Ives is the scene stealer supreme. Visually its like a soap opera as 90% of the story is in the big house. But the words that come rushing out of these marvelous actors isn't about just sex, its about life and everything that makes life worth living. These classic faces and this classic storytelling put this film on par with the best art ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor and Burl Ives.

Although the references to homosexuality are hinted at; a person not familiar with the play may not catch them. Otherwise it is an excellent movie. Gore Vidal says This is a movie where Ms. Taylor made a white slip one of the most noticeable pieces of underwear. \\"This is not a direct quote, but more or less accurate of what Mr. Vidal says."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest!","review":"I saw this film for the first time in my life today and I could not get over Williams' brilliance!

Credit is needed for the original playright(although I am aware the plot was altered to please the strict critics of the time), who along with the screenplay writers are as important as the actors.Speaking of actors, Liz Taylor, Burl Ives and Paul Newman were all flawless in their roles. They were human, and as a painting they were more real than reality. My opinions of the characters changed continually throughout the film. It was as if you were peeling away the skin layer by layer to find the truth. Annoyance turned into hate, hate turned into compassion.The most important element of this film was feelings;emotions the players have, and have to deal with.

Unfortunately, Brick's married to Maggie the Cat (Taylor) who hasn't favored him with children yet. Cooper's got a bunch of 'no neck monsters' which puts him in favor.\\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\" is one of Tennessee Williams' most powerful plays. They couldn't have acquired a better cast then the one they did. The lines are sharp as razors despite being delivered with molasses slow Southern grace. Definitely one to watch with a mint julep in your hand.Rebecca Kyle, October 2008"},{"rating":"2","title":"This, at least, is the real story.","review":"This play is about a woman trying to redeem her husband who is drinking himself to ruin because he can't deal with the fact that he was in love with his dead football buddy - another man. If you watch this version, that's what you'll see. Sadly, the Paul Newman version was made in a time when it wasn't OK for Maggie to try to help her man own up to his love for his friend, so instead, the story became about her trying to save him from alcoholism. This is a much less dramatic topic, and it's frankly dull and offensive to a beautifully written story. It's like telling \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" as a story about the perils of packing a picnic basket, without any mention of a big bad wolf. If you want to see the fabulous play Williams actually wrote, get this one. If you just want to look at nice acting in a badly mangled, lame story, get the older one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof","review":"I really did not enjoy this movie.

Newman as the Stage Manager is completely in charge, and does not succomb to sentiment. A reader, or viewer, who thinks this play is sentimental, may stand corrected, especially when dismissed by Newman at the end of the production.

Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The 1940 film version remains the BEST","review":"The 1940 film version of the 1938 play remains the BEST with an ending that playwright Thornton Wilder approved of.

Instead as I read it I found most of it was watered down basics of the foundation of \\"wiccan magick\\" and I would suggest many other books for a beginner before this one; which was written with out the background information. Overall I found that it didn't say anything particularly refreshing, ingenuitive or really thought provoking to keep me interested. One of my disagreements with this book was a chapter on stones/crystals that was very inadequate. If you like to read books that sound more like folklore then magick or a path to spirituality rather then a little stroll in the lifeless park of religion then you might just Like this book a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good looking book!","review":"This book is the perfect follow up to Wiccan Mysteries.

Wicca was created by Gerald Gardner in the 1950's, Aleister Crowley didnt even agree that he should do this in fact crowley had other plans for what Gardner should do. As for cunningham he didnt jump on the wagon until much later. Cuningham did change wicca alot by presenting the solitary path but he was far from having anything to do with creating it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative,indispensable,and flawed all at once","review":"Raven Grimassi has given us a book which does something few books ever do. He actually explains the HErmetic Mysteries in SIMPLE, DIRECT LANGUAGE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND! However, there are times when he seems to contradict himself, which I imagine is the fault of Llewellen's bad editing. Also, in explaining the passage of power from one plane to another, he uses a metaphor which assumes that the hierarchies of our society are somehow mirrors of an Astral Hierarchy. Other than a few little glitches, the book is very informative, thought mainly for experienced practitioners. Beginners might get a bit confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick, run from this product supplier","review":"On June 1st, I came to Amazon and found what I thought was a \\"deal\\" for a Fram PH7328 Extra Guard Passenger Car Spin-On Oil Filter (Pack of 2).

ALL the characters are unlikable (even themain characters Gyles and Cornelia) and nobody talks like these people. Thedialogue is stitled and when it tries to be funny it's just embarrassing. I was constantly lost and trying to make heads or tails out of this. To make matters worse the author introduces characters quickly and (after a number of pages) explains who they are and what they ahve to do with the story! AND he gives constant long paragraphs to explain what a certain place looks like. Why? Also if Cornelia had said \\"My Goddess\\" just ONE more time I would have screamed!

On the negative side, I would have liked to have seen more dialogue with Lolly Spindrift and I was annoyed at how much he \\"dumbed down\\" Al Rogoff. Any true Archy McNally fans will be very disappointed at how stupid Al is portrayed in this latest novel and as anyone knows, Archy would never associate with someone that \\"low rent\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy.","review":"This entry in the McNally Saga is a bit of a let-down -- especially coming right after Lardo's \\"McNally's Dilemma\\" which is probably the all time best McNally novel. In \\"McNally's Alibi\\" we get to see Archy take leave of his senses. The only time he seems to do anything right is in trying to pick up Officer Georgy O'Hara, which he does quite nicely. I agree with those who think Connie Garcea needs to take a hike. That one has outlived her welcome. It is time Archy got a new love interest.Hopefully what we saw in this novel won't happen again.If you really must read this book then do so.

At this age (1) babies should have fun more than anything, their brains need stimulation, this toy most definatly does that.

Poor choice, she is no Russian, if you ask me.

I have no idea why anyone gave it rave reviews.First, Keira Knightley's performance was simply over the top. Her character didn't seem crazy; it seemed totally freakish and weird. It was as if Knightley was over-exaggerating every word and every action. So much so that it was hard to watch her without wanting to laugh at how ridiculous her acting was.Then, the relationship between Keira Knightley and Michael Fassbender (Carl Jung in the movie) was so bland and boring that you could not even imagine the supposed passion they had for one another. Lastly, every time Jung and Freud (Viggo Mortensen) met, I had to fight not to fall asleep because their conversation was beyond mundane.Definitely don't waste your money or time on this film. You can earn more money but you can never get back the 90 mins you will spend watching this dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"This movie should have been good because there were some really great actors in it like Keira Knightly and Michael Fassbender but it was just slow, overacted in some parts, underacted in others, and weak with the point.

Her attempt to portray a psychologically damaged patient in a mental hospital was amateurish at best. It was like watching a bad high school stage production in which the immature actress completely overacts. What was so hard to watch was that she was so obviously acting - you try as a film viewer to suspend belief and get absorbed in the roles of the film. However, when the acting is so bad all you see is someone pathetically attempting to act and nothing more. My wife and I kept on looking at each other and shaking our heads before we finally threw in the white towel of surrender in order to spare us another minute of experiencing an actress way over her head and unable to bring the least bit of subtlety to what could have been an interesting film."},{"rating":"1","title":"wanted to like it but didn't","review":"i wanted to like the movie because of the stars (although more the guys than the girl). but found it slow, stilted and uninteresting. it's too bad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done! Well done for a historical drama!","review":"Keira Knightly really pulls this movie together and gives it a sexual charge. In addition, the script deals fairly with a very dark and controversial issue between Jung, Freud and a patient of Jung's. By turns, Jung and Freud are both humiliated and somewhat redeemed. It reminded me of the film, \\"When Nietzsche Wept\\". Jung's final line in the movie rings truer and more compassionate than any other film dealing with adultery: \\"Sometimes a man has to do something un-forgivable just to go on living...\\"Enter: The creative birth of the wounded physician."},{"rating":"1","title":"History is changed","review":"This is an example of Hollywood revriting history. Are people so ignorant? All they need is provvide good looking actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by Overacting & Gratuituos Kinkiness","review":"I have never thought of Kiera Knightly as an especially talented actress, but her overacting in this movie put her even lower in my estimation. Her overacting was definitely one of the contributing factors to ruining the movie for me. Her bodily contortions and over-the-top facial expressions during the first third of the movie were so ridiculous and distracting that they could have been featured in a Saturday Night Live skit.Beyond that, I can't help but think that the sado-masochism so emphasized in this movie was gratuitous and done to make it more shocking and, thus, appealing to the masses. How many times did we need to see Jung smacking Spielrein's naked buttocks?So, unless you're a masochist like the character Spielrein I wouldn't recommend you watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously over acted yet still dull","review":"Yuck. I rented this movie to pass a rainy afternoon. Watching the rain fall would be more exciting. I am embarrassed for Knightly. The real puzzle is how this got good ratings on Rottentomatoes.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsexy","review":"The most unsexy sex I've seen since a comedy involving falling on a bannana peel and knocking over lamps. With all the Victorian layers of clothing and sexual repression, what fun this movie could have had slowly peeling away the layers. Instead we get the opposite of eroticism- sudden shots to the middle of a sex scene that could not possibly be less erotic. Middles are never good- show us the beginning. There's no foreplay. It's ironic because the rest of the movie is so slow that when slowness is needed, it's fast! In addtion, there is bad acting all around. Keira especially overacts so much i couldnt bear it. Everones accent is wrong. Dialogue slow. False Embellishments to the real story of freud vs jung. Also .Not a single redeeming feature. Cant' believe i paid 13 bucks for that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I enjoyed the movie itself alot as I am into psychology, but the quality of the movie...notsomuch! I streamed the movie and it kept jumping back to the beginning or freezing up the entire time. It ended taking me almost four hours to watch the whole thing piece by piece. I intend to rent or purchase the movie and watch again in the very near future without interruption. This was my first time streaming a movie from Amazon and I was less than pleased and will most likely not do it again...fail!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I really enjoyed the excellent acting skills of all the players. It was a riveting tale and kept me spell bound."},{"rating":"1","title":"sum of the parts is greater than the whole","review":"I like all of the actors in this movie in other things that I have viewed, but hated this film.The characters were exaggerated and farcical reproductions of people. I found it impossible to relate to or sympathize with them. It was surprising how unlikeable they all were. I keep waiting for some redeeming scene or quality to emerge and was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Overlooked Gem","review":"Immaculately filmed and edited by David Cronenberg, this film was inexplicably ignored at awards time although all three New York Times critics picked it in multiple categories. All five performances are outstanding. Keira Knightly is brave and touching. Michael Fassbinder is perfect as the repressed and conflicted Jung. Viggo Mortensen, playing against type, steals the show as the suave and wary Freud. A film for grown-ups that may well lead them back to reading about these seminal historical figures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie Great Video","review":"It was a little hard to watch the first part of the film but it turned out to have a satisfying ending.The video was great with a 1:85 aspect ratio. Very crisp with beautiful cinematography. Sound was great as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dangerous method","review":"I expected more from this movie. I'd love to see interplay between Dr.Freud and Dr. Jung, but I was disappointed. I put Dr. Jung on a pedestal as a model of spirituality because of his devotion to helping the first alcoholics receive information about their illness. Dr. Jung is quoted in the Big Book of Alcoholic Anonymous -- the medical knowledge. Dr. Freud - well he abused cocaine probably distorted his view of spirituality. I would like to see something between these two great men again in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"jung vs freud","review":"the movie follows the development of freud and jung's relationship over a decade. the movie nicely depicts the narcissism of freud and his difficulty tolerating anyone who was not an avid admirer or who challenged his beliefs. unfortunately freud served as model for the development of psychoanalysis. jung challenged freud and was excommunicated from freud's church. keira knightly plays a patient of jung's who he stops therapy with and then beds...somewhat similarly to freud bedding his sister-in-law in terms of boundary violations. a dangerous method is a good name for remnants of psychoanalysis still in existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed that it was a library cd. It still had all the library information. When I finish I like to give to my library but felt I could not do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL","review":"I wantd this to be better, the cast was amazing...and yet such an interesting subject was presented in such a boring way, it felt like a T.V. movie. Very uninspired and overall a shame. The few scenes where there was actual sex involved were far and few, and felt staged. Not much more to say other than its renter at best. Again, I love all three actors...but they were given nothing to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always funny","review":"I've never read a Dortmnder novel that failed to make me laugh outloud. Westlake had the magic touch for believable criminal highjinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dortmunder Book","review":"I have read all but a few of Westlake's Dortmunder series and I love them all. But without a doubt \\"Good Behavior\\" is the funniest. Landing in a convent with nuns who have taken a vow of silence is just the beginning. The usual crew of bungling crooks are all here and they are fumbling all over the place. If you like Donald Westlake's books, I know that you will enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for its time.","review":"Biohazard were definitely original back in the day. Unfortunately whatever impact this album may have has been softened up by the influx of rap/rock bands who are mere shadows of the fore-fathers of the genre. That said, if any of you are wary of this thing called \\"rap-rock,\\" Biohazard is your best bet. These guys did it first, they did it the right way, and this record holds true even 10 years after its release. Uncompromising, undisguised, and unabridged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone please gives these guys a hug.","review":"I shouldn't be judging music that I know little about, but jesus, this is probably the worst album in my collection. When I was about 13 I read up about Biohazard and how they have tough lives on the streets and all that jazz, so I thought I'd buy their record to hear what the hood sounds like to angry white men. I'm sorry, but maybe they should spend a few more years on the streets and buy some decent drugs while they're at it. I'm into all types of music, even alot of heavy stuff, believe it or not, but Biohazard to me just sucks. The lyrics are awful, the instrumentation is actaully decent, but the whole sound is just anger. It annoys me that these guys don't seem to feel any other emotion than that, and that's why I give this album a 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Not Deicides best album. They focused to much on brutality. The songs are all pretty good though. The best ones are Dead But Dreaming, Trifixion, In Hell I Burn, and Holy Deception. Its Quite good but i would buy once upon the cross first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar death metal album","review":"I think that Legion by Deicide is simply the best death metal album, period. It is certainly the best offering from Deicide by far. The vocals are Glen Benton's best, extremely brutal yet intelligible, unlike, say Chris Barnes's. The guitars are amazing as are the drums. I don't know about the bass because you can't hear it in the mix. Lyrics are typical stupid satanic stuff, about what you'd expect from these guys. The factor that makes this album stand above the rest is the complexity of the rhythm patterns employed in the song structures. Offbeat syncopation gives a jarring feel to otherwise straightforward speed riffs. If you are into death metal, you need to own this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't really like it","review":"I love death metal, and some of Deicide's albums, but I can't really get into this one, not that it [stinks], but I just don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"technical but boring","review":"This album is fast, brutal, has excellent recording, precise guitar riffs, and perfect drumming. The only drawback however, and it is a HUGE one, is that there is hardly a good song in sight.Decide's first record was very promising. The songs were great. It had mezmerizing, chanting, sing-along-with-satan, kind of tunes. The songs on Legion, and most of their records since then however, are just boring. You know those heavy records that are just boring, repetive walls of sound? Well throw Legion into that category.Here's some advice to the band - nobody cares how technical or fast your riffs are if the songs aren't good. I highly recommend buying their self-title first CD instead. Despite inferior recording quality the songs are MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant.","review":"I love metal but this album is the same one benton already made twice before and is still making now....even the generic riffs are the same!!!! LAME"},{"rating":"2","title":"A POWERFUL STATEMENT","review":"THIS IS A CLASSIC DEATH METAL ALBUM BY DEICIDE AND I CAN SAY THAT THIS IS A REALLY ENJOYABLE ALBUM. I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST HEARD \\"SATAN SPAWN, THE CACO-DAEMON\\" I FELT LIKE I SHOULD BE OUTSIDE SACRIFICING GOATS RATHER THAN SITTING IN MY ROOM LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM. BUT ALL SATANIC IMAGERY ASIDE DEICIDE IS A REALLY BRUTAL BAND THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO MOSH AND HEADBANG. ALTHOUGH, I WILL ADMIT THE LYRICS ARE STARTING TO GET OLD, DEICIDE IS STILL A REALLY GOOD BAND AND I HOPE IN TORMENT IN HELL DOESNT SUCK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Poor musicianship, uncomplicated riffs and boring drumz make for a death metal release that is mediocre at best. Get suffocation, cryptopsy or hypocrisy instead of this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best....their worst","review":"Deicide is one of my favorite bands, but I never listen to this CD. It just isn't very good. I think they tried too hard to be brutal and forgot to be good. Poor arrangements. Chaotic. Sounds very rushed. If your looking to get into Deicide, buy anything other than this. My fav's in order: Deicide, Serpents, Insin, Once, Legion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh... I've heard worse, and much better","review":"Boring thrash riffs, repetitive and unimaginative drumming, stoopid lyrics and one of the most average vocalists in death metal. Legion is a flat unchanging drone from beginning to end, not unlike listening to a vacuum cleaner that occasionally changes from high to low. The guitar sound is an unimpressive weak buzzing, like radio static, heavy it's not. Back in the day this album was impressive, but listening to it (again) today I find there's really not a whole lot to Legion other than the speed. It doesn't hold up. I never really \\"got\\" Deicide anyway. Their music never propelled or moved me, unlike Morbid Angel or Death or many other American extreme metal bands of the early 90's. Ultimately Legion and Deicide aren't that interesting to me musically and the poorly concieved fascination with Satan comes across as cheesy. I'm afraid Legion is an unimaginative album from an average band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deicide is boring","review":"I realy do not like this worthless band along with their sorry and worthless albums! Deicide's \\"legion\\" is by far? the worse deliver by a \\"deathmetal\\" band ever! I hate deicide's lirycs, fans, and,their whole fake \\"satanic image\\" !! Its all a load of ....! I hope all you guys have fun playng along side satan while you all burn to death and he watches you die very very slowy. Alright ? Now, want something worth own it ? Well, buy any thing from cannibal corpse,suffocation,grave,impaled,origin,dyingfetus,morbid angel,immolation,skinless,mesery index,leprosy,the crown,cradel of filth,slayer, the haunted, at the gates,hate-eternal! Man, so many good grindcore/thrash/black/deathmetal bands out there and you choose this piece of sorry garbage called \\"deicide\\" ? Whats wrong with you guys ? Geez!PS: The band \\" in flames\\" is way better then deicide!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHAHAHA!!!","review":"I can't help but laugh at these guys. Satanic and anti-religion bands are so out of date man. Anything satanic or anti-christianity these days is just corny. That being said, Deicide are a perfect example of this cheesy lyrical content. They try so hard to make themselves look/sound evil and brutal and I just find them complete idiots. To me, those who can't write songs, write about anti-christianity. Satanic and anti-religious lyrics are like the lowest form of songwriting ever. It is the most imitated lyrical theme, and still remains the lamest.Honestly, I can stand death metal...Melodic death metal imparticular, but when I hear crap like Deicide and Cannibol Corpse, I get really offended over the fact they try to make music. I'm very passionate about my music, especially metal, and when I hear these guys trying to be \\"brutal\\" and \\"evil\\" it turns out to be nothing but absolute crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the lucky","review":"The unit I got was DOA: the tray would not open.

Now I have to go out and find a new tire...this was a birthday present and rather disappointing for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schwinn Roadster Trike","review":"The trike is very well made. It appears to be safer than some of the other tries I've looked at because of the low center of gravity and wide base. My daughter has not had any incidents (or near incidents) of tiping over. It seems to be securely planted on the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schwinn Roadster is the best for tall kids","review":"This bike is great! Not only is it the envy of all the kids and parents it is also great if you have a taller, bigger kid. My son is 2 but is already 3 ft tall (he takes after his 6 ft something fit dad). Other trikes are too small, he can hardly sit in them. This one allows him to sit comfortably and still have growing room, plus the metal makes it strong enough to easily hold his extra muscle weight. The real tires are a plus as plastic ones just don't go very well. I highly recommend this bike for parents with taller kids. You will be very satisifed. One parent told me they thought about getting it but it looked too big for their dainty 1 1/2 year old. I agree she is too small at this point in time for it, but there was no way my son could even fit on her little dainty plastic trike. Again I recommend this bike for durability and fit for taller kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well built product","review":"I bought this tricycle for my son for christmas. This is well built and very sturdy. All metal with air tires capped of with a nice finish. I paid 35.00 for this on amazon and well worth the money. Great Value"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it works better for older kids","review":"I'm not sure if my daughter is just too small for this trike but she is having such a problem with it. She is now 2 3/4 and her legs reach the pedals fine but its just such a big and heavy trike. It looks cute and it is very safe but the wheel base is so broad and moving it around is work. It may work better for an older child"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it","review":"This is a great product. We haven't had any problems with the tires as a lot of the other reviews were saying. They were pumped up out of the box and have not deflated at all. Everyone was really impressed with this trike. It is very sturdy for our 2 year old. He is still a little short for the pedals but he likes to push it around for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"kids love this","review":"i now have two of these trikes, one in blue and one in pink. the kids absolutely love them. they are easy to put together, and probably the best quality trikes ive seen in a while. everything is steel except for the back 'passanger area' which is wood.if you are in the market for a trike, this one is definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Trike!","review":"I guess you can call it being at the right place at the right time. I purchased this bicycle in December and it was discounted for more than 1/2 off the msrp with free shipping. Can't beat that! Wrap it up! All the other retailers were quoting the price for Amazon's non discount msrp or more. I read so many glowing reviews on so many sites that I had to get it for my son. It will be his present for his second birthday in a few months. I know he will love it and can't wait for him to ride it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So awesome!","review":"Got this for my 2 year old. She is tall but still needs an inch or so to fit it. The seat is adjustable so she can grow with it. Looks very cool!!!!! My friends and I wish it came in adult sizes!! lol Its not feather lite but not to heavy to get going."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Schwinn's quality?","review":"We recieved this red Schwinn Roadster in a timely manner. However, in putting this together we noticed a number of flaws... more than just imperfections. The decals are all very noticeably off center. The left wheel appears to be angled/inverted. Also, we've even already noticed gross paint flaws. Sadly, I also have serious doubts about the durability of the untreated wood on the back. What I do like about this is that it was very easy to put together and will grow with our son. If he had not yet seen this, however, I would glady send it back for something of better quality. I would not reccomend this to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Poor Quality","review":"I read a bunch of reviews where people complained about the quality of the bike, but it looked so nice on the picture...When I received it, I wish I trusted those reviews. It's very cheaply made. One tire was already patched with some glue, and all three were deflated. I tried to inflate them and noticed that one back tire was not even sitting on the rim and I could not do anything to fix it. The ornament on the bike is actually not painted but rather slapped on with a sticky painted tape. At first I thought it was a protective film over the paint, but NO, it was the \\"paint\\". I am returning the bike!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy and rusty","review":"We purchased two of these. They rusted within one month of purchase. Unfortunately we were just past the Amazon return window when I decided to try to exchange them.We leave it outside because I'm not going to lug two tricycles from the back patio around the house to the garage every day. We also leave our Schwinn bikes outside, and they don't rust.If it rusts within one month where we live (San Diego, a dry climate without one day of rain in that month), I couldn't imagine what they'd look like in a year or two.Of course the kids didn't mind the rust. But the trikes were so heavy they never learned to pedal them. One day at a friend's house they both started pedaling a different trike around like mad. I sold the Schwinns on Craigslist for $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MADE IN THE USA","review":"When conducting an internet search for an American made Tricycle this one is advertised as American Made.

A year later she still cannot reach the pedals. She sits on it and scoots around sometimes. While it looks awesome and is well constructed, it is just too big and heavy. My five-year-old can pedal the tricycle, but of course she would rather ride her bike or scooter. I would NOT buy this again. I wish I had seen it in person and would never have bought it.

Think twice before purchasing this bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"23 month old loved this shiny new red bike","review":"My parents purchased this bike for my 23 month old son for an early 2 year old birthday gift. My son is a bit tall for his age (90th %tile) and he fits it perfectly with the seat forward. My only flaw with this bike is that it came with a crack in the wooden board which has the Schwinn name written on it. My father put the bike together and said that the screw/bolt was drawn too tight and cracked the wood. This part was already assembled when shipped to us. My son learned how to peddle in three days and is doing well on steering after a couple of weeks. He loved the tassles on the handlebars, and called it a motorcycle when we pulled the blanket off to reveal the surprise. The tires need inflated a bit, but the bike does not tip and is safe on our slightly inclined driveway. I would definately recommend this bike as a beginner tricycle for a two year old and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic fun","review":"We already have one of these for our 2 year-old daughter and when our son was born we knew that our daughter was NOT going to want to share hers so, we purchased one for him.

But more importantly, our kids LOVE this trike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My nephew loves this bike","review":"I brought this bike for my 2 year old nephew, for Christmas & he just loves it.

Unfortunately he's still a little small for it and can't quite reach the pedals. However it won't be long. I was impressed with the build quality and looks of the trike. I would give it five stars for durability, except for the fact that the bell fell off the handlebars almost as soon as I put the bike together. The plastic strap holding it in place is extremely thin and fragile, and I can't see any easy way to reattach the bell. Too bad, because otherwise the trike seems to be durably built."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bike/Great Quality","review":"I bought this bike for my 3 year old!

I have to say these bikes are great. They are easy to assembly and the tires are inflatable. I think of all the crappy bikes in department stores these days, this is definitely a quality, stylish trike that kids will get a lot of use from. I didn't give it five stars because the wooden step on the rear is a little on the thin side, and also because it is made in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazed . . .","review":"Assembly was easy, didn't even need instructions, great durable metal product. Almost every other bike we looked at is complete plastic. We are very pleased and our youngest daughter loved getting this for her B~Day. I highly recommend buying this.

It's well built and sturdy, looks great and should last for years. The only things I didn't like: It's supposed to be for 2 years and up, but even on the shortest setting my son can't reach the peddals, and he's not a short 2 year old. The box was a little beat up, and resulted in a bent wheel well. I was able to bend it back but I shouldn't have had to. More often then not it seems like a get things from Amazon in less then perfect condition. Last but no least, you have to be sure the handle bars are just right, or the bike will wobble. All in all I love it, and would but again in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"We bought this product for our 3 year old grandson.

Her feet reach the peddles but she still needs to grow about a inch to peddle properly...she is 33.5 inches tall right now. This bike is so pretty and retro looking! The bell is really easy to ring too. When she is not pushing herself around on it she likes to sit on the back board and hang out. I wish they had gotten the pink one for her but since it's red and we may have a boy next it will transfer well=)"},{"rating":"1","title":"it an average toy","review":"I thought Schwinn it an good quality brand but I was wrong on this one. There are two things about this product I don't like.

I definitely recommend this trike :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best tricycle to get, though not perfect.","review":"Putting this tricycle together was easy. Had to buy a bicycle pump to air up the tires more. They haven't gone flat yet though, so i think they were just underinflated for shipping. It is beautiful!!!!! Disappointed in the stickers decorating it when I studied it. Made a perfect product less than in my opinion. However if that is where they were going to cut costs so be it. This tricycle is large for the three and up group (despite what the box mislabels) has a great bell, and steers like a dream. It's inflated rubber tube tires are awesome! and the schwinn body is sturdy and great to look at. The back is very wide, making it near impossible to tip over, and also difficult to get around tight corners. Great bike, just please don't get disappointed by the little imperfections when you get it, it is still a quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADORABLE AND WELL MADE!","review":"LOVE this bike! We bought this for our daughter when she turned two. She was able to reach the pedals without any issues (she is a little tall for her age). We like this bike because there is no tipping hazard. We gets lots of compliments on this bike. Seat can move back to allow older/taller kids to ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roadster Bike by Schwinn","review":"Awesome bike for toddlers! Durable and extremely well made! Great Bike!! Definitely recommend this for ages 2-4! This is a bike that is well worth the price and I strongly advise purchasing one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice trike!","review":"This is a very nice trike and my 2-year-old loves it. It's way less tippy than an old style trike, but it will tip if he corners too fast (he's a wild boy). For less tippy-ness I think you would have to get a big wheel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Birthday Gift","review":"We bought this for my son's 2nd birthday and it was a hit! He absolutely loves it and wants to ride it everywhere. My son is a little short (only 34 inches tall) and with the seat all the way he can put his feet on the pedals but he can't push the pedals all the way around. Regardless, though, he loves to just sit on it and scoot around with his feet. The bell makes it extra fun for him and he loves to put stuffed animals on the back to ride with him.We love how sturdy the trike is, the base is so broad that there's really no concern about him tipping it. Even when he sits on the back of the trike it doesn't move. We also love the way it looks--it's the perfect, classic triclyce. I would highly recommend to anyone.We haven't had any problems with the wheels deflating as some have mentioned. My sister has had this same tricycle for her son for over a year and said she's never had problems with the wheels either."},{"rating":"2","title":"high quality, easy assembly, long lasting toy","review":"This bike is a superb buy! Great look, easy to move the seat as their legs grow, and great study material! I love the look and this bike will defiantly hold up! Only con: watch if children like to grab wheels, with the top area of the wheel being made of metal, it can scratch their hands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"A little large for our son who has yet to turn 2, but he already loves it. Will not tip over"},{"rating":"2","title":"Built tuff and durable","review":"My two year old son just loves to ride this tricycle , it seems like he never gets off of it and never let's my 4 year old ride it, I had to buy my daughter one in pink ...

Good make and very comfy for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flat tire?!","review":"My husband and I were disappointed to see that the front tire was flat when we opened the box! We bought for our son's 2nd birthday. Pacific was nice enough to overnight a new tube but only to find out that they sent the tube for the back tire instead of the front! We had to buy a $6 tube from a local bicycle shop and just paid them $10 to change it out as we were really frustrated at this point. The product is great but not sure that I would order from Pacific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"Highly Recommended! Nice trike! Not like what you'll find at Wal-Mart. My 50#, 3 foot tall, almost 4 year old loves it. I had to move the seat almost all the way forward - (there's still a couple of clicks left) - in the adjustment notches for her in order for her to be able to really crank on the peddles, so it's not for you average 3 year old (my girl is big) unless you have a flat, paved surface to ride on. There seems to be plenty of room for her to grow and still enjoy her trike. Plus, it seems well made and sturdy. We live in the country and our drive way is gravel. With the air-filled tires it's easier to peddle around. So far, so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 year old LOVES this bike","review":"It was a little tricky to put it together. Nothing too terrible, but it's hard to get the handlebars right enough. My son LOVES is new bike. It's super durable and he was able to ride it right away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Auntie gramma","review":"This trike is so much safer for the kids to ride compared to the traditional tricycle. It's low to the ground and has back support. It was so easy to assemble and it looks great too! I bought the red one for my grandson and the pink one for my granddaughter. They loved them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolest Ride for the Little One","review":"This is the kind of trike I wish I had when I was a kid. Shiny and sturdy! It wasn't the easiest to put together but that's because it has to be secured well to be safe. I'm generally not the handy-girl type but I was able to figure it out with a few screwdrivers and a wrench. My nephew adores his tricycle! And I'm happy that the seat and handle bars are fully adjustable since my nephew is growing so fast! My only complaint is that the enamel on the underside of the seat/wooden deck gets scratched/nicked easily now that my nephew is riding his trike everywhere. But at least its in an area that we can't really see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutest trike ever!!!","review":"We got this for our son's 2nd birthday a couple of weeks ago.

But it looked top heavy, so I went with this, which had elements of the Radio Flyer look. I'm glad I did! Even as low as the seat is, my 3 year old still can flip it over. I like the air filled tires too - good for the many bumps on our road.The only beefs I have are that the handle bar twists and the front tire wasn't installed properly on the wheel. But for the price, it's a great deal.And she loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Schwinn Roadster","review":"We ordered the Schwinn Roadster for our grandson, knowing that it might be a little too large for him, but he loves it anyway because he can sit on it and move it by \\"walking\\" it. It's great because it sits lower than a standard tricycle, so it's a lot safer for little guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect trike for a beginner","review":"We bought this trike for my son's 2nd birthday. It is the perfect size for him to grow into! He has loved it from the day he received it. He can reach the petals with the seat in the first setting (yes, the seat is adjustable which is great!), however he hasn't quite gotten the hang of petaling it yet. He will keep his feet on the petals and we can push him so he gets the motion, or he just scoots along using his feet on the ground. I am sooooo happy with the decision to buy this tricycle. It is durable, sturdy, adjustable, and most of all, my son LOVES it. He rides it almost every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schwinn Roadster","review":"I had been looking for a tricycle for my 3 year old son for quite some time. Most are cheaply made or far too small for him as he is 43 inches tall. I tried looking for a Big Wheel thinking it would be a good substitute but found them all to be cheaply made as well. I came across this bike in a local retail toy store but they only carried the pink version and weren't interested in ordering one in blue for me. So I came to Amazon!!!!!!This tricycle is extremely well made and durable. My son rides it every day and loves it!!!My only concern prior to ordering was the size restrictions on the box. As another reviewer stated though, they are incorrect and will easily accommodate a child larger than them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Customer Service Disappointing","review":"Upon putting this product together I found that there was excessive play on the front fork assembly. I took it apart and re-checked the assembly directions, reassembled with the same results. I contact Schwinn support concerning the problem and was informed that I had received an older model and they would send a retro fit part to correct the problem. They stated I would receive the part in 7 to 10 business days. Well it has been over a month now and no part has been received. My granddaughter loves the bike even though the front wobbles when she rides it. I would recommend this bike only if amazon ships one of the newer models without the defective front fork assembly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Premium Trike","review":"Both my Grand Son and Grand Daughter got this trike for their 2cd birthday, 1 red, 1 pink. It is very well built with real tires and for the quality it is priced right. And they love the bell on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most bad ass tricycle ever!","review":"We bought this for our 2 year old for Christmas and are very happy we chose it. Saw alot of good reviews on this, and they were right. Saw some negatives about the tires, but we have not had any problems after 2 months. We love the style of this one and get compliments all the time. It is very well made. Metal > Plastic all day. The price was sweet too. It looks like it would cost way more than it did. Highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tricycle!","review":"Love this trike! Very cool looking, sturdy and expect it to last through both my boys (2 yrs & 8 mos). The seat seems very comfortable and there are many seat settings to fit your child's height. Also the handlebars aren't too high for his little arms. The only thing I see wrong with it is that the paint scratches VERY easily; in fact, it was scratched several times just during assembly! I would certainly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Tricycle!!","review":"I bought this tricycle for our grandson who is 2 1/2 years old. It is very well made and is a lower profile than a traditional trike, making it easier to turn without tipping over. He loved the little bell on the handle bar. I liked that you could adjust the seat forward so the pedals can be reached easily. By Spring, he should be ready to ride like a pro!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trike!","review":"I purchased this trike as a christmas present for my 17 month old daughter. She is a little short to reach the pedals, but come spring I think she will enjoy it(may need pedal blocks still). The trike is beautiful and well made. No problems with the tires (they did need to be pumped up). Only one issue, one of the fender stickers has a bubble in it. Other than that we are very happy with our purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trike","review":"Pros: Great trike for kids. We like the fact that it is \\"low profile\\" and is not easily tipped over. The assembly was very easy and the quality is top notch. The adjustable seat is very useful.

Good quality tires.Fast, prompt shippingCons: We ordered the blue trike yet received the red trike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way, way WAY...did I say \\"way\\"?...too heavy.","review":"What else can I say? My 3 year old son is big...has been in the 95th percentile for height and weight since birth. He's never been able to ride this thing comfortably. This is my first review on Amazon and I'm doing it because I feel strongly about this item. Out of the box it's beautiful...it could not look any cooler and my son was jumping up and down. You want it to be as fun as it looks but the reality is that it's just way too heavy. Not fun, never used. End of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Tricycle!","review":"We bought this for our son's second birthday, and while we still have to help him ride it a great deal, he just adores it! It was easy for my husband to put together and is so flashy! The bell is a hit too! He is the envy of the neighborhood! (Just kidding!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trike!","review":"Bought this for my 2 year old grandson - he absolutely loves it! My husband and I assembled it quite easily, and we are not mechanically gifted at all. It is very sturdy and the adjustable seat is a really good idea. My grandson doesn't quite have the pedaling down yet, but he uses his feet to scoot all over the house and down the street. This is a trike that he will use for a long time, and it's built to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter is the envy of all her peers!","review":"We did a lot of research before buying this tricycle, and are so pleased with our purchase. This trike is very sturdy and a smooth and comfortable ride. The seat is low to the ground, so it's not at all tippy like so many other trikes seem to be. It's good looking too. We've gotten many compliments on it, with people wondering where we got it. Sure there are less expensive tricycles out there but this one is good value and worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"Just recently bought this cute little three wheeler for my 2 1/2 year old. I was so surprised by the sturdiness and overall quality of this product for the price. I have seen other bikes in the store and they were plastic and not very attractive.

It was easy to assemble and has room for growth.Our daughter absolutely loves it! She must feel very secure because she rides rather fast on it. We love the fact she cannot fall backwards because of the high back seat. We also love the fact if she were to fall sideways off, it is low to the ground so there is less chance of injury."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toddler trike!","review":"We bought this bike for our 2 year old daughter.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Replace Rear Tire Inner Tubes!","review":"Overall, I love this tricycle for my daughter.But, we have encountered one major problem that is making me rethink this purchase. My daughter rode the bike for a bout a week when we got a flat in the rear tire, where the brass vavle stem meets the inner tube. I have been trying to find a replacement inner tube for the rear tire for the past month. The 10x2 inner tube is almost impossible to find, and the one or two places that might have them want more than $20 each!I was originally going to get two more of these for my younger twin daughters next year, but until I work out this tire problem, that's not going to happen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my almost 3 year old","review":"My son is 33 months old, (37.5 inches tall) and absolutely LOVES this trike! The rubber tires are perfect because he can ride just about everywhere. The very first day he was pedaling down the sidewalk :) The biggest problem has been just trying to get him off of it to come back inside!I read a ton of reviews on this tricycle, and I haven't had any of the same problems (ie tires need replacing, steering bar bent). However, almost every single sticker on the trike was wrinkled or bubbled and needed flattening out... That was not a big deal, but mildly annoying. Other than that, it has been perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Trike Ever!!","review":"i got this trike for my daughters 2nd birthday.. it is the cutest and most durable one i have ever seen! she doesnt quite get the hang of it yet, but she loves every minute trying! whenever we go anywhere all the kids want to ride it and it definately withstands all the children! best childrens toy! i recieved it fast and it was easy to put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 flat tires","review":"I received this trike with 3 flat tires.

It is beautiful to look at but all the tires were flat when it arrived in the box(some assembly required). I figured that they were shipped flat on purpose and pumped them up on Christmas eve. Christmas morning the big tire was flat again, I pumped it up again but before he could ride around the Christmas tree it was flat again!!! Ever try to get a patch kit, or a tube, or customer service on Christmas Day HA HA HA! Fortunately he had other things to play with but here it is mid january and he still can't ride it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rear Wheels Won't Spin","review":"I purchased 2 of these for my almost 3 year old twins. One of them works perfectly and my first girl loves it. But the other one does not work. The rear wheels don't spin and the poor girl was trying and trying to pedal, but couldn't. My big clue was when I put her on a hill and the thing wouldn't even roll downhill! I turned both trikes over and tested the wheels spinning in the air. One set of rear wheels would spin 6 revolutions but the other set of rear wheels would only spin 3 inches. Now one twin thinks she is just no good at the tricycle and can't understand why her sister rides hers around with no problem. I am writing to Amazon to see if I can return or replace the defective one.Jennifer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intense off-gassing","review":"I bought this trike for my toddler's 2nd birthday. I was so excited about it because it's pretty cool looking and rides very well! However, the intense chemical smell was a deal breaker. I will be returning it. The smell was so strong that I could only be in the room with it for a short period of time. I did a little research and it turns out there are approximately 70 chemicals that off-gas from tires,4 of which are known to cause birth defects. What a terrible thing to discover when I'm 5 weeks pregnant. Why are corporations allowed to put these chemicals in our children's toys?

A very well made product, all metal with inflatable tires for the price of a plastic trike. While he is a month or two from comfortably reaching the pedals he is more than happy to use Flintstone power to scoot through the neighborhood. While some reviews mentioned its too heavy, while it is about 20 pounds my son has no issue getting it going and cruising the neighborhood.And of course he gets plenty of compliments from everyone that sees it. Cool bike, great price"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Tricycle...","review":"Well, after getting this yesterday, and putting it together today, I must say this is a wonderful trike. The weight on the trike is substantial, but not too much that my 20 month old girl couldn't move it easily around the room. The assembly was much easier than I thought it would be, and it's very very stable. The only thing was there is a couple small dents in the front fender, but since it's probably going to get several more, it really is a non-issue to me. Now, I know that they say from 1 and 1/2 years, but my 20 month old (who has long legs and is tall for her age) barely reaches the pedals. She's happy using her feet for now. I would wager this will be in this family a long time.Sorcha"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trike","review":"We have purchased 3 of these tricycles in the past 2 years for our grandsons; 1 was a gift, but the other 2 are kept at our home as I watch the boys daily. The boys, ages 20 months and 3 yrs, love to ride them with the streamers flying and the bell ringing. I love them because of the way they are built. The center of gravity is set very low to the ground, making spills and tip-overs a thing of the past. The rubber wheels have a better grip than the plastic wheels of other brands too. (I had purchased a small plastic trike and the way the wheels would just spin in place was very frustrating to the boys.) The old-fashioned fenders on the wheels help keep little fingers from getting hurt and the wide step in the back seems to be useful when getting on or off. All in all, a great trike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusty Chrome & Flat Tires","review":"The chrome fenders were rusted right out of the box. All tires were flat. I read reviews before buying, so I knew to check the rubber strips between the rims and the tubes. They were in there, but not centered properly over the spoke ends. Didn't seem to be any damage to the tubes though. Probably because they were never inflated or ridden on.While inflating, I noticed the rear tires did not fit the rims properly. It's as if the tires are too large in diameter for the rims. It's nearly impossible to properly seat the tire beads on the rim because of this. If you're not careful, the tube will pop out from between the tire and the rim when you pump it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best trike ever","review":"We bought this bike a year ago for our son. He was just shy of 2 years old and needed a bike for daycare. We wanted to get something he could grow in to and wouldn't outgrow quickly. This was it! It's a solid bike. Well constructed and the wide tires keep our son from tipping over when he's cruising at full speed and taking sharp turns (he will now be 3 next month).At first he couldn't reach the petals and would just scoot along with his feet \\"flinstone sytle\\". Within a few months he was reaching the pedals and flying down the sidewalk. Solid tires that you can inflate, strong metal frame and a solid adjustable seat w/ a back.Everyone that sees the bike just loves it. We love it so much that we may buy another one to keep at home (his other one stays at daycare full time). Highly recommend! You won't be disappointed. My husband wanted one in an adult size :)Oh and the assembly is a breeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice trike!","review":"What I like is how sturdy this trike is, and the wheels are inflatable instead of solid rubber. It also looks very nice and I think it has a powder coating instead of regular spray paint. The only thing we customized were the handlebar tassels. We went to a hobby store and got some pink ones which I think match better. They were easy to replace, just need two plastic ties and the new tassels."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love It","review":"... my daughter is 39 inches and she is on the closest seat setting...so she will have this trike for a while!Tires stink like other reviews have sd ...but they are rubber ... so they have an odor but i have the trike in my house now after 2 weeks in the garage and i cant smell it in my house ...

It is so well built it will be a family heirloom.The first couple of days it seemed she had minor difficulty pedaling due to the weight of the trike, but we made an adustment and she is now pedaling away.

My son was really excited about the look of the bike, the tassels, the color (blue).I assembled it with the seat in the middle position (there are 5, I think) and the bars at maximum depth. he fits perfectly! his feet easily reach the pedals, but I can see that he'll be able to grow with the bike. I feel if the seat was in the \\"shortest\\" position, it would get a child another 1 1/2 - 2 inches closer to the handlebars.the only downside for tall kids is that the bike is too low to the ground to make scooting (instead of pedaling) comfortable.all around, a great purchase and competitively priced :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"MP3 Defective","review":"The last two seconds of nearly every song file is corrupt.

The film is surprising, entertaining (you get Cleo singing, and you get Jean-Luc Godard and Anna Karina in a silent film in the film) and touching. Technically this film is brilliantly done; do esp notice the remarkable camera work. Brilliant director with excellent cast in a very good looking film from the French New Wave. And when Criterion does the transfer, you get it in all it's glory. I'll now go watch it again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual film","review":"Picked this up after reading the reviews here. A slow moving but very engaging movie. The camera work as some have noted is unusual and works well in this film. Great use of reflections. I was reminded at times of the artwork of Estes. The transformation of this woman is slow, believable, and gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Varda's Cleo has more mirrors than anything by Fassbinder.","review":"There are so many visual tricks going on in this film it can make you \\"breathless\\". Keep an eye open for the movie poster of Un Chien Andalou that appears center screen after Cleo's taxi journey from the Right to the Left Bank. The Right Bank Paris shops and their signs are used to articulate Cleo's story. The sequence when Cleo window shops and then buys a hat explains her existential dilemma through her surroundings. She is about to face the possibility of death, she is single, she would like to be married, but that would be too practicle for her, so she buys a winter hat in the summer. Death is as absurd as life. In the end she meets a soilder going off to fight in the Algerian revolution, he also faces the possibility of an absurd death. Together, Cleo and the audience realize that love is the only thing that makes sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, Seen Better, Seen Worse","review":"Not a whole heck of a lot happens in the 90 minute film in which a woman wanders through the streets of Paris as she anxiously awaits a medical appointment at which she will receive the results of a test. She buys a hat, meets up with a friend, talks a walk in the park etc. The events all unfold in real time and the early 60's mostly black and white cinematography is nothing short of gorgeous but on the whole this one comes across a little too self consciously arty for its own good. Nice, at times, but hardly profound. Perhaps this was more compelling back in 1962.2 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"something to consider before joining...","review":"very good book to be read before anyone even considers joining the reserves within any of the military branches...currently in law enforcement in the Beaufort County area and going to Parris Island on a daily basis to workout I can honestly say that life for a recruit begins on the dreaded \\"sand flea/gnat\\" infested island in SOUTH CAROLINA, not NORTH CAROLINA...as stated in the previous review...I guess 13 weeks of boot camp made the last reviewer forget what state he/she was in..."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT MIDDLE","review":"I found the first 20 pages or so clunky and unclear. But once we get to the story problem, the bus and the killings, it gets really good. Then for about 70 pages it gets better and better. The best is the character development of all these different cops, who each has his own different personality and talents. Also, the police procedural stuff is convincing and compelling. Finally, toward the end, there's about 40 pages that are tedious, like reading an accounting textbook. Then the last few scenes are annoying, at least they were to me. Sorry it wasn't wonderful all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like this acclaimed story","review":"This is the fourth novel of Martin Beck police mysteries.Although this is acclaimed as one of the best Martin Beck stories, I donft like the novel because it is not a feasible story. I think itfs unlikely to happen that a man kills a woman impulsively to hide his bad behavior and then commits a well-planned mass murder to hide the first crime."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Laughing Policeman","review":"The Laughing Policeman is my favourite Martin Beck mystery. Great plot and insights into the various characters and Stockholm location."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only mystery by these authors worth reading-- but this one is really worth it","review":"Sjowal and Wahloo were that rare combination of two people writing together. She was a poet, he a playwright. Legend has it that she wrote the descriptions, he the dialogue. However they did it, this book came out very well, and is an excellent read. The policemen are especially well drawn, and the social milieu sounds and feels right. Later books by the same pair deteriorated into propaganda for their religious belief in Communism. Whenever an author (or here, authors) uses his fiction to promote something else, whether left or right, religious or irreligious, or whatever, it becomes polemics, and goes pffffft. This made their last book, Terrorists, almost unreadable. This book happily still is readable-- very much so. Read it, and skip the rest of their books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, hard to put down","review":"Highly recommend this book. I felt like I was there, sloshing through the rotten weather... trying to solve bloody murders. I picked it up after the Girl with the Tattoo and thought it was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe It's Me..........","review":"but this book just didn't float my boat. I like my books hard-boiled and/or noir and The Laughing Policeman failed on both counts; in fact to be honest I didn't even finish it (after reading over half of it I felt that I at least gave it a chance). Not much is happening here-go figure the critical acclaim!"},{"rating":"1","title":"almost unusable","review":"physically, the print is fuzzy. and it was not clear to me before i ordered it that this is not the complete book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Press","review":"I don't understand why there is such a huge range in price for garlic presses. Yes, the $2.99 press from Ikea feels like it will snap in your hand but do the $40+ presses I see really do that much of a better job? This press is only $10 but it is well-made and presses garlic flawlessly. Even large gloves.I've used mine for almost a year, several times a month, and it still works and looks new. I can see why some people think it is plastic: the all-aluminum construction is very light and it is polished to give it a non-metallic feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great piece.","review":"Works great.Can handle a few cloves at a time which is really great to speed up cooking.Cleans easy by hand or in the dishwasher.Value priced. Who can not like that?This items has sped up my cooking, my sauces and marinades have been so great lately I had to tell you.It will make your cooking much easier and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garlic get paint coating!","review":"this is definetly a no for me! having silver colored garlic in my meal?? i wonder how healthy would that be. I owned this garlic press for 4 months and that is what i'm constantly getting out of it now... in the garbadge it goes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the job but finish is coming off","review":"I got this for Christmas (3 months ago) and the finish is already coming off. I use this item about 3 times per week for about 3-4 garlic cloves per time. I would say this is moderate use for a garlic press. I wash it by hand and use the little tool to remove the garlic skins but the finish is chipping on the hinge and in the cavity that holds the garlic clove. The press does do a good job of mincing the garlic but when I replace this item (sooner than I was planning) I will not buy this model again. I really do not want whatever the finish is made from in the food that I prepare for my family. Overall, I am disappointed that this is wearing out after only three months of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Works very well and is easy to clean. The only complaint is that it doesn't have a very large capacity, that is, you need to cut large cloves of garlic in half in order to fit them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart. Too small.","review":"This cheap contraption fell apart. All of the hinges unhinged. And the space where you put the garlic is really small. Fits maybe 2 cloves. I'd spend my money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This garlic press looks metal in the picture, but it isn't. It's very flimsy and won't last long. I've never seen a garlic press so cheaply made. The cleaner that comes with it is hard to clean, because pieces of the garlic skin get stuck between the teeth. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works - but I'd better chop with a knife","review":"The garlic press works. This is my first Garlic Press. So I can not compare it with other garlic press. But after one use, I have decided to chop garlic myself the old fashion way with a large Chinese clever knife. It's a lot faster than using this garlic press.If you decide to use this garlic press, be prepared a lot garlic stuck in those little holes. I have not found an easy way to get those garlic out, other than high pressure water to wash them out. Needless to say, a lot garlic down to drain. I'd rather eat garlic, instead of washing them into a drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"This works great - much better than my previous plastic one. No need to peel the garlic. My only slight complaint is that I misplaced the little hole cleaner almost immediately and have seen those where it is built into the back of the handle, and that would have been a better way to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk - Literally Broke the First Time I used it","review":"DO NOT BUY. I used it once and it broke at the hinge. It looks like a cheap casting in the broken section. In addition to the weak hinge, the way the press operates is not well designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coating/Paint Issues","review":"The first time I used the press it seemed to function properly. After several uses, however, the silver coating/paint came off on the garlic I was pressing... pretty gross and unhygienic. If I hadn't been paying attention my guests would have eaten silver-coated garlic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Fell apart after 11 months of very light use. Seems to be a quality product, but that is deceptive. I strongly urge you to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Hinge Design Ruins Fine Product","review":"First the good points: This garlic press is made of sturdy, lightweight aluminum, has great ergonomics, good capacity, presses well and is easy to clean. Unfortunately, some idiot decided to save a few cents in manufacturing costs with a hinge design -- both on the handle and the swing-out tamper -- that fails within a few months (at least for active cooks). A solid hinge would make this a fantastic garlic press worth more than the asking price. As it is, it's a waste of money and more scrap aluminum in the recycle bin. Keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel good movie...Enjoyed it.","review":"I had listened to the audio book \\"What if God Were the Sun?\\" a year ago and really enjoyed it... I like all of John Edward's books, but this one is not his usual book.. It's not about his communications with the other side, but rather a wonderful story of family ties and love that lives on.. I can't remember how I happened to find out there was a movie based on the book, but I'm glad I did.. It's a great story. It's the typical lifetime movie.. You could nit pick it apart if you so wished to, but the message is a strong one, and as usual, Gena Rowlands gives a great performance, one that makes you wish you knew someone like her. Lacey Chabert is also very good in the movie..I don't want to ruin the story, but enough to say it's about someone who thinks once you die, that's it.. it's over... but life show's her there is more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged DVD","review":"DVD arrived broken, split in half. Will have to repurchase to find out if the movie is good. Might want to upgrade the packaging on your shipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"She got me exercisiing","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, and the 6 week program takes you from begiinner to knowing you can do this. I had done the program for 3 weeks in a row, hardly missing a day until my life got so busy. I felt stronger in those 3 weeks than I have in years. I have three girls to run after and I did feel more energy, and flexibility. I plan to continue my exercises with her and I ordered her Real World Fitness book as well. Don't dish her for using the celebrity's names. We all want to look a little like them, so lets read about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these two","review":"As usual Blayne and T. have written a fasinating book. I have read The Road To Glory as well as the others these two have penned together. They are both funny, I mean LOL funny, great plots, and hold your interest. I'm hooked. I will certainly be reading what they write. If you are a avid reader such as myself. Then you need to pick up these authors books. Trust me, you will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave out the Squirrels","review":"After reading \\"Madam President,\\" I had very high hopes for this book. While there were humorous parts, and a few touching parts, this book was not up to what I was expecting. It is very slow at times and is hard to understand until you realized the truth about Glory.And the squirrels served no purpose and could have easily been left out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glorious Tale","review":"This is a kind of back to front story. The two leads fall first in lust, and eventually in love. But all is not as it seems.Trucker Leigh takes a wrong turn and finds the small town of Glory. She is instantly attracted to the handywoman, RJ. Their initial relationship is purely physical, and they explore that aspect a lot. All is not as it seems, but Leigh is too busy exploring her new companion to worry about the strangeness of the town.This is a funny, passionate, and sometimes emotional tale. One to read on a warm summer's night. Be prepared for surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snugglers Cat","review":"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter and she loves it! You put their bed pillow in it, and it becomes a big plush cozy pillow case. It has a big plush kitty head and feet that hugs her body when she sleeps. She sleeps with it in her bed, and also likes to lounge with it while watching tv. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece","review":"The Horse's Mouth is the best novel written in English about an artist; it is also one of the great, great novels of the 20th Century. Gully Jimson is as rich a character as Leopold Bloom, and this book is so much more real, accessible, and heartfelt than Ulysses. This book, the first time I read it, struck me in the same way as The Sun Also Rises; that is, I knew that there was no other book quite like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true original","review":"It's often been said that Cary's novel is the best ever written about a painter and the process he goes through in creating his art. The genius of the novel is that Gulley Jimson is such an unlikable character, given to violent fits of temper, all the while he is possessed of genuine genius and immense talent. The book is hilariously funny, but Jimson's misdeeds dangerously increase as the novel continues to the point where the reader starts wondering why he or she is laughing anymore, and begins to see the troubling ethical questions the novel poses about the relation of genius to morality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tech Thrash!","review":"This is another fine tech thrash album by a great group of guys who are also believers as well! They mix the message of Christ with great lyrics that make ya think and interesting song structures.

Don't even think that you can load it and drive the car with any degree of success on a keyboard. Even if you have a joystick or a racing wheel (which I purchased) the game locks up. There is no customer support aside from the usual (fix it) facts that come via e-mail. Yeah I know it only cost ...but NHRA should be ashiamed of themselves for buying into this. Oh and one more thing THEY ARE RELEASING NHRA II. I hope they worked the bugs out of this one seeing that they used this poor suckers money to fund it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game really is sorry","review":"This game is really bad. Is should be a whole lot cheaper than 9.99. First you can't steer worth a flip an there is no customer support they say that they can't do much to help you out. My best bet to do with your money is to buy a game made by bethsoft like IHRA or Championship drag racing or Burnout. Don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential and Inspiring","review":"Finally, an Internet marketing how-to book that truly delivers what's promised on the back cover. It's well-organized, written in clear and non-technical terms, and chock full of useful advice and web site addresses. Where appropriate, Janal includes case studies.I found many useful strategies and tactics in each of the six sections (Online Marketing Strategy, Online Selling, Promoting Your Web Site, Creating Customers for Life with One-To-One Marketing Programs, Online Marketing Tools, Online Media Relations).I highly recommend this book to both e-entrepreneurs and marketing/promotion managers of small and mid-size companies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"A dull book with lots of conventional marketing principles.

It is a powerful story which is timeless and very true to life. The first time I read this story as an adult, I was moved to tears; the same is true with this movie. (I guess it was put out on the shelf early, judging from the release date, because I found this movie at Target the other day for $9.99.) The movie is well done in every way, from the acting to the music to the scenery. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It is worth the price. Buy it; watch it; share it!

I would recommend seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enchanted Musical Performance: The Velveteen Rabbit","review":"The title of this video is very misleading.

However, the movie is very good. The kindergarteners got a little squirmy when the adults in the movie had conversations and \\"Rabbit\\" wasn't around, but the older children were enthralled. It can be enjoyed on many different levels.The differences and similarities between the movie and the book gave us a lot to talk about.

If you order several bars, put them in your freezer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food For Thought","review":"The first thought I had when I started reading was that how did Jill Nelson KNOW what I went through and feeling? The second thought was on the lukewarm (at best!) mainstream reviews the book received. Is the reading public afraid of anger being expressed? Of strong opinions given? Of constructive ideas for black women's empowerment being promoted? The third thought was that we need to talk to one another as black women and as citizens of our communities to stop the anger and realize strength. A great book to discuss with anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"4","review":"Ah, the Light - I thought it was just me that was filled with great rage and pain. Now I see that it is pandemic in all black women. I am not alone and I refuse to stay invisible because I didn't realize I was invisible until I looked in the mirror of the words in this book. Thank you Jill. Thank you for this gift I will share with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat scathing but honest and validating for black women.","review":"Being a black woman of Nelson's generation, I found this book to be a surprising validation. It confirmed my own belief that we (black women) need to spend more time talking about our life in America. Nelson's anger/rage was a little raw and exposed at times, but it needed to be said just the way it was said. However, a little more structure and objective statistics to support her conjectures would have taken some of the emotion out and added more substance. Every professional black woman in the country should read this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"What else is new?","review":"Jill Nelson is just another angry, bitter, whiny black woman with an axe to grind. This book is filled with the same old whining and cliches which have grown really old and tired. Almost everything she touches on is so predictable whether it's accusing black men who date outside the race as being sellouts (while saying nothing of black women who do the same thing of course), demonizing the Million Man March, whining about the light skin/dark skin thing and basically ranting about how the black woman is a pathetic victim. If it were a black man writing this foolishness, he'd be written off as an angry old coot in a minute. Well that's exactly what Jill Nelson is as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book for African American women to read","review":"Jill Nelson captures the essence of what I had been feeling since childhood, but was never able to express. For those people who are upset that she sounds angry it is about time someone is angry at how the African American woman has been treated by Black and White men. I am so glad that someone addresses the abuse that African American women put themselves through in order to be aligned with the Black Man only to have him betray her by pretending that she does not exist. Many of our men would not be where they are today if it were not for the Black female, yet most Black men have no use for their Nubian sisters. I am so glad that someone addresses the rage, frustration, and hurt that this realization causes. Thank you Jill Nelson for the voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone in the world is the problem - except Jill","review":"This is just another poorly edited, poorly written, and poorly conceived blame whitey, blame black men, blame society, blame everyone but yourself race books. A book of essays should convey challenging and intelligent arguments and thoughts. Nelson's book is just a collection of silly generalizations. This book was clearly written on the fly. Readers seeking smart writing by real intellectuals should try Shelby Steele and bell hooks. All I learned from this book is how embittered and mean spirited a person Jill Nelson is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reformatted Version of Christian Worker's Commentary","review":"If the original version of the CWC is a bit hard on the eyes, then invest in this reformatted version with the easier to read typefont.

I personaly only rented it to watch Seth Green, who is an wonderfully talented actor. I liked it so much though-not just because of Seth- because it was so funny and creative that I bought it! The DVD has great behind the scenes and that kind of stuff, it's really cool! Watch this movie, you'll like it, well if you're a teenager, that is, but I'm not saying adults won't like it either. It is rated R though for brief nudity, horror/gore/violence, language, and a brief make-out scene,and strong teen drug use, so you might want to think about letting younger kids watch it. All in all though, it's a pretty good flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Funny Horror Movie But Is Still Not That Great","review":"This is the kind of movie that would be compared to something like Chopper Chicks in Zombietown. It has all the laughs, some frights, but too funny to take seriously. That's the issue with Idle Hands. Devon Sawa doesn't take the fact that his parents are dead very emotionally, which is weird.The only part of this movie I really hate is the ending. It completely stunk, and made me agree that it was only a two and a half star movie. There are a lot of people who still like this movie and I hink it's great. But to give this film three stars is silly.I could watch this movie again and still find it funny. That's about how good it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPOFF","review":"This movie is a total ripoff of Evil Dead 2. This isn't even sick or disturbing, it actually pretty tame and really not funny.The acting is downright horrible, but I guess its supposed to be for the comedy. See Evil Dead 2, thats a horror comedy, or if you think you can handle it, Dead Alive (unrated version). They are much better and ten times funnier than this bubble gum.This movie gets two stars because the scene where the EVIL DEAD 2 WANNABE hand was slinging the cat around was hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"The previews were better than the movie!","review":"Every remotely funny line in this movie (promoted as a comedic horror movie) was shown in the preview. If you like alternative horror movies, this may be for you, but I thought the plot was weak, the dialogue contrived and the movie generally awful.

The acting and effects are decent. But the story, the direction, and well, pretty much everything else, are bad.A few minutes into the movie, I thought it was a horror movie. Even then I was disappointed because it's not nearly horrifying enough. Then a third of the movie gone by, the plot became more and more ridiculous, and only then did I realize that the filmmakers wanted to make it a black comedy. But just that the movie has the style of a black comedy doesn't mean that the filmmakers would feel obliged to offer you any laughs, witty dialouges or dark humor. The movie has none of those.The only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is some really really terrible movies deserve the lowest grade more than this one does. Not by a lot, though, I have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"First time I saw this it hit me as fun. Second viewing felt like a waste of time.

Even watching it as a black-horror comedy, it is horrible. To show gore is the only goal of the movie and even this fails, because the special effects are stupid.

I saw horror movies before let's take an example (Blair Witch) this is something for real you feel your body shake like a blinder and you spend the whole night wake. this movie is not like this, they want to say that ideal hands are devils playground !!! or they just want us think that smoking drugs will cause you to do bad things, actually I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idle laughs...","review":"Yer another comedy flop. The film promises, but never quite delivers. Sure it's corny, hammy and dumb and for a while it's funny, but towards the end it just becomes stupid. These teen comedies don't really appeal to me, but the small horror content of this film saves it from being boring. It just could have been much funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-grade horror/comedy","review":"Pretty low budget (minimal F/X, if any), B-grade horror/comedy that of course gets its main + points as an intro to Dark Angel's Jessica Alba. Maybe worth a looksie if you're *really* into quasi-horror/wanna-be comedy films or are curious, but otherwise you're not missing much of anything if you even skip the $1 rental--really no \\"horror\\" surprises beyond the first five minutes or so. Pretty simple and not terribly original, dramatic, or impressive, and generally not recommended as a film worth seeing, *very* unlike an Unbreakable, Frequency, Sixth Sense, etc.... The general concept could have been done *far* far further, and still may one day resulting in a top-notch horror film."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best movie i have ever seen in my whole life!","review":"this is one of my favorite movies i reccomend this one.it is hilarious and a little spooky at the beggining,a really good cast,vivicia a. fox was a babe in this one cause they have a halloween party and in her costume she is hot and plus she gets half naked at the end.a lot of drug use but still really good.get this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny older movie Entertaining!","review":"the acting was great for comedy and subject matter.

It has an idiotic plot, and a terrible cast.I'm generally one who likes a lot of movie genres -- drama, adventure, action, comedy, some horror, sci-fi.. This film tries to make horror funny by using excessive violence. It is disgusting. I'm an 18 year old teen, and I've seen some pretty bad movies, but nothing near this. It's one of the few movies I've ever considered stopping in the middle because it was so gory."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disturbing... how can people enjoy this sick fare?","review":"i was disgusted when i saw this movie in theaters. this kind of excessive violence was horribly disturbing and i can't imagine how people find this entertaining. i'm a 17-year-old Scream fan who enjoys horror movies, but this kind of violence was completely unnecessary and makes me worry about the future of our country if people can watch this stuff without thinking twice. skip this flick unless you've been possessed by demons yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Bother.","review":"This movie was the ABSOLUTE Worst movie that I have ever seen.

This movie didn't provide any laughs or gore, and it was nothing but an Evil Dead 2 ripoff. The story was one of the most pathetic I have seen in a long time, and it resembled something of a late-night B Movie. In fact, I've seen B movies with a better plot than this. Evil Dead 2 was 10 times funnier in it's 20 minute possessed hand sequence, and a lot more original. And the ending??? could they have come up with anything worse??? the chick is tied up on to a car that is going to flatliner here on the ceiling, which has a pentagram painted on it??? give me a break. but, like I said, when you have guys like Seth Green smoking weed in a movie, it's sure to be a winner with a lot of brainless teenagers who don't know what a real horror movie is. or a comedy for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"tried to watch , I couldnt make it all the way through. plot was bad. his has were posessed? eww gross. only good thing about this movie is j. alba"},{"rating":"1","title":"Other than a few (maybe three) lukewarm laughs,","review":"this film is pretty much at the bottom of the stupid level.

After being the \\"family friend\\" in A SOFT PLACE TO FALL, the good guy in love with the woman he can't have, Hall finally finds love -- and more family entanglements than anyone imagined. Ellen O'Brien Markowitz has spent her adult life trying to reconcile the disparate parts of her background with no luck. In her heart she will always be Dr. Markowitz's daughter, even if her DNA tells a different story. Her birth father, the feckless and charming Irish tenor Billy O'Brien, appeared in her life the year she turned fourteen and nothing has been the same since. When her half-sister Deirdre, a failed musician, comes to town with a one hundred pound dog, a broken-down car, and a bucket of problems, Ellen begins to discover that love and family are both worth fighting for. I just loved this book and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 1st Class Book","review":"I am so happy to have stumbled upon Barbara Bretton. Her writing, storylines, characters and settings are all very believable and absorbing. The title of this book is a bit weak and I felt it didn't really describe the book but, aside from that, it was a wonderful book. I think women of all ages would enjoy this book and its characters. The characters were rich and complex, Bretton was able to make me laugh and tear up at various points, and the story was full and highly believable. Bretton even delicately touched upon 9/11 through one of her characters and I thought it was tastefully done and very realistic. This is only my 2nd Bretton book, but I will be reading all her books from now on.

[That's in contrast to Sony and Memorex, where each attempted burn was always chancy.] However, my last stack of Verbatim's started out OK, with no problens, then 2/3 of the way down the stack I started to get write errors when burning. I dropped the recording speed from 16x to 12x and that helped some but even then a few were unusable. Thinking my DVD recorder was getting dirty, I invested in a cleaning disk but that offered only a marginal improvement. I am now reluctant to spend money on a product that has gone from ultra-reliable to iffy.

And the first 3 disks were good. After that, like every other disk i cannot use. I've used the same software with other dvds and never had problem this frequent. I even downloaded new software to try and still no use. So it's obviously the disk's problem. I'm VERY disappointed. I've gotten other brands before, and maybe have not more than 3 disk not usable.

I guess Amazon doesn't even read these reviews because no one has contacted me or emailed me with an apology or with replacement disks for the damaged disks both times.

But the two most recent spools I have purchased have been nothing but problems. The 100 pack which I cannot find where it was made has errored every single disk I have tried to record on. The second spool of 50 was made in Taiwan and seems to be hitting about a one in three error rate. I very much miss the old made in Japan disks. Tried writing to Verbatim about the warranty and was told they only warranty on data recorded on a computer, no other sources such as DVD recorders. Their current DVD-R disks should be avoided. Although I am still having absolutely no problems with their DVD+RW disks, owing mainly I am sure to the different way by which +RW disks record.

It is as par as with the Maxells, Sony's, TDKs and RiDatas that I have used before. Try to stay away from unknown brands that is kind of a hit or miss. The thing with DVD's or CD's is that when you find a bad one, it seems to be bunched into the same stack as they were manufactured at the same place and at the same time. My recommendation is not to burn DVDs or CDs using the maximum speed, the chance of a bad burn tend to be much much less if you use the next slower speed indicated on the media. Same as filling up the data capacity, 4200mb seems to work best for me as filling up the DVD to the edge may become problematic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived already open with a broken case","review":"The box has a perforated lid, and it had already been open.

And \\"Pierced\\" has a little more variation in songs. But \\"Effigy\\" is still more or less essential if you're serious about Death Metal.Mike Smith's drumming is creative and excellent and the Hobbs and Cerito twin guitar attack may be my favorite in the whole Death Metal genre. Mullin's vocals are almost impossible to decipher on this album (not so on \\"Pierced\\"). However, he is probably my favorite brutal DM vocalist overall.The cool thing about Suffocation is that repeated listenings reveal a little more detail. There are always hooks and changes in the songs that keep jumping out at you, which is what seperates this band from some of the \\"sonic sludge\\" you get in a lot of extreme metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"olde tyme religion","review":"this is death metal. you need look no further. from the sludgy production to the densely twisted riffage, from the jackhammer drumming to the sepulchral growls, everything that defines the genre is right here. there is a feral intensity to this work that turns bones to dust and drives sane men mad. so much for the music. I like two other things about this. first of all, the apocalyptic and almost cosmic nihilism of the lyrics. second of all, the picture on the back. these thin young men in jeans and torn t-shirts are starkly real. I find the fact that they pooled their desperate alienation to make this particular music inspiring. As brutal and esoteric as this disc is, as uncompromising and unsentimental, there is something in it that points the way to redemption. By building an effigy to the forgotten, Suffocation strangely succeeds at offering hope to the hopeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly The Best DM Release Ever","review":"I listen to a lot of music, and death metal isn't my big thing (I'm more of a hardcore guy), but I love listening to Suffocation whenever I want to break something.

The ones I bought from them are \\"Infecting The Crypts\\", \\"Reincremation\\" and \\"Jesus Wept\\". (I don't buy whole albums, but I listened to tidbits of other songs and loved them as well.) The vocals may not be clean, but this is some death metal I can easily follow by. Deicide failed me, and so did Cannibal Corpse. Suffocation got me on track. \\"Infecting The Crypts\\" is a great anger anthem, and \\"Jesus Wept\\" makes you want to smash some fine china. \\"Reincremation\\" and \\"Mass Obliteration\\" are great tracks as well.

When I heard it the first time, I couldn't swallow it. I started listening to death metal at that time, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse , Morbid Angel etc. Then I came back to this release and realized what an accomplishment it is. The riffs are insanely technical, their are multiple time changes withing songs, and then there is the compexity. This band does something few bands can, write complex songs filled with hundreds of riffs, while keeping the songs intresting. The production is excellent, the drumming is insane and the vocals are very brutal. NOTHING can or will match the brutality of this release.

This is also a great album to play to those hair metal freaks who consider the above mentioned bands heavy. Anyway, this is possibly the heaviest album I own. Ffom Frank Mullen's vocals, to Mike Smith'smachine-gun double-bass drumming, this is one of the most talented bands ever.

They work as advertised until some sort of a power surge comes along, like the power going off and on. Then it's all over: you have a nice 2-piece expensive paperweight.

This one I can't recommend unless you operate it from a backup UPS."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one.","review":"I bought one of these for myself about 2 years ago and it works great. Most of the transmitting stations are about 60 to 70 miles away and this amplifier pulls them right in for the most part. Once in a while we get a \\"no signal\\" message on the TV but not very often. We get about 40 stations. I bought one for my father-in-law so that he could get local stations. He has 2 or 3 satellite dishes but no local stations. He is also very happy with the results. I like it because it sure beats paying for a cable bill for channels that we don't even care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Report a year later","review":"Very happy with build quality and reception.

I was impressed with the diecast metal enclosure and the hardware. I live in a rural area and wanted to install the best amplifier that was available. The signal strength was higher that my old Radio Shack pre-amplifier. About 3 hours later, the signal started to pixelate and degrade across all channels. Each time I turned on the TV over the next few days, it was either the best reception on all channels or it was dead. I double checked all of my equipment and hooked it straight to a single TV to eliminate any doubt that it was from my distribution amplifier.

I have an RV that runs on solar so I hooked it up directly to the 12 volt solar battery system to avoid using an inverter. I've had it running at as low as 12.3 volts and works great!I tested the current using my clamp on amp meter and it only consumes 0.2 amps at 13.1 volts which is about 3 watts. Awesome!I now get channels that I didn't get with an amplifier with a lower gain. Great product and built well. I like the aluminum housing. Most are cheap black plastic that attract heat."},{"rating":"2","title":"New configuration","review":"I bought this to replace one that fried during an electrical storm. The old one had the two input configuration - one for VHF and one for UHF which I used to connect two different antennas to but the new one only has a single antenna input. I asked CM support how to connect a VHF and UHF antenna to the new single input and they suggested reversing a splitter. I figure that a VHF/UHF diplexer would also work. Other than that it seems to work fine and I was able to successfully replace the broken CM7777."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preamp not up to snuff","review":"I needed an antenna preamp to boost the local signals in my area. A Radio Shack model was servicable but stopped working. Selected Channel Master because I knew the brand. Dissapointing results - SNR - signal to noise ratio - was worse with the amp. This was determined subjectively by viewing dropouts on known weak signals and watching TV with/without the amp and also by measuring SNR with a Hauppauge HVR-1950 which has a SNR indicator for my computer. I liked the separate preamp and power supply hookup and it was easy to install but it didn't do the job. I replaced it with a Winegard AP-8700 which works much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it is suppose to do","review":"Residing near Elgin IL, most of the television transmission towers are located 40+ miles away in Chicago. Reception levels changed with the digital conversion for my large directional antenna located in the garage attic. Several channels became marginal in winter and nonexistent in summer.Installed the CM7777 and my reception problem was gone. The new side channels available in the digital transmission are real improvement in service. Installation of the CM7777 was not difficult. Follow the instructions provided and you will not not have a problem.It would have been a beneficial to have two patch cables about 1 foot long to aid in the installation, but 3' versions are available at most local hardware/electronics stores. It is something you should have in your hand before you go up to install the preamp. It will save you a trip up the ladder and some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate Change","review":"The old 7777 (with a choice of separate or combined inputs)was the best mast top amplifier I ever used. However, after receiving four new series 7777s that refused to produce any signal, I installed a fifth unit that made beautiful pictures. CM replaced the non starters with new product from a different run. Their engineering blamed to much signal or other local causes for the failures. Seemed strange since the fifth unit was installed in the same general area and it worked fine. Less than 90 days later the unit that was working expired during an electrical storm. On the very same tower and antenna two consecutive new 7777s refused to provide even a hint of a picture. Replaced with a Winegard 8275 and got instant reception. All the Channel Masters went back.

It replaces a lower gain CM 7778. The CM 7777 was dead out of the box. Be aware that Channel Master gives only a 90 day warranty, so I missed out by a month. So I am SOL. Their tech support was useless - basically sorry about that, tough luck. Can't say a lot about the apparent Quality Control & Testing but what do you expect from China? If you buy one test it out ASAP. Also I would strongly suggest sealing the Type F connections with \\"liquid electrical tape\\" and the case with silicone rubber sealant - it is not sealed in any way - it does not have a gasket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working after 2 months-- :-(","review":"The unit was working great for a 2 months and then----nothing.

No other band would be able to pull off an anthem about hate (Der Untermensch) and do it with the flair that Type O has. \\"Glass walls of limbo\\" is absolutely spellbinding, filled with visial imagery.

Overall, if it's a rowing movie you're looking for, this is the most accurate portrayal of the sport I have witnessed on film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oxford is no Miracle","review":"Ok, the cover looks like a clone of Miracle with Kurt Russell and that is about the best thing this movie has going for it. West looks really young so this is probably a made for tv British film that has been repackage to ride the curtail of West recent critical acclaim on HBO's The Wire and on the success of Disney's Miracle. I didn't finish the movie because I honestly didn't care who won the boat race. Unlike Miracle which keeps you watching despite Russell's wardrobe and great looking toupee, this movie never draws you in and you just wish the boat would sink and drown the entire cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it induced labor.","review":"The only good thing about this movie was my wife going into labor 2 hours later.

Gene's album is almost as good as the Ace Frehley one. Don't hestitate to buy them both ! You'll keep playing them over and over - and : Hurry - these are limited editions !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Schmalz, glitz... no guts!","review":"I have no idea what Gene was attempting to pull off with this album, so for all I know it wasn't an attempt, he was successful. But I hope for his sake it was more like a failed experiment. Kinda like a mix of chemicals sitting on a Bunsen Burner and exploding into a fireball of badness. I hate to focus on negatives in my reviews, but I feel it's necessary to steer the unwitting clear of this one. I think that it's fairly obvious just by reading the (breif) liner notes what can be expected. We see that an orchestra is credited, and then the appearances by Donna Summer, Helen Reddy (!?!?!!), and Cher. Yeah, overproduction, overextension, and ultimately overblown. I'm sure Gene had a big role in \\"Music from the Elder,\\" too. There is an interesting parallel here. Not that I could do any better, but really, we expected much more from you, Gene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gene Simmons - self-titled (Mercury)","review":"Are they kidding with this release? This is the 1978 solo record by the blood-spitting Kiss bassist Gene Simmons. Paul Stanley's solo lp is much better (see my review). I couldn't honestly see too many fans actually buying this CD reissue EXCEPT for maybe bored (yawn!) completists. I don't like to whine that much, but this disc was sort of tough for me to sit all the way through. There are a few so-so cuts, like \\"Burning Up With Fever\\", \\"See You Tonite\\" and possibly \\"Mr.Make Believe\\". But the album's closer \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" almost made my dinner come up. Simply avoid at ALL costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The least exciting of the four solo albums!","review":"Gene Simmons seem to believe his solo album was the best, as well as the most liked. I would say that Simmons recorded the least exciting album of the four Kiss members. The opening \\"Radioactive\\" is the album's highlight. The Beatles sounding \\"See you tonight\\" and the quite rocking \\"Burning up with fever\\" are better than the average, but when it comes to the closing \\"When you wish upon a star\\", I certainly wish that Simmons would shut up - it's plain awful. The overall impression is that it's rather lame and the material is in fact quite weak more than occasionally. Simmons sure have a talent for business, but he surely think too much of his musical skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gene Simmons sings Barry Manilow!","review":"Gene, what was going on in your head here? I thought you liked to rock, I thought you spit blood and breathed fire! But dueting with the likes of Donna Summer and Helen Reddy is beyond comprehendible!

I don't even know."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Legend In His Own Mind....","review":"I heard Gene thought his solo album was the best of the four. Oh really? Only the song \\"See You in Your Dreams\\" saves this effort from sinking to a one star rating. After listening to all 4 solo albums (on vinyl) again after 25 years, it is way \\"too\\" easy to see why Kiss went downhill after Ace's departure. Paul's effort is solid, but only a shade above ordinary hard rock. And bless Peter for trying. This? You'll maybe listen to it once all the way thru; that's if you don't keel over laughing during the final track. The sound samples here are all you need to convince you."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt even warrant 1 star","review":"Of all the solo's released under the kiss flag this ranks dead last!

Isn't that enough to warrant a 1 star rating? This is supposed to be the Demon of the band KISS. Back in 1978 they still carried that air of mystery. So, when I hear Gene covering a Jiminy Cricket song, it's time to pack up and move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought it would be","review":"I am a big Kiss fan; however, I've always been afraid of the solo ablums.

He really took some risks with it, especially on the When You Wish Upon a Star song, which I happen to enjoy.

Gene is the Man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"You would expect the demon of kiss to have a heavy enerjetic solo album but its the exact opposite. I think there are 2 good songs on it. I believe we actually have Cher to blame for this because she was dating Gene at the time and probably influenced him. There is a good version of \\"See you in your dreams tonight\\" which was on the kiss album Rock and roll over. Do your self a favor and don't buy this unless you are a kiss obsessor (like myself)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Absolute Worst of the Solo Efforts","review":"This album just plain stinks! It is the product of a pompous, egotistical megalomaniac. Oh, and look at the all-star cast: Cher, Helen Reddy, Liza Minelli, just to name a few. This album reeks of blantant shameless commercialism. \\"See You in Your Dreams\\" is a great song off of the \\"Rock-n-Roll Over\\" album. It was remade on this album and absolutely ruined. To make matters worse, it then fades into \\"When You Wish Upon a Star.\\" \\"Tunnel of Love\\" and \\"Livin' in Sin\\" are examples of Gene's overwhelming obsession with sex and with his narcisistic self. The only cut that has any alleged redeeming qualities is \\"Radioactive.\\" This song translated very well into the Dynasty Tour's live set. Still, that doesn't change the fact that this album is just plain lousy. It's only value is as a collector's item. Any sane person would be embarassed to be caught listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gene's Ego Running Wild","review":"Unfortunately this was done in 1978 when nearly all music was horrid. Radioactive is fun and some of the stuff is ok. I was on the floor laughing the first time I heard the lyrics 'I'm living in sin at the Holiday Inn' because it was so stupid. The music on the song was good though. Hearing Gene sing 'when you wish upon a star' is very painful. Overall this album is just too slow - call me a purist but one slow Kiss song a record is plenty."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Okay Album","review":"Of all the Kiss solo albums, Gene Simmon's release would have to be the most experimental. Almost all of it isn't my taste, but it's not completely bad though. \\"Mr. Makebelieve\\" would have to be the best track on here. \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" is also surprisingly good. As far as I remember, when I first heard that song I was quite baffled. But it's not bad. I actually give this album 2.5 stars. I think this could have been a better album--heavier."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is bad","review":"I think that this album should have never been released. A little better than Criss' solo album, which is not saying much, Radioactive and See You Tonight are average at best while the rest is BAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Joke","review":"Gene Simmons never stopped criticizing the solo-effort of his collegue Peter Criss. But where Criss really tried to make a 'solo' album, not a great one but a good one, Simmons never came any further than hiring a couple of famous names, without even considering taking time to write a decent tune. This resulted in one of the worst Kiss albums ever. It contains a couple of decent songs, but most of the songs are rock-musical based tunes that are just not good enough. Wanna buy one of the solo-albums? Don't go for this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Gene Wished Upon A Star","review":"Buy this one for the front cover art only.

What about all of the MMT patients who have been successfully using methadone for 10 or more years, where were they profiled in this book? And the social worker friend of hers who said all MMT patients with children should have them taken away should have her license taken away!

But stranger yet- she does come to meet him, and when Stuart discovers his canoe has been damaged, he speaks bitterly, sulks, screams, and acts like a rude jerk toward his guest. When she keeps trying to encourage him to make the best of it, he acts selfish, spoiled, and abusive. He refuses a peppermint she offers him.

The boat race was especially inspired, fun to read aloud (although I didn't know half the jargon), and my son repeated the colorful seefaring phrases for days. However, I grew frustrated as the story grasps for bizarre plot arcs (I'm willing to accept a mouse that talks, but a 5-inch tall girl named Harriet Ames is just random).Because my son is adopted, I appreciated the \\"different kinds of families\\" theme at the beginning of the book.

As if this is just the way it was. End of discussion. I loved that! Funny. And the writing is charming, to be sure, but the story just goes on without getting anywhere. It's one adventure after another without an end in sight. No goal. That's my trouble with Stuart Little.To explain the sudden and unsatisfying ending, I did hear that the author, White, was quite a hypochondriac. At the time of this book's writing, he was convinced he was going to die at any moment, (He ended up living a number of decades after Stuart Little was first published.) So, fearing certain death, White demanded the publisher to publish the book now!, as is, \\"before I die tomorrow!\\" Amazing, but true."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER RECEIVED BOOK!","review":"I CANNOT TELL YOU IF I LIKED THE ITEM OR NOT BECAUSE I NEVER RECEIVED IT.

As a child, I think we all felt tiny in a great big world, and rereading this book recaptures that part of childhood, when we as adults often feel the world is a much smaller place.

It is about a mouse named Stuart who is born to a family of humans. His adventures include going down bathtub drains, pushing up sticky piano keys, retrieving lost ping-pong balls, and sailing in a toy boat called The Wasp. When his bird friend Margalo comes along, the adventures double. But when Margalo goes missing, he goes on a journey to find her. With a red toy car and a trunk full of doll clothes, he heads south. Young and old will all love this classic by E.B White."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull family classic","review":"The second son of the Little family turns out to be a mouse, whom they nevertheless name Stuart and raise as their own. I was somewhat underwhelmed by this family classic. Stuart's \\"adventures,\\" such as riding on a toy boat and going down a drain, are related briefly and dully, without developing much tension or excitement. The characters are unfailingly stiff and polite with each other; even the interaction between family members often comes off like conversations between strangers at a cocktail party. The Little family's treatment of Stuart seems quite neglectful as well. Mr. Little, in particular, seems to think nothing of sending his little son into potentially dangerous situations, such as down a drainpipe to fetch a ring. At one point, the book describes how it becomes Stuart's job to go inside the piano while it is being played and hold on to a key that sticks, even though doing so subjects him to loud noises that affect his hearing for hours afterward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Famous author, over rated book","review":"The first half of the book is charming and enjoyable, but my family and I lost interest in the second half, which seemed to be \\"fill\\" to complete the work for publication. We found the book to be inconsistant in its style; Was STUART LITTLE meant to be complete fiction, with disappearing cars, other little people, and people who accepted Stuart's made up money, or a story about a small mouse-boy in an otherwise normal world? Save yourself some time, and skip STUART LITTLE. If you're interested in a story about little people, I'd recommend THE LITTLES by John Peterson ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Windsor Middle School A.H.","review":"This book is very interesting and fun to read.

This book is one of the rare technical books I can recommend this way. The price tag of 105 is hefty, but many books today are outlandishly priced.

I think it was a gift from the newspaper,... Anyway it was fantastic. Rading this book was like having the need of knowing more and more about it. On the one had I wanted to end reading it but on the other hand I had a sad feeling of doing it. I had ever heard nothing about Paul Auster, but since then I started reading any thing I found about him. He is an artist. I think that there is not much people able to write as he does it. His descriptions are exelent, and all the people he introduces you seem to be real and near to you. First of all I tried to tell my friends to read it , but his name seemed strange to them and didn't trust on me. But now I feel I am not the only one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting and intriguing character study","review":"I began reading Leviathan with no knowledge of Auster other than that a friend enjoyed his work. The book read quicker and more easily than I expected, but it is by no means shallow or simple.

Folks, this is a rewrite of the far superior \\"The Locked Room\\". Still, it almost makes it; had the development of Sach's and the narrator's relationship been more deeply considered this may have been quite good. At each point in the novel we are given a situation that brings us almost, not quite, a little bit further... to the development of any sort of dynamic between the characters. Relationships go from white to black with the drop of a hat. Somewhat contradicting myself, Auster could have successfully dropped all relationships in the novel for a development of a philosophical theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started great, went sour","review":"This author has a lot of talent, but it really lost it the minute the scene in VT occurred.

The last 50 or so pages were really bad.All the same the guy is a very gooooood writer at his best. Almost reminds me of a cross between Summons to Memphis and LA Confidential.

The vocals are without personality and the risque subject matter is juvenile rather than erotic or sensuous.

I mean, I never really wonder why he hated Superman so much...mmmm...other than because he's being evil. Origin of Bizarro is also in this book. What I didn't like about this book is there is very little action. Superman mostly fights nobodies on the street and the only real villain he fights is Bizarro.

In this movie the effects are so overused there technically isn't even a single fight sequence in the entire thing.
