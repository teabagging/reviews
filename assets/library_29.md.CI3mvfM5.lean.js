I didn't realize until after I read Michelle's book that Michelle had the mini gastric bypass surgery, which is an old surgery that has been abandoned as being dangerous. Barbara Thompson's book covers everything about the RNY weight loss surgery and what you have to do after the surgery to be successful. It has become my bible. My surgeon recommended this book to me after he had read it. Barbara Thompson brings up important information that I hadn't even thought about. It is very well researched and very personally written. If you get only one book on weight loss surgery, make sure it is this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"First of all I must commend Barbara Thompson and her long road to success with WLS, as well as the courage it takes to discuss this very personal matter in such a public forum. However, if you are looking for a book that focuses on factual medical answers to the tough questions you may have about WLS, then this is not the book for you. This book is a light read, easily finished in an evening. Often I found many of Ms. Thompson's answers to commonly asked questions lacking in research or based solely on her personal experience, which is great for a look at personal testimony about what she went through but not very factual for typical surgery experiences. If you are looking for detailed answers to your questions about WLS, you may want to read the various books out by Michelle Boasten, who is an RN and presents information in a more objective manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible","review":"This is the worst book I have bought on weight loss surgery. It is so bad. It has the most basic information. I flipped through it for 4 minutes and it is now going in the trashcan. There is no substance. I thought there would be a lot more about how to live once you get the surgery, and there is a tiny chapter in the back. The rest is the most common information you can find on the internet. And some really annoying obvious information. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally Moving","review":"This has to be one of my all time favorite classics.

It has hundreds of photos, wonderful tales of adventure, and a mountain of information that will provoke and delight anyone interested in the region.And what a region. Once a major route between the silks and technology of China and the markets of ancient Rome, trekked by Alexander the Great, now buried in sand and the indifference of centuries.

It is so amazing how much insight and wisdom these workers had into the life of their employers. it's hard to believe it's true not fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two sides to a story","review":"This historical publication interviews 42 women(both black and white) in the 1980's to determine their perspective regarding the bond between domestic workers and their employers from the turn of the century to the 1960's. It was referenced in \\"The Help\\" and provided much background. It definitely shows that, although these women often worked under the same roof, they definitely had two different opinions relative to their own situations and lifestyles. Some of the women interviewed were open and honest, and others were obviously reticent still to candidly speak their opinions, maybe out of a feeling of loyalty or possibly fear. Several times I felt as if I walked in to an already-in-progress interview and missed much of it. I don't know if parts were edited out (and possibly the lapse in time has caused interviewees to forget), but I would like to have heard more. The book is an intense piece of work that left me feeling hungry to read more on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Telling Memories Among Southern Women","review":"This was an interesting follow-up after reading the HELP and seeing the movie.

It does a good job of warning about the perils of a Big Brother society.Part 2 is where Bar Code Tattoo completely and utterly crashes in on itself. The pacing is terrible, plotting poor, and the writing weak. Ms. Weyn gets pushy with her message.

The premise was unique and interesting, and it sounded good. However, after reading it I regret ever having done so. The writing was poor, and the author seemed to flit from one thing to another without a thought of consistency or plot development. One moment she meets new people, then she flees again, then she suddenly develops an aptitude for telepathy. Its hard to figure out where the author is trying to go with anything, and the book as a whole was just a mess. I definitely do not recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"This is easily one of the worst books I've ever read. The plot is poorly thought out, with new plot points springing from the pages without warning and without just consideration. Rather than flowing seamlessly from one event to the next, it seems as though the author added in random ideas whenever she got bored. Every time the scene becomes too static, she introduces a betrayal or kills someone off.And because of the poor planning of this novel, the story begins a million miles away from where it ends, leaving many of the plot points unresolved or only hastily, untidily wrapped up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, poor execution","review":"I decided to read this book because I thought it had an interesting premise.

Interesting premise, not so awesome writing. It's most certainly not Weyn's best work, but it is what got her some attention. There really wasn't a huge amount in this genre at the time (2004) and she did well breaking in with something different.I've read reviews that tell you the story is predictable. It's not. Well, it wasn't for when it was first published. Sure...it is now, when dystopian YA fiction is all the rage. The characters are all a little weak, and yes, Weyn has some disjointed connections here and there. But the book isn't a lost cause.The story doesn't wrap up neatly, which is a plus.

After nearly two years in a medium-sized, boutique law firm, I think the situations and advice of the author are on-point. The book is a bit unconventional, but after a few chapters, I found it well-written and really funny, which makes it a lot easier to digest. I recommend this book to all new lawyers. It has information you won't find anywhere else - including stuff nobody ever mentioned to me - and you might pay a hundred bucks to duplicate it, if you could find a \\"Senior\\" lawyer who cared enough to tell you everything written in the book.

I was very embarrassed, and hid it in my carryall. I was very, very unhappy at work, but I started to read it. I spent all weekend reading it, and ended up reading it three times! This is an amazing book. I now see what I've been doing wrong, and I will change everything I do at the office. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. Messinger.

Imagine putting up with this miserable joke of a \\"career\\" for 1/3 the money biglaw pays. Small firms are horrible too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for another book","review":"This book is nothing more than the author's attempt to act smarter, and more well educated, than he actually is. From his blatant use of a thesaurus on every other word, to his analogies with Confucius, the Hitler Jugend, the Soviet Komsomol, and hundreds of others; the author tries to sound like a genius.Although there is some useful information, I urge you to save your money for other law books. In this one, you won't find more than two informative sentences before the author deviates to three paragraphs of useless cliches, quotes in foreign languages, and endless rigmarole. The author has desperately tried to make this book much more than it actually is. As a result, the 225 pages actually contain only 20-25 pages of useful information."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a mess","review":"I do not understand the enthusiasm for this book in the previous reviews.

I returned my copy to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advice that demeans","review":"Eager as I was to get advice, being a first year associate myself, I was disappointed. The book is, at times, demeaning, offensive, and out dated. Foolishly, instead of correcting grammatical or worse mistakes in his book, the author makes fun of the editors' (reasonable) comments for revisions in footnotes. Also, he distractingly uses made up words like \\"and're\\", supposedly for \\"and you're\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleh","review":"A lawyer recommended this book to me. Let me neutralize that advice by trying to convince you not to buy it. Two problems here.1) Mr. Messinger never convincingly establishes what his credentials are to write this book. The extent of his traditional law firm experience seems to be a brief stint as a junior associate, and his advice seems to be derived entirely from that limited experience. This is akin to a book about succeeding in law school written by someone who dropped out after the first year.2) Mr. Messinger's prose desperately needs an editor, but since he published the book himself (\\"The Fine Print Press\\" is a thinly-veiled alter ego for the author) you're out of luck. The book has some worthwhile points to make, but Mr. Messinger writes like a motormouth party guest who never tires of his own sense of humor.There are other books out there, by law firm partners, that cover the same material more succinctly. Buy one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible and strangely written","review":"this was the absolute worst book on being a lawyer I have read, and I read quite a few when starting off law school.

This CD is unique in its approach to the didgeridoo, pairing it almost exclusively with the acoustic guitar. I have since picked up Outback's only other recordingDance the Devil Awayand have been equally impressed with that disc, although it is definitely a very different offering by this creative duo, incorporating roughly a dozen other instruments in their approach to the songs.

The movie itself was just so-so though. It's about how her character is trying to rescue a city leader (in Mongolia I think) from the Japanese. It didn't really feel like an adventure, as one might assume from her Indiana Jones-esque character.

The plot really gets going when she is recruited to assist a spy deep within Japanese held land and ends up becoming embroiled in the resistance efforts whole-hog.The film features excellent cinematography, fine performances by all actors, and well-choreographed martial arts sequences. There were some silly sound effects related to those fight scenes, but that's to be expected in an older film like this one.The only dissapointment I felt was that I would have liked to see some of the plot and characterzation touches. (For example, was the drifter related to our heroine or not?)All in all, though, this is a very enjoyable flick which I highly recommend.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie !!

I talked to Garmin and they said their maps are updated at the same time as MapQuest on an annual basis. My neighborhood has been in existance for four years and yet my whole neighborhood does not show. However, Garmin said that my neighborhood will be on the next update in September.

Afterwards, Smith systematically refutes post-modernism thinking and logic as it pertains to Christianity. At the same time, Smith recognizes critical issues that post-modernist Christian writers discuss, which the modern church needs to address.

The book outlines the many ways professors and administrators encourage mindless conformity and fail to educate.p.s.I notice many posts about this book by people who attack it and haven't read it.

However, as a non-leftist student of Brown myself, I find the book overtly biased in its gross over-simplification of politics on campus and the type of atmosphere that has been created. Brown is a remarkable institution with a student body that is by and large very intelligent and open-minded; the author unfortunately seems to target specific examples of sheer absurdity which are generally not indicative of overall life here and which do not reflect in the least the sort of experience I or my other non-leftist friends have had.

Unfortunately, Mr. Rowley's amateurish account of his years as a studet (or was it as a football player?)at Brown University only serve to reinforce this latter point. His views are laced with a type of reactionism common to most college Freshmen, whether left- or right-leaning, but lack the intellectual development of a writer apparently some years removed from life as a college student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"A repetitive, often trite and condesending look and why he did not like his college experience.

As a self-proclaimed expert on elite academia, I thought I had heard all there is to know about the sad state of educational affairs within these top schools. But Mr. Rowley reveals shocking revelations to even those who stay on top of the subject. Yes, some of his stories make you laugh, but some of them just make us realize how far behind the conservative movement remains on these campuses. It's discouraging to anyone who is concerned about the future of this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"rambles","review":"I am a successful stock trader and have been for over 5 years.I also trade ETF's.I have been searching for a good futures book to get a good understanding of the rules of the game.This book is poorly organized.It rambles from commodity to order fillings to exchange to nothing.If you are wanting to learn the basics of the exchanges,what is traded on what and the nuances of deliveries and all the questions a beginner has,do not buy this book.I have stopped reading the book after chapter 8.I can not waste anymore of my time.Any book on the subject is better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really basic stuff so do not expect much","review":"The book is really basic in nature and tries to cover what the title conveys.

I left Africa with a mission to find this group (who ever they were). I recently heard \\"Spirit of the Forest\\" on the air here at KGNU Boulder, Co. - That was it!

This is early-Barry, from 1976, but re-mastered to accomodate today's Fanilows. 13 tracks, a wee bit over 47 minutes total. Old favorites/Manilownian classics are: \\"New York City Rhythm, Tryin' To Get The Feeling Again, I Write the Songs, Bandstand Boogie\\", and \\"Beautiful Music.\\" Some other popular Barry tunes heard less often are: Why Don't We Live Together,\\" \\"As Sure As I'm Standin' Here,\\" \\"Lay Me Down,\\" and \\"You're Leavin' Too Soon\\". A few that I had not heard before are: \\"She's A Star, A Nice Boy Like Me, I'll Make You Music, and Marry Me A Little\\".A great collection, it includes an 8-page booklet with a couple of young Barry photos and the words to all the songs, so you can sing along. There is also a photo of young Barry with his beagle Bagel. Barry's Bagel-Beagle, I mean, Barry's Beagle Bagel. In the booklet, Barry tells us he got to use his own band on this CD, augmented by by New York studio musicians. It was a dream come true for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manilow Fanilow (too much? I know)","review":"Okay, so I'm just being honest: songs like Why Don't We Live Together are too cheesy, even for this diehard Fanilow. But songs like Lay Me Down and Trying To Get The Feeling move me each time, and Bandstand Boogie and New York City Rhythm get me moving. Much more to love about this album than not, and it's much better than just the greatest hits compilations that always leave out Lay Me Down, which I think is one of his absolute best best best. The album is worth it just for that tune! In short, this album is worth it, period. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"painful","review":"This book is about a womans experience in revolutionary Russia.

I was a huge fan of her in the 80's when she earned a little success here in Europe.Now she decided that she wants to do everything on her own... the only thing she didn't consider is that she's a lousy songwriter. All of the songs are dull and repitive. There's not a single hook line that knocks you off your feet and the lyrics are a little over the top: peace, love, happiness, believe in yourself yada yada yada... we've heard this a million times and the whole CD is a joke.

First, I have to say that she has my total respect for releasing her CD independently. Her voice is still strong and undeniably one of the best. The songs however lack of good hooklines and charismatic songs that her producers prepared for her in Europe in the late 80's. She had strong material to go with an extra-ordinary voice. Now Lory's voice can't conceal the lack of good hit potential that is surely missing on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus Rocks!","review":"This CD is one of the best Johnny Rivers albums I've ever listened too.

Although all of the Darkover books are theoretically standalone, this one is definitely improved by having some background.That said, I love this book. The only minor quibble I have about it is that I get a slightly stronger sense of Magda's character than of Jaelle's, even though the book is supposed to focus equally on both women.One of the best things about this book, to me, is that even the antagonistic characters are not portrayed as evil. Bradley makes excellent use of the shades of gray in every character throughout the book.(Also, it's so nice to have a major character refusing to define herself exclusively as heterosexual or lesbian! Definite yay!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dare to question conventional thinking...","review":"The second in the series of stories depicting Magdalen Lorne, the Terran struggling to belong to a world in which her people are extremly distrusted, and Jaelle n'ha Melora, the native struggling against her expected duty and place in feminine society. Thrown together in the first novel, Magda and Jaelle become fast friends, the only two who do not belong anywhere and find comfort only in each other. Thendara House is the story of these women, one a native trying to work and leave peacefully with the alien Terrans, and one a Terran trying to pass successfully as a native, who discover that one cannot be what she is not, and one cannot escape that which is destined to be. Struggling to control their untrained laran (ESP), they find peace only in the crux of disaster, and finally learn that they cannot always rely on their own stregnth to survive.

By the other way Margali is leaving in Thendara House for her 6 month reclusion with the renunciants. She has also many problems in relationship with others darkovans.

They are not looking to speed up or slow down the classics of the cuban music. The performance is technically correct. The notes and arrangements are synchronous in every detail and this produces, eventually, a monotonous sound. The cd lacks, in great amounts, soul. The first cut \\"Descarga de Hoy\\" is an example of this. It simply fails to deliver in its performance. Descarga, cuban slang for a jam session, cannot be \\"boxed\\" in."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a dump, and I still enjoyed it!","review":"This is a truly unique movie. The leads can't act, the sets look rediculous, the plot is so thin, you hardly know it is there, but it is still wonderfully entertaining. Flash Gordon makes one big joke out of every other science-fiction movie ever made. The supporting cast, led by Max von Sydow and Timophy Dalton gives their best possible performance, even if Dalton has trouble at times to keep a straight face. The sets are so crummy, that they only add to the entertainment, von Sydow has a great time being evil. An excellent movie for the whole family. The children will take it seriously and love it (there is even enough sex to make them think their almost grown-up) and adults will have a good laugh. Either way, nobody is going to be bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interceptor says: If you like sci-fi, you'll like this.","review":"I first saw this movie when I was about three years old. Even then I was already nuts about sci-fi movies. What I liked about it then is what I like about it now. The action and the music. Over all it is a great movie. My favorite part is when Flash and the Hawkmen are attacking the War Rocket \\"Ajax\\". That I feel is where the music was best of all. As far as the characters in that sceen, I really got a kick out of Vultan. You can't watch him in that scean and not get the impression that he had just been so anxious for that moment that he could taste it. That's all for now but, keep a sharp lookout. You don't know where The Interceptor will turn up next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flash Gordon (Saviour of The Universe Edition)","review":"Ahhh Ahhhh Flash! My wife and I love these great 80's cult classics. The music by Queen is awesome! The special effects were respectable for the day but it was the mix of romance and humor that is the most entertaining part of this movie. The packaging leaves a little to be desired, we were hoping for a glossy color information pull out cover with juicy information about the movie, maybe words to the songs and some fun pictures, but it is fairly plain, just a 5\\"x7\\" card with a black and white comic book sketch. If you enjoy music by Queen or the semi-cheesy 80's cult classic style movies I would say Flash Gordon (Saviour of The Universe) is a big thimbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLASH! AAHHH!","review":"A great movie for Sci-Fi lovers! It has it all; an evil sadistic ruler from outer-space(Max von Sydow); the beautiful, helpless lady in distress(Melanie Anderson); and the only person that could possibly save the Earth, our hero, Flash Gordon(Sam J. Jones).I loved it. I admit, it's not exactly Star Wars, but it's a good, fun, sci-fi adventure.This movie, in my opinion, speaking as a father, is for older audiences.

The dialog is appropriately cheezy, the visuals are splashy, and the music by Queen keeps things speeding along.

Great scenery chewing performances by nearly everyone, and a rocking Queen soundtrack make this movie really stand out from most of the sci-fi Star Wars rip-offs being made at the time.

It was released on VHS for awhile, but for the last several years it was only available at the ridiculous price of $99.00, or more.Flash Gordon is the classic American Sci-Fi hero, and has had numerous incarnations, but this 1980 version is the best by far. The acting, directing, and cinematography are all excellent. The special effects were leading edge for their time. The soundtrack by Queen is perfect for the film. This version is exciting, campy, and a classic Sci-Fi adventure.Buy it! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flash Gordon DVD","review":"Just how I remembered it from when I was a kid.

No sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"After a long wait, disappointing news","review":"Flash Gordon (Saviour Of The Universe Edition) (2007) Region 1/NTSCThe bonus features for this long-awaited release are truly disappointing. The Region 2 dvd (2005) has commentaries and the usual extra features that we have come to expect on special edition dvds. However, the Region 1 Flash Gordon does not have much to offer by way of extras, and none of those that our European counterparts received in the 2005 Silver Anniversary Edition. Is it too late to give us a real collector's edition of Flash Gordon? Hopefully we will get a 2-disc issue in the future with at least the Reg. 2 features or something similar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Again...","review":"The movie itself is pure fun. The video transfer is great. The audio is not so great. What happened to the bass? I though the woofers in my speakers were not working. The original vhs version of the movie sounds better.The extras are a joke. The cover art was not impressive. The packaging design seems to indicate that there are some cool stuff included the casing. There is one pencil sketch which to me looks very amatureistic...that's it.Everything else about this \\"Saviour Of The Universe Edition\\" has been mentioned before so I'll stop right here.My copy is going into my \\"sell\\" drawer, while I wait for some company who has enough interest in the project to remaster it the RIGHT way.I'm very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know Before You Buy!","review":"For me, what made this Flash Gordon movie so special was the music by Queen (though Brian Blessed is great!) and if that's what you remember and why you are considering buying this DVD, then DON'T!The images are clear. The story as campy and fun as ever. But the music seems to have been phoned in from Hong Kong over a very bad connection. For me, this ruined everything. Save your money. Better to by the CD of the soundtrack!! How in this day and with the technology available this DVD ever saw the light of day is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLASH GORDON is FUN !","review":"Flash Gordon (Savior of the Universe Edition) is FUN to watch. We consider it a Sci-Fi Classic. There is 1 episode of the old black and white series of Flash Gordon on the DVD, which was cute to see, but would have been much better if they had the whole series to compare with the movie. Love the campy movie, very colorful version. Of course, music by Queen is fantastic ! Can watch it over and over. It's GREAT !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome movie","review":"I had nearly worn my tape to nothing with this movie. I just love it but the DVD is a thousand times clearer.

A bit corny but if you liked the old Flash Gordon comics you will love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I traveled to my childhood","review":"I just end watching the film and it totally transported myself to my childhood back on 1980 when I was a 7 years old kid. I Know this movie is kind of cheesy and has this theatrical, over-acted old-style movie look. But it is very entertaining, so much fun to see and you don't get bored at any moment. The lines are so golden-age comic-styled and the production design is totally based on the 1930's original art concepts.Its a must have movie for the fans.Positive points: You can have the pic now. The quality is acceptable. You can watch the first 1936's Flash Gordon chapter, totally new for me! The packaging is so collective and deluxe. Its always nice to hear Queen's soundtrack.Negative points: Some errors in lipsynch. A booklet would have been nice.In general terms: am so happy with this product. I recommend it if you watched this film as a child and now you want to enjoy some time feeling the way you felt back in 1980."},{"rating":"2","title":"One more thing I wish it had...","review":"If they remixed the audio to 5.1, there is one additional thing they should have added - a music-only track. I'd love to actually be able to hear the incredible music Queen did without all the dialogue on the CD soundtrack. A DVD would be an easy way to provide this, as an alternate audio track, and I think hoping for a CD without it is wasted energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie a 5; Lacking most Important Special Feature","review":"The Special Feature that must happen is the one where Queen's soundtrack is the only thing you hear. Including each time it is used to \\"hear\\" movement. That soundtrack is beyond amazing.The movie itself is a tribute to how special effects were done prior to the advent of computers. Why not a featurette on how these techniques were done? Interviews with the various actors, the costumer, etc. would also be wonderful. The costumes were amazing! An inspiration to any costumer.I have the Region 2 DVD and am very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical film","review":"If you want to purchase this film, you must to consider that It's was made about 25 years ago. You will not see digital effects, nor sound 7.1, but it's a must-have film for the 80's generation. The soundtrack (Queen) is the best !!! The costumes are very expensive and beautiful...and, of course, the performance of the actors (except Flash) are ok.You will pass a nice time watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie, Bad Disk made Right","review":"I saw the original movie in the theaters, so I thought I would buy a copy on DVD.I thought I was buying a new DVD, paid for one.

This is a fun B rated movie from the early 80's that I enjoy watching about once a year. Yes yes yes I know.

Especially when the sexy Timothy Dalton makes an appearance, or when the music is provided by one of the best 80's groups there was--Queen! Ornella Muti is good too, so is Max Von Sydow as Ming.

I enjoy listening to all her cds (this one in particular) and seeing her live whenever I can. She is reinventing contemporary folk music, as far as I am concerned- going back the basics of being down-to-earth, telling great stories (some of which you'll even hear on this album), and writing lyrics and music that could stand on its own- but combining them to create some great art and some great fun. She's also very new york/east village cool but chill- if you know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real, honest, wonderful.","review":"This is a great CD, it really captures what's she's like live and on stage.

The CD is rather subtle with the intricacies weaved in deep. The music is nothing short of quietly stunning, and the title track \\"Matapedia\\" is simply one of the most beautiful and haunting songs I have heard in my 41 years. I caught this track on a college radio station while driving home the other day and had to google The McGarrigles immediately (there's a strange phrase- eh?). For this one track alone, the CD is more than worth the expenditure. But I'm slowly beginning to see the eloquence in the other tracks as well.

After 20 years' familiarity with my increasingly scratched antique vinyl version of this Brit jazz-rock classic, I was looking forward to having a pristine and cleaned-up version on CD. But goodness knows in which river the master tapes have been lying for the last 30 years - the sound warbles almost completely throughout the CD, and there is wow and flutter with pitch variation. Apparently Beat Goes On Records have promised to try to find a better source to master this album from in future. It's a pity, because in its proper form this is a masterpiece of jazz-rock fusion - or, more accurately, collision! - everything that \\"Septober Energy\\" attempted to be but didn't quite succeed (even though many of the same musicians play on it), and would without question have received 5 stars from me under any other circumstances.

The concert was a revelation and I became among the annoited Cale fanatics and bought every release by this criminally ignored genius. I own every Cale CD (including four anthologies)and quite a few out of print vinyl editions of his work. Of the 2000+ compact discs I own, \\"Fragments of A Rainy Season\\" has graced my CD player more than any other album in the ten years since it's release. This live album focuses on all of Cale's strengths, his lyrical song craft, his tender and anguished voice, his instumental wizardry and his larger-than-life stage presence. Give this wonderful showcase of Cale's brilliance a listen and I promise you will seek more. The additional tracks that have been piggy-backed onto the original 1992 release make this CD a real dollar value."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Cale, raw and unplugged.","review":"Fragements of a Rainy Season was John Cale's unpluggedalbum. He sings his \\"hits\\" with only an accoustic guitar and piano. From his first album after being sacked from the Velvet Underground to his album with Lou Reed (Songs for Drella) Cale covers his most known work. Despite using only a piano and guitar, Cale rips through Safe and Guts with reckless (but refined) abandon. Classical trained musician, Cale adds a touch of class to the avant-garde music scene.

Finally, here was evidence of the greatness in the music of my parent's generation, and the beauty of a spare, stripped down sound with deep lyrics and deeper emotion.

Robert Letham has a better Reformed perspective (though admittedly a more difficult read) and there are others outside the Reformed community whose books will better serve as (basic) foundational studies in both the areas of doctrine & practicality (Bruce A.

It is just a collection of terribly anti-climactic short stories. They lack any sort of real punch at the beginning or even the end of the four to six page marvels. Unfortunately for me, I found Jason's writing to be plain, boring, and most of all uninspiring. If you want to live the cruising life through another's eyes check out An Embarrassment of Mangoes, Seasoned By Salt, or The Heart of the Sea.

Reading about it is as close as they come. Ray Jason's \\"Tales of a Sea Gypsy\\" is a terrific way to touch the seagoing life, even if you don't go near the water. This old salt and longtime reader of tales of the sea has left the briny deep for calmer waters closer to shore and given his oilskins to a younger sailor - a girl, by gemini! That makes reading about seagoing exploits the more important.

If Mr. Jason had left his continuous attempts at humor out, I'm sure it would have been a good book as I'm sure he has very good stories to tell. When I bought the book I felt I could overlook the humor and grasp the story, no way. The attemp at humor is on every line of the book and the key word here is attempt. I am sorry I didn't take the advice of the Canadian reviewers.

It is a book to make you smile, laugh, and in the end you will put it in your library as a reminder of why we go to sea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, uninspiring read","review":"Being a fan of sailing stories, I bought this book on the strength of the glowing recommendations by other reviewers. However I was very disappointed. Mr. Jason's constant and annoying attempts at comedy fail to make his sea-yarns even mildly entertaining. This \\"four hour read\\" book is largely a waste of time and money. There are far better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!!!","review":"I would strongly recommend to ignore all the positive comments about the book. It is not funny, does not make you want to go around the world sailing. Ray was trying too hard to be witty, he failed. I lent the book to some of my friends, they felt the same way. Plus, the book is a 3 hour read - hardly worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toy was a hit","review":"I had bought this toy for my son's 8th birthday and it was a hit. I have three children and they all loved it. It's been three weeks now and they still play with it daily, it was a definate hit. My only disappoints were: They are plastic now, instead of wood. I recall as a kid, breaking the wood ones now and then. But the plastic is just as breakable, yet without the typical peircing points a broken wood one would have. I bought the large 200 piece tin of them, when I opened it up 2/3rds of the tin was nothing but air (they did take the time to add in cardboard so you wouldn't know.) I was disappointed such a large tin was so empty - but nontheless, the toy was a super hit. I wish I had bought them earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"a lot cheaper at toysrus","review":"I bought this for only $34 at toysrus.

I could not take it away from a 5 year old grandson but the container was just over 1/2 full. As a child I could make many interesting things. This set has so few parts one item is max.Very poor value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to fit pieces together","review":"Purchased this after my daughter created several \\"inventions\\" with her brother's set. We wanted more pieces for her. This set is plastic, the other is wood. I am not impressed at all with the plastic pieces. Many of them were hard for me to fit together and I am quite strong. The plastic pieces also bend--their wooden counterparts do not. The pictures of things to build that come with the kit are in color--but the pieces do not necessarily match the picture..i.e the pink rod in the picture may be the blue rod in the kit that is the same size. Made building the ferris wheel extremely annoying. Will likely return this kit and get more wooden sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of fun for the grandchildren","review":"This really gets the creative juices flowing! Amazing creations from our grandchildren - and they love it. A really pleasant change from computer games. What we would like to get, to supplement this, is the Space Explorer set, and the Toy Builder set. Our kids had those, and they were absolutely great; however, they don't seem to be available anymore. If they are, I haven't been able to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic","review":"I have owned these for about 5 years. Very disappointed in the quality. My child didn't play a ton with them or abuse them but I just had to chuck them in the garbage because the pieces continuously break off into each other & you can't get them out which renders them useless. Plus, it creates very sharp edges when they break. I don't know if the plastic just weakens over the years or what,but unless they have improved the quality over the past years, I would not recommend these. I am going to buy the wooden ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy on Amazon, buy at local Toysrus","review":"This is a great toy, very educational, but don't buy it here on Amazon for $80+, its free shipping is delusional -- in local Toys'R'Us it's only $35....I just bought it yesterday."},{"rating":"1","title":"No instructions?","review":"Very disappointed that there no building instructions. Hasbro says the pictures on the can and the printed insert are all the instructions included. Well I might be a little satisfied with that if the colors of our parts matched the photo's colored parts. Very aggrivating having to decern what colors of our parts match those on the pictures cause the part's colors are not consistant from photo to photo on the printed insert. Legos does it right with step by step instructions. My kid loses interest fast when even his parents are having to decrypt the instructions to build the simple windmill. It's still a decent toy but be warned that these aren't your old favorite wooden parts and you're pretty much on your own to figure out how to build stuff by the included instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper at ToysRUs","review":"This is an excellent construction set, but I paid $34.99 for the same 200 piece set at ToysRUs, instead of the $99.95 advertised on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Not It","review":"If you're looking for the Johnny Appleseed cartoon that you saw in the 1970's or 1980's, this is not it. In the old story, he walked all over the country starting orchards and singing, \\"The Lord is Good to Me.\\" There was lots of color. In this story the colors are blue and brown, and he stays in a little town trying to convince everyone the virtues of apples & juice. No singing.

None of the songs are very innovative, but the overall impression generated is one of satisfaction. The opening track, 'Bombollini' is well constructed with an excellent rythmn section, and 'Ace of Hearts' is an up tempo ballad which works well. The title track remains my favourite, with a catchy tune and wonderful slide guitar.Time appears to have passed this album by; the next few releases from Chris Rea were probably his best to date, but this album is still worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Chris Rea","review":"This CD gives you an idea of where Chris Rea went after his 1970s pop success (\\"Fool If You Think It's Over\\") and before he started writing longer, Dire Straits-type guitar-based tunes.

However, I do not believe reading this book will give you a deeper understanding of what you need and can do to help children in the syndrome mix.

He presents the negative side of becoming an attorney and leaves out the positive side of legal practice.I found \\"Law School Confidential\\" to be a much better read.

But he encourages students to listen for their professors linguistic and political biases.Falcon doesn't seem to realize that he is writing primarily for students of top law schools. If you're like most students, you're attending a school with a lesser reputation that has to actually teach students in order to survive. The flaws in instruction he identifies are much less common in stories from students at, for example, the University of New Mexico. But even if you are going to one of your \\"safety\\" schools due to cost or location factors, I'd recommend this book to get you fired up before fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE ACCURACY AND WRITING","review":"I have a unique perspective on this book because the author, Atticus sent me a copy. He sent me a copy because he wrote about my case. Not only did he get the facts completely wrong, he used facts from a poorly written story in a sports magazine about the case. Law students should be given accurate examples and discussions of FACT and LAW. THAT is what the legal profession is about. Mr. Falcon (Mrs.? _ Atticus is a pen name...) owes a responsiblity to his readers to spend time getting the facts and the law right. I was amazed at the innacuracies and the bias demonstrated by Atticus. If the fact finding and legal innacruacies stated in my story is ANY indication of how Atticus handled the other cases mentioned this book is misleading, and arguably harmful, to law students. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I didn't read this BEFORE applying to law school!","review":"Negativity abounds in this book. The author (and I find it highly suspect that he wouldn't publish under his own name) clearly is a bitter, bitter person. Of course, since I'm going to a less than tier one school at night (double horrors!), what do I know? The way the author made it sound, I may as well not go at all, as I am doomed to fail and wind up in the gutter somewhere. I've gotten to chapter six, and am going to try to slog my way through the rest of it, as some of the reviewers have said he does have some insight into studying methods, but this book is very discouraging. If you want to go to law school, I would buy anything other than this book, you will only get depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!!","review":"This book is worthless. The author, writing under the alias Atticus Falcon, simply refers the reader to other books without giving any practical advice of his own. His so called expertise and credentials cannot be verified because he uses a fake name. For all we know, this guy is a law school drop-out, which would explain why the tone of this book is so negative and harsh. Also, Atticus Falcon has some really strong, racist opinions about minorities and gays that he expresses daily on his own website and Princeton Review message boards under another alias, \\"Sforza\\". There are many Pre-law books out there by reputable authors that are many times better than this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book three years ago .. and now I'm graduating","review":"I bought this book before I started law school, and in just a few weeks I'll be graduating. I would recommend this book to anyone planning on going to law school - read the recommended books (especially the Examples and Explanation series - I've bought them for every class I could), learn about study groups and outlines and study aids, but take the advice on the \\"horrors of law school\\" with a grain of salt.Maybe its because I went to a 4th tier law school (yet one I've very pround of!) but there was no back-stabbing, no in-class put-downs by professors, no hiding books - I went to a school were people actually give you notes if you miss a class - without you're having to ask for them - and where the rest of the class will chime in if someone is \\"on call\\" and doesn't know the answer (or as we say in class, \\"co-counsel\\").In any event, be prepared to work your tail off for three years, but enjoy yourself too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful at a top 10 law school","review":"PLS's list of recommended study aids is useful. However, I would be very wary of the author's advice to blow off anything concerning policy and concentrate only on the black letter law. At UVA, my experience so far has been that professors take it as a given that you know the black letter, and on the exams you are expected to show your mastery of the policy behind the black letter. Also, the author's advice of not paying much attention to the cases is dead wrong. Without an understanding of the cases, you will never learn the policy reasoning. In short, his advice may fly at a second-tier school, but if you attend a top school, take his advice with a grain of salt"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Helpful","review":"This book is just a bunch of lurid gossip.

In addition to thinking about what makes students successful, I have read various studies on the subject. I have read both PLS and the new edition of PLS. Apart from inviting students to take a self defeating attitude towards law school (e.g., his open hostility and demeaning comments about law professors will surely discourage readers from using an invaluable resources), much of his advice will reduce a student's likelihood of success.

I said the author suggests that students not BUY THE CASE BOOKS -- not sure how the person below got out of that that I said the author suggested students not read CASES (it would be pretty hard to pass your first year of law school w/o reading the cases, since law school is either case or statute driven exclusively).

I am applying for Fall 2000 and I am reading all the primers now. I think the point of the author is that Law School is a different animal and he suggests how to approach it successfully. We must do the work. This is not a magic pill. The book is a Godsend because I know that I need to prepare ahead of time. I would be foolish, however to believe that I am garaunteed success simply because I am preparing by the author's formula. My recommendation is to focus on the process of understanding the basics as many one star reviews say and pay less attention to the negative reviews about the author's personal feelings and experiences. Maybe the author needed to take a shot to feel better but the advice in this book is not to be found anywhere else! Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!! may cause anxiety in future lawyers","review":"Plant Law School was sent to me as a gift just before I began law school. As if I didn't have enough to worry about, this book caused me major anxiety. The author writes with biting negativity and states from the get-go that he wants to get out of the legal profession. He discusses at length the excrutiating pain that I had to look forward to and the torture that I could only lose sleep dreading. He goes beyond the \\"hell\\" that is law school to criticize the profession on numerous different levels. If you too, hate lawyers and have decided to avoid law school at all costs, this is the book for you. If you want to talk someone out of entering the legal profession, send them this book.

Falcon presents you with one truth -- getting good grades will take some work. First year is hard, but manageable. I would not purchase this book.

While I've no experiences of my own to compare to what Falcon writes, I cannot believe that a lawyer-especially one who claims to have attended a top tier school-could produce such a poorly written book. His style is a bitter, cynical diatribe that knows no subtlty. He often capitalizes words for no apparent reason, hyphenates words in the wrong places and uses a dizzying series of mixed metephors, absurd analogies and simplistic historical examples. His prose reveals him as one who has little knowledge of history and the English language, never mind law school. This book is in bad need of a good editor.

Al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Hamas are epigones. They vent their fury on those who took- or who suport those who took-from the Palestinians the country known as Israel. The moral is : No one has clean hands. The Human race would have a better chance for improvement if each race would face up to its own ignobility.\\" Quite disturbing, right?

DO NOT, under any circumstances, answer ANY of the interview questions as advised in this book. I interview law students and applicants to our firm every week. Upon hearing one of these \\"cooked\\" responses, I immediately put that person's resume/application in the \\"No\\" file.Do yourself a favor and answer job interview questions frankly, honestly and with originality. Your sincerity will play far better than the insulting routine this author -- and almost every other career counselor -- proposes.I don't know what's more pathetic: the fact that people like this are still making money encouraging applicants to \\"sell themselves like an infomercial\\" or the fact that other people actually give them money for the drivel they're shoveling."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Yeah, Rah, Rah!!!\\"","review":"My review is \\"give me a break\\". This book should have been titled, \\"Rah, Rah, You can do it, yeaaaaaaaaah!!!\\"How many times will the author say that we all should go to our CSO because they love to help us and they are counsellors first and lawyers second? She didn't meet my CSO and didn't mention them in her thank you section. Apparently she only met CSOs who wanted to be guidance counselors from birth and not the failed, bitter lawyers who got a CSO job as a favor.There are some interesting ideas that could have been boiled down to a few pages. Warning, a lot of those tactics might be effective for a petite, attractive woman but if you try some of it as a man security will escort you out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless advice","review":"The advice offered is something anyone who has graduated from high school would know. The author sounds like a cheerleader, constantly reminding you of how well you can do. Her conversational tone annoyed me from the beginning. It makes me glad I got this book off bookmooch, if I had paid for it I'd be upset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource for Any Law Student","review":"I discovered this book after a visit to my school by the author. Kimm Walton's writing is as personable and inspiring as she is in person. I found the chapter covering non-legal or alternative legal careers especially helpful. Whether you are looking for a traditional legal job or want to explore alternative options but have no clue where to look, this book is an invaluable resource.The only downside is that some of the advice she offers are pointers you could pick up from your Career Services Office. But even this is not directly negative criticism because any overlapping advice merely reinforces it's importance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent book, but not worth purchasing...","review":"Although the book includes some useful advice, I didn't like the tone of the writing (other reviewers have called it \\"cutesy\\"). I wouldn't recommend buying a new copy of \\"Guerrilla Tactics\\"; however, if you can find a used or borrowed copy, by all means skim through the book for information/advice that can be applied to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guerilla Tactics got me my job!","review":"I love this book. As silly as it all sounds it's based on common sense. I used Walton's guerilla tactics as a very unconventional law graduate and got a job at a big NY firm. I _highly_ recommend this book (and having the guts to do what she advises) to anyone looking for a job in any profession in tough economic times. It's entertainingly written but her advice to swallow your pride and knock on doors is exactly what any jobseeker needs to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treat it as a checklist","review":"So, the economy sucks right now and there are way too many lawyers in this country. So this isn't the time to be making stupid mistakes in cover letters, resumes, and interviews. I have been looking for a job for several months now, although not aggressively. After reading this book I realized how many mistakes I made while looking for a job in my first year of law school. I know I could have done better if I had read this book at least two years ago. I now treat it basically as a checklist of the most important things to do during a job search. I refer to it often, such as the night before an interview, so as to refresh myself on how to prepare."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"I thought this book was excellent. The advice Walton gives in the book is practical and largely common sense. Yet, many job seekers forget to do it. And, although this book focuses on the legal profession, most of the advice can be applied to any professional looking for their dream job. I am not yet looking for the legal job of my dreams (I begin law school this fall), but I will keep much of the advice in mind as I go through school. And one day, thanks to my efforts and some tips from Kimm Walton, I will have the legal job (or at least a job) of my dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor interviewing advice. Read \\"Nail Your Law Job Interview\\" instead.","review":"This book is terribly outdated and offers very little advice on lawyer interviews. It seems to be written by someone who just sat down and wrote what they THOUGHT the hiring process should be. Its advice (for example, to sell yourself like an \\"infomercial\\") is simply silly. If you have landed a few interviews, you can't risk losing your shot by following poor interviewing advice. If you don't want to waste your time and money, I strongly recommend reading \\"Nail Your Law Job Interview\\" book instead - it is written specifically for lawyers (from students to senior lawyers), on how to succeed in legal interviews. It is much more thorough and offers a more accurate perspective on the interviewing process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music","review":"This CD is absolutely beautiful beyond my expectations.

Chesney gets back to his country roots here, and with songs like, \\"Like Me\\" who wouldn't like this album? The country world will adore this album as his best. Kenny Chesney's vocals are sweet and they are strong. Those who enjoy Kenny Chesney's \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\" , Tim McGraw's \\"Live Like You Were Dying\\", Corinna Fugate's \\"Home to Me\\" and Miss Miranda Lambert's \\"Kerosene\\" will find this disk to be a classic country album through and through."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEDIOCRE EFFORT","review":"The latest Chesney album, The Road and the Radio is decent. Just decent. Average. Nothing too spectacular. Another word I would use is mediocre. This album is not what should be considered a country album. It has more of a rock type feel to it. Kind of like John Mellencamp meets Jimmy Buffet. After his previous albums with the exception of Be as You Are, I expected a little bit more from Kenny on this album. His other albums had at least a country feel to them. Not so for this one. The top songs are the title track, 'Who You'd Be Today', 'In a Small Town', 'Beer in Mexico' 'Tequila Loves Me' and 'Freedom'. Overall, this one is not up to snuff with \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\" or \\"No Shoes No Shirt No Problems\\" but if this is the first Kenny Chesney album you buy, you shouldn't be that disappointed. A word of advice though to Chesney from his more hard core country base is to make the next album a little more on the country side like some of his previous efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kenny Review","review":"A must have in a collection for any true Kenny Chesney fan, this verion of The Road & The Radio were in limited prodcution & if you can obtain a copy you WONT regret the addition to your Library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Between Buffett and Mellencamp","review":"I came to Kenny Chesney through his Be As You Are album of Jimmy Buffett-like songs (in subject matter anyway) that he wrote while on his boat in the Caribbean. I'm a huge Buffett fan and loved that album which came out in January of 2005. This album is the follow-up that came out in November of the same year. It still has plenty of \\"fun in the sun\\" subject matter with songs like Summertime, Beer In Mexico, and Tequila Loves Me (another song about Mexico), but if anything, this album has everything that the \\"rock music\\", and I use that term losely, of today is missing: great song writting, great playing, rocking guitar solos, and SOUL. I call it a mix of Jimmy Buffett and John Mellencamp. Yes, Kenny Chesney is supposed to be Country, but this albulm is as much Rock, in classic Southern style, as it Country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Kenny","review":"I was disappointed in this CD. The songs all sound the same. I'm a huge Kenny fan and own all of his other CD's--this is not like the Kenny Chesney I listen to almost every day.

What an artist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Country at all","review":"Kenny Chensey is a Pop Tart with a Cowboy hat.He needs to listen to George Strait to find out what real country is.Chesney does not rely on steel guitars and fiddles but rather rock guitars and drums.Hip Hop overtook pop radio so pop rock artist like Chesney, Keith Urban and Sugarland had to go somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical","review":"Typical of what is wrong with today's Nashville country.

That was a year ago. It still works fine.I wish the camera worked, especially in dim light. And I wish the battery life was closer to the Philips phones sold in Asia (a month standby time and 8+ hours talk time).

It had intermittant lock ups, and made beeping noises on it's own. 3 days ago, it locked up and is still not working. I had to buy a new phone. Motorola nor T-Mobile would replace it.

He has not,in this book, made the subject interesting. That's unfortunate. He comments on the latest findings and opinions regarding human origins and takes his own position. However, I find his juxtaposition of the limbic system and the higher cortical functions to be just another 'id vs ego'. Not very illuminating.

It's always been a touch cranky but well worth the trouble. This is no longer the case with version 7.0 (and the upgrade to 7.0.0.33 seems to have made things worse). Cursor position is unstable, that is you probably aren't entering text where you think you are. Randomly, selected text refuses to unselect. Parentheticals won't allow you to move the cursor to the next block of dialog. Smart type \\"forgets\\" character names and locations, et cetera.

Very intuitive and straight forward. If you are serious about writing scripts, give into the industry standard and get Final Draft.

It has the best layout of any of the major script softwares on the market (I've tried 5 top ones). Having said that, I always found it somewhat buggy, but I put up with it for the sake of the layout. But version 7 is just a disgrace. I would much rather they focused on getting the bugs out than adding more useless features I'll never use. It is now just bloatware, and extremely buggy. I'm boycotting FD until they get the COUNTLESS bugs out (spellcheking that won't \\"take\\" after my correction are a particular bugaboo). I guess the FD people find themselves in a bind - they need to generate sales, but unfortunately have no idea how to improve the software - guess what: most of us just need the basics, so unless you really deliver something useful, it is easy to ignore the \\"new versions\\". My advice to them: start with taking the COUNTLESS bugs out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quintessential Writing Tool...","review":"As a screenwriter I find this tool absolutely essential in order to appear professional. The \\"Tip of the Day\\" is a great opener to the program. Everything is made easy in terms of formatting and it's easy to just open up and start using. There's lots of great little tools like being able to see your script with index cards and being able to make notes. Everything's at your fingertips like creating a pdf and registering the script with the WGA and it's pretty much the standard in Hollywood. What more can you ask for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth A Dollar","review":"I have been using Final Draft since version 4. After endless crashes of version 6 on my Mac, I finally upgraded to version 7. Although I haven't had the classic v.6 total wipeout crash (where you can't even open the last saved version of your file or it opens blank), today I had a nice surprise where the scene numbering dropped down into the action. Not wanting to do a scene re-number I was forced to go to an earlier auto save version. AUTO SAVE OFTEN!I was too slow to return this version or I'd me on Movie Magic already. No updates that mean anything the entire time I've used FD, and with 7 they screwed up the Navigator, a feature I actually liked! I won't even get into the hopeless lack of keyboard shortcuts and cheesy incomplete porting to Mac.Don't waste your money! FD6 is out there for \\"evaluation,\\" and you won't need activation."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"let the buyer beware...\\"","review":"I just bought the upgrade on March 31st and was very disappointed. Perhaps the worst thing about it is the fact that using the \\"go to\\" feature to jump from one page to another causes the application to \\"unexpectedly quit\\". This happens EVERY time I do so, which makes the act of writing a screenplay on it totally impossible for users of mac OS X. Hopefully there will be an update coming down the pike soon, but how long it will take is anybody's guess. I'm back to using Final Draft 6. So a word of warning before jumping in too soon (like me), wait until the update before you purchase if you're a mac user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aren't Newer Versions Supposed To Be Better?","review":"I've been using Final Draft for a number of years now, back to version 4.X, and always liked it. Version 6 has been a real winner, with a few annoying quirks. When given an opportunity to upgrade to version 7, I thought, \\"Great, I'll do it.\\" I'm sorry I did. FD7 may turn out to be a good update to a good program, but as it is now it shouldn't have been released. Just a couple examples -- when I switch to the index card view, I get a screen full of blank index cards, even though I'm many pages into my script. What gives? It's much less convenient to access Scene Navigator and Index Cards in FD7, and as another reviewer wrote, the Go To function doesn't work properly. What a disappointment. So now I'm back to using FD6, which is so much better. I'll be on the lookout for updates that might make FD7 at least usable, but until then I'll stick with FD6. You should do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Program","review":"Read the negative feedback on this site, so I attempted to use Word (again) for all of my script formatting. It looked horrible, so I decided to give FD7 a try, regardless of the reviews. Typed the entire script, made revisions, tracked changes, made more revisions...The program worked great, and the script looks better than anything I would have had the patience to create in Word.Maybe they have fixed all of the initial problems (that I read about on this site), but I think it is an excellent program. I recommend it to anyone, who, like me, likes to write and hates worrying about where he/she has placed the \\"more\\" and \\"continued\\" on the page, or how the margin on my dialogue centers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just add words?","review":"I have to work every day with FD 7 (Mac OSX) as the production company I write for asked me to do so.

After reading a number of scripts, I was very concerned that I would have to go through all kinds of hoops to keep the formatting and pagination. In fact, I put off starting a script because I was so worried about it. My friends recommended Final Draft. As soon as I sat down and installed it, I realized I had nothing to worry about. I was able to start expressing my ideas quickly and easily. Now all I have to do is finish a script and sell it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FD7: use at your own risk","review":"There seems to be a growing trend to release unfinished software, and then issue endless patches to fix it post-purchase: thats the situation with Final Draft 7.If you buy this product you MUST download repair patches for it at once, it is not safely usable out of the box. There have been three (or more) patches already, there may be more due.I noticed within 10 mins the select and paste function was dodgy. What I didn't expect was the unforgivable sin: losing work because of a program crash.That's when I went online and discovered similar tales of woe.Get it together guys.I'm going back to using FD6 (I've been using FD since version 3, on floppy disk) until I hear its safe. Maybe the new patches finally fix the program - but I'm not going to use my work to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird (on a PC anyway)","review":"I have a friend who uses the Mac version and swears by it. I purchased the PC version and it's certainly interesting. It behaves like no other text editor I've ever seen. Simple operations like cut and paste become strange exasperating games to see what text Final Draft will actually decide to let you cut and paste. I guess it's trying to keep script elements contiguous--but there are times when you just...want...to move...the damn...WORDS. Final Draft makes the mistake of assuming too much.Edit: I hereby redact the rest of my review. I still think the program could use some polish on a PC...but my previous ire was more from ignorance than the program itself. It ain't so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clunky but fine","review":"After all of the hoopla and disgruntlement I'd read, I find Final Draft 7 just fine and dandy--albeit sometimes clunky.

Of course, placing it is another matter, but that's not Final Draft's problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HORRID PIECE OF SOFTWARE!","review":"I've worked as a professional writer in Hollywood for a decade and Final Draft is the worst screenwriting program I've ever encountered. It's buggy, non-intuitive, clunky, slow, and supremely frustrating to use. I actively discourage writers I work with and hire from using it. How this became the \\"industry standard\\" is beyond me. Final Draft will kick-out a professional-looking script, but as far as actual \\"writing\\" Final Draft gets in the way of the process. If you like having to battle a program that's always trying to second guess you - then you may love it. But I certainly don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"this product is total garbage","review":"Final Draft is a totally inept program. Never has a product failed so completely. I have been a professional writer for eight years; I would rather use charcoal pencils and toilet paper to write my next screenplay. The mere fact that this sad joke of a product can be packaged and marketed is testament to the fact that there are so few competing screenwriting software programs out there and so they enjoy somewhat of a monopoly. I've just switched to Movie Magic and I'll report on that software shortly. If you're a self hater and like to waste countless hours trying in vain to retrieve lost writing, like a program that is counter intuitive and has none of the requisite functions that would even qualify it as a screenwriting program then this super turd is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soild program with good customer service","review":"Final Draft is the industry standard and I have bought the last three versions of the product and put them to good use. However, they have all had their quirks and bugs. On the most recent verison a prepackaged template simply crashed the program everytime it was used.That said, while trying to fix this problem, their customer service department has gone above and beyond the call of duty. Even though we still haven't been able to totally solve the problem, they have been great. This program is a big help, just remember to save often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac users beware","review":"I noticed \\"Designed for Windows\\" printed on the box as I was opening it. Wish I would have seen this on the product page before buying it. You open the program on a Mac and it looks like you're using a PC. No keyboard shortcuts for things like adding a scene index card, so you have to keep going up and using the pull-down menu. When I tried to rearrange my scene cards, the card to be shuffled turned into a blank card, for some reason. Maybe if I hadn't spent $170 bucks for this, it wouldn't have been so bad. Mac users, I advise you to steer clear of this and try Montage or Movie Magic Screenwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Word on Final Draft 7","review":"Final Draft 7 is a wonderful scriptwriting program for the aspiring and professional scriptwriter. Having used a previous version of the program, Version 7 has a variety of useful features that make writing scripts much less tedious. These features include: easily accessible television, film and stageplay script templates; the ability to have your computer read your script back to you in different character voices; and a one-click Writer's Guild of America online registry service. This is the scriptwriting program I've dreamed about, and I'm confident that I made the best possible purchase to further my writing career."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace","review":"As a now professional writer, Final Draft 4, 5 and 6 got me through the early screenplays, I have grown very fond of the program - my major \\"work tool\\".Final Draft 7 is a disgrace. Not only will you be wasting your money on an unusable product, you will spend hours of your time downloading and installing updates that fail, trying to optimise and \\"learn\\" a program that will let you down. I am actually amazed that a program that is so close to Version 6 (really, the only addition is the split screen thing...)is so far from that version in terms of stablity. What is up with this?We are talking about a program that is a BASIC word processor tailored to screen and stage writing - this isn't a complex 3d game!My strong advice is that if you feel you have to start with Final Draft, then purchace Version 6. (Still avalible - how many companies would keep an outdated version of their software on that market?) Otherwise look at the competitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another writer back to using V6","review":"The people at Final Draft really should have worked out all the bugs in Version 7.0 before releasing it to the public. I've used Final Draft for years and this new version is the first that has actually crashed my computer just trying to use it. Go To has problems, as does Index Cards, and even Spell Check doesn't perform properly for me. It doesn't even fix the spelling of the word after I've approved the change. Like the other writers here, I have returned to Version 6 until Final Draft gets the bugs out of this new version. So far, a complete waste of time and money. In this case, newer does not mean better. Stick with V6 if you want to get any work done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This program sucks","review":"I'm a professional screenwriter who started on FD back in the day and then converted to Movie Magic. I'm having to use FD 7 on a project I'm collaborating on and it's crashed 5 times now. I hate the interface, it's glitchy, and it doesn't have cool MM features. I do like the format when you print, but man, it ain't worth it. Wish I'd talked my partner into going w/ Movie Magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was disjointed with the story jumping years at a time. The plot was a little obvious and I'm used to more suspense and romance in NR books.

It was just disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Thoughts","review":"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan. I buy all of her books the second they hit the shelves but I don't think I will be doing that anymore. The book makes me have second thoughts about Nora being an \\"automatic\\" buy anymore. The book is mostly a prologue with only a few chapters in the here and now. The writing starts off pure Nora but by the end of the second chapter her J.D. Robb persona is front and center. If I want a violent book or a violent sexual book, I'll buy one. This books dark theme and poor interaction betweent the main characters was a huge dissapointment. From now on, I'll wait to read the review and for the paperback edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I have all of NR books. This is one of the few that I have not been able to read. I have carried the hard cover book since it was first published, from MA, to California now to New Hampshire.

I have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there.I move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and Blue Smoke is going into storage.

A JD Robb I believe.I was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Graphic-Too Long to get somewhere","review":"This book was so different from the usual NR story.

I was so happy to see this one ! BUT, it is so dark in spirit, so much that is sinister going on, I could not take it longer than about 1/4 thru. In thumbing thru the rest, it looked like the same throughout the book. I know life is not perfect, I know Nora occasionally does this type story, but I do not like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"While the story is interesting, the hero and heroine don't meet until page 200. Also, the heroine is rather oblivious to the threat that has hung over her since age 11. A book of 400 pages with half of it the backstory, in order to get to the action, ugh! Hope her next offering is better. Even setting it in Baltimore didn't make thai a standout for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the suspense","review":"I guess that being a Nora Roberts fan for a long time has its problems. I was thrilled when I found out that \\"Blue Smoke\\"was coming out. However, after reading it I felt in awe at the predictability of the plot and the character development. After the first 30 pages I already knew how everything was going to end, who the murderer was and why. I continued reading in hopes that there would be a twist in it but there wasn't. I was expecting something on the lines of \\"The Reef\\", \\"Homeport\\", \\"Birthright\\", and my favorite \\"Northern Lights\\", which I had just finished reading for the third time before jumping into \\"Blue Smoke\\". I have a nagging feeling that this novel has been cut down considerably for publishing purposes. It is just odd when compared with the rest of her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this one. There are better ones out there.","review":"I suppose I can't expect Roberts to blow me away with every book that she writes, especially since she is so prolific but I found this book to be such a let down that I was stunned. I have read many, many Nora Roberts books and I love her In Death series when she writes as JD Robb, but Blue Smoke just didn't work. The characters just weren't that developed or even likable and with the added cruelty and violence thrown in it just wasn't an enjoyable read. If you want to try a Nora Roberts book DO NOT BUY BLUE SMOKE. There are better ones out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed this book","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It put all of my favorites into one book: suspsense, mystery, romance, strong willed/strong minded heroine. I also had the joy of growing up in a close knit Italian family, so I could relate to that as well. This is one of those Nora Roberts books that after you get through the first chapter or 2 and are hooked, you have no personal life until you are finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT Buy This BOOK-RAPE and SODOMY","review":"I am a huge fan of Nora Roberts and have read every single book that she has written. That is why I was so disturbed to read her lattest novel \\"Blue Smoke\\". It started out very different from her other novels and took me awaile to get into the novel. About half way through the novel things just went south and then got worse. For some reason Ms. Roberts thought it would add to the story to graphically describe a sean with rape and sodomy. Then the women is burned alive. It is just terrible and very disturbing. I actually threw the book away. DO not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Smoke","review":"I am usually sleepless in anticipation of the latest NR release, but I have to say, I wasted my nights waiting for this one. I would've enjoyed the story much more if it just dealt with a fire bug and his motivation without going into the gorey, gorey details. I wasn't sure I could finish it and had to keep putting it down for days before I could continue. If I want to be aware of senseless acts of violence, all I have to do is turn on the evening news. I read to escape hearing about all the awful things people do to each other. I don't want to have to pay for the privilege. To say I was disappointed, doesn't even come close.Shame on you, Nora! Bring back good, ol contemporary romance. I know you can do it.DA Texas"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Way Too Long","review":"This could've been a good book but it was way too long and the whole love at first sight thing bothered me.

I couldn't figure out what all the fuss was, it read like most of her other books. Toward the end, I finally reached the graphic 2 1/2 pages. I just skipped them. The book was as thrilling without the descriptive element of murder. It could have been omitted and the outcome and romance would have been as satisfying and interesting without the gory details. I will continue to read NR, but if you too do not enjoy graphic details, don't read Divine Evil! Those are some images I can't get out of my head!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for romance, keep looking.","review":"This is not a romance. If you're wanting to read general fiction with suspense, then you'll likely be happy. The villian is more the main character than either the hero or heroine and there's no real \\"romance\\" going on here - a couple sex scenes, but no romance. I couldn't get over all the disgusting things the villain did near the end of the book (not to mention the beginning of the book and all through the book) because there really was nothing in there to counter-balance it . Definitely not my kind of read and I'll be thinking twice before purchasing any more of her written-for-hardcover books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we say \\"not a real romance\\"?","review":"A Nora Roberts book was the first romance novel I ever read and to this day she is still my favorite author. Now, that said, Blue Smoke did not impress me.I didn't like the excess violence or the fact that she goes into full detail with past boyfriends. There isnt even much of a romance to the book.If you are looking for a suspense then this is for you. If you are a Nora Roberts fan looking for a romance, dont look for it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"another disappointed reader","review":"Ms. Roberts is, in my opinion, one of the best at writing romantic or romantic suspence novels with well-written characterizations, warmth and wit and that's why I love reading her books and own many. I don't think she does as well with the degree of violence she attempts in this book or the handling of a sociopath on the loose, nor did I enjoy reading it. This is one book I do not plan to own or read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it much","review":"I agree with the other reviews about how slow the book was, how secondary the romance felt, and how annoying it was to know pretty much from page 1 who the bad guy was and then watch Reena take forever to figure it out. I read suspense thrillers pretty often and I'm not usually bothered by them. But there was one scene in this book that left me really shaken. It went on way, way, way, way too long and in too much detail. It was totally unnecessary, added nothing to the plot. And unfortunately that is what I will probably remember most about this book. :/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Very good COP","review":"The book had a good story line with good characters. A nice loud loving Italian family. The problem I had with this novel was huge neon arrows would have pointed to the suspect much earlier in the book. It was a shame to make the cops look so stupid, especially the main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a long-time NR's fan, and I was very disappointed by this book. The \\"mystery\\" was a complete no-brainer, the main character is fairly fleshed out but does a few stupid things that left me shaking my head, the villain is sadistic and thoroughly unlikable so you can't even have fun rooting for him. The procedural aspects on fire investigation are somewhat interesting, and the protagonist's family members can be entertaining (if somewhat stereotypically \\"Italian\\"), but on the whole I found this book predictable and unpleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it.","review":"One chapter was all I could finish.

Why, oh, why? Obvious plot, dimwitted \\"heroine\\" who doesn't seem to cotton on to the fact that her boyfriends tend to burn up, plastic Italian family love-fest . . . the story goes nowhere. Glad I checked it out of the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crime story - romance","review":"Crime mystery / romance by the diva of this genre. Renna is from a close knit Italian-American family who own a pizzaria in a Baltimore neighborhood. Due to an arson fire at the restaurant when Renna was a child, she focuses her energy on studying to become an arson investigator. Through the years, there are other mysterious fires and the unsolved death of Renna's first love.Bo is a carpenter who had seen Renna several years before at a college party and considered her his \\"dream girl\\". Try as he may, he could never connect with her until many years later. The romance between Renna and Bo takes place during the increasingly blatant and more personal arson fires plaguing Renna.This is a pretty good and quick read that I enjoyed until the ending. After a fair amount of tension, the ending was a little rushed. The romance is a little predictable, but I would still have liked to see more of Renna and Bo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smokin'","review":"The loving Italian family, smart and capable protagonist Reena Hale, compassionate and good-looking boyfriend, and sex \\"off the charts\\" in Blue Smoke will satisfy loyal Roberts fans. However, if readers are looking for the afternoon delight kind story sometimes associated with Roberts, this book is not for you. Blue Smoke is harsh. Sadistic rape, murder, and a truly evil sociopathic character may put unsuspecting readers right off. But after reading Blue Smoke, I have even more respect for Ms. Roberts as she shows her ability to work in yet another genre. Except for some minor logistical problems associated with a handgun during the story's denouement, Blue Smoke works. It shows that talented writer Nora Roberts can play with the big girls of this genre (Reichs, Gerristen, Slaughter, early Cornwell, et al). I hope Ms. Roberts keeps Reena Hale on hand for a few more adventures. Good job, NR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disbelief really hard to suspend!","review":"Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book. Believe me, it is not one of her best.I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long. It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable. How many boyfriends of one person can be killed? The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarey but fascinating","review":"One of the best books she's written! Well developed characters you come to care about & great mystery to solve."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll give her another chance, but only one more","review":"I wasthinking I'd really found an author I would be very happy with. But as the book progressed and the language got worse, and the dialogue became 50's B movie stuff and worst of all the graphic human torture made me sick to my stomach I knew I'd picked up the wrong book. I don't like graphic sex scenes, never have so I just skim over them.I'm going to try another Roberts book because so many people adore her writing. But I'm going to read something else first so I can get this terrible book out of my head.If most her books have as wonderful characters as she set up as parents and friends in this book I could become a Roberts fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOKKAAYY...","review":"Nora, Nora, Nora, what have you done!! I used to love reading your books, now I am scared to pick them up. If I wanted graphic detail I'd pick up a JD Robb book. Please keep the graphic, mystery to JD and keep the fun, light, romantic stories to Nora.If you like NORMAL NR books, do NOT read this one. If you are offended by graphic details of murder and other violent crimes, do NOT read this book. I was very disturbed after finishing this book. Plus you get 300 gabillion pages of build up for a 2 page boom...then...well that's the end of the book. All in all, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Smoke","review":"An avid Nora Roberts fan and devoted to J.D. Robb also, I have never been so appalled and repeled by any book! I am totally shocked that NR wrote this book!! I had to keep skipping so many passages that were nauseating with the graphic detailed acts of psyco-sadism and brutality that I (1) quit reading the book and (2) thanked God I had borrowed it from the library instead of my usual purchase of a NR book!! I had to give this book 1 star to post the review but I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy! Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Not what I expected from Nora Roberts. The detailed torture scene of one character, including being burned alive, while concious, was nauseating. I was looking for a light, enjoyable read and I wish I had never picked up the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The plot was not suspenseful; the entire story was laid out in first few chapters and nothing compelling followed -- not a single twist. Reader is just waiting for Reena to notice the too-blatant connections. Even the romance was ho-hum."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can get past the contradiction...","review":"This book is about a very observant and perceptive child (Reena) who has a \\"memory like a tape recorder\\" for details and observation. She grows into an equally super-sharp adult with a passionate mission. Yet, though its blantantly obvious from the start of the book who the villain is, \\"sharp-as-a-tack\\" Reena never makes the connection. If you can get past this huge flaw, its not a bad story. The reason I gave this book any stars at all is because the other characters were real and endearing and the author captures the flavor of Baltimore's Little Italy beautifully. This book could have been great - I feel Nora dropped the ball on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping story","review":"Unlike some other reviewers, I found this book to be pretty good. Perhaps those reviewers did not read the synopsis on the back before buying it? Well, I did, so I knew it was a romantic thriller when I picked it up. The author does a good job of making her characters very real, believable and sympathetic. I wanted them to succeed, to get together and to figure out what was going on. Additionally, the side characters were very believable and interesting. I did not find the violence to be excessively graphic. I am happy to see Nora Roberts branching out into different genres, rather than just pumping out the same old thing over and over, as some fans seem to desire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Smoke","review":"I have all of Nora Roberts books and this is by far the worst of her books that I have read. It's more of a JD Robb book rather than a Nora Roberts book. We knew the bad guy from the first part of the story. There was no suspense, and the description was graphic. This is a very disappointing read for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written and researched","review":"First off, if you have a complaint about a trend in books, write the publisher. Green and the loss of it always gets their attention. Now, for the book. I thought it was well researched and written. Not gory at all. You see worse than that on CSI. This is reality. There are people out there like this. It is a mind of a killer and that's not pretty. If you believed it, it made you feel something,horror, sadness or happiness when she brought you into their world, she did her job, she must have with all the negative comments. Believe me, there are much more graphic books out there not so well written.Although I like her Irish trilogy best, with Carnel Innocence second, this one was good and suspense is a good genre for her. I'm sure it's tough getting the right balance between serious, family and romance, but she does it justice.I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who can't take the reality of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty","review":"Unnecessary gross disgusting violence, I could not bring myself to read all of it. I usually love Nora Roberts's books, but I threw this one away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought it was good!!","review":"I was hesitant to read this book after reading the review by the customer who said it was very violent and graphic. I completely disagree. I read this book and enjoyed it. The last couple of chapters may have been alittle graphic, but due to story nature, but I believe it was neccessary. I do not like scary or violent books and did not find this book to be at all disturbing. I enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have my money back please?","review":"This story earns 2 stars only because of that part that still belongs to the Nora Roberts I have always enjoyed - a warm romantic relationship with appealing secondary characters. Sadly what remains stuck in my head are the repeated graphic and gratuitous violence that is *not* what I bought NR for! In my view there was no reason for the detail; the pyro's character had already been effectively brought to life for me long before. Shame on you, Ms R, for disappointing so many fans. I don't buy your books for that sort of experience.A secondary criticism (though I can appreciate an author trying out new techniques) is the long stretch before we get to have Beau and Reina meet. What causes so many NR stories to sparkle is the interaction between the main characters, and in this case the story was treading water for a very long time before it got really interesting.As another reviewer has stated, this is a NR book that I will never read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Novel Not So Hot","review":"With apologies to Nora Roberts, normally one of my favorite authors, this was not a great book by any means. Long, over-written and pedantic, I just couldn't enjoy it. I kept waiting for the book to get started, move along, or just get out of the way. Please don't judge the author by this book. Pick another one and just pretend this one didn't ever go to press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so violent?","review":"I usually love Nora Roberts and wait impatiently for her new arrivals but this books was a major disappointment. It is strangely violent - violence that seems unnecessary to the plot and takes the reader too much away from the story. I truthfully don't have a problem with murder, mayhem, etc. but it has to fit the tone of the book and this story tries to be two different things - a shocking, slasher style book and a warm, once-in-a-lifetime romance that don't fit well together...at all. I got the book from the library and am glad that I did not pay for it. I do not recommend this book to Nora Roberts fans - it may be more for her J.D. Robb following."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong \\"author\\"","review":"Like other reviewers of this title, I try to read all of Nora Robert's books, including the J.D. Robb series. I have certain expectations for books written under the very different styles of each of these \\"authors\\" and this book was too much of one and not enough of the other. The graphic detail and disturbing window into the evil mind of the villain is expected from \\"J.D.\\"; warm families, sexy romance, gentle humor, and strong secondary characters---trademarks of \\"Nora's\\" books---are welcomed as comfortable contrasts to the horrifying suspense of Eve Dallas's future world. I enjoy both styles, but I am more prepared for the lingering darkness created by exposure to the evil mind of a socio-path if I know that's I'm getting. It was hard to finish the book, and after reading the graphically violent scenarios crammed into the last 20-30 pages, I am almost sorry I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with some of the other reviewers","review":"I'm a Roberts fan, I've read/and own almost all of her books.

NOt one of her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violence, sadism, torture do not a mystery make (or a romance)","review":"I said this about an earlier Roberts book and I say it about this one: I wish it had come with a warning label. I really don't want to delve into the minds of serial arsonists/killers. I don't want to know that a person being burnt alive smells like a pig roasting (happens more than once). AND i don't want SIX pages of rape and sodomy along with cutting and \\"tinny, high pitched shrieks.\\" Other parts of the book are lovely and funny (though the first chapters of the heroine as a little girl were very slooooow and way overwritten- hmmm, Nora Roberts as Stephen King in more ways than one).

Do better research!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops my bad","review":"Really thought this was going to be enjoyable since I have read previous titles by this author and loved them. I just didn't get this one. It seemed to me as though the main character might be just about as deranged as the killer and I just didn't get that happy feeling of wanting to root for the success of anyone in this book. I almost think in some way I liked the killer better than the hero and heroine because at least that character was designed to make the reader feel revolted and actually completed the mission. I didn't absolutely hate it, but I found it kind of long winded and disappointing. Not the best Nora Roberts out there.

Plus the always wonderful Clifton Webb reprising his arrogant plutocrat American tycoon role which no one (other than Edward Arnold) does better. Here he is, decked out in yachting attire and all, sailing the Med in his steam yacht in search of ancient treasures. It's a battle of wits between his cunning and money and Ladd and Loren's honesty and innocence. You can guess who wins in the end but its fun anyway.

Marriot v Stewert, there were two Moody Blues, pre and post Laine.For me, Go Now remains one of the most enduring songs from the 1960s. The rest of the songs more or less can be found on any eary Stone,Beatles, Kinks,Who, Rolling Stones album.I would have loved to see the early Moody Blues evolve as the above mentioned bands did. But it did'nt happen.The second Moody Blues were the pot smoking LSD type songs Nights in White Satin, Timothy Leary's Dead. Brilliant? Personally I could tell them where they could ride their seewaw!Unless you are a big fan of early English R&B; or this is the only way to get your hands on Go Now, I would pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"a different Moody Blues","review":"This is the first music from The Moody Blues, and although the more known version of the Moody Blues with Justin Heyward & Co were big, when you listen to this CD you'd have hoped they had more material with this lineup. Denny Laine, the original Moody's lead singer lead this early phase of the Moody's, and it's no wonder Paul McCartney grabbed him later when he formed his post Beatles band, Wings. Denny had 10 great years with Paul & Wings, and this set is filled with great songs, and a great sound that was the mid 60's. The classic, Go Now, andI'll Go Craazy set you off into a world of great songs that the early Moody's always had."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 for presentation, 3.5 for music","review":"I was very impressed with this collection as a complete package of Laine-era Moody Blues. All 26 of their recordings on one disc! That's a great selling point right there. I also really liked the informative liner notes by John Tracy--they are much better than his inane musings in the old Prelude, Blue Jays, Songwriter, and Night Flight CDs. His writing has improved dramatically.However, like most people, I feel the music here is mainly for diehard fans or British Invasion historians. There are several gems on here though, surrounded by a lot of par-for-the-course R&B.; \\"Go Now\\" was a deserved hit, but I'm really a big fan of \\"Boulevard de La Madeline.\\" To me it makes a nice bridge between Laine-Moodies and Days of Future Passed. A great, inventive, beautiful piece of sixties art-rock.Overall an excellent package, highly recommended for those interested in hearing early Moody Blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Encyclopedia","review":"This book has two major flaws:1. Far too many low-quality pictures are crammed into the pages2. The history is biased toward the success of the IH brand, and the story conveniently ends in 1980.

It was probably the most boring book that I have ever read. Every time I started to read it I would fall asleep. I tried to read a chapter each day, but I ended up reading a page or two then passing out. The book goes too far into specifics and numbers in certain areas of his life which takes away from the story. This made the book almost unbearable to read.

I would even fall asleep when reading it!!! I had to re-read sections multiple times because I couldn't even tell you what I was reading. It went in one ear and out the other.

I went into reading it with an open mind, and after the first chapter I wanted to pull my hair out it was so boring.First off, the book took place in a time period where I wasn't even born. My parents weren't even born yet. It has to do with a subject that I don't even know about.Second, the author dragged on and on about numbers and business partners and business investments. He was using words that were not in my vocabulary.Finally, the plot and main ideas of the book were so slow. They jumped around and I didn't know what business we were talking about, or which business partner was involved. They talked about money and finances."},{"rating":"2","title":"an enlightening, informative book of the man and his success","review":"I was given this book to read as a requirement of my United States History Class in college. I am 36 years old and had heard of Mr. Carnegie, ie; Carnegie Hall in New York, but knew nothing of the man or his greatness. This book is an easily read biography of Andrew Carnegie and his successes and failures, the latter being few. The book reads easily and quickly, yet covers a great deal of information and circumstances in Carnegies life; letting the reader know and understand Mr. Andrew Carnegie more. I am pleased this was an assigned book and a required reading. I have a much better understanding of the industrial revolution and of Mr. Carnegie. I think anyone needing information on the Industrial Revolution or Andrew Carnegie will find this book very helpful, interesting, easy to read and informative. I certainly did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Industrial revolution","review":"Funny how it turns out that we only read these books in school. I read this for my first year American History class.The book revolves around Carnegie and his rise to sucess during the late 19th century and early 20th century.In the wake of the industrial revolution many indivduals like Carnegie succeeded. We see this with the Rockefellers who were the worlds first billionaires and with Carnegie , who was the first billionaire of the 20th century.By the integration of horizontal and verticle industries we see how he has accomplished this. Again, the opportunity is here for us as the information age is still in it's infancy.It involves both aspects from a historical look at an american immigrant and the ideal \\"American Dream\\". The economic outlook is equally helpful studying how he valued verticle and horizontal integration of industries.steve@virtualpage.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Really enjoyed reading this book.

I found the Sun Witch to be well written, and the idea of the three sister witches under a family curse very intriguing and plan on reading the rest of the series to see how it plays out. My reason for giving this book only 2 stars is because I just could not like Sophie and Kane. I just did not believe them to be realistic characters and found her transformation from doubting-witch to all-powerful witch to be rushed and rather unbelieveable, and the love between Kane and Sophie to be much to superficial and unrealistic.

Fun to read and interesting characters. I read it in one day and could not put the book down, however my review would have been 5 stars if some answers or plots would have ended, such as Sophie meeting her father. I would have loved to read the meeting on that. And did Liane really hear a baby in Lever 13 and did nothing about it? If so this would make the character more evil than good. I did love the secondary characters' relationship, Liane and the emperor. It was very complicated and not your typical romance story. If you would call what they have romantic.

His lyrics are heartfelt and definitely get you thinkin. Sadly Reuben passed away before the album was even technically completed. The producer/dj is Nickels (who has moved on to the group Lojique) and his beats are insane. In some ways you could compare them to Outkast's beats on ATLiens, but still very unique, very good.

Spector does a good job within the pages of Delaware River, part of the River Journal series published by Frank Amato Publications. Spector begins with the river's history, then reveals a wealth of facts about the many fishing opportunities this watershed offers both in New York and Pennsylvania. The Delaware was once a smallmouth bass and walleye fishery, but the constructions of dams in the 1960s turned the river into a premiere coldwater wild trout fishery that is also one of the few rivers on the east coast to be navigated by drift boats, which are primarily western river water craft. Delaware River is chock full of vivid color photos, and Spector adds useful information about the river's shad fishery and insect hatches, too, making this a thorough introduction to this excellent, historic, fly fishing destination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As one who fishes the Delaware, I was hugely disappointed by this \\"book.\\" There is no new insight, the text is lame and rife with grammatical errors and the photos are horrible.

The direction is flabby with undue emphasis being placed upon silly and, naturally, superfluous stunts and car chases, with an inappropriate free hand being given to Gayle Hunnicut, playing the wife of Lucas and former lover of Lee, whose melodramatism proves distortive for what should be the critical scenes in this leaden affair, while the pudgy Englishman Reed, ill-advised to strip to the waist, has his lines dubbed in order to present an acceptable American accent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd take Halliday and Resnick anyday over Tipler","review":"I use Tipler in my intro physics classes and I can't stand this book. I am always resorting to Halliday and Resnick (Fundamentals of Physics) or Giancoli (Physics for Scientists and Engineers) for a better explanation. Tipler drags out the explantion. Whereas other books like H&R use 1/2 as many words to describe a physical concept. Tipler's book has a lack of GOOD examples to illustrate the principles of physics. I also think Tipler did a poor job integrating the photos and pictures into the text. Tipler's book also lacks application to the real world and seems to have less of an emphasis on problem-solving unlike H&R. All this book did for me was turn me off to the wonderful subject of physics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halliday and Resnick much better text","review":"For the good: The electricity/magnetism section is a fairly good and understandable.

To get the full affect, you have to give each of the cuts some attention, but the rewards are definitely there. Fripp moves you through his music effortlessly.

Six years later there was a \\"Songhai II,\\" and this album was recorded at the same time. It also includes Thompson and two other West African musicians. But Diabate is the star attraction here; he is the most renowned living master of the guitar/harp-like instrument known as the kora, and one sometimes can scarcely believe that there is not multi-tracking going on in the recording.

He's even gone so far as to say he hates it. I have NO idea why. It's great. Better than most of their post \\"Arenalize\\" music, IMO. You can hear on this album why Def Leppard were originally considered part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (along with Iron Maiden, Diamond Head, et al). You can also hear the melodic side too, which makes their transition to a \\"pop metal\\" band not all that surprising.

But only after it turns rabid and chases the heroine down and bites her companion.. yes, that's fun. Do dog lovers want to see the dog turn on the humans and then get shot? This DVD is simply a marketing ploy created by immoral people who only care about milking the public for a few more thousands to line their bank account. A law suit against GATAM media for false advertising would be welcome by me. The DVD menus are totally unclear as well. What do you expect from people who are soulless!

I know that I was leary because the date kept changing for the release and now it is happening again. Warner Brothers does not need to make a killing they just need to make a nice profit, which they would with a loyal fan base. Not buying Knot's Landing does not mean I will buy something else, and even if I do, it does not mean I will buy Warner Brothers.

Sure, you might be able to get away with not using live rock, but it won't be worth it in the long run. Also, I don't agree with the list of recommended filter combinations. One more thing, the book lists an air stone as essential equipment, but the only thing an air stone will do is aid evaporation and cause salt creep!

When the hose starts coming in slow, then it is time to recharge the battery. It does take quite a few hours to charge but it lasts a long time.

Initially I experienced the same impossible task of trying to unwind the hose.The problem was solved after charging the battery. I ran the reel empty of hose continuously for 30-40 minutes. This stretched and loosened the drive belt.I then recharged the battery, and the hose reel now works perfectly.I suggest not reeling the hose until you operate the reel for an extended time.Under the conditions I have given above, this power hose reel is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The easy way to wind up your garden hose","review":"This really is a great product. It truly is the \\"lazy\\" man's way to wind up your garden hose. It can handle hoses up to 150 feet in length. If I only had a little hose to wind up (say 25 or 50 feet), it really wouldn't be neccesary to have the powerwind hose reel, but for those of you who have at least a 100 ft. hose, it really is tough to wind up your hose with those hand cranks. With the powerwind hose reel, all you do is step on the lever, & it winds it up for you. I use my hose quite frequently, & it definately helps out my back from having to bend & crank.

While it is easy reel in the hose, it takes a tractor to pull it out. We had to pull so hard, it caused the hose to clamp on itself, and I had to open the top and pull the house out by hand.

Last month, the activation switch broke and, since it was out of warranty, I searched online for the switch and I found it $2.00. Only problem the minimum order was 100 for the little sucker. So, I bit the bullet, and ordered a new one for $83.94 (Cheaper than $200.00 for 100 switches). The new one arrived, big problem - it is very difficult to pull the hose out, I could barely do it, my wife could not. My original one was no problem. I took my new one apart to see what was up and discovered the Co. has \\"re-engineered\\" the product to save money. Original has metal bearings and fittings, the updated one is all plastic parts. I removed the switch from the new one and put it into my 4 year old model. (So a new switch ended up costing me $83.94, but at least it works!) Bottom line, do not buy this product, it is of very poor quality compared to the original design."},{"rating":"1","title":"chinzy","review":"The concept is probably pretty good but the construction is the chinzyest (my own word but you get the idea) I ever saw.

Took another hours to contact the company again, and they suggested that I return it to the store.Following their troubleshooting advice, I discovered that the design of the foot electrical-switch mounting and the motor axle bushing are prone to cause problems. And the handle for manual rewounding will be broken when someone (like the wife or kids) does not know to push down on the lock for the handle.

Slowly building passages in places bring up the Godspeed You Black Emperor comparisons, but this effort is less formulaic, with a greater mix of dynamics and melodic elements. The infrequent heavier moments feature a bit of growling - though the singer, whose clean voice is already very raspy, sounds a bit like he's in the throes of terminal agony. But the vocals are mixed down a bit, and their rough nature actually works with the fuzz/distortion of the guitars.Falling somewhere between instrumental post-rock and modern progressive, it's at times moody, at times almost trance-inducing, but rarely feels annoying or superficial like many works in those genres. \\"Altered Course\\" was a highlight, though none of the tracks deviate too greatly from the overall approach. A rewarding experience for those who will invest a bit of a listening effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Renaud CD","review":"I love this CD. I bring it along on every road trip I make.

I couldn't even finish it. While I acknowledge that singleness can be lonely and Christians could use some help thinking about it in a God-honoring way, this book is not helpful to that end. Yes, we should value marriage and not deliberately close ourselves off to that option, but to act as though whether we get married is OUR choice and the most important thing in life is to cut God out of the picture (otherwise known as idolatry). A good antidote to this attitude is Paige Benton's article: \\"Singled Out by God for Good\\" which can be found in several places online.

The collection also includes Pahud's Shubert disk and his Weber recordings, as well as Juliette Hurel playing French music for flute. It's a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic Title: Nothing Secret in the Talmud: Anyone Can Read It","review":"What a stupid title for a hatred filled book. There is nothing secretive about Judaism or the Talmud. Anyone can become a jew, anyone can learn all they want to learn about Judaism, and anyone can read the Talmud, just learn aramaic and hebrew just as you would need aramaic and greek to learn the Chrisitian Bible. Or read it in English translation. Where's the secret? Where's the \\"conspiracy\\" Get over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Semitic Garbage","review":"This is an Anti-Semitic piece of garbage. There is no truth to this trash at all. It is well documented that the early Catholic Church stared anti-semitism in its teachings and even published same in its books. This \\"book\\" just continues the anti-Semitic view the church has had for centuries. The author claims to be an authority on the subject, however in truth he knows nothing about Judaism or the Torah. This \\"book\\" is an anti-Semitic hate manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Antisemitic garbage","review":"Pranaitis was a Russian priest, universally unrespected within the church. He claimed to be learned in Talmud and kabbalah; his cross-examination at the Mendel Beilis blood libel trial in 1912, however, showed his ignorance of even the most basic Aramaic and Hebrew legal terms. This book is a translation of a Russian tractate containing falsified quotes from the Talmud \\"proving\\" that Jews have an violent anti-Christian agenda. Even if you are interested in the history of antisemitism, or Russian antisemitism in particular, this book is not worth your money. To see an accurate representation of Pranaitis's \\"knowledge,\\" consult the autobiography of Mendel Beilis or the transcript of his trial."},{"rating":"1","title":"I","review":"A previous reviewer says:\\"You are called men, but the Goyim [Gentiles] are not called men.\\" -Kerituth 6b; \\"The progeny of the Goyim is like an animal.\\" -Sanhedrin 74b Tosephoth; \\"All Gentile children are animals.\\" -Yebamoth 98aI presume that these alleged quotations are taken from the Pranaitis book. However, I went to the online Talmud site recommended by another pro-Pranaitis reviewer(...)and discovered that these alleged quotations do not exist. And, no, this is not some special \\"sanitized\\" Talmud. It's a Jewish web site, and most of the passages in question aren't even talking about Gentiles at all. The alleged quotations are pure fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"inaccurate","review":"The author is either ignorant of basic Aramaic translation or purposely inciting hate. Many of the terms he uses like \\"apostates\\" in the Talmud does not refer to Christians, as he contends. Also the Talmud uses the word \\"akum\\" which refers to idol worshipers. Christians are not included in this terminology."},{"rating":"1","title":"I. B. Pranaitis is a liar.

He was cross-examined on four terms. What is the trnslation of Hullin, Eiruvin and Yebamoth (all names of tractates) - he knew none of the them. When asked who was Baba Bathra, what did she do and when did she live? - even the jurors knew that the man was a sham."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Real Question","review":"The Talmud is not a \\"book\\" in the normal sense, that it can be just picked up and \\"read\\" like a novel or a history. Its language and vocabulary can be very technical and specialized; its meaning never clear on the surface. If you think you can understand what's going on on any particular page simply by reading it and taking it on its face value, you are wrong. Not that it is a secret code. Rather it is a complex and extremely sophisticated text that needs to be \\"learned\\", not merely \\"read.\\"That said, the real question isn't so much the truth value of this book (yes, many of the quotes are real; what the author implies they mean is highly misguided) as it is why has it been republished and why does Amazon feel the need to market and sell it, especially under the \\"Judaism\\" category rather than the \\"Anti-semitism\\" or \\"Prejudice\\" category?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most disturbing!","review":"Having read Israel Shahak's book, \\"Jewish History, Jewish Religion\\", \\"The Traditions of the Jews\\" by Johann Eisenmenger and now this, \\"The Talmud Unmasked\\", I am deeply saddened and disgusted.I was raised in a Christian family and community and was taught that the followers of the tenents of Judaism are our \\"elder brothers in the faith\\"...that their God and ours (the God of Abraham) is One and the same.This is not true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong from the first page","review":"I reviewed the first few pages of this book before I decided not to buy it. I was surprised that the book is in error beginning with the first paragraphs. The name of Jesus in Hebrew was Yehoshua, which is commonly transliterated as Joshua. First, there is no J in the Hebrew alphabet as the author contends. Second, the name was never unpopular being the name of a hero of the nation.If I can find such gross errors on the first page, how many more would I find in the entire text and how many less informed persons will believe this nonsense?"},{"rating":"1","title":"trash","review":"If no thought was put into the book, no thought goes into its review.Seriously, watching your $30 burn up in smoke is more entertaining than reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fruit of Un-crucified Flesh","review":"The Talmud, an intentially cryptic work in written form, is not for Christians, nor is it about them in any way. One can not understand Talmud via written form soley, as this is only half of the equation. Eager Christians willing to suck in and spew out poison with regard to Jews -- well, the poison resides with the viewer. Christians will not understand the Talmud as it is; they are intentionally kept \\"in the dark\\" as the hostile outsiders they are, and if they think they know something about the work, they are deeply mistaken. What Christian reviewers do with what they do see proves that point. They have no idea what they are really talking about. The only thing they are talking about is themselves, and what they bring with their percerptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Immature for Her Age","review":"Vampires Fon't Exist is a well written and composed story- for a thirteen year old. Anyone older should be put to shame for ever writing such immature rubbish. Don't get me wrong- the characters are enticing and the plot is well done, but the writing is lacking. If you like great characters and storylines but couldn't care less about literature, or regard for the English language, this book is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not enjoy","review":"I have to say that I did not enjoy this book at all. I had read the reviews for this book and had such good hopes for it and was so excited to finally read it and I believe it just did not deliver. I was truly disapointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Entrapment","review":"So much explicitly over the edge detail into the smallest things that really make the reading seem as if it's not reading. You yourself are brought into the story. Mind traps and dangerous yet mysterious obstacles take over your mind. You can go into the story believing you are righteous but all is questioned once you are actually on the pedalstal. Best story i've ever read. An entourage of so many diverse and vivid images that reflect on the realistic views of the world and how we see it. Your personal perspective may change before your eyes. Excellent story, will always from now on be on my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth twenty.","review":"I may be a little biased, but I originally read this work on Quizilla when I was fifteen, and I knew the language was bad then. This girl has good ideas and writes good porn, but her grasp on the English language is painful at best. I'd be willing to give her work another look after she took a few more English classes and got a decent editor. The only reason I looked the book up here was because of the sex scenes (which I remember being hot at the time that I read them), but I don't find the language in the excerpt worth slogging through. If you're looking for an amusing thrill, find it for under five bucks. If you can write better than she can, don't bother. You'll go mad with a highlighter and forget the story completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensitive yet Exciting Guitar Work","review":"I always look for artists who can express the blues in such a way that you never want them to stop playing. Double guitars that do not compete but build on each other and compliment each other is a rarity. But if you want two who do it the best---this CD is for you. Stevie and Albert are on the same wave length!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT RECORD!!!","review":"Vaughan does it again, and with the company of Albert King it's like magic. This is a MUST have album for blues lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin From Head to Toe","review":"If you LOVE Stevie Ray, then you'll love him even more on this CD with Albert King.

I must say that its nice to come home and have music waiting at your door, especially when the music is this damn good. The quality of the recording is excellent, and the \\"guitfiddle\\" playing is superb. \\"Ask Me No Qustions,\\"Blues At Sunrise\\", and \\"Overall Junction\\", are three songs that are just jamming. Hard to believe \\"Blues At Sunrise\\" is 15 minutes long. This recording is a must for any fan of Stevie Ray Vaughn, Albert King, and the blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars","review":"I've been known to find cooperative efforts between guitar masters to be less than fulfilling, likely due to the high expectations I have from seeing two such names on an album cover. This, however, is an exception. Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan, mentor and protege, play the Hell outta these blues! And there's little doubt that they're having a great time doing so, playing some classic blues selections, with the notable appearance of Vaughan's own \\"Pride and Joy\\" and King's \\"Blues at Sunrise.\\"All in all, it's a great, fun blues album, featuring two of the masters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldtime Bluesman Hosts Young Blues Guitar Prodigy","review":"If you are like most Stevie Ray Vaughan fans, you seek anything he ever recorded - which puts this item in the \\"must have\\" category for SRV fans. If you are not particularly a SRV fan, this album might not convert you as well as others. Stevie assumes a secondary position to Albert King here, complementing King's work without showing him up or overpowering him. I enjoyed the album greatly, but must admit to being a fan of both these artists, so I tried to temper my rating with the knowledge that better albums exist for the casual listener of either King or Vaughan.Stevie Ray recorded some of the best rockin' rhythm and blues of all time, along with his band Double Trouble. And Albert King is well known as a true blues master. So I urge you to not limit yourself to this one sample - although quite tasty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blues Guitar!","review":"This CD represents a single, wonderful blues recording of the collaboration of traditional bluesman Albert King and smoldering blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughn. The disc offers a nice variety of tempo and technique, and the guitar work is simply sublime, the musical equivalent of slow cookin' on a summer evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Rarely does an album get released where teacher and student aren't too shy to cut loose. I didn't have high expectations for this one but this release is clearly an an exception to the rule. AK and SRV are having a great time and while SRV is in awe of the master bluesman he doesn't take the back seat on this one because around Albert, that WOULD be disrespectful. AK and SRV go at it with great respect for each other and the music. The result is a firey session that is sure to satisfy every fan of these two artists. SRV is clearly the only guitar player to copy AK's licks perfectly and it is a real treat to hear them together. The CD is peppered with dialogue between to two and AK acknowledges SRV as the future of blues as if to pass the torch. But the music is the meat here and it is wonderful. Recording quality is very good and the disc is about 60 minutes in length. If you are an Albert King and/or an SRV fan this one will be on the top of your favorites list for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Two Worlds-Then and Now","review":"Two generations of blues masters come together in one dynamite CD...Austin's Stevie Ray and the Chicago Master, Albert King. Both left this life too quickly, King at 69 and Stevie Ray at 35 but their music will live on for future generations.

SRV's reverance for Albert is obvious. The production values are a little choppy, but always entertaining.

You get Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughn collaborating. Not hard to figure out where SRV got his groove. Seller was prompt with communications and shipping was almost overnight. Amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Snap Shot in Time!","review":"If you are a Blues connoisseur, I don't have to tell you the significance of this CD. It is truly a priceless snap shot in time when one of the old masters of Blues, Albert King get's down heavy (with the then rising star) the late great Stevie Ray Vaughn. Some down to earth, colorful and entertaining, \\"Blues Man\\" dialogue between the two is scattered throughout this otherwise scorching studio pieceTrack 3, Stevie's Pride and Joy, just smokes and is clearly my album favorite. I believe I've listened to this CD at least a hundred times already and should buy another copy just to lock up for posterity! This CD is well worth the slightly higher price, buy it, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blues or Blahs","review":"It didn't take off for me until the last two songs except for Pride and Joy.

King's tone, passion, and fleet-fingered style all wove their way into Stevie's approach to guitar, but \\"In Session\\" shows that there was much MUTUAL admiration between these two guitar heroes. King generously allows Stevie to take the majority of the solos, and one can picture him standing back in the studio, watching Stevie in awe. While this recording is neither man's best work, it's a vital document because it captures them together just JAMMING for fun. It's the blues equivalent of Jerry Garcia's and David Grisman's \\"Shady Grove\\" release -- conversations, missteps, bum notes, and a raw underproduced sound are just as entertaining and inspired as the searing guitar work and soulful vocals. A must for any fan. This might be my favorite posthumous Stevie release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment.","review":"A hilarious look at the normal and not so normal occurences of everyday life, from childhood to adult.Great reading for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"This memoir is charming and hilarious and brilliantly told.

Tarantula\\", it contains the title track (same as the album version) and six live songs from the tour with The Venus 3 as his backing band. Amazing sound quality and performances throughout, I'd love to hear a recording of a full set from this tour, as they didn't come to my town (Robyn did, however, come through on a solo tour shortly after this and it was spectacular!)Most surprising are a couple of Soft Boys tunes reworked here, \\"Queen Of Eyes\\" and \\"Give It To The Soft Boys\\", both awesome versions. If you dig Robyn Hitchcock and his oddball style of psych pop/rock don't hesitate on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to be a Fan","review":"This four pack of movies is definately for fans of Van Damme! The best movie of this set is Timecop, then Hard Target, followed by The Quest and Street Fighter. There are some great fight scenes in the Timecop and Hard Target, but if you've never seen Bloodsport (a must see), The Quest is very similar to that in a cheaper way. Street Fighter is one of thoose video game to movies, enough said!

I rarely watch tv so why did I want this but to be polite, I watched it, and watched it, and watched it! The colors were so vivid. The depth of clarity was amazing,and the huge variety of fish made me feel like I was snorkeling the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Some of the scenes made me energized because the was so much activity while others were so soothing and calming. The clown fish were so funny and the angel fish were so elegant and very regal looking. Then there were those slow starfish that moved across the screen without even seeing them move. The aquariums were so clean and the plants and fish seemed so happy and healthy. Did you see the yellow angel who was actually smiling? Five star kudos to the owners and the photographer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality","review":"This video is shot in horrible quality.

BUT WORSE.This came straight from Amazon, and judging from another comment, this is a manufacture problem. You can even see it by tilting the disc in the light on the underside.

It would cost me more money to send it back to them, and having to pay postage (again) to have it sent to me. So please don't waste your money on this product. Not only that, but the so called tanks it shows have very few fish in them, and the color isn't very vivid at all.

The scenes are colorful and a nice diversion to look at while I'm endlessly on hold at insurance companies. The water/bubble sounds are soothing in the background. The scenes authomatically replay so you don't have to keep hitting \\"play\\" when the scene is done.

Although I do not speak or understand any of the languages (and Toure can sing in 11 different tongues), the music itself establishes the emotional foundation that allows Toure's voice to evoke the listeners empathy. The album contains the hypnotic repeating figures of African folk music as well as seminal Delta blues.

Ry Cooder has assembled an excellent cast of musicians to back him, including the immortal Clarence \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown on violin. The songs are hauntingly beautiful, echoing the Blues, but indebted more to the pervasive Muslim inflence in West Africa. Toure is one of the grand masters of Malian music, which has an incredibly rich heritage. He is a purist at heart and this music reflects that approach, although it has been jazzed up to reach a broader audience. \\"Soukora\\" and \\"Ai Du\\" will leave you breathless.One only wishes that Toure had the chance to meet John Lee Hooker, since the two seem like soulmates. When he heard Hooker, Toure apparently was so stunned that he said Hooker belongs in Africa. It just goes to show you that the Blues is firmly embedded in the African tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous, happy, relaxed music.","review":"This will make you want to dance. Standouts for me:\\"Lasidan\\" - Gets in your head. It's possibly my favorite song on the album. Touré's voice resonates in the mind for days.\\"Banga\\" - Ali Farka Touré is incredible here on the njarka. The combination of this beautiful instrument, the congo, and the calabash is breathtaking.\\"Diaraby\\" - A fitting end.

It was so bad that at one point you clearly see Stephen Baldwin's leg floating in the water after being bitten off by (I assume) the shark, and in the next scene, he walks out of the hospital without a mark on him. Not only that but his expression never changed through the entire movie -- not once. Not when he got bitten, not when his wife was kidnapped, not when his father died -- throughout the entire thing he looked like a guy trying to wake up from an Ambien hangover who is also slightly constipated.I laughed through the whole thing. Definitely worth renting but next time every time something completely implausible happens, I'm taking a shot of Maker's Mark.

If only Vanessa Johansson had been eaten during the opening credits, the rest of this insipid tale might have been sufferable.

Dreams Fly Away consists of a mixture of previously released tracks (from her work with her former husband), live recordings, remixes (the remixes of the One Clear Moment tracks are an actual improvement. The annoying echo producer Hugh Murphy put on her vocals is much less noticable if not altogether gone) and demos.The notes and interviews are interesting and provide a unique perspective on Linda and her step out of the limelight. Her medical condition has obviously been overcome to some extent (her latest marvelous album is ironically titled Fashionably Late)but, for a while, this was the last word on Linda's music. While Linda may have been Richard's muse for a brief period and his voice for a number of their classics, she deserves recognition as an artist in her own right. This collection puts things right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"A pretty good assembly of bits and pieces from Linda's somewhat intermittent career.

Even on the rear cover, there is a photo of a punch executed from ma bu (horseriding stance) is shown - the problem being, ma bu is not part of xing yi.Even the stance shown on the front cover is somply wrong in my eyes since all the strength in the posture is directed backwards. (don't belieev it? try at home...) That is, however, a popular posture for demonstraions and modern wu shu dancing.The book lacks theory, or presents it in an incomplete way - for example of the five (six by some sources) words that describe the xing yi body, only four are mentioned in this text.I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone wanting to practice the positions presented in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Hsing Yi book","review":"This book and \\"Hsing Yi Chuan\\" by Master Liang Shou-Yu and Dr. Yang Jwing Ming are probably the best English books on Hsing Yi."},{"rating":"1","title":"No audio!","review":"Tried to watch but there is no audio.

He's been nominated numerous times, and actually won, for his dramatic roles, but to me Williams will always shine much brighter when making us laugh. To me, arguably his greatest role was that of Daniel Hillard, a very irresponsible married man, father of three, whose wife Miranda (Field) finally has enough and puts him out. In an attempt to see more of his children he disguises himself as Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire, an elderly woman who is hired to take care of the children while their mother is at work. William's is genius as he frantically switches between Daniel and Euphegenia, trying to, through Mrs. Doubtfire, win back his wife and deter her from Stu (Bosnan), the new man in her life. Hysterical from start to finish, \`Mrs. Doubtfire' is a sure fire crowd pleaser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Conquers","review":"I won't go into all that this movie is about because if you have not seen it; I'm sure you have already read about it.I liked this movie for several reasons. One is the humor that waS provided by Robin Williams in his role as Mrs. Doubtfire. It was outstanding, but aside from that I think the film made another point. It showed that things always do not work out exactly how we may want them to and that we need to understand that and I feel the movie also showed the importance of love, understanding and compassion between people. That's pretty good for one movie, don't you think.

Unfortunately, he doesn't end up being with his wife, but these things happen sometimes. I love how his gay brother and his lover try to find him the perfect mask for the job. The songs they sing are amazing, and they fit the occasion. It's a film with some ups and down like life itself. It's family-oriented, too.

And since she's the love interest, that kills the love story. There's been plenty of negative comment about Mick Jagger in this, but he's fine. It seems most people just can't get their heads around such a famous rock star being an actor.The major problem is the script, which probably had merit when written, but ended up after the rewrites making very little sense. You can watch this movie and enjoy the ride, but at the end you just ask yourself, \\"What the hell was that?\\".None of it makes much sense. Every scene has been designed as a photo opportunity to make the film's technicians look good on show reels - and they do. But the price paid is to alienate the audience from any identification or lasting enjoyment.Ultimately,the producers Hollywoodie-ed this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupid, but Fun","review":"This movie is the right kind of stupid.

Anyway Emilio escapes and is labeled a FreeJack and is on the run from Mick F-ing Jagger in addition that the whole city of future New York wants him cause a bounty is placed on his head for a trillion dollars or something like that. Oh and he has to get back to his girlfriend and stop evil Anthony Hopkins. I just don't care. This film is a hot mess with odd product placement, weird character motivations and inconsistent editing.

Had she not been picked to act Amelia Earhart, the movie would have been a dud. The movie was not a great hit, but it was well-directed. I learned so much about the real aviatrix through this movie. Rutger Hauer was very good as a alcoholic navigator who goes with Earhart on the final flight. Both of them steal the floor. But it is Keaton who makes this movie worth watching. The final scene left me in tears- it was very poignant. The sky, the sun, and the subtle dialogue was blended very well.

The description on the website is manifestly untruthful. The deck wizard only offers a few options: deck dimensions; corner chamfer; and stair position. In order to change anything, you have to reconfigure the pre-drawn deck one board at a time using a very limited set of editing tools. The wizard only allows you to position the stairs coming straight out of one of the sides-forget about having a landing halfway down. There are no options for any of the materials used or railings, etc.The Help file is for DesignCAD, the words \\"deck, \\" stair,\\" and \\"rail\\" are not even included.It doesn't even create a materials list.

(Uris clearly likes Greece). Plot: Visiting American author is trapped by the German takeover, and secret British information falls into his hands. He MUST get it to the proper authorities, blah, blah, blah. A Colonel Klink-like character is hot on his trail. He deals with a couple of Greek hotties along the way.This is a boring book.

This is the only book by Leon Uris that I have read. I was under the impression that he was a writer who researched his subjects meticulously. Perhaps this was one of his first books, because there is very little local color here, nothing that one couldn't glean from watching movies and skimming a few travel books. Worse than that, the characters and situations are cliché from start to finish, and the prose is dull. It reads like a treatment for a typical 50s WWII flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good - But Not GREAT!","review":"Plenty of power to drive the six speakers and ample volume level.

Likewise, Melba Moore (a Tony winner for this show) delivers an incredible rendition of \\"I Got Love\\". The rest of the cast are very good performers and the score does not suffer ever in their and the fine chorus' hands. The engineering is a bit crude but I'm willing to forgive that given the recording's age. The liner notes are of a fold-out nature and really offer no insight into the making of the show or its life on Broadway but the synopsis is good.

Still, there's astounding music here, especially \\"The Girl with the Sun in Her Hair\\", the aforementioned \\"The Box\\", and \\"Out There Somewhere\\", all of which combine well-crafted beats with a melodic and harmonic sensibility that's so lacking in a lot of techno these days.

Now anyone who has heard most of the older albums like this one have to wait for new Autechre and Squarepusher albums to actually hear something refreshing that isn't just using new technology as a crutch for what the artist can't accomplish with actual talent. Even though Orbital seem to have lost direction now with the Alltogether album, it's still nice to know that they had wonderful gems like this in them at the time.

The book itself is patterned a lot like a smaller book of his called \\"ARhT\\". If you compare the paintings that appeare in both of these books, you'll find that the retrospective pictures look less colorful and lacking in detail (some are actually just black and white photos) maybe it has something to do with it being an older publication. I dunno. Get ARhT instead. the paintings look better and Giger tells some really cool stories and maxims on life."},{"rating":"1","title":"For art fans, not horror fans and \\"Alien\\" fans","review":"I didn't like this book at all. I expected paintings of aliens and supernatural creatures. Instead I got art that's nonsense, from my point of view. The paintings look nice, but they're meaningless to me. I think that Giger needs better ideas for the subject matter of his paintings. Also, Giger's obsession with sex seems juvenile to me.One of the few things I liked in the book was a sketch of a kid ringing a doorbell while another kid drops a guillotine blade toward the neck of the woman who stuck her head out the window to see who was at the door.This book includes the two \\"Necronom\\" paintings that inspired the makers of \\"Alien\\" to hire Giger as designer of the alien, but if you're looking for artwork related to \\"Alien,\\" there's a separate book for that. I think there is also a book that covers all of Giger's filmwork including Alien, Poltergeist II, and Species."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Inspirational Tale","review":"A great autobiography, this book tells Neil's inspiring story--from his early passion for the stars to why we should care, and why we should all reach for the Stars!!

He goes from topic to topic about his exeriences and always entertains the reader while doing so. Such as the being black in academia and New York section, to the public's stupidy concering the natural laws of world. He also displays his wide knowledge of astrophysics and anything above the sun. In the end the book entertains, informs, and delights with the sky not being the limit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a 5 star","review":"I ordered this book after reading Tyson's wonderful \\"Death by Black Hole\\" without knowing it was an autobiography.Overall, I enjoyed learning about Tyson's life path from a childhood interest in astronomy to becoming an acclaimed astrophysicist. Included are tales of how being black adversely influenced several life experiences. Fair enough. On the flip side, I wouldn't be too surprised if some of his extraordinary opportunities were due in part to his ethnicity.That said, Tyson is a true original, and his books are well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"This book exhibits a strong gravitational force.

Thurman's lectures on Tantric Buddhism are fascinating, and they are counterpointed well by Wise's narration of the trek to Kalias, his own failings and fears, and his relationship to his teacher. Thurman is (as always) enlightening and impressive, and Wise's story is wonderful in that he is \\"only\\" human, too-- it makes the path toward enlightenment seem possible for the rest of us!

It was just one of those days that nothing went right, and by the end of the night I turned on the television not knowing exactly what I was looking for. Normally I don't watch sports movies, but I read the info on this one and thought it sounded fun and intriguing. I was genuinely surprised at how much I liked it. I am considering buying it, that is how much I loved this movie. Brian Presley does a great job playing the younger version, as well as the older version of himself. Kurt Russell does a phenomenal job at playing the older mentor role. Melanie Lynskey plays his wife and she gives an exceptional performance as well. Family friendly, anyone friendly for that matter.I highly recommend it to those that feel like their life is not going exactly how they wish it would be going.

I would highly recommend this film to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touchback very poor movie!","review":"I read reviews on this movie claiming it to be a Christian movie, but it had nothing to do with the Christian faith. There was no mention of God, the Bible, or faith. It had a great deal of profanity and a skinny dipping scene that was totally unnecessary.This movie was about a young football star who gets seriously hurt and can't play football anymore. Of course, this ends all of his dreams for the future. He ends up staying in the same small town, marrying,and having a couple kids . He supports his family on a struggling farm. He is very unhappy about his current life situation. He tries to commit suicide and ends up having a dream that lets him go back and relive the past and learn that what he has in life now is not so bad after all.I would not recommend this movie to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sports movie","review":"Good movie that is uplifting a bit on the more aspects of the regrets than game play.

It is an amazingly good movie with a great message. We wondered why we had never heard of it before. There is a little foul language which may be inappropriate for smaller children, but we didn't feel it detracted at all from the movie. If you want a feel good, against all odds type of movie - this is for you. Football, family & small town camaraderie are the main themes. There is a farming aspect of the movie, but it is totally unrealistic so don't rent it for accurate farming scenes! We live in the middle of farm country & still love the movie.

Authors had also added movies about the Second World War in which you can find according to the name of the movie as well as who played whom related to the biographic subject.

I have 8 cushions, a blower, cords and things to kill weeds and feed plants all in there.No spiders or little guys hang in there, though I do have a person spray every other month.

The main problem was the bottom and sides did not snap together, they seemed to \\"rest in place\\" but did not hold, making it nearly impossible to snap the other pieces on. I also tried a rubber mallet, as recommended by another reviewer but that did not work at all and i wouldn't suggest it. I would recommend another product.

Needless to say, I was not pleased in the least. This substance reminds me of no form of leather I have ever smelled in my life. It is so potent and sickening that I am suprised no one has dropped dead from its stench. I've noticed here recently that the majority of people who review products on here are fanatics who are hopelessly devoted to them, so I thought that I would give my two cents to bring their heavenly praises back to earth... there is hardly anything satisfying about this cheap scent.

The older English Leather smelled a lot stronger and had a slight burn when applying; however, the new English Leather did NOT have the same smell and it did not have the same sensation on my face.

It's a great application... sometimes. The problem is that is has always been prone to develop bugs that are rarely fixed in a timely manner. How a company rooted in time management and organization can allow this to happen I do not understand.

By then, the bugs might be gone. As it is now, I'm using Outlook 2002 on a Windows XP 3ghz machine with 1gb of RAM, and it takes me 34 seconds to load Outlook (time for the splash screen to go away). Occasionally it will tell me it had to disable PlanPlus on startup as well. The memory usage (if you leave it open all the time like I do) is high as well, although I don't notice it much, having such a leet box (translation: fast computer).I do give them 2 stars instead of 1 because it's pretty. Outlook 2002 on its own is really dull, especially after you've looked at it daily for years.

I installed FranklinCovey Plan Plus 2.0 atop a completely fresh, never-before-used Outlook 2003 and Outlook now runs for about 30 seconds before crashing. I did not bother to contact support to see if there are any resolvable issues; these problems are OK with open source products that are still under development, but for retail price, I expect software that works.Like its predecessors, 2.0 also fails to uninstall completely, leaving behind its menus and other nonsense after it's supposedly removed itself from your system.Please, Franklin Covey, get it right next time before releasing it.

At one point, I received a phone call for assistance from Franklin Covey. We were able to locate the missing Outlook data files, but the wait for service typically exceeded fifteen minutes.

The clarity and natural shine of Joe Boyd/John Wood' production & engineering which so graced the first two albums is sorely lacking here...the arrangements are a little cluttered and bottom heavy, the vocals aren't particularly made to stand out....the overall effect is a somewhat dated and a touch cheesy which is dissapointing considering the first-class songwriting.

And how did an Indian servant manage to have his \\"master\\" put in chains and fed bread and water on a British ship with other British passengers? And why did the hero not devise a way to escape his captor when he was allowed out ON HIS OWN in London? Why didn't the hero just shoot his captor when they were together on a hunting field AND THE HERO HAD A GUN after the captor told him he was going to kill him regardless? And how, in 19th century country Britain, did a big gang of foreign ninja's on horses avoid detection by the locals---any locals, anywhere in Britain?The hero is an idiot, and the plot about as realistic as a Bugs Bunny cartoon, only not as funny.

This book portrays a much different Johnson, one who is very aggressive. Taking the reader back to a different place and time, \\"Crow Killer\\" was definitely an interesting read. It would be interesting to read a story about JJ from a Crow Indian's perspective, but this was definitely worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"When men were men...","review":"I suppose that most people find their way to this book through the movie,Jeremiah Johnson. It is a great film and one of Redford's best.The book is a fascinating look at the real life model for Jeremiah Johnson, John Johnston. His story is essentially compiled from the oral tradition of the old west augmented by interviews with people who knew Johnston (or alleged to know him.)Some of the stories are fantastic and should be taken with a grain of salt but it does suggest that only a very unusual(and dangerous)individual succeeded as a mountain man. The romantic notion of the old west is replaced by an environment that is hostile and unforgiving. The map provided is hand-drawn but gives a sense of what must have been involved for settlers attempting to cross that portion of the country.I enjoyed this small volume very much and found it ironic that Johnston wound up being buried in a cemetery in Los Angeles (what an insult!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing stories of an amazing breed and an exceptional individual member of that breed","review":"I liked this book. It gave me what I wanted, which is a recounting of events in and surrounding the life of the famous mountain man John Johnson. I found it compelling reading. On the other hand don't expect great literature. The writing and language are \\"rough.\\" It does flow well, however.In quotes from interviews of certain of John's friends and other contemporaries, there are things like certain characterizations of Native Americans in general and of specific tribes that some may find offensive. In fact if I were to hear someone say them today, I would find them offensive. Given the context of these quotes, however, I was able to simply accept them as indicative of the mentality of these men during these times. It's worth noting that many of these same men (including Johnson) had close friends who were Indians and had Indian wives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crow Killer: The Saga of Liver-Eating Johnson","review":"Crow Killer: The Saga of Liver-Eating Johnson tells the real story of Mr. Johnson (Jonston) not like the cupcake movie version.

So one day he's ridin along with 80 gallons of whisky tied to his horse, and gets captured by the Injuns. They strip him naked, steal all his clothes, and tie him up. Its Winter, too.So he chews thru his leather straps, kick-boxes his guard into unconsciousness, amputates the man's leg, and escapes into the snow. Its 200 miles to his cabin, Winter, and he's in his birthday suit. But he makes it, gnawing on the leg, and using it to bludgeon bears (who oughta be hibernating) along the way. Much later the Crow Killer gets some payback on his captors, wearing all the fur coats and union-suits, and hoodie-footies the Indians took from him. Huh?Only perfessers would get pulled in by this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read It Now","review":"This book is a very good recollaection of Jerimiah Johnsons life. From when he first appeared in the mountains in his early 20's to his death. This book brings Johnson to life in much the same way Robert Redford did in the movie but unlike the movie this book focus's more on the man himself and not those around him. This book is filled with gory accounts of his fights and it also shows how fearless the Mountain Men were. If you are interested at all in the Mountain Men of the late1700's and 1800's then this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting read.","review":"Funny amazon recommended this book to me, as I already own it. Bought it at the Old Trail Town in Cody, Wyoming. Where Jeremiah Johnson is now buried. Very interesting book! No one will ever know how much of it is really true, but I'm sure alot if it is at least based on fact. To make a long story short I can definitely recommend this book.

The description says that the viewer has the ability to navigate through the DVD. The problem is that there are about 4 subtopics on moguls and 6 subtopics on steeps. Each is about one minute. The creator has compiled about 10 ski tips into a DVD and is palming it off as a full instructional video. Where is the substance, guys?Maybe I am spoiled, having purchased \\"Breakthrough on Skis II, Bumps and Powder\\".

For advanced skiers who have mastered the technical part of a good turn, tactics are the next set of skills they need to work on in order to conquer the whole mountain.The DVD contains drills, tips, and demos to help you made better tactical choices when you ski moguls and steeps. The feature that I like the best is the \\"step by step trainer notes\\". It breakdown the movements into different stages and provides a summary & picture for each. I wish I can print those out and bring them to the slope!Overall, the DVD is more valuable for advanced skiers than intermediate skiers. Intermediate skiers who haven't quite able to make a solid turn will find it difficult to perform some of the drills accurately."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful!","review":"I bought this locally when I couldn't find Monin's syrup.

It's awesome. I rarely agree so much with a way of rearing children. Though I'm not a parent I could take a lot of useful information from there, both regarding my own childhood, my future parenting skills when I need them, and the way how we should relate to each other.Smart Love focuses on rearing children based on the principles that children are individuals whose minds are still developing, but who we should with respect nonetheless.It's not permissiveness in the way that this methods don't advocate we should let children do everything that they want, like put their lifes at risc, etc. And it's totally aggainst punishments in the way they won't make children grow as happy adults, that it will only correct their behavior but that it will cause unhappiness in the future. This and much more on the book.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for thought","review":"This item was shipped in time and I am able to review as needed.

I'm grateful that the publisher had the instinct to publish this very thought provoking book. To those who write that they repeat the concept too many times...look around you... at the world around you...then maybe read the concept a few more times. Maybe try and see the world and particularly your child's world through their eyes. And then read the concept a few more times. I'm thinking about making a big poster of it and hanging it on my wall.

YOU ONLY NEED THIS ONE BOOK!","review":"I have three children, and my shelves were filling up with parenting books. They told me \\"how to\\" but none of them told me \\"why.\\" Now comes Smart Love, which tells me Why, When, What AND how to. I now know how to respond to my children today and also where they have been and where they are going developmentally. For the first time, I really understand the meaning of behavior that has puzzled me with each child, for example, why they start clinging to my leg at about a year of age and don't let go for months. Wise and warm hearted and knowledgable, Smart Love is the best book out there. No wonder Ann Landers recommends it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE book for every parent.","review":"My five children range from 8 months to 13 years of age and I often feel the need for expert advice but don't want to buy a book for every child! Not only that, but I have not found the books I have read very helpful because they are either too harsh or too utopian and they are so narrowly applicable. Smart Love offers a coherent understanding of what parenting is all about and what growing up is all about. Smart Love is smart because it offers a game plan for parenting your child from birth through adolescence. The principles and guidelines make sense and carry forward. At the same time the book makes clear how my children's minds are changing and growing and what is reasonable to expect at every age. I have relied on this book for dilemmas I have had with each of my children and each time the advice has been terrific and the problem I was having was completely resolved. If you have children of any age, this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Science plus good practical advice makes for real parenting help","review":"This is the first parenting book I have read (and I read them by the bushel-full) that offers a coherent, scientifically based view of childhood and the parenting relationship and then develops practical, doable parenting strategies based on the findings. Most parenting advice is so ad hoc that contradictions abound. The Piepers have an empirically based view of the unique nature of the baby's mind and how parents need to respond in ways that account for that immaturity. The same holds true of children all the way through adolescence. Take a look - you will see how different and truly helpful this book is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If Parents Used Smart Love Children Would not Shoot Each Oth","review":"I was reading Smart Love when the Littleton shootings occurred and I realized that children would never reach for guns to solve their problems if their parents had used Smart Love guidelines.

A friend who is an educator gave us this book as a baby present so I thought I would take a look. I was interested in their approach until I read their take on mom's return to work. Basically, they say that children \\"thrive better\\" if a parent is home with them until they are three years old. I found this broad generalization to be both offensive and unhelpful. These authors are so clearly biased in favor of stay at home moms, it undercuts everything else they have to say. Moreover, there is shockingly little evidence to back up their various claims. There are two pages of footnotes for the whole book. If they are going to throw around such concepts as inner unhappiness, the all-powerful self and the competent self and trash working parents this way, they should at least have some studies to back up their claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turtles tracks OK, but Grassroots tracks re-recordings!","review":"'nuff said.

I found it easier to load music on it through Windows Media Player rather than the CD they give you. I was having issues with my CDs being read as duplicate tracks but if you go through WMP it is fine.

You have two choices when listening to songs on the unit, If you select \\"All Tracks\\" it puts every single song in alphebetical order!.

When we called Samsung's service center, they asked for the serial number in order to repair it.

The characters were rather simplistic and the story line did not make a lot of sense in terms of what the aliena';s hope dto accomplish.

In any case, the writing style was clear and concise, but I feel the subject matter had been visited before. I'm sure I read something similar years ago. The characters were interesting, but never really gelled as I can't imagine the varied souls engaged in this book to have actually coexisted even in this state without massive disruption to each other.

Clarke fan for years, and also enjoy Stephen Baxter. However - this book begins as a thinly disguised attempt at promoting the author(s)' political views. I have a thick skin and normally don't pay attention to those things in the interest of the greater storyflow, but this is blatant and obvious in an \\"in your face\\" kind of way (for example, reference the character \\"Sable\\" who would in real life never have been allowed in NASA or even in space in the first place). The insults and propagandizing comprises a large part of the first quarter or so of the book. Then, with the anti-american sentiments mostly out of the way, the plot settles down a bit and starts to become interesting. By the last few chapters, it is actually reminiscient of the Clarke I know and love. Overall though, it is a disappointing book, and not worth digging through the garbage to get to the small amount of treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun ride, with an incomplete conclusion","review":"Ok, so i get that this is going to be a series of books.

Ancient peoples from different times waging an epic battle...ok, I liked that. But I wanted to read the book for the time shifting aspect, and this aspect is really not explored or in any way resolved in this book.More floating round devices with physical properties that defy our laws of physics....less horses and sword play!

The music itself is OK, but nothing extraordinary. The vocalist ruins it for me. Granted, Tobi Sammet is practically a vocal god. The lead singer for Taraxacum sounds like a weak Joey Tempest (80's era Europe) knockoff at times, and at the high end of his range (out of his range if you ask me) sounds like Geddy Lee from Rush.

But past World War Two and Hitler's interest in developing the ultimate people's car, the narrative loses focus and seems to lose its way amid references to Charles Manson, Mickey Mouse, Nike Town, and a host of other pop culture items. I almost got the feeling that the author wasn't quite sure which direction to take and that his editor was MIA. I found myself also losing focus the more I read and by the time the author discusses the Autostadt, I'd lost any semblance of interest. I'd have stopped reading, but I had less than twenty pages to go.My hat goes off to the dust jacket's designer. It's exceptionally eye-catching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very few illustrations","review":"It would seem logical that a book about the various mutations and variations of the VW Beetle would be full of illustrations - this book has very, very few.

The completely implausible plot revolves around industrialist Wagner (playing the evil twin of his Hart to Hart character)trying to kill his reporter mistress because she has discovered his illegal operations. He attempts this by trying to blow up the Concorde, not once, but twice. (You think they would have learned the first time not to get back on the plane). Both the writing and the acting was horrible. I found myself begging for the characters to die, just to put them out of their misery.

Laurence Sloan's insight into the future is astounding. He makes assumptions based on sound economic theory in the midst of the Great Depression and most of what he predicts actually comes true.

Short on algebra, long on theory but a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Educational Tool","review":"This film is a powerful portrayal of the AIDS crisis in Africa which depicts 5 individuals who go about fighting the disease each with a unique approach. The \\"film\\" is actually a series of still photpgraphs which are narrated by the individuals portrayed. It is exceptionally well done and keeps the viewers' attention. I am a high school teacher and used this film in a Human Rights class - the students were moved by the film and I recommend it to all interested in gaining further perspective on the crisis in Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, a deeper look","review":"The new Nosferatu Clanbook takes a new and novel approach by not presenting Nosferatu as being the be-all and end-all clan of Vampires. Taking a slightly more realistic look at the clan, it better illustrates their strengths and weaknesses then many of the books which have preceded it. While I personally find much of the charm in the book is to be found \\"between the lines\\", this may grate on some readers who would prefer outright statements of fact rather then having to deduce information by what is said and what is not. The information on Nosferatu living spaces (sewers throughout the ages) and social structure was much needed, though admittedly dry. On the whole, the clanbook is a valuable commodity to a storyteller or role-players, but is likely to be of little interest to those simply looking for new disciplines and methods to make yet another combat monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive recording of Jobim's music","review":"For my money, this is the definitive recording of Antonio Carlos Jobim's music, set in his native tongue and featuring Elis Regina's breathtakingly beautiful singing. This album ( along with the album Frank Sinatra cut with Jobim in 1967 ) constitutes the high-water mark in recorded renditions of Jobim's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that emotes","review":"If someone were to ask me what a warm smile sounded like, I would direct them to this album and the song \\"Aguas De Marco\\". There is a lot of beauty and emotion in this album, something I wish more could be exposed to.I first discovered bossa nova when I was in my early 20's, when I was looking for piano sheet music from Ryuichi Sakamoto, and came acrossMorelenbaum (2)/Sakamoto: Casa (Tribute to Jobim)(an equally emotive album), which lead me down a musical road of discovery to Elis & Tom, a quintessential bossa nova album more people should own. A little over a decade later, I can always listen to this album and, like a nostalgic childhood memory, get the same feeling or solace that \\"here is a beautiful thing\\". It's a little hard to verbalize, but I think fellow owners of this album can appreciate it.If you don't buy this album, at the very least, give it a listen through the samples here or on Youtube. There are very few who would regret that time spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophisticated, charming and groovy.","review":"This album is among the best ever recorded in Brazilian Music. Tom Jobim, one the most important popular composers of the 20th century, joins a younger band at the top of its shape. Everybody is playing extremely well, the arrangements are charmingly sophisticated and the sound has an unparalel groove. Elis Regina understands the beauty and blues of Jobim's musical ideas, who at the same time embraces the innovative energy of this band. The album is worthy from the first to the last song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"There's nothing more I can add to the title of this review. Elis Regina really is PERFECT! What a voice! Incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I checked out this cd from the library and have been looking for it ever since. It's a great pairing of voices, and Jobim's great music. A must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"When I purchased this CD I knew I was going for something masterful. Jobim and Elis are two of the best artists not only in Brazilian Music but in humam history. The combination couldn't be better. However, as the CD began to play I was astonished. The result was beyond my expectations. Elis is sensitive, passionate, clear, funny and absolutely in tune. Jobim's compositions are genius. Here I saw all the bounderies of music style vanishing. Some of these songs could easily be placed together with Schubert, Wolf and Strauss in a classical voice recital. The sound quality is just amazing considering the recording date. It is certainly one of the best CDs I've ever bought and one of the best examples of music making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elis & Tom - the best moment of the Brazilian popular music","review":"This is a special disc. When Elis sings Jobim it's the supreme pleasure. For those who like Brazilian music this disc is essencial. Elis gives her best interpretation ever. She exceeds the expectations. Her way of singing \\"Águas de maro\\" is the ultimate gift for our soul. It's difficult to choose the best music because all of them are \\"the best\\". But \\"Retrato em branco e preto\\" is unbelievable. The \\"Maestro\\" plays the piano and both - Elis and Jobim - deliver the most beautiful music ever. If one wants to have one disc of Brazilian music, this is the one. Attention to \\"Brigas, nunca mais\\" - Elis is pure rhythm. The booklet brings the lyrics in English and Portuguese, and you can see many pictures taken during the recording. It's worth and it's a great present to someone you love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm sorry, but I must disagree with all of the previous reviewers. When I look for latin jazz, I expect something that has at least a little swing and groove to it. While I am not intending to disparage Elis Regina and I am a fan of Jobim, this album, with a few exceptions, is a bunch of sad songs sung in portugese. It is not at all what I was expecting. Be warned that it is NOT in the vein of the Sinatra/Jobim albums, the Getz/Jobim albums, etc... Some may welcome the lack of orchestral accompaniments - for me, this was a disappointment. My feeling is that while Elis has a nice, vulnerable sounding voice, it is too thin to carry the effort by itself, which it seems to be expected to do based on these arrangements. Sorry, gang, don't shoot me - just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"a voice like flowing water","review":"This CD is extraordinary. Elis Regina's voice is like water with sunlight on it. In \\"Chovendo na Roseira\\", her singing flows as effortlessly as the rain she is singing about. Few singers in any language can touch her --and she makes it sound so easy! Jobim's slightly gravelly voice provides a nice counterpart on several tracks, especially \\"Aguas de Marco\\". I wish these two had had the chance to work more together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it.","review":"This is a wonderful listening experience. Both performers sound loose and at-ease. There is no overwhelming orchestral backup so the recording has a more intimate/personal quality that makes it a nice contrast to other material available by these artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical Bossa Nova at it's very best","review":"Two giants of the genre, together on an intimate, heartfelt disc.

The best Brazil can offer in terms of music. She is probably the greatest singer we have ever had. Tom Jobim is already known by everyone who has interest in Jazz and obviously, Bossa Nova.

Hardened street criminals melt into submission with just a few well-considered tactics from the mighty Mike Devlin. Oh please. This is an ex-FBI agent's fantasy of being the renegade, establishment-bashing fed--earning the respect of the bad guys while at the same time taking arms against the stupidity of the Bureau bureaucracy. The whole effort strikes me as a children's-book version of a crime novel--no subtlety, no ambiguity, no reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I don't know why everyone fell in love with this one. Every piece of action, every plot move, and certainly every single thing protagonist Mike Devlin ever did, thought, or dreamed was completely predictable from start to finish. Instead of characters author Lindsay gives us stereotypes and quirks (the talkative Irish guy; the Jewish friend with bagels; the well-spoken black Viking partner who, yes, dies nobly like a good token should). The story is just a lot of macho fantasy with no life or conflict. And the crimes resolve themselves so neatly, so bloodlessly (with the exception of the above-mentioned token) that one wonders why these guys are so world-weary and bitter in the first place. For all Paul Lindsay's vaunted FBI experience, there's little in this book that rings true, or even interesting. It's a gripe-fest, and a tedious one at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impressions of Wendel's reprinted Oliver book","review":"I ordered this book from Amazon, unseen.

This is by far one of my favorite series I have ever read. They are so character driven that the reader is automatically pulled in, and it is hard not to love them. The story takes all kinds of unexpected turns, that you never know what will happen to Angelique. She is the epitomy of what people love in a heroine. While Joffrey de Peyrac is everything that a woman could want in a strong, masculine lead.

However, after tying to read this mess and falling asleep over and over again, I gave up and went on to a more interesting book. I'd never bother to try another of her books. Someone should tell Ms. Thayer, (or perhaps a little research would help?) that there is no such breed of dog as a \\"golden Lab.\\" She referred to the \\"breed\\" at least twice. Ms. Thayer - there are Golden Retrievers, there are Yellow Labs, there are Golden-Lab MIXES, but no golden Labs. The minute I saw this first of many errors, she lost me as a reader. So many inconsistances I don't know where to begin. We're hit over the head repeatedly by the fact that Linda and Owen don't have lots of money, but both of their kids go to a VERY expensive private school. Who paid for the tuition? Well, I could go on and on but have too many good books to read to bother with this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow but realistic","review":"I guess when things like this happen, this is probably a pretty close comparison as to how it is handled. The book was easy to read and the writing style was decent, maybe a bit juvenile. It is about a high school girl who suddenly tries to commit suicide and then claims the reason is because she was raped by her step brother. He denies any such thing. The book keeps you debating about who is telling the truth and who is lieing and how the parents handle the ordeal. It was a disappointment though here and there the author will throw in a little surprise. The parents were boring and somewhat lame at times, as is most of the book anyway. But I guess if you want a laid back, easy to read book, this is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written, period!","review":"I tried to like this book, after all, I devoted several hours of my life to it, but it is so badly written that I would prefer to give it no stars.The story could be interesting, but the writer made the bridging parts of the book so bloody boring. I cringed every time Linda went to Owen for *warmth*... or relished the *warmth* of a room... the character Linda is so unrealistic and annoying.

The basis for the plot is good, a step brother and step sister, the brother rapes the sister, and the story is to examine the relationships of all those involved. But there is too much extraneous tidbits that really do not have much to do with the rest of the plot. The neighbor who seems to have a crush on the father, the friend of the mother that admits she is pregnant.... there is no followup on why these characters are included in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very predictable; boring and trite","review":"Uninteresting and boring.

I have found this piece of software to be trouble-free. There is a good interface, which gives you the choice between differents Os every time you boot yoour computer, and a good manual, so installing several OS is not a hassle if you know precisely what you are doing.However, let me give you a few words of caution: 1) Before doing anything to your partitions or trying to install a new Operating System, ALWAYS back up your data, as there is no such thing as perfect software in this world; 2) Although the manual is well written, it does not give you enough information. If you are serious about running multiple OS on your computer, I would recommend reading \\"The Multi-Boot Configuration Handbook\\", by Roderick W.

Its cover gives the impression, with bullets, that you will be able to learn several things from the author. For example 1) Using an S Corp for a personal tax shelter. 2) Completely avoid paying any income tax. I bought this book thinking that I would be taken through a step by step process on how to accomplish at least those items highlighted on the books cover. But instead, I was taken through a lot of general information without really being tought how to \\"do\\" anything. I believe that the author is knowledgeable, however this book was sold as a \\"how to\\" book. It feel way short of that mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys rock!","review":"I love this CD. IMO, 69 Eyes just gets better with each release. No filler here, just consistantly great gothic metal all the way through. Dark, decadent, great energy. Some of the songs sounded like they were influenced by The Cult - not a bad thing. Great new rock is so rare - thanks 69 Eyes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sh**!","review":"Well, this album is a good one. Its not my favorite of the 69 eyes albums, but it rocks nevertheless! This CD is more towards heavy metal than goth, and I guess is the album that send the band in a new direction.If you are unfamiliar with the 69 eyes, you might want to start of with another album. Blessed be, paris kills, and Devils are all better albums,If you allready listen to the 69 eyes, you need to get this one! It has a few awsome songs on it, even thought its not my favorite album it has my favorite song \\"wasting the dawn\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shade tent bought for dog agility events","review":"I bought the tent cause it is large and will provide alot of shade for me and the dogs at a dog agility trial. Love that every wall seems to zip open but there are still screens to shade and keep out bugs.Good news is I can easily put it together myself. Bad news is that one of the flexible pole insert things pulled out the first time I put it up. I stuffed it back in and it works, but bit disappointed it broke the very first time.The other thing is it's a bit on the heavy side. I think it said 43 pounds, which didn't sound that heavy until I picked it up at the post office! So I'm not going to be walking far and carrying it.BUT once it's up, it will be perfect at the show. Lot's of room for me and my dogs and friends. Easy to put up, good directions on the bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKE IT!","review":"The first weekend I used this tent it weathered a big storm with few problems. I was at a race track camping out in the open when the storm came through. The fierce wind blew over other tents around me, I heard men crying out in the night and poles clanging together. This big boy stood tall through the carnage.The wind blew so hard that a tiny spray of water came through the window zippers that were facing the storm. Of course the side got wet where I let my mattress touch it, just like any other tent. It rained hard all night and eventually some water blew in under the fly and collected on the screen roof giving me a little inside rain by morning.Keep the fly roped down tight and the tent will do well in a storm.Problems: 2People trip over the ropes so flag them for visibility.Kids and lazy adults go in and out without unzipping the screen door all the way which can result in a bottom tear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collapsed in Hailstorm","review":"This tent lasted me less than 24 hours. It's nice for fair-weather, but that's what I was expecting based on the weather reports. A hail storm came, and the hail collected on top of the canopy. Because it made the top sag, water was able to collect as well. I had left the campsite and went into town because the storm was getting bad, and when I returned after it cleared up... I discovered that the tent had collapsed. The metal tubing had buckled (at the joints) under the weight of the water/hail.I still like the tent a lot, how it assembles and such... it's just not hail storm proof..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our friends call it The Taj...","review":"We love it! Perfect for a pack-n-play and room for my tall husband to easily stand. And we've used the canopy all by itself, which is great!

If it gets too boring to listen to the same lesson over and over until you get it perfect, just go on to the next lesson when you have it 80%. Each new lesson gets you deeper into the language but repeats some phrases of the old lessons so you really get them. I even started dreaming in French with these CD's.

There is a profound knowledge of music at its best, exploring your inner feelings of being at ease with the world around you. There is not one bad track in the whole album, thanks to the author's vaste understanding of beauty itself. It is thus very hard to single out one piece, just push the play button and let the music wrap you in its arms. Happiness in this case is the final outcome. A tribute to life and an inspiration for everyone . A final huge wish for more music like this to be conceived, and many thanks to the ones who partecipated in the making of the album.

The only difference is that the band has gained much more experience and know how. You can actually hear it on the quality of the music and the quality of the recording. Even though they are much more laid back, they are definitely crisper and cleaner on this album more than any other. All of the songs sound better than their original recordings and the four new songs fit the bill just fine.

Although Juelz has some charisma and style, it's not nearly enough to carry his music. His flow is subpar (at times he just talks), and his lyrics range from juvenile to cliche to incoherent babbling at times, as if someone were recording his responses to an inkblock test. The production is outstanding at times, on tracks such as \\"Dipset.\\" However, the production of Cam'ron, Jazze Pha, Heatmakerz usually doesn't compensate for Juelz's inconsistency. Juelz Santana should've waited longer before dropping his debut. He may develop into a capable solo artist in the next few years, but Santana isn't quite ready to take the stage alone. \\"From Me to U\\" has a few tight beats, but it's really not worth $14 dollars unless you have a bag of money to burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tha Best Cd Yet!","review":"Yo....This cd is worth your money.Juelz is a Lyrical genuis.It's one of the best CDs today.If you like Diplomatic Immunity(Diplomats) then'll you'll love this cuz you get more of Juelz.

Just like his bit*h, I mean, his boss, Juelz is an east-coast Mike Jones. Repetitive lyrics just make you tired, and the fact that most of the lyrics at the end of each hit on the beat don't rhyme just make you hate this garbage more. This is like a 50 Cent album, it's just something to break killz up on. The gangstas in the Southside of D.C. don't wear pink. The thugs here in VA don't sport pink when sh*t gets gritty, so why would you claim that you're a soldier when you look like my sister? You're a corporate, formula gangsta. Just being a nigga from the hood with the ability to rap doesn't automatically make you gangsta.

Juelz Santana along with the other Diplomat members are hot. Some people don't understand their style so they don't feel their music. You got to hand it to these guys, they are trend setters. From their clothes, to their beats, to lyrics. The best track on Julez Santana's album would be \\"One Day I Smile\\" \\"How I Feel\\" \\"Why\\" and last but not least the street banger \\"Santana Town\\". All though Julez and Cam'ron have the same rap style you can't hold it against him. Their both from Harlem. They are the only rappers from Harlem that are well known ever since Big L died.

Diplomats put the best music out today!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SANTANNA THE GREAT","review":"I recommend this album to anyone who first heard Juelz flow.The album has alot of diversity.The album's first track is \\"The Champ is here\\"which santanna make his mark and let hata's know what they're in for.The second track is \\"One Day I Smile\\"which is a tight track Juelz is talking about his hardships and how DIPSET got signed to the ROC.My personal favorite songs are \\"OKAY OKAY\\",\\"WHY\\"(WHERE SANTANNA IS DROPPIN' JEWELS),\\"MONSTER MUSIC(A SONG THAT IS INNOVATIVE).The list go on the album is a must have .Juelz has a choppy and cocky flow which makes him ahead of his class.I admit it's not classic material,but this will be the album that will test time.So,go out and buy it and witness a star in the making cuz youngun got potential to be the next big thing.Much love go out to the ROC for putting Juelz on."},{"rating":"1","title":"wack","review":"I expected more from J.Santana. He stating to sound like Cam'ron which is garbage and he knows it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this crap please","review":"Remenber at the end of the song \\"I can\\" by Nas,he was sayin:\\"Save the music y'all,save the music y'all...\\"Well,Nas is giant and Juelz Santana is such a deep Sh*t. Don't buy this crap.Save your money and spend it for your kids or something else..If u want music then buy \\"The Ownerz\\" by Gangstarr or iven some classics like \\"Illmatic\\" by Nas,\\"The blueprint\\" and \\"Reasonable Doubts\\"By Jay-z. Anyway Santana is sucks and he needs to get his ass back in his ghetto f*ckin' right now.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A School Girls Soundtrack","review":"This a example that lyrics don't sell, you take a image and a pretty boy with back up popularity artist (Cam'ron) and you got a weak album. Juelz Santana drops a decent verse once in a blue moon. Juelz delivery is by far the worst in history his flow is broken and he pauses between every bar for about 3 seconds. Boring imaged gangsta rap for school girls to buy and masterbait to his pictures cuz what's on his disc isn't worth a listen music."},{"rating":"1","title":"R U KIDDING ME!!! I LAUGH AT THE WEAK","review":"This album is a piece of s*!?. Anyone who buys this album needs their brain checked. The only reason this album gets even one star is because of the half way descent production, but then again all of the beats have that little anoying voice in the background. Cam'ron also has garbage appearances on this poor, pathetic excuse for a rap album. So, if you like wasting 15 dollars, go ahead and buy this bulls*i! cd. I promise you you will regret every moment of it. The best songs on the cd are \\"How I Feel\\" (the shortest song on the cd) and \\"Why\\". Juelz's lyrics are garbage and the whole diplomat crew is garbage. I Only have on thing to say to Juelz Santana, WORD TO YOUR MOTHA, HANG THE RAP GAME UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT REALLY SUCKS","review":"WHAT REALLY GOOD MY NAME SHAKHIA I EXCEPT BETTER FROM JUELZ SANTANA.THIS ALBUM IS (...)

Several aspects of the book were a disappointment. First of all, it was too long. The story could have easily been told as a short story, instead of a rather painfully protracted novella. Secondly, I had rather expected the author to teach me something new about the era in which the historical novel took place. That didn't happen; Having read the book I now know absolutely nothing that I didn't already know about Norman England. Thirdly, the characters were superficial, wooden, and rather remarkably peevish, most of them flying off the handle on the spur of the moment for no clear reason. Lastly, the dialogue sounded contrived and unbelieveable, even supposing it to be a representation of people speaking a thousand years ago. Sorry, but I found the book to be a tedious bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"donab","review":"If my ridged chipping peeling problem is due to dryness this did not help but did smooth out my cuticles and certainly smells good.

I read a review that said if u don't use this product everyday that your skin n cuticles will begin to peel. That is true. I didn't use it for like 3 days n the skin around my cuticles began to peek.

Makes my skin around toe nails and fingernails healthier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book","review":"I was reading this book in bed last night. The book is about horses being reflectors of the human experience. An insight in the book made me realise that my daughter plays a similar role in our lives. When we adults are upset but refuse to acknowledge our upsets, she bursts into tears or has a tantrum. When we don't acknowledge that role in our children, we can damage them. It is a lovely book, blending equine and human dimensions and written by someone who loves and understands both people and horses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!!","review":"This book is a fantastic follow up to the Tao of Equus! That book was fascinating, and this kicks it up a notch! I was delighted to see that Ms. Kohanov referred to Elaine Aron's book on Highly Sensitive People. While reading the Tao of Equus, that book kept popping up in my mind --it is so relevant to the discussion! It confirms my thought that pursuing a future in Equine Facilitated Therapy might be a good fit for me. I am very grateful to both authors for their groundbreaking work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"book review","review":"Riding between the worlds did exactly that, took you between the world of the horse and human. I finished the book in one sitting it was that engrossing to me. Thanks again for another wonderfully written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human-horse connections can provide invaluable models","review":"From the usual basics of the practice to more unique chapters on correct breathing and posture, this covers a world of detail. Linda Kohanov's Riding Between The Worlds: Expanding Our Potential Through The Way Of The Horse explores a new kind of therapy which blends psychology and spirituality with a love of horses. Human-horse connections can provide invaluable models for growth and understanding, and enthusiasts will appreciate a direct assessment of these connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's the audience for this book?","review":"I bought this book simply because Amazon advertised it to me and it had good reviews. It obviously makes a connection to certain type of people (presumably \\"extreme sensitives\\") but it didn't do much for me. I found it hard to work out who the author was actually writing for. She didn't provide insights to assist troubled people, so clearly you have to actually attend her therapy program to benefit from her knowledge. Nor did she detail what she does in her therapy with horses, so you are left wondering exactly what is happening in the round yard. I suppose if you are on the inside (ie part of the horse-assisted therapy community) this book will mean more to you than it did to me. I tried to have an open mind but sorry, I ended the book not feeling at all convinced that horses are somehow in tune with the real meaning of life just like yogis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courageous and much needed","review":"Like the Tao of Equus, this book will probably mostly appeal to Highly Sensitive People, but it is good information for the other 80% of the population. After reading some of the reviews for the Tao of Equus it is clear that some of that majority either aren't interested or are incapable of understanding the information presented in these two books. Nevertheless, it is a courageous act on the part of Linda Kohanov for the rest of us, that 15-20% who have been squashed, like the horses, for being extraordinarily sensitive and intuitive. If this sounds like \\"whining\\" to you then you probably won't get it even though the author presents the information in a thought-provoking and often emotionally-charged manner. You'll never convince those of us who cried and were moved the whole way that it's \\"fluff.\\" It's healing for us, healing we've been waiting a long time for. Thank you, Linda, for speaking out, for empowering me and for being an advocate for the horse \\"field.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!!!!","review":"What a beautiful book. Her story of the experience with Noche the horse in the early part of book moved me. Noche put into words what frustrates me about humans - how we flee from joy. I keep the quote on my wall at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After reading the sample of Tao of Equus I decided not to read it. I should have done the same with Riding Between the Worlds. If you are looking for a book on personal psychology this is a book for you. If you are looking for a book about horses this might not be the book for you. I have really tried but I just can't even finish this book. Too much about messed up people and not enough about horses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Krups FEM2W 2 slice toaster.","review":"I was very dissapointed in the toaster.

Also, the white and stainless looks great - just as good as the black and stainless. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty nice toaster","review":"After two toasters that broke down in the last year, one expensive, one cheap, we read the reviews on you website and decided on this Krups model. So far we like it pretty well, but I will reserve final judgement until it's served us satisfactorily for at least two years. (My husband and I are old fashioned: we remember when toasters lasted for years and years and toasted well.)One comment for now, though: we like hearty whote grain breads, and these only seem to toast well when we crank the dial up to the high end. I hope this isn't an indication that the toaster will toast less and less well over time.On the other hand, we are pleased with the speed of toasting. Our last two toasters were much slower. A real drage when you have company, especially. (We agree with some of your commentators that for some reason four-slice toasters don't function as well, so we stick with two-slicers.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and New Strawberry Shortcake","review":"This is an adorable DVD featuring Strawberry and her friends. First off if you are looking for classic Strawberry Shortcake, this isn't it, but that doesn't mean its bad either. It's a new version of Strawberry Shortcake and her friends, Lemon Meringue, Orange Blossom and Peppermint Fizz. In this DVD the character think about their futures but have obstacles to face of course. The theme is \\"Anything is possible if you work hard and believe in your dreams.\\" The girls become busy career girls and Peppermint Fizz is the mayor of Strawberryland. Peppermint Fizz is bossy and doesn't treat her friend's right, but she realizes that to be successful she needs the help of her friends. It is 45 minutes of Strawberry Shortcake fun and they are super cute characters. The whole DVD is wholesome and full of great lessons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!

The movie disappointed everyone and went directly into the garbage can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting and unusual!","review":"I love this album! But it's not typical, bland Christmas background music. So if you like renaissance music and interesting-sounding instruments (krumhorns and bagpipes elicit a similar response in people), then I encourage you to order this cd. I own another one by Ethan James, and my 18-month old especially gets into that hurdy-gurdy buzz!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Joy...","review":"Ethan James' is a very fine vielle player, a passionate musician and a meticulous craftsman.

Interesting and fulfilling. ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll make it short and sweet","review":"I won't go in to much detail, since others have done a great job of it already. I just want to say I love this album! If you were a casual observer of Bryan Adams music in the 80's, you'll probably only recognize a couple of songs that you would have heard on the radio. Reckless was such a HUGE album for Bryan & there was no way of getting close to selling that number of albums again. But what you get is an album of great songs that tell stories better than I think he did before or even since. There's a depth and emotion found in these song that is wonderful. I got to meet the man briefly after a show he did a few years back and I told him I thought Into the Fire was a great album. He came over and shook my hand and it was a really cool moment for me. I highly recommend getting a copy of Into the Fire, if you don't already have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album from Bryan!","review":"Into the Fire was a very strong album on its own! Although it had to compete with U2's album in the spring of 1987, it had a good string of hits. That In the Heat of the Night is still a rocker to this day. But one of the album's big surprises is Another Day and its fast moving paces and bridges that is done so remarkably in 3 minutes and 40 seconds! Victim of Love is still a solid ballad. One of the more dramatic performances on here is Remembrance Day. History dramatically sung by Bryan in some 6 minutes. For Bryan to follow a very mega successful album in Reckless from '84 is a hard feat. But Into The Fire did well on its own strength. It helped make Bryan a more acceptable artist and songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool","review":"I liked this CD. It shows Bryan's serious side. Although it was a commercial disappointment, it was good. It definitely was not the last good BA CD. I want to see the videos for \\"Victim of Love\\", \\"Remembrance Day\\", and \\"Hearts on Fire\\". I liked the video for \\"Heat of the Night\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryan's Best Album","review":"With \\"Reckless\\" coming in a close second. This is Adam's most mature effort, and every song tells a story -- from \\"Native Son\\", the lament of the Native American and the loss of his culture, to \\"Rebel\\", a song of a once-rebellious son who comes to terms with the world he came from, to \\"Remembrance Day\\", one of the most moving rock songs ever, about Canadians in WWI. Oh yeah, and it rocks too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"uneven writing, great reproductions of Chinese Paintings","review":"With one exception, the essays in this compilation suffer from a problem that seems to crop up in many books on art history, namely the essays move from fact to fact saying little in between about the ideas behind the art. The exception is the last chapter which is on Chinese painting in the 20th century. I greatly enjoyed this essay as its author talked about the ideas and techniques behind the art as well as giving a fact based history of Chinese painting in the 20th century. I recommend this book for the last essay and also for the stunning full color reproductions of the Chinese painting that populate the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book","review":"This book is a premier collection of Chinese paintings from over the ages.

Frequently and inexplicably, the work panes have all shrunk, and I must resize them all manually (this is not simply done with one click of a Restore button). So, for a software package that advertises that it's going to help you organize your time, it fails from the start. The interface is clumsy--it's still operating in the Windows 3.1 days and struggling to keep up with the current Microsoft interface. Clearly, Franklin Covey has not invested in software design and maintenance. The product is loaded with bugs. There is no added advantage to using this product over Microsoft Outlook. Scheduling is a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased but wondering","review":"I am still not sure if this is the complete answer. I think using microsoft outlook may be better.

I traded mine back in for store credit just today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful music","review":"This disc offers two very similar yet dissimilar pieces. Mausoleum is a piece akin to Andriessen's De Materie, De Staat etc. A broad 30 minute piece with use of his traditional ensemble. This piece is very aggressive, and the use of the two high baritones is really interesting. He uses voices as an instrument better than anyone I know. The piece frequently uses one of Andriessen's most unique techniques: Hocket. Which is the subject of Hocketus, which while not quite as musically attractive as Mausoleum, offers a view into master hocket technique, both compostionally and the way it is performed. For anyone into Andriessen, I'd be hard pressed to give you a reason not to buy this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't learn a single thing.","review":"I had this textbook for one of my fourth year undergrad courses.

She likes looking at babies, so we thought this would be great. Unfortunately as other reviewers have stated, almost all of the babies in this book have negative words associated with their faces (yucky, stinky, sad etc). Staring at these faces does not make my daughter happy. I flipped through the negative ones as quickly as possible only to find almost all of the pictures were negative. As others have stated, the two pictures that are not negative (yum yum and yipee) do not have particularly positive or expressive faces either. My daughter stared at the word 'yipee' without even glancing at the face next to it. This book was a big disappointment. This is the first book my daughter hasn't seemed at all interested in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read over and over and over ...","review":"We have the older edition. My daughter loves this book and has loved it since she was about 5 months old. She is now 17 months old and we still read it regularily. We checked it out from the library so many times, we finally broke down and bought it. As for other reviewers, I think it is hit or miss with what your child will like b/c my daughter really likes books with actual pictures, not drawings. That's why we check books out at the library more than we buy them. If we find something she really likes, we'll get it for her. We also have more educational books, but she really likes to look at babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful beginner book!","review":"This book, in short simple ways, shows a diverse array of children and common emotions.

I guess it's probably the big, clear and so expressive faces of the babies. My 4 year old especially loves it that one baby is crying---I think because that's a reality of babies that so many baby books seem to ignore, and it probably helps him accept that his brother does cry sometimes! I'd really recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's favorite car-ride book","review":"My daughter LOVES this book for short car rides- half an hour or so. She doesn't go to daycare AND she's an only child so she doesn't see other babies except from the seat of a shopping cart when we run errands or in the park. So she LOVES this book and laughs and coos at the babies on the pages. My only complaint, and this is really small since she doesn't actually READ the book, she just looks at the babies faces, but some of the baby faces don't look like the describing words on the facing page. If you want this book to teach your baby describing words, this isn't the best one, but just for the pictures, it's very cute and entertaining for baby.***EDIT Note: My daughter is 2.5 now and she still LOVES this book!!!

An extraordinarily fertile period for these great talents, (well-represented here) includes the memorable year 1974, when ECM released no less than four fine collaborations in Burton's name: Matchbook, a duet with Ralph Towner; Ring, with Eberhard Weber and Steve Swallow on basses, Mick Goodrick, and a young Pat Metheny on guitars, and Bob Moses on drums; Seven Songs for Quartet Chamber Orchestra (from which the beautiful Michael Gibb's piece \\"Three\\" is included here), and Hotel Hello, a duet with Swallow. I was fortunate enough to see a festival of these ECM artists in 1976 in Hampton, VA as they toured the U.S. for the first time.

While Levine illustrated a face frame cabinet first, he used that only as a comparison to the european style cabinet, which he built during the video. Admittedly, the final product does look very 80's with the laminate and all. Any viewer can take the ideas and, utilizing more aesthetically pleasing materials, create a beautiful and strong cabinet.

Upon first glance I chalked it up to yet another cheap Marley compilation (The cover is fairly dull), but when I flipped it over I found that it was all magical Upsetter! I really can't say enough about this album. It boasts some of the best sound quality of any of the early Marley releases and in dub, the rhythm section shines like the sun.

As an album this is a solid work. Not as smooth as his later work Douglas still seems to be leaving the much more rock past of Death In June behind.

Other than the dwarfish servant (the only really interesting character in the book), I really couldn't care all that much about what happened to any of them. I didn't find the twist of fate ending particularly satisfying (but I won't spoil the story for you).

There's no editorial consistency - Mike Nesmith is referred to as \\"Mike\\" and \\"Nesmith\\" in the same entry.

Not a book to read in one session but these books never are. This is a great reference to thumb through while you are listening to the CDs.

We're on our third one of these from a local big box retailer. The first two didn't last three months each. Low priced compared to most machines but that price doesn't help now that we're looking to replace it again after only another six months. At this point, the pump doesn't have enough force to push through the espresso when it is ground and packed properly. The frother is adequate once you get the hang of it. The wand never really had enough oomph to froth 20oz of milk in a pitcher. So if you like one shot in a 12oz drink, your pushing the limits of the machine if you make two drinks in the morning. As an alternative we tried the Bialetti Mukka which was also limited by its capacity. The price jump to the next level is significant and so we'll shop carefully before committing for the long term. But we certainly wouldn't go back to this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"The Krups XP4030 is a major disappointment. While it does make excellent espresso it is not capable of adequately frothing milk.

The Krups XP4030 is better looking espresso machine than my old one, so I thought it should perform better too. I liked the double espresso shot canister since making espresso for two is always added work. The expresso came out nice, with a creamy head...so far, so good. Unfortunately, when I used the froth steam wand my expectations quickly diminished. It sounded and looked like someone with a straw blowing into milk. It couldn't hold a candle to the old unit in this function, so I returned it the next day.

The first machine was made in Switzerland and the current one I purchased was from China. I don't know if it was the materials used to manufacture the latest, but it was not acceptable. There was definitely a smell of plastic from the machine and then when I foamed the milk, there was a smell of plastic and the taste of rubber. My husband called Krups and they sent a new foaming nozzle, but this was not any better. I returned the machine today.

I ended up sending that same machine back 3 times. They replaced it with the same type of unit. After 2 months it went out as well. I sent that unit back a total of three times as well. They replaced it with The XP4030 unit and a coffee maker. I had the issue with the steamer blowing off and bought a replacement for it.

Now I am reconsidering the brand or perhaps the quality of the chinese made KRUPS or even that my 250 machine (how much I paid for it two years ago) was not the right model. I will take it for service and let you know how much it'll cost to fix it and see if it'd be worthwhile to buy one or fix it. The problem is that the pressure is gone so water doesn't get through the filter. One more thing that I regret buying the machine is that it has a plastic bottom which has lost its color due to the steam which would be avoidable if I'd purchased all SS one.

After buying their $100 combination Coffee/Espresso machine and finding that the Espresso part didn't work well, I ate the $50 extra I paid for that half and bought a $150 XP4030. It was a miserable experience. The instructions were atrocious. The cup seal wasn't good and steam spewed brown water everwhere while brewing. The frothing attachment comes off on its own when it is turned on spewing milk and steam everywhere while bruning my hand. It's basically unsuable and is about to get returned.

The frothing bar is too short too and keeps falling off so keep your free hand on the turn off dial or you could end up in the burn unit. Then the pump...it is on slow motion and does not use all the essence of the espresso grinds. Just floods it.

I am new to making my own espresso drinks and until today I have never used an espresso machine. I followed the directions for cleaning it and made my first espresso/latte in less than 30 minutes out of the box. I used Starbucks espresso pods and the espresso had the perfect amount of crema. I was concerned that I couldn't froth the milk, but it turned out perfect...beautiful foam and hot milk. There were many complaints about water leaking. If you read the directions, it tells you that this is common and that there is nothing wrong with the machine. I have noticed water leaking out of the machines at coffee shops so I guess it is common. I expected to have to make a few cups before getting it right, but my first cup turned out great. So far this machine is a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 2 months","review":"I bought this machine about a year ago. After 2-3 months the gasket that seals the connection of the coffee filter to the machine started leaking. A design flaw of the machine is a hard stop that prevents tightening the basket just a bit more to stop the leaking around the basket when the gasket weakens.I spent some time on the Web looking for a replacement gasket for this model. I went to the Krups Web site and bought two replacement gaskets. The problem was that the new gasket leaked more than the old. No espresso coffee in the morning for a while.Today, finally I bought a Breville Modena espresso machine for not much more than what I had paid for the Krups. The gasket is much tighter and seals well before the hard stop is reached. It was a pleasure to dump the Krups in the garbage. It is amazing how a $6 part can completely mess up a whole espresso machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong temperature","review":"This unit has its quirks, as detailed in other reviews, but works fine once you figure out that the water tank needs to be pushed down, wait for the little orange light to turn off, etc. But it has one fatal flaw.The water for the espresso is not heated hot enough.Proper espresso should be brewed at 194'-203' F. This one pours blank shots (no coffee, just water through the machine) at maximum 160' which is far too cold for proper espresso brewing.After months of working with the confounded machine trying to pour a good, dark shot, I just went back to using our stovetop Moka pots, which are a little too hot (they brew at boiling, 212'F) but make appropriately dark espresso.That's basically all you need to know. It just doesn't brew at the right temperature. Save your money, get a Moka, or find a machine that you know brews at the right temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything's good except the frother","review":"This is a great machine except for one flaw. The frother nozzle shoots off during the frothing process. Very messy, very dangerous, and mostly very disappointing. It makes wonderful expresso fast and easy. I use an expresso jigger and it stays fairly hot on the plate above (which it is intended for) while doing the next step of frothing the milk. The frother nozzle is the only issue I have with this machine. I now keep it on using one of those ring clamps I bought in the car parts and accessories department. I got one with a little handle on it. I still have to be careful as it still will occasionally shoot off. I have written Krups by email with NO ANSWER and that is very discouraging. I am looking at buying a different brand now, too bad because this was otherwise a great machine for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experience","review":"I had the hardest time figuring out this machine even though I've had Krups machines in the past. I just could not get it to work. After two calls to the Krups Customer Service it was determined that I had a faulty machine. I decided to return it and not get a replacement. Wow, that was a big mistake and cost me close to $55 over the original purchase price since I had to pay shipping and a shelf fee...I guess the cost of taking it down from the shelf in the warehouse. I felt ripped off and will never order this kind of product from Amazon and Today's Concept again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Froth!","review":"The machine was user-friendly but has two major drawbacks: 1. There is no auto stop, so you need to turn it off when you have the quanity of coffee you want. Secondly, and this is the worst, there is no froth, only bubbles. We called the company about this and were told to only insert the tip into the milk. However, this brought the same measley bubbles that we got when we put the wand deeper into the milk. This will be going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"This product has two fundamental problems. One is a strong plastic-ey aroma from the water reservoir that doesn't go away with time. The other more fundamental problem is that it is extremely sensitive to the grind - a little bit too fine and it gets totally constipated and won't funtion. If you do get any coffee out of it it is burned and foul tasting. I consider it a waste of money and am looking for a replacement. On the plus side, if the grind is just right it will produce good espresso."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service","review":"This is a great product. Great and speedy delivery. We received the order in three days and the shipping was free.

At first the machine worked very nice but then came the wand flying off in the middle of steaming the milk. What a mess and I was actaully burned by the milk although it didn't leave a mark. The cost was very good considering the quality of the espresso drinks I made. Easy to use and the instructions were fairly clear. I can see a law suit coming if they don't change the frothing wand design. Very bad idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yup, it's official Krup is Krap","review":"Bought this to great excitement at C&B today. Then read the online reviews to some dismay. Sure enough I spent 30 minutes reading the instruction manual so I wouldn't screw it up. Then proceeded with the step by step cleaning instructions. I could not get this machine even to suck up any water at all. It just sat there grinding away nothing but the smell of overheating electrical appliance. I'm taking it back tomorrow and getting the Gaggia. Krup is krap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Have had several Krups espresso maker. All have been wonderful low end machines. decided to upgrade.Even though the machine makes great espresso, the steaming mechanism is a very poor design. Instead of a screw on frothing mechanism, Krups has incorporated a friction fit design to facilitate cleaning. I cannot tell you how many times the mechanism has popped out into my mug spraying milk eveywhere. Throwing it out today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Workmanship","review":"I've had 3 of these: in less than 30 days!!! It makes great espressos and caps, but mine kept breaking, and the retailer confided that ours weren't the only ones. The first one wouldn't steam. The second one did, but then the 'wand' literally shot off the machine into the milk, and could have steamed my hand. The third one had a funky switch right out of the box: it was angled like it hadn't been attached correctly at the factory. We kept it for 10 days, and then it died completely.To their credit, customer service was excellent, empathetic, and did the right thing. But I'm done with Krups. Too bad, because the expresso and the steamer worked perfectly (when they worked)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The big disappointment","review":"I have been the happy owner of the simpler Krupps Espresso machine for more than 25 years. It works great, and makes us double lattes quickly and efficiently. Our former unit was finally starting to fail, so we decided to upgrade. Big mistake!Every aspect of this machine disapponts! It can only make one double shot at a time (so to make two in the morning, you have to empty the hot, drippy espresso filter). It also doesn't have the oomph to steam milk like my old machine. You constantly have to reheat the small amount of water that the pump sends to the steamer.Finally, I will never buy another non-book or music product from Amazon again. Their return policy is terrible and we are now stuck with a machine that we hate. My recommendation: buy the cheaper Krupps machine from someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the electronic version, not the hardcopy book","review":"I returned the book promptly upon receipt.

On the inside, the book is shallow and un-engaging. Most concepts are covered poorly and are made hard to understand. One of my biggest gripes about this book is how the author tells you \\"Now lets learn how to make _____\\", and instead of explaining things, just dumps 4 pages of lingo code on you. I feel that a good book should break down the code and explain what it is doing. Copying a hundred lines of code form a book does not teach you anything. The book is also very dry and a bore to read. I fell asleep several times while reading, no joke.If you want a book that touches on some of the same principles, take a look at \\"shockwave 3d\\" by Jason Wolf.

Some kids really like Cam as a character, and some don't really warm up to her. Either way, though, she's certainly worth a try, and kids who are mystery crazy seem willing to go along with Cam as the central character even if they don't bond with her.The mysteries have some thought to them, and this book is a good example of how they are put together. Based on keen observation, which plays along with Cam's photographic memory, the solutions turn on details and paying attention, which is a pretty nice way to describe mystery stories in general and a pretty nice subtle message within the book.So, maybe Cam will be a huge hit in your house, maybe just O.K., but in any event I'd want to have one around.

The track selection is very well put, not only on the musical selections, but also in the political spectrum that each of the songs were born. From the furious take on \\"Rock the Casbah\\" by Taha to the energizing funk notes of Egyptian singer Hakim with James Brown, the album also includes musicians such as Joe Strummer and bands like Asian Dub Foundation. The album takes the listener to a virtual trip to a Middle East much unknown for us Westerners: a Middle East where the prevailing sounds of Ra, Shaabi and Qawwali get together with Rock, Rap and Funk. More than \\"a good world music CD\\", this album is an exercise in cultural understanding and reaching out to individuals who, while belonging to different civilizations, yearn of a non-belligerent future."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome!!!!!","review":"The best boots by far that i have ever owned. my buddy got a pair of oakley SF boots the same time i got mine. we both wear them everyday and his are falling apart like a cheap sneaker....!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"These are the worst boots I've ever worn.

Part memoir, part vision, Mayhall's book details both her grief and the short life of her son, chronicling the good memories and interspersing them with the struggle to deal with the pain of loss. Using her faith to define her son's presence in the next world, Mayhall's view of heaven is replete with bicycles, loved ones, popsicles, and Jesus. Scotty watches on proudly as his mother reclaims her life, working to help other parents with similar losses heal, and rebuilding her family when she and her husband move forward with the adoption of a child.

Since neither of the main characters (Victor and Theda (\\"Ginger\\")) are ever referenced in any other Discworld books, this is one of the \\"standalone\\" books in the series (\\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" and \\"Monstrous Regiment\\"). It's also one of the excellent ones. As the name implies, it's a parody of Hollywood during its Golden Age. Since Pratchett's forte is working with cultural metaphors, and Hollywood is a prime source of such metaphors, Pratchett is at his best here. The way the material and various films tie together (especially in the last 100 pages or so) is hilarious. Plus, the book does some good development of C.M.O.T. Dibbler and Detritus. It also introduces Ridcully, the Archancellor who seems to be Pratchett's now-permanent one, and one of my favorite recurring characters: Gaspode. Excellent book. I rate it at 5 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"Too contrived, too many riffs on existing motion pictures and not enough good one-liners and story events compared to prior books.

Frankly, I am a little bit disappointed. The biggest disappointment with it is that the characters just lack the liveliness and originality of all other Diskworld books I've read. The only great character this time around is Gaspode The Wounder Dog. Victor and Elaine are just too bland, and don't have anything interesting going on for them (not Rinsewind fear of everything, not Cohen ridiculous selfesteem, nor Vimes cool strong lead.) They just lack any special quality(except Gaspode that is.) It is still really really funny and I've enjoyed it more than most non-Terry Pratchet book I've read but I think it is the weakest one of the diskworld series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase","review":"IN the past I have order Mister Little Elk's Lakota teaching course ($230 absconded via Paypal with no possibility of recovery, Oct 27, 2004, Transaction ID 8EM08787XB5393341), expecting to receive the product in the future.WHY would you want to receive Native American teachings from a theif ?!

The desperation of her lonely life is palpable, and the only kindness she experiences is from someone whose rich, full life is a reminder of the emptiness in her own life. Her hope of finding marriage is dashed when the man in question realizes she isn't someone with money to fund his pipe dreams. Her collapse is total and very painful to witness. Judith Hearne will serve as a reminder that compassion is the least we all owe to other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad life","review":"I saw the movie first then read the book.

Yes, this book was well written, however, if that is a large portion of justifying this book as excellent then I would advise exploring other kinds of books;there are plenty of books that are both interesting and well written. I would mostly recommend this book for men and even then, middle-aged men.

The way Russo creates characters that I can identify with, in the midst of banal situations, is a rare talent.So I naturally bought this book immediately. Russo, however, is a long-distance writer, not a sprinter. His stories don't give him the space he needs to develop characters. While several of the stories in this collection are gems, one cannot help but think that Russo could have taken them further - a few hundred pages further - and make novels out of them.I'll still give this 4 stars because Russo is one of the finest stylests writing in English today, and has one of the best ears for dialog. A great writer, but not a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Collection","review":"I'll admit this right up front. I was a little disappointed when I heard that Russo's latest release was a collection of short stories. I believe his novels are some of the best fiction being produced these days. Still though, I ran right out and got this collection--and that's where the disappointment ended. These stories are powerful and will stay with you. Russo is simply a wonderful writer and these characters and their lives will inhabit your imagination for some time after reading this collection. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"More great prose from Russo's world","review":"Richard Russo offers a very enjoyable, if somewhat repetitive, collection of short stories in \\"The Whore's Child and Other Stories\\". Published in 2002, it's clear that Russo is near the top of his game in many of these stories. My favorites were the title story, \\"The Whore's Child\\", as well as \\"Joy Ride\\", a tale of ill-fated escape. Each story in the book is a compact 20-40 pages long. They're very tough to put down once you get started.My only quibble is that a few of the stories tug at the same themes. A bit like John Updike, Russo is keen to explore the angst of the aging American male. To be sure, that doesn't take away from the author's mastery of his craft. Whether you're a big fan of Russo, or a first-time reader, there's very little risk in grabbing a copy of this book. You can cut bait if the first story doesn't work for you. But I suspect that very few people will begin reading this book and not finish it quite quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Character Tales","review":"I've never read a Richard Russo book before, but I heard him read the title story on NPR and was fascinated. Russo quickly brings to life images of characters and divines their motivations for our personal pleasure. All the characters are interesting and tragic in the small events of their lives.

However, this unit really can't do that for many people.You can ONLY record two shows if you meet ALL of the following conditions:-You subscribe to cable TV-At least one show you want to record is on analouge (not digital) cable-The other show you want to record is on either digital or analouge cableIf you have an antenna, no dice. Dish newtwork or DirectTV, no dice. Want to record a show on HBO and Showtime at the same time, no dice.

The first is the lack of a 5 pin serial port for connection of the tuning cable which causes the use of the funky light attachment at the front of the unit when hooked to a Direct TV box. Sometmes the tuning is inaccurate causing misfires when programs are recorded. The other problem is that internally the TIVO unit looks for a basic cable signal erratically for the second tuner. I have replaced all of the cables with new shielded cables so I know that is not the problem. I am replacing it with a Direct TV DVR. When the TIVO works, it is great, but it is not reliable enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I had my previous Tivo box for 5 years and I was very happy with it. This particular machine promises that its dual tuner technology will allow you to capture two channels at once. An exciting promise, but it doesn't deliver. Getting a blank screen on one of the channels is the most common problem Tivo owners have - check any Tivo bulletin board. The worst part is that the two channels will be working fine and then you discover that it hasn't recorded programs because of the dual tuner.In addition, I've had far more trouble connecting to the Tivo service through this box than I ever had with the previous box.I've disconnected my cable splitter. I'm just going to use it as a single tuner box. I hope the connection problems don't continue.I miss my old Tivo.Update - March 2009It works fine as a single-tuner Tivo.

As a writer of poetry myself, I like to get a feel for the local poetry of places I visit. The dutch are apeople who have made great contributions to Western society--but in the realm of Dutch language literature, they (wrongly) assume that only they are interested in it.Unfortunately, this book does not present me with a clear view of Dutch poetry. Why? The translations are hideous! They are written for the most part in a convoluted, artifiical English which was obviously composed with too much closeness to the original text and not enough feel for the natural flows of English. The translations are artificual-sounding, with lines composed in an unnatural way so that they \\"will rhyme.\\" So on the quality scale, these translations are the equivalent of paint-by-number.

EDDIEJINNJ"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good and broken too!","review":"The first cd was pretty lame hokey late 60s-early 70s country I guess is what you would call it. The second cd would not play. Immediate return on this one. First time I've done that with an Amazon purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This is a classic Anthrax album. It always had kind of crappy production, and still does. It would be a great candidate for a remastered edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"This must be Classic Thrash Metal!!!!","review":"Sprading the Disease,is the best Anthrax Thrash Metal album i've heard.This is pure adrenaline pumping thrash metal.Ripping lead guitars,fast rythymic chops and Charlie Benante, one of the most technical and skilled drummers i've ever heard.Great inspirational lyrics can be found in many of the powerful and thrashing trakcs.Yet,many lyrics create weird situations of paranoia and fear,and how to overcome them.Any,self-respecting Metal fan should get this.It rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my personal favorite","review":"Whenever I am on the highways for long periods of time,I make sure I have this with me.My favorite tracks are \\"Armed and Dangerous\\" and \\"Lone Justice\\" and \\"The Enemy\\".I absolutely must recommend this to anyone who doesn't already have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthrax's Best!","review":"I've got this album in addition to Among The Living and We've Come for You All.Maybe I'm showing my age,but I much prefer 80's metal to nu metal.That said,I like STD better than Among,which most people seem to think is Anthrax's masterpiece.Don't get me wrong,Among is one of the best.But as someone who loves both,if Among is a 10,then STD is a 10.5!I think the album is solid from beginning to end,where as Among slows down a little bit here and there.STD is 80's thrash/heavy metal at it's best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Garden for Groundhog","review":"Just like all of Lorna Balian's books this one is fun to read and enjoyed by my grandchildren. Goes through the year of gardening and also tells about \\"Groundhog Day\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"detailed, yet simple","review":"This book gives a clear understanding of energy. It shows energy being stored, converted and used. The illustrations and verbal presentation are simple enough for a young child, yet interesting to an adult who generally thinks little about where the energy we use comes from (me!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy's Review","review":"This product will also help with my vocal style which is jazz and also help warm up excerises. Although these these cds are helpful there are in my opinion better on the market ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Comedy","review":"Great cast really delivers some funny. No need to be a sports fan to enjoy. Definitely has raunchy moments for those who might be offended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crudest and Most Hilarious Season Yet!","review":"I have not bought this from Amazon, but I watched when it was aired on TV, and it is absolutely hilarious. I have seen all four seasons of The League, and it has yet to disappoint. Be warned that this season is certainly the most crude season yet, and it is for Mature audiences only, but being a college student, NFL fan, and fantasy football player, I fit the perfect demographic for this show, and I love it. I would not recommend this to anyone who is easily offended, as there is a lot of crude content, but for those who love football and fantasy football, and comedy, I would highly recommend this show. Guest stars include Jerry Jones, Adrian Peterson, Ryan Fitzpatrick, and Deion Sanders among others."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened??","review":"I simply don't know how a show which came off its funniest season to date COULD completely jump the shark with that abomination of a first Season 4 episode. I am tired of all the 'sports related' guest appearances. I understand the premise of the show is far-fetched to begin with, but at least try to make it a bit more relatable to those of us that actually indulge in a bit of fantasy football. Seasons 1-3 did a phenomenal job of doing so, but all of a sudden now you have these guys being whisked away to Cowboys training camp, or having a different athlete every week be in the middle of the story line. ENOUGH! What saved this season from getting a 1 star was the Hoodie Episode. More Episodes like this, Less Episodes like the 1st one or the one where Kevin is running for Judge (HORRIBLE! but fast becoming the norm)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unfunny episode","review":"I am a huge fan of the first three seasons. But this season opener is pathetic. This episode attempts to replace raw, edgy humor with about 9 billion cameos from football players and coaches. If I wanted to see football players, I'd watch football. When I watch The League, I want it to be funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"While the first three seasons were highly juvenile, there were enough chuckles to make it worth watching. However, I would strongly caution past viewers from paying almost $2 per episode to watch pretty much all the same old jokes re-hashed. Perhaps $10 would be worth it for the whole season, but the current price is simply too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny show","review":"The real reason I bought this episode because I am madly in love with Timothy Olyphant. I had heard about this show for awhile and never really watched it, but after hearing that Timothy was in it I finally checked it out. I will be watching it from Season One now :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about fantasy football anymore","review":"There were still a few decent jokes, but the show has nothing to do with fantasy football anymore, which was really the draw before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny!","review":"Very funny and nice to watch with your own Fantasy Football Fan. This season does not disappoint. The character's are funny with great guest stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show!!!!!","review":"This is an amazing show. Perfect guy show and my girlfriend loves it too! Winning!!! Would definitely recommend it for anyone who enjoys raunchy comedy shows such as its always sunny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"This show just gets funnier every season and it provides an inside look at the lives of the fantasy-league obsessed and how their lives can literally revolve around football."},{"rating":"1","title":"may have jumped a shark","review":"The first couple of episodes were pretty funny. The rest of the episodes seemed to be crude without a point to being crude. The show has gradually become less funny because as the show has progressed they have dealt less and less with the fantasty football aspect of the show. The charecters and plots of episodes have become less believable. It is too bad because this once was one of the better shows out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Book was given to my friend as a gift. She has been hunting for these books at yard sales. I looked up Amazon and gave them as an early Birthday gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthouse","review":"Eugenia Price's books are always great. I've read most of them and was surprised to find I've not read this series yet.Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"North South early builders","review":"Most have no clue that besides the James Gould of this book there were many others who migrated to the South from the North, became \\"Southerners\\" and fought against their Northern family in the Civil War. And that includes e.g. Mayflower descendants.This story is interesting history in novel form relating one such story and with good detail about many North and South events of the time.I would have liked a little more of even earlier history as the local ceramic cooking balls discovered nearby, surely appear Egyptian (see Barry Fell's \\"America BC\\").With today's incessant squabbling in Washington, we have forgotten our roots of being nation builders in the past"},{"rating":"2","title":"Society by choice","review":"I read this book and loved everything thrilling about it. Although fiction, this book draws you into the mob circle, leaving you with the feeling that you know this stuff really happens. I really love this persons writting knowledge and hopes that he has another novel soon. Great reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull writing","review":"Personally I hate bullies, which is just what the syndicate is on a grand scale. My librarian tho askedme to give it a test run and I did, as far as I could anyway, which was page 48. The writing was justtoo dull and simpleton. Mr. Gambino should of hired himself a good writer to breath some life intothe life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rates ZERO STARS-The Author Is A Con Man-NOT Michael Gambino","review":"According to today's(Aug.28th)edition of the New York Post-the headlines are screaming about how this book was a total lie-Michael Gambino is actually a smalltime Vegas con man named Michael Pellegrino. Pellegrino didn't spend half as much time in jail as he's written in this book. The real Michael Gambino is Carlo's great grandson-a 16 yr. old still in high school. Don't waste your time or your money on this, folks. Not recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"RE: Author is God","review":"I told you this book was all lies. The publisher just recalled all of the books, because Michael Pelegrino (AKA Gambino) is a fake and a liar. Maybe his career will go the way of some of his characters to the local landfill. Suggestion for your next book tell everybody your the real Santa Claus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies, all lies!","review":"Reading it, it all seemed really unbelievable, so I did some research on this book, and found out the author made the whole thing up.I didn't finish the book. Wasn't worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORSE READ IN FORTY PLUS YEARS OF READING","review":"I cannot believe I wasted my time reading this one. I suppose I got hooked because after the first chapter I thought to myself \\"it cannot get worse than this.\\" I kept going...boy was I wrong. If this story is in anyway true (which I seriously doubt) then it is a pitiful tale of a pitiful person and it saddens me. On the otherhand, if it is true (which I doubt), please blow up the Ford Tarus as it is not paid for and not the Blaizer. Thank you....I cannot recommend this read for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author Is A God","review":"Or atleast he thinks so. If it were up to Mr. Gambino he would have you think not only did he create the wheel but also every vehcile it goes on. I think he spent so much time reading and listening to stories about the mafia that that he actual believed himself to be the mafia. If Mr. Gambino only had writen the stories as they were told to him the book may have been ok, but probally not! The title should have been Mikey Gambino One Man Mafia ."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Honored Society","review":"Pure trash !I read a wide variety of material and this book belongs at the very bottom. Contains no redeeming features for author or book.If one enjoys sloshing through the slime it may be of interest, otherwise cross this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully illustrated fairy world full of the wonders of nature","review":"Henterly's breathtaking pictures depict an amazing fairy-tale world full of the wonders of nature. The fairy, with her beautiful, long brown hair and spectacular butterfly-like wings, goes to market and ends up helping out various animals including a fish, bird, frog and mouse. The rhyming text is from a poem titled \\"A Fairy Went A-Marketing,\\" and it originally appeared in Rose Fyleman's book of verse, Fairies and Chimneys.My daughter loves to slowly page through the illustrations and point out all the interesting fairy world details. This book is appropriate for preschoolers on up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous illustrations","review":"Both my 4-year-old and 1-year-old enjoy this simple, moving story about a kindly fairy. Henterly's illustrations are magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Pictures","review":"This story is an old one as you may know. the Illustrations in this book brings this story to life. I used to read this to my niece and my little sister when they were young. I read it to them so much, I knew it word for word. A lot of the times people would get annoyed with this...but I never got tired of this cute story.I would definately recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs much smaller than other New Balance shorts","review":"I have several pair of NB shorts in size medium and they fit great. But these run extremely small. (I'm wondering if this batch was mislabeled.) They're also very high-waisted, sitting above my waistline. Try yours on first! Don't make the same mistake I did by washing them first, then trying them on thinking they would fit like all my other NB shorts!! No returns for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Witchery of the Old Ways","review":"This was my very first real witchcraft book, way back in the 1970's when I was much younger. It is a wonderful volume and a good introduction to the practice of real witchcraft, unlike many overly unbalanced \\"white light\\" titles out there these days.It has everything one needs for both the beginning practitioner on the path as well as the more advanced to return for reference. I will always have a soft spot for it!It is loaded with gems of traditional lore and is one of the few volumes that one truly needs. Indispensable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Witchcraft","review":"This is not a wiccan book at all. If you believe in wicca then stay away. This book is about true witchcraft as a practice, not religion. If you are interested in working with the spirits and practicing witchcraft then you have discovered your book. There is no mention of Karma here and there shouldnt be, karma is a hindu concept not a witch's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"This book is a hodge podge of Ceremonial Magick, Wicca, and the fantasies of the Inquisition passed off as \\"real\\" Witchcraft. True, their are people who practice Witchcraft outside Gardner and Wicca, but I doubt you will see a book by them. They are very diverse and many do follow their practice as a religion and not \\"just a craft\\". Many are also bound by oath, not to reveal there practices to anyone. The craft is passed many times only to those who the signs say should learn it, even in the family. I really wish I had paid attention to the sub title \\"For Witches, Warlocks. . .\\". Warlock means oath breaker it's an insult. First clue on the spot a phoney list, Warlock. I have a good friend who is a real Trad Witch, and can trace her lineage back to the \\"burning times\\", I'm going to give this to her as a gift, a GAG GIFT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what a witch ISN'T","review":"This was the first book I read about Witchcraft. I am very glad I was smart enough to pick up others and read about what Witchcraft truly is. No, not everyone is a Wiccan, but the Craft IS a religion, and this book portrays Witchcraft as something to be mastered, and something used for power OVER others. If you want to learn about a positive, Nature-based religion revering the Goddess and God, then I don't suggest this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUBBISH!!","review":"I wish that there was a way to have actually stated on the rating drop-down \\"0 Star\\"The VERY first give away that this book was complete rubbish whaat when Mr. Hudson referred to himself as a \\"warlock\\". It was downhill from there.When speaking to Anthropology classes studying religion, magic and witchcraft, this is my example of a \\"do not buy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK REEKS","review":"First of all, you don't master witchcraft. Can you master a religion? NO, NO, NO. You cannot master witchcraft. You follow it, practice it, and live by its one law. This auther calls male witches \\"worlocks.\\" I am a male witch, I am a witch, not a worlock. Worlock means traitor or oath-breaker. There is a chapter in this book called vengence and attack, whata load of TRASH. All REAL witches now that attack and vengence is strickly against the wiccan rede. Keep away from this book. If you want to read a truthfull book on what witchcraft really is, then read books by Scott Cunningham, Silver Ravenwolf, Laurie Cabot, or Ray Buckland. This book should not even be allowed in the section with the rest of the wicca books. It is trash, don't read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Powerful Magicks","review":"This book contains no spells of mass mass destruction, and rather has weak minded spells of hell. Magic was given to man by the Pure and Only GOD. Those who so choose to use Shai'tans version of \\"magic\\" should know that Pure magic is extremely powerful. Those who wander the dark side shall be destroyed at midnight on December 31st, 1999-2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like it or not, it shook up the early 70's","review":"I'm a witch in my 40's and the first two books on the Craft I read were this one and Leek's Diary of a Witch. I even remember seeing Paul Huson plugging the book on the tv game show, \\"To Tell The Truth\\".So what do we have here? An interesting mix of witchcraft, ceremonial magick, \\"satanism\\" (that crap about repeating the lord's prayer backwards)and ethics-free suggestions about spellcasting, as well as some intriguing guidelines on coven organization.Do I recomend it? Certainly not for any beginners. I do think its an important work in the cannon of Craft history, for the sake of being one of the very first best sellers about actual, practical magic. I think it belongs in a coven library for this reason, but not for use as a working text. Like A. Crowley, there are some gems here...but you have to dig through a great deal of stuff that makes many readers uncomfortable.Read it for it's historical value. Go elsewhere for Craft intruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get your hopes up","review":"this isn't a tradition of witchcraft it is a mix of all kinds of things cerimonial magic, black magic, necromancy (just to name a few ) in this book the author claims that witchcraft is still selling your soul for magic powers (read the introduction if you don't believe me) it just doesn't say to who. (how convient.)i don't believe pagan is the only form of witchcraft and i think one could use this in witchcraft however this book doesn't discribe any traditional practice of witchcraft it's just the author putting together a \\"stewpot\\" of magical elements into one single book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not witchcraft","review":"While there may be some magical techniques in the book, it has very little, if anything to do with pagan religions, or witchcraft. Saying a prayer backwards might be good for the movies, but other than being borderline gibberish, borderline teenybopper rebel satanist, is not a good way to truly start. And loving that after he instructs you to do this, gives you a \\"blessed be\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm...","review":"Well, I have NOT read this book... BUT, I have thumbed through it. The one problem I have is the use of the word \\"warlock\\"... as it comes from \\"oath-breaker\\" and a Witch is definately NOT that... I believe that the rest of the book, with its rather \\"dark\\" attitude, can not be discredited competely. When you take into consideration that there are forms of Witchcraft from other cultures, Most notably Brujeria from Mexico, then you can't really claim that ALL Witchcraft is Pagan nature worship. While this is most certainly the most common form of Witchcraft (and probably a much safer approuch to it), I'm fairly certain that its arrogant to say that there's a \\"true\\" form of the Craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"an occult classic","review":"I have been searching for this book for a long time, I was not disappointed.... I love these works on witchcraft and the occult from the sixties and seventies so much! Trying to lay claim to a wealth of ancient information and make it practical for the modern age. An occurring theme...well.. probably forever! A grimoir perfect for anyone who wants to experience the \\"early\\" days of the noepagan movement in the U.S. I found the chapter on counter magic and protection particularly interesting. All I can say is if you love holzer, sullivan, sarah morrison, katherine paulsen the list goes. this is the book you want on your night stand.."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best investment you'll ever make.","review":"I started out with the first edition of this book in 1970. Back then there were not many authors that were serious about their craft. Such as Doreen Valiente and Valerie Worth (Cunningham was my age), and a few Hoodoo authors, just to name a few. I considered Buckland as an author for 8 year olds and housewives in suburbia (I still do). After 30+ years as a neo-pagan, and reading lots of books, Huson is still the best, with Crones Book of Words being a close second! I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants a solid background in the craft. Remember that most of us out here are not wiccan, we're eclectic pagans, so this book is a must have for your BOS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vaulable read to add to your coven's library.","review":"I hold this book to high standards. I have the \\"Boxed\\" edition. It has a hasp and lock to keep it secure. The title says it all, with all the boding of a great understatement, \\"Mastering Witchcraft\\". I bring it out at parties to the amazement, sometimes shocking, glee of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Wicca","review":"This books deals with Traditional Witchcraft, NOT Wicca. Although not strickly speaking Traditional it is one of few mass market productions on the subject I have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic of the Pagan revival","review":"Many people won't recall that the publication of this book in 1971 was one of the major influences on the Witchcraft - and Wiccan - movement in America. In many ways it was the 'Spiral Dance' of the 70s, allowing dozens of new covens to form. The author has an excellent feel for the medieval archetype of witchcraft - he takes bits of lore and turns them into workable rituals, including coven rites. He gives detailed instructions for curses and love-bindings, but gives pretty explicit warnings about them too. His work with spirits is pretty cool, though pretty ceremonial magic-y. His chapter on coven organizing was the best thing in print for many years.Recommended, with a grain of salt.Ian Corrigan"},{"rating":"2","title":"best of the basics","review":"I have had a copy of this book in my library for as long as I have been interested in the occult. Aside from the classic works of mideaval esotericism, this is just about the only book that I consistantly thumb through for reference purposes. The information is clear, and is unclouded by the current wave of harm-none ethics which causes any number of authors to omit whole areas of spellcraft, apparantly because they do not trust their readers to be capable of a basic moral decision. This book covers all of the basics, including ritual preparation, consecration of the tools, magical defense, and spells to improve your home life. The author explains the terms and ideas clearly and concisely, but without \\"dumbing down\\" the content. Mastering Witchcraft is an excellent book for beginners, and a useful reference tool for more advanced students of the art. I thoroughly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Guide.","review":"Paul Huson put 1,500 years of witchcraft research in this amazing book. It's a well prepared, cyclical guide and contains everything you need to know about the first, intermediate and advanced steps of witchcraft, NOT WICCA. Wiccans shouldnt approach this book, find it too complicated and scold it with negativity. This books is pure WITCHCRAFT, and it's great for both witches and warlocks, covens as well.If you're a serious practitioner, buy this without giving a second thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a comment...","review":"To everyone who made comments about the author's obsccurity, if you click on his name on the main page, you can see he has written quite a few books, many of which were published quite recently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel covers Del and others","review":"This CD was my introduction to Daniel O'Donnell. I purchased it for O'Donnell's excellent cover of the DEL SHANNON ballad, \\"Kelly\\" which has been a beloved standard in the British Isles, for forty years. The entire CD, however, turned out to be a most pleasant listening experience, with the singer covering a wide rage of material and artists, from Irish tunes, to Bob Wills, to Bobby Darin, to the aforementioned Del Shannon and even the spiritual \\"That Old Rugged Cross.\\" O'Donnell sings all of them in a pleasantly low-key manner which will be enjoyable over repeated listenings. Highly recommended !"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD grooves with a hip and fresh NY jazz funk vibe","review":"This is a great jazz funk recording.

In my opinion,too much time was spent discussing things about vegetarianism that I already knew about (e.g., vegetarian philosophy, etc.) and not enough time spent on cooking techniques and recipes.

More than most researchers, he has kept two issues front and center: (1) the contradictions and failings of the juvenile court, and (2) the role of race in driving juvenile justice policy and practice. There are few resources available that address these issues adequately, much less that place them within a broader historical, legal, and sociological context. His primary policy focus is on abolishment of the juvenile court, but many of his arguments can be used to develop and defend modifications, rather than wholesale elimination, of juvenile justice systems. For this reason alone it is a must read for proponents of juvenile justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Kids-Bad Book","review":"Adding nothing new to the world of juvenile law, Barry Feld once more demonstrates the gap between academia and real life. It is apparant that the author is either naive or has no real or practical experience with delinquents, the juvenile system or the politics of criminal courts. The book contains no new ideas, insights or real solutions to the limitations of our juvenile system or the issues facing today's families and thier chidren. Rather, Feld merely rehashes revisionist histories and opinions of other academics and concludes that because a greater number of delinquents have been treated as adult offenders over the last decade, we should scrap the system altogather thus literally throwing the baby out with the bath. It is not suprising that the positive reviews of this book have all been from other academics. It is a shame our \\"scholars\\" cannot offer better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah yeah yeah.","review":"hmmmm.. the name of the band says it all. should you listen to this band sometime? yeah. sometime NEVER. singer chris reynold's vocals are mediocre at best and the lyrics so ridden with cliches that one wonders why this band would want to make a permanent record of their work. seeing them open for low was one of those moments where you watch someone embarrass his/her self and you cringe because it's painful. do you stay for support? or do you you just walk away? most people did the latter. save your money. support your local band that opens for low because this one isnt' worth the bucks. there is no time for idle dreaming in my life and there certainly is no time for this generic blah blah blah disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"I'm sorry to those people that hate this band but just keep it to yourself.I think it is one of the best CD's i've ever botten.

It does not try to oversimplify or codify. It is not a book for those who want pleasant stories; it is a book for those who want some flavor of what it was like.

This movie seemed to have a lot going for it. The acting wasn't great, but it was pretty good. The killer were nicely contrived and acted, the blood and gore was phenominal for such a low budget production.It's a fun, fun movie.

An exceptional page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"Having loved \\"Birdsong\\", I was eager to read Faulks' new book and even bought it in hardcover when it was published in England. What a waste of money! I only managed to read 100 pages of it before I became completely fed-up. The depictions of life in Vichy France may have been interesting, but the main character just irritated me too much. It was too ludicrous to believe that someone as insecure and vacuous as Charlotte Gray would ever be employed as a WWII spy. If you enjoyed \\"Birdsong\\", I'd recommend \\"A Very Long Engagement\\" by Sebastien Japrisot. Don't waste your time with Charlotte Gray!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I hoped","review":"I Love books set in war-time, so it seem natural to read \\"Charlotte Gray\\" by Sebastian Faulks. Well I finished it all that I can say that it seem uninspiring to me.Charlotte Gray is a young Scottish woman who moves to London during the war to work, after meeting and quickly falling in love with a pilot, who then quickly get shot down over France. Charlotte who of course can speak near-perfect French, decides to become a spy and go to France to find her pilot/lover. While in France she get invovled with a resistance leader.Mr. Faulks seems to make everyone but Charlotte flawed and of course everything is easy for Charlotte to get to France to find her love. There are better war-time books out there and its not \\"Charlotte Gray.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlotte Gray (a lot of nothing ?)","review":"I read Birdsong and enjoyed it. I bought Charlotte Grey hoping for more of the same but was dissapointed. After reading it I was left thinking \\"what was it all about\\" ? I think the author has a funny style of writing in that he goes into great detail about things that appear unimportant (even irrelvant) but skips by things which are central to the story (like the capture of the children). In the book the death of the old man in the camp is dealt with in less than a page after being a key character throughout. Whilst reading it I was constanly waiting for something (anything) to happen but sadly it naver did and in the end it fizzled out like a damp firework. I intended to buy the third book in the trilogy but after Charlotte Gray I don't think I'll bother. In summary the book was a lot about nothing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't stick with it","review":"Charlotte Gray was not at all what I expected; I read the first 70 pages or so and found it slow and dull. After that I skimmed for another 40 pages or so before admitting defeat. So glad I got my copy at the library. For a much better treatment of the same subject matter, read Simon Mawer's Trapeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"A summer read, when you don't have to worry about time...","review":"Faulks' flawed and interesting novel can occupy your vacation time, while you are at the beach and have nothing else to do. One young lady who read this book said that it made her \\"cross,\\" because the heroine seems so dippy and ineffectual. Another person said that the book lapses unrealistically in its description of spying and the French Resistance. Yet a third friend said that the father-daughter \\"trauma\\" and the concentration camp overlay were unnecessary or out of place.True, you will not be disturbed by strong women or reality in this book. Still, this is a good book for your vacation time, schmaltzy and frothy and not too bad, unless you happen to require strong, unselfconcious women in your novels. This is not Jane Austin or Tom Clancy, but I liked it, anyway, on a hot summer day."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste","review":"i am astounded by the reviews that i've seen here. i have not picked up a more woodenly characterized, pretentiously written novel in years. i did not care a whit for charlotte or peter, or believe anything about their feeling for each other. the ludicrous efforts to \\"make themselves worthy of their love for each other\\" in france had me rolling my eyes. if you want to read a moving, absorbing work on WWII, and specifically women during WWII, pick up \\"Gone to Soldiers\\" by Marge Piercy. THAT is worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grotesque mess of a novel","review":"In this book we have a Mary Wesley-inspired love affair between a 25-year-old Scottish girl and an RAF pilot in WWII London; and a John Le Carre-inspired spy story. Although there are brief sections of fine and compelling writing, Faulks doesn't handle either the love affair or the spy story as well as Wesley or Le Carre. But the novel plunges into a different realm when Faulks introduces a William Styron \\"Sophie's Choice\\" element with a tale of two young Jewish brothers fleeing the Nazis. Their story is so compelling and sad and real that it makes the love affair and the preoccupations of Charlotte Gray seem trivial and silly. She becomes intent on getting a message to an old man in a concentration camp but seems not to care about the boys' fate. This novel needed a good editor to shape it into a first-class read, which it could have been. Instead it's long, boring and, ultimately, trivial and offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"\\"Charlotte Gray\\" is the only novel I've read in recent months that can compare to \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\" for superlative plot, engaging theme, well-rounded characters, and overall quality. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but dull characters","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who said the characters were dull. I felt compelled to finish the book, but it was the story itself that intrigued me. I kept hoping Charlotte and others would come to life and display some passion, but it was never to be. The only part of the story which touched me and was heartbreakingly sad, was the fate of the two little brothers who were killed in the camp at Drancy. This book never came close to the author's previous offering, Birdsong."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a disappointment after \\"Birdsong\\"","review":"\\"Birdsong\\" was one of my favourite books so I was looking forward to reading \\"Charlotte Gray\\".To say that it is not in the same league as \\"Birdsong\\" is an understatement-it is almost as if it was written by a different author.I thought the characters were shallow and the dialogue at times unbelievable.Faulks will have to try harder-he can't trade on the success of \\"Birdsong\\" forever.The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that as a Scot living in France,the background details of the German occupation were quite interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"After the intensity of Birdsong, flat and disappointing.","review":"Despite the no doubt accurate descriptions of wartime covert operations behind enemy lines, and the deprivations and humiliations of life in Vichy France, these are the best parts of the book. Charlotte Gray herself is not a particularly interesting character and her love affair with a RAF pilot somewhat Mills & Boonish. I found her travels through occupied France rather unlikely. Not really in the same class as Birdsong."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing:signs of hasty & sloppy plotting","review":"Was Faulks being pushed by his publisher to produce the book in time for XMAS 1998? Not one character lived on the page, not even the main protagonists. An episode that would have occupied a chapter in BIRDSONG is covered by one paragraph of reported action in the pluperfect tense. The events described in the book are improbable in the extreme. I would not have employed Charlotte Gray if I had been her spymaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"A love story? No way","review":"I thought this book was so good at the begining and enjoyed the first few chapters but then what happened?????

Boring, boring, boring........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent airplane book but nothing more","review":"I would not recommend anyone buying this book. If you are curious, check it out from the library. The character development is shallow and the story is generally not well written. The readers who have enjoyed this must be very young, and therefore not exposed to the better writers of the past.

This DVD has the poorest production quality of any DVD ever! It's obviously something that a couple of people threw together in an hour (maybe less). I thought it was gonna be a concert video, but it's just a collection of their music videos.There is noticable static on the Red Barchetta track (on a DVD???). Some of the videos don't fade out completely, they just start to fade, then freeze, and then end. The production company that made this is totally trying to rip off fans. This is certainly not representative of the band or their own production values."},{"rating":"1","title":"no need to rush","review":"Rush is the greatest band on the planet... musically. As a video band, they are abysmal. Every video here is either pure cheese or poor-quality concert footage. The overall quality isn't better than the VHS version, and the only extras are two additional videos that should've stayed in the vaults. Maybe this DVD is a good intro for new fans, but there's nothing different here to really offer the Rush fanatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush Chronicles","review":"Any Rush fans library will be enhanced by this musical sojourn into the recording studio of these three magnificent musicians. Filmed deep in the winter months the atmosphere is true to their Canadian roots and is the perfect setup for the freezing wail of Alex Lifeson's guitar, the blustery beat of Neil Peart's drums and the chilly wailing of Geddy Lee. Watching Rush make music is the instumentation of the very threads of perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE MONO sound on videos","review":"NO excuse! No excuse to release this DVD in 2001 and use the MONO versions for the videos! Just pathetic! I really wanted to kick back and enjoy some Rush videos and they are all MONO! I mean come on! It dont take much work to re-edit them using Stereo and 5.1 mixes! Plus they left out \\"the Body electric\\", \\"Vital Signs\\" and \\"show dont tell\\". Really bad all the way around! The CD version comes with a booklet and all, this one...NOTHING! No booklet, no insert, No Bonus material! They phoned this DVD in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As it should be","review":"I was a bit surprised by the selection of videos but not the quality of production. Those who grumble about sound/video quality miss the point. As with any re-release, we are stuck with the limitations of the original recordings. No there aren't any extras but it does whats' advertised - It plays Rush videos. Don't forget, Rush was one of those 'Pioneers': among the very first artists showcased on MTV (see \\"Subdivisions\\", \\"Distant Early Warning\\"). That alone makes this DVD priceless. Had the DVD included all of the original MTV videos, I would have given it 10 stars!! Maybe in another release??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me smile!","review":"So glad to own this DVD. I love Rush, and I was so happy to check out these videos. ... Now let's see some more Rush DVDs of Exit... Stage Left, A Show of Hands, and Tour Under Pressure. (I think that was the name of it?)

They just make great music and put on an excellent concert. I liked seeing them in their Farewell to Kings garb. Cheesy? Well....yea but I still like it. Remember some of the clothes back then? If you don't it was just as bad if not worse. I really liked Subdivisions and Limelight and several others. This gets only 4 stars for Distant early warning. That was and still is one of the worst videos ever produced. Other than that it was good to see these videos again. Oh yea, it is not nearly long enough. We need about 5 or 6 more tunes and some interviews.Rush still remains as one of the best musical groups to ever hit the invisible airwaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Peart and Rush","review":"I just picked up The Spirit of Radio CD with the 4-song DVD and I have concluded that Neil Peart is the best drummer of all-time. I have been a huge fan of Rush, but have never seen them live. I cannot wait for them to come to Northern California. Close your eyes and you can hear the layers of bass, drums and guitar, along with the keyboards. Truly a remarkable band that I think never got the accolades they deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you review something you haven't seen or experienced","review":"You people need to wait until you actually see this before you can review. You so desperately want this to be great because it is RUSH. I love RUSH, but let's get real. I do not want to buy just because it is RUSH.

And that DVD was over 2 1/2 hours!But this RUSH CHRONICLES has barely one hour of material, the image quality is VHS-like and the sound quality is uneven.I simply don't see why they couldn't tack ALL Rush videos into a single DVD (cause there aren't THAT many - apart from the ones missing, I also noticed the blatant lack of the SPIRITS OF THE RADIO clip), with nice sound AND polished image.Sorry, Rush Rabies out there, but I have Video-CDs with better quality and more stuff than this scam.

Unfortunately this book is a 272 page stream of consciousness rant that offers lots of complaints but very few solutions. The few solutions offered are not even well thought through (For example, ban advertising of unhealthy food to kids. Why is this a government responsibility? Is there any evidence it would it solve the obesity problem? Exactly how would you do this? Any constitutional issues?) This book is an extremely light weight effort and very disappointing. Nader should be ashamed to accept money for this empty diatribe.

And, once again, I can't see it.How cool would it have been if Nader had joined Gore (or Kerry) in return for a top post at the EPA, Agriculture, or other consumer-related federal post? Then, he'd really be making progress.As it stands, the world is going in the exact opposite direction of Nader's proclaimed platform, and his book doesn't make a strong argument for running. Not to mention, the rambling semi-coherent nature of this book makes it a tedious read.This book is conceptually and stylistically flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nader continues his descent into the abyss","review":"I've always admired Ralph Nader, but in recent months I can't help but think something is deeply, truly wrong.

The book was a great read, the lead characters were amazing and their romance blossomed so sweetly. Such an immense improvement over the garbage romance novels that are out there today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Different","review":"Midnight Pleasures is a wondeful read for those who love romance novels, and will capture the hearts and attention of those readers new to the genre. In the 424 page read you will find two enchanting characters that will cause you a great deal of frustration with their blatant lack of communication, and \\"Pride and Prejudices\\". The tragic twist not usually seen in romance novels will endear you to both of the main characters and allow you to fully appreciate the ending of this novel. Their is an afterward, so you somewhat get the clousure you looking for in the end.There are other interesting characters in the book, but thier stories are not true attention keepers and may cause you to read over them in order to get back to the story line of Patrick and Sophie.

Too many boring plots all in one story. It started out pretty good. But once the heroine and hero got married (which by the way happens too early in the story) It just got so boring. Lady Sophie (heroine) starts out as this vivacious and flirtatious character....then suddenly becomes a gloomy, cowardly mute. I mean the author really destroyed the personality of her character. Because I really liked her in the series book before this one which is Potent Pleasures which was a whole lot better than this book? I like Patrick's character in the beginning of the story.

I bought a used home theater sub-woofer with a built in amp off craigslist for $20 and used the amp from that and made a little amp box from radioshack. I connected the amp to a headphone out on my computer so I could run it in conjunction with the logitech system. Works like a charm.My review:I can definitely feel the bass now without waking the neighbors even on a lower setting. On high you can still hear the bass from the vibrations off my bed but I really never crank it up that high. Probably going to buy a couple for my car.

It is a very readable book but does have some drawbacks:1. It is way overpriced. Too thin, not enough info for [price], even if Amazon discounts it. Ideas are repeated over and over again.2. These authors (and others who review their buddies' books on Amazon and give biased reviews) are making a living off you buying into XP. It is funny how they say the last thing you want to do is adopt XP only partially.3. So don't waste your money on more than one book from this group of XP diciples who are rehashing the same info over and over in about a dozen different books.4.

I am disappointed that the book does not reveal much of the private Aaliyah. This is certainly no fault of Chris's. Aaliyah's family and close friends are just not readey to speak about her. However that's the person I want to learn about. Buy the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible..","review":"I am a big Aaliyah fan, but when I got to the end of this book, I was dissapointed. The book kept going off topic to discuss the lives of Aaliyah's family, her producers, artists she collaborated with, and other artists. And that got really annoying. I bought the book to read about Aaliyah, not the lives of people she was involved with. When I was reading it, I couldn't help but wonder if this was a 5th grader writng this, because it was just awful.

Its a great buy for the quality and cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaliyah","review":"I thought this book helped me to remember the type of person Aaliyah really was, but the book really didn't give new insights on how she lived her life. It was just the same old story that MTV, ETV, and VH1 were telling. But I do like hearing what the other stars have to say about the death of Aaliyah. I wish the book had been more specific about the day that she died. Fans such as myself already realize how good of a person she was, I just wish people who really weren't into her music to know and come to understand why everyone was deeply hurt to hear that she died. The way the book was written, you might as well have had one of the fans write it. Maybe one of us could have told the story better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your time or money","review":"Okay,I am a Aalyiah fan, and I am a person who loves to read. So when this book came out I ran to get it. I would not recommend this book to anyone who has cable or internet access. The information in this book was stuff that I could see on E's true hollywood story or VH1's behind the music or visiting a website. This book did not offer anything we already didn't know about Aaliyah. So if you have cable or internet, don't get it. It was rushed and hurried.

It is huge even when folded (although it is a snap to fold). It takes up the entire back of my minivan. I don't think the designers ever actually strapped real children into this stroller. The straps have never fit around my oloder child (he is very tall, but it wouldn't even strap on when he was 2) and my younger child, who is very average size, could only be strapped in until he was about 14 months old. Also, by the time they are old enough to need a footrest, it is too short. The holder pouch is very big, but difficult to get anything into, and the handlebars are too wide to slip diaper bag straps around. I often end up putting it on top of the sun shade, which is too low to be useful to the kids. It rubs accross their heads and drives them nuts.

It is way to long, longer than all the other tandem strollers. The front foot rest is up to high, so my 19 month old son's ankles hit the foot rest(it is not ajustable) can't get stuff in or out of the basket easily, you have to unsnap it. The shade in the back gets ruined and doesn't stay up because of folding it up. I had the eddie bauer single and decided since I had the car seat for my new baby already to fit this, I would save money.

If you don't fill the grids(i.e. limit the batter to what's directly over the heating element) it worksOK but you end up with evenly done, but half-size, irregular-edged waffles.If you are buying this as a grill, ignore our issues; they probably don'tmatter unless you need big waffles.We returned the unit"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product","review":"I was wanting to replace my waffle iron but didn't want to store anything else.

At this stage in this groups evolution, they are unsure in what direction they want to go, pulling in three different musical directions. Not the excellence of Leige & Lief to later follow. Tho, Dennys voice is strong in 'Fotheringay' & 'Nottamun town' and a very good rendition of Bob Dylans 'I'll keep it with mine' is still not good enough to pull is album out of the dumpster, and for $20 + bucks one would expect more.....

Thompson is a songwriting genius, who plays everything from European, Middle Eastern and Western riffs, as good as any in the land. First time buyers should start with single discs \\"Shoot out...\\" or \\"I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight\\" before purchasing this box set because it has different bands and singers and Richard Thompson has been way under played on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must for RT fans","review":"I have been a big RT fan for years.

One of the two bolts that secures the muffler had fallen off and the other was loose. I tried to use the saw with one bolt but it quickly loosened and I ended up stripping the threads on the engin block with all my tightening. I spent a few hours looking for a replacement bolt, but Husqvarna is not well suported with repair shops locally.My advise is make sure you have a local shop that repairs the saw that you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old school.","review":"A predictably smooth and lush performance from HvK and Berlin, recorded at the twilight of the analog era.Baroque music played on modern instruments is grossly out of style now, but recordings such as this reveal just how lovely this type of music can sound, even if it's not \\"authentic\\". This is a beautiful performance of these concertos, done in the grand old manner that has almost slipped away with the advent of period performance.Karajan recorded the Brandenburgs in the mid-60's, and again in 1979 (this recording). The 2 recordings don't vary much in terms of performance style, but this set does show just how far analog recorded sound had come by the late 70's, and is an interesting look at another side of a conductor not really known for baroque recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, good purchase","review":"This tape was in excellent condition and an excellent movie.

And I don't understand what happened to the children.I believe this could have been a film with more depth, if it hadn't been for all the gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Birds","review":"Dead Birds should have been entitled, Dead Ducks! It wasn't the actors, it was the plot! Something (skinned dog manufactured out of spent gum?) attacks the 5 people heading for the old farm and they are forced to kill it before they even get close. Hmmmm, not too promising in my book! Nevertheless, the group continues to the old farm and spend lots of time wandering around the interior (neat old house!) There is also the subplot of the original owner who turned his children into little sneaky things with sharp teeth via cutting up his slaves. Of course, we don't really know why he did this or for what purpose. The kids only show up two or three times to scare someone and their moment of glory is so fast you have to stop frame them to get the full effect. In spite of the feelings of unrest and the fact that characters regularly walk out of the house and disappear, the group continues to stay. Personally, I would have kept walking on down the road after the gumby dog showed up; go figure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I've Recently Seen","review":"It boggles my mind how in other reviews this movie was praised. It was possibly the worst movie I've seen in quite some time. (Saying alot since I watch a ton of movies) The whole premise to me was ridiculous. Confederate soldiers after robbing a bank go to a haunted old mansion and systematically get picked off one by one. Besides the time period, the rest of the movie was completely unoriginal. It featured a creepy little boy a la The Grudge, a creepy little girl and a well a la The Ring, and a scarecrow a la Jeepers Creepers. The shooting of the movie was unique and featured wide angled, deep shots however it didn't really add anything to the movie. Overall I wouldn't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak!","review":"Boring the script was very dry it could have been so much more but it was complete crap if you want to see this movie rent it from redbox do NOT buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible film from start to finish","review":"When I bought this movie, I at least hoped for good actors. Good actors will make any movie, however bad, worthwhile. Then after the first five minutes I started to hope for good cinematography. When neither of those hopes came true, I laid my last hope on a good story line with scary monsters. The cover at least promised that. Needless to say this movie was a bomb through and through. The actors are hams, the flow of the script is monotonous, and scary monsters were in very short supply. I want my two hours back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very predictable movie","review":"********* Spoiler Alert **********The only scary scene I found in \\"Dead Birds,\\" (the title of this movie truly does not make ANY sense) is when Isaiah Washington's character finds a woman pinned down to the basement floor in this farmhouse. The woman in this scene gives a truly terrifying performance (her fear was very convincing). Other than that, the plot was predictable.

First of all, the title does not make sense for this movie. It is set in the 1800's which made it boring for me right from the beginning. The movie is about a group of bank robbers who hide out in a abandoned house. It is more of a western type movie than horror movie. The only good part of the movie was when the ghostly images appear but their faces remind me of the rediculous face of the killer in the Scream movies. There are supposidly souls and spirits trapped in the home but don't get prepared to be scared. This is not a scary film. I don't recommend anyone buying it. If you are curious, just rent it and save yourself money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dead birds? dead slow, dead plot","review":"This movie starts off very promising and goes nowhere fast (actually it goes nowhere quite slow). A group of confederate soldiers rob a bank and hole up in a farmhouse for the night. So far so good.Now, we are treated to a very very slow buildup that goes nowhere. Lots of atomosphere but no substance. And the last half of the movie makes no sense. Demon children that hide under the bed, a dead wife that is never explained, and what looks like a werewolf (where did he come from?), and a man vanishing into smoke make for one totally incomprehensible ending. And let's not forget the title of the movie which also makes no sense. What a waste of such a good start to a flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!!","review":"Just watched this as a rental: This movie was so slow and awful, I fell asleep!

I guess I like a little continuity with my \\"period\\" movies... And not a single character had any accent at all!The \\"scares\\" were pretty run of the mill and almost none existant.I felt the acting was fairly wooden and stodgy.When you start to critisize a movie within the first 5 minutes of the opening, you know it's going to be a long run of boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way South Of Dixie...","review":"A band of confederate soldiers, led by Henry Thomas, rob a bank, killing everyone inside and out, and head for a plantation-home hide-out.

It's nice to see that it's still possible to write an original horror movie, instead of remaking one or \\"borrowing\\" nearly whole-cloth from existing ones.The best part, however, is that the creepy atmosphere was masterfully done, and didn't waver during any part of the movie. Most supposed horror movies fall flat in this regard, unfortunately.My sole criticism is that there are deleted scenes in the movie that should have been left in the film. They make the ending more sensical, which should be a priority over film length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Birds","review":"If you like scary this is for you!!!

At least for me it captured a consistent, chilling sense of impending horror - like some unknown stalker that keeps creeping closer and closer but remains just out of sight. The writers and directors were inspired by J-Horror and hence didn't feel a need to over-explain the plot like most bigger budget Hollywood horror films seeking a wider appeal have to do.My only disappointment were the few instances where the chosen special effects were incongruous with anything in the plot. Its like the director thought a certain effect would look cool and just did it, no matter what the story was.No spoilers as the film is more than worth watching but you'll know that I mean if you see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You All Serious???","review":"I'm a fan of all types of horror films, so my opinions regarding this movie are not based on dislike of the genre. 4.5 stars overall for this???

I bought it based on the reviews, and because I'm always on the lookout for a good biography. I hit the jackpot on this one. Lee Server's portrait of Mitchum left me feeling I knew him intimately. I found myself laughing out loud many times on the train to work at Mitchum's hilarious comments on the absurd world of show biz. Server interviewed zillions of people who knew Mitchum to draw a consistent and thoroughly convincing portrait of a man who was both sensitive and caring, and obnoxious - even dangerous - when he boozed it up, which was most of the time, it seems. Anyway, I can only say this ranks as probably the most entertaining biography I have ever read ... it ranks right up there with Scott Berg's biographies of Lindbergh and Hemmingway."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Guy...","review":"Robert Mitchum's life was making movies, making women, boozing it up and smoking dope. He was very laid back, a poet, a singer and extremely intelligent. He was a man of many facets. This book chronicles it all and is truly very interesting in the insight given of the man none of us really knew. The one thing that intrigued me was his 3 year affair with Shirley MacLaine during and after they made the film \\"The Apartment.\\" For reasons he never devulged, he would not leave his wife Dorothy to marry Shirley although it is intimated that he wanted to. I recommend buying this book if you are a fan of Robert Mitchum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Absolutely Horrible","review":"This is a terrible book. The author does a terrible job of making anything about Robert Mitchum's life seem interesting or worth reading. And whoever edited this book should immediately be fired. For instance, Eglin Air Force Base near Pensacola, FL is not spelled \\"Egland\\" - I know because I was born there. There are many other errors of this kind throughout the book (for instance when the author calls Mitchum's son \\"Josh\\" instead of \\"Jim\\") that totally detract from the readibility and smoothness and veracity of the book. And it's one boring page after another of movie details that have no releveance to Mitchum's life. Check it out from the library if you must read it but definitly DON\\"T BUY IT! Better yet, just go rent some of his movies - you'll see that Robert Mitchum truly was one of the greatest actors of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"pjpp....A real Disappointment!!!","review":"I did not bother to purchase this book as I had seen previews when it first arrived. A lot of fans from around the world visit my Web Site and made it clear that they were surprised at what this author had written!! It is one thing to not like the star and write negative articles, but to put his family down is quite another story. Mitch was married 57 years to his childhood sweetheart. As for his mother.. she was a very talented hard working woman and raised her own children. It was quite clear to me that this author did not know Mitch or any real facts about him. He lived in our state for over 10 years with his family and raised quarter horses. He wanted the privacy for himself and his children.

By phone I asked to buy a replacement port from Emachine, they refused to provide it. They said they would only offer to repair it for 40% of the purchase price of a unit, which worked correctly for at the most six months. I simple want a power port replacement for my laptop, which has been inoperable for almost six months. Emachines is a company, which chooses to negligent it's obligation to support its product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underpowered","review":"First impression is important for anything, and mine with the M5305 is not positive at all. The unit arrived with two production defects, one more serious (three bad pixels on the screen) and one minor (media drive doesn't fit exactly). The performance is very bad... I've seen a Fujitsu running the same processor and it was fast, but not the M5305. The video performance is also terrible. The combo drive is noisy, making one feel uncomfortable using it on the road. Travel weight is a little over eight pounds, so it's heavy! And the styling is quite ugly, too. There's a reason why emachines chose the angle for the product shot on their website... and did you notice they have very little specs info? This is one under-equipped machine. The widescreen is pretty much useless in 99% of your computing day. In sumary, South Korean PC maker Emachines must do more to make decent and reliable products... much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disappointed","review":"I bought the product and the colours are beautiful and it arrived speedily, but boy are the packets small!

It has people with white skin, and brown skin, and dark brown skin. Such a special diverse cake!! And look at the colors used; according to the box the colors are light brown, dark brown, pink (skin tone), and black. Wait! Pink is the only one that is \\"skin tone\\"? Didn't they use 3 of the 4 colors to make SKIN tones? If the needed to describe the shade of pink why couldn't they say \\"peach\\" or \\"light pink\\" or something similar to that. Why make pink stand out as the only one that is \\"skin tone.\\"It doesn't matter how good this product is, I cannot use it until the packaging is no longer (probably unintentionally) offensive and racist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but ...","review":"I purchased several packs of this last Thanksgiving to decorate a Pumpkin cheesecake and it was fun to work with cuz it's like clay but edible. What I didn't like was that once placed on the cheesecake it started melting and this cheesecake was cold outta the fridge but the fondant started melting and the colors turned to liquid ruining my cheesecake. Just stick with icing or plastic cake decorations that ruining your baked items with this fondant. But it can be used alone as a edible clay for kids. :P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for anyone who likes protein or low-cost menus","review":"The book was informative and is based on scientific fact. However, the time to make and acquire the ingredients are time consuming, especially if you live in any small rural community. Only the wealthy can afford to have \\"Dakota\\" beef shipped to their home. It is extremely expensive.The diet is vegetarian based, if you aren't already a vegetarian, you probably will not like it. In addition, the recipes I tried were not tasty at all and we didn't enjoy the meals.The Sugar Busters Diet proved to be much better and we were both highly successful with it.Several friends have also tried both diets and found the recipes in Sugar Busters to be highly superior. It is no wonder as Sugar Busters was written by a group of physicians from New Orleans, the food capitol.

I used to eat fast foods and bakery and everything that was wrong. Stay away from the fat and eat the oat bran and fish and olive oil and turkey and chicken breast and everything spelled out in the book and the cholesterol will come down.

This series has elements of everything: romance, fantasy, a daring but compassionate heroine, the monstrous but kind-hearted companion, the quiet and mysterious and perhaps more monstrous other companion. I was hooked... and as long as these books are, it is quite a feat to be hooked for thousands of pages!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too dues ex machina for my tastes.","review":"It's an interesting concept, but too many things are just too coincidental to be entirely believable. Also, Rhapsody's extreme humility is annoying beyond belief, the characters take forever to figure out what was obvious to me, and the end was mostly predictable.That said, I did finish the series, mainly because I hate leaving stories unfinished (even when they're not to my liking).I certainly have no plans of ever buying the follow up, Requiem for the Sun, nor would I borrow it from a library to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these books! Haydon is brilliant!","review":"I love these books. I have already read the first five and I am re-reading them now before I get the Assassin King. I have bought them for many of my friends which says a lot about how good they are. I love the characters and ideas behind them, as well as the plot development. Haydon has an incredible imagination and a beautiful way with words. These books are a wonderful way to take your mind off your life and work before bed, during study breaks or even just when you have some extra time. The further into them you get the harder they are to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time and Money","review":"I was on the lookout for a new series and I came across this one. Some people loved it, some people bashed it, and I made the mistake of buying it. I will say I read the whole stupid series thinking it may redeem itself eventually...instead, it got worse. By the middle of the first book, I hated Rhapsody in all her impossible perfection and self-righteousness. As far as characters go, Rhapsody was ridiculous...not to mention her boyfriend, who had to be the most unmanly male love interest I've ever read. Yes, I read fantasy to escape reality (I think a lot of us do) but I don't read fantasy to be bombarded with mush. I can appreciate a splash of romance as much as anyone, but this was just plain dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT EURO-POP.

We have been using INDIA TREE natural food coloring for years. Although the results are frosting colors much lighter then grocery store food dye.....the kids are happy and so are we. The other day i ordered the INDIA TREE \\"Emerald City Green\\" sparkling sugar to make pretty treats for St.Paddy's Day. The package arrived today and i could not be more shocked/upset. They use Blue#1 and yellow #5 in this product.

I'm so angry and very dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for kids learning to swim","review":"This swim sweater is a great product. It allows your child to still propel themselves forward to swim but gives them security with the inner tube float. It is very well made and I think does an excellent job at providing just the right amount of security for a child learning to swim. I look forward to both my 2 year old toddler and baby (eventually) getting use out of it for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has made our summer so much better!!!","review":"Our daughter is 2 1/2 and a VERY cautious personality. She has enjoyed the pool from the steps and will occasionally take a quick trip in our arms around the water. Not now. . she loves her swim sweater. It took about 5 minutes to convince her she wouldn't tip over (the reason we went with this option, even though some other products are supposed to be better to prepare your toddler to swim). She loves it! She can swim the length of the pool without holding onto us. Of course we stay close by, but she loves her new independence.When we get out the pool, she says \\"thank you swim sweater, see you tomorrow!\\" So cute and really makes our time in the pool more fun for everyone! I can't say how great this product is. There is no problem with her slipping out of it at all - it fits very snug on her. A little tip - it does work better to have your child step into it rather than try to put it over their head/shoulders."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE!","review":"My 3 year old is afraid of pools. She went in the pool with me and within 10 minutes or so let go of my hand and floated around on her own. Since then, she doesn't want anyone's help getting in the pool and floats all around - it has really boost her water confidence! I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Funny and original, this book is one of my favorites. True, some of the stories are \\"well-worn\\" but they are told in such a way that it seems fresh and new. I recommend this book 100%."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality camping stove","review":"The idea behind this propane stove and grill is fantastic. You have a regular burner, and a small grill at the same time. The execution, however, leaves a lot to be desired.Fit and finish in this product are extremely poor. Out of the box, paint was flaking, and various pieces required adjustments with pliers just to make them fit. The igniter mechanism on my unit worked very well for the grill part but very badly for the burner part.The grill plate is aluminum with some kind of coating that already had scratches when I received the unit.Reading other reviews I can't help but wonder if there are two different grills sold under the same stock keeping unit number: the bad kind and the good kind. If so unfortunately mine is of the bad variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camping Grill","review":"After reading the poor review of this grill, I knew that it wasn't how they all were. I bought this for camping this summer and it performed very well. We cooked steak, hot dogs and hamburgers, and egg sandwiches and coffee in the morning. The only complaint that I have is that, there really isn't a low setting on the stove. There is either high or higher! Overall though, great grill, would definately recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective, poorly made, potentially unsafe product","review":"It is unfortunate to have to write such a review, but the product received was so beyond unacceptable that I am compelled to do so. The unit was received new, but the hinges were already rusted, the closure hasp broken (poorly designed and executed), the grille had sloppily attached and bent locating pins and virtually all the lid edges were razor sharp. Made in China, this stove demonstrates no attention to detail, quality control or materials. I own several other brands of camping stoves and am dismayed that this unit was ever allowed out of the factory, much less, off the design table. Further, the design of the unit is poor and execution is extremely poor, if not downright unacceptable (in major ways). As this unit was new in the box, I can only assume that it represents the low level of quality and lack of respect the US manufacturer has for customers. Save yourself cut hands and returns, buy another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor design!","review":"I had a lot of fun with this stove while it lasted but it did not last long -- about six months! I live on a sailboat and I used it every day; maybe someone who goes camping once a year will have a better experience. The burner did not simmer well (the flame kept creeping back up) but the grill worked great until the stove itself died. It seems to have a design flaw -- the regulator has an unusually narrow diameter tube and the propane tubes inside the stove are flimsy and wobbly. I called Century and they said this is the way the stove is supposed to be. Hmmmm. I did not think it would last long but I liked it so much that when it died I tried out another one. This one was immediately defective and I took it back. Neither Century nor Coleman seems to make a tough propane stove any more. Camp Chef may be a better, though much more expensive, choice for a person who does a lot of camping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother..","review":"True, it's easy to install and use. But, without the ability to add grids (like feet, inches, etc.) it's useless. Very limited functionality in selecting and modifying selections (i.e. can insert a tree but the description remains, you can't remove it). Non-standand in terms of Windows, like right click on an object and expect to edit the properties, forget it. House designs, deck designs, etc. limited in color and type. It's cheap, but still not worth the price. I'll be doing my planning on graph paper instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"As the previous reviewer stated, it doesn't seem possible to specify any kind of dimensions with your drawings. I bought this software for the purpose of designing the landscaping in my back yard. I measured my house and my fencing but there's no place to put these measurements in the software. This renders it basically useless for all but the most simplistic or rough designs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good But Not Great","review":"This book started off well and captured my attention from the start but failed to engage me all the way through to the end. The characters were colorful but undeveloped and there were many characters introduced but never fully fleshed out.Bailey and Louisa fall in love but why? Jon and Peter are happy but why? Eve and Max continue their relationship but why? The relationship problems are dwelled upon but the resolutions come almost as an afterthought. Sometimes the resolutions just appear, without any discussion.The characters in this book don't really have any serious problems and everything seems to sort itself out. The conflicts are few and amiable and do not feel like real life. The happy ending is of course expected because nothing really bad happens to these people and only confirmed my view that this book was good but not great. An enjoyable read but nothing I will recommend or remember in a few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing","review":"As a native Washingtonian, I was drawn to the book by the title. About 50 pages into the book, I kept waiting for the plot to make some interesting twists and turns. The relationship between Bailey and Louisa was predictable and needless to say, the book didn't \\"wow\\" me. I guess I had different expectations. I enjoyed the references to local restaurants, bars, bookstores, etc., but found that the lack of character depth and compelling story lines left me feeling uninspired and bored. Leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polished novel without gay passion","review":"Kafka-Gibbons's second novel is a gem. What a writer! Some passages are so exquisite, written with such poignance, that I had to stop reading and let the emotions subside. There are also some virtuoso performances, such as when a character carries on a conversation with adults while managing an importunate child, a scene that conveys the controlled chaos of parenting any father would recognize. The obvious skill and passion in this novel make the gay characters all the more disappointing. They are convincing as parents but devoid of any sexuality. It's not that the author doesn't know or can't convey eroticism. The May-September romance is powerfully sexual, but the author is trapped in a heterosexual imagination -- one that does justice to the politics of gay families without reaching the depths of same-sex desire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a written version of a bad sappy movie","review":"This was just a really, really bad book. Sappy, predictable, lacking any depth or art. I bought it because I lived near Dupont Circle one summer, but I think sitting on the circle watching the grass grow would be a more productive use of time than reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent mystic folk","review":"this is one of my favorite albums of the incredible string band. brilliant lyrics, especially in painting box. way back in the 1960s makes you wish you could go back to that time. the album's a bit odd the first time you listen to it, but eventually you'll get used to it and love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"It's a surprise others have been so generous towards this book. Usually, I'm the one to be positive when a book has let me down but I honestly can't recommend this. The story is marketed as a 9 1/2 week thriller but it missed it's marked.The first mistake is noted in other reviews...poor character development. Jake's character is tolerable if Mimi's wasn't so weak. You never get the feeling as to what makes her tick or motivates her to the voyeristic behavior she increasingly displays. Just when you think the book could salvage itself (by having Jake & Mimi get together and finding out the results) it doesn't happen. The ending was such a yawner that I barely registered the words. By that point, I just wanted to finish the book.I don't like wasting my time and money to be disappointed when it could have been so promising."},{"rating":"1","title":"luckily i didn't pay money for this book--","review":"I obtained an advance copy of this book a few months ago, and read it because it sounded like an engaging, trashy novel. Well, it's not very engaging...the female characters are all gorgeous bodies for Jake to manipulate, and the sex scenes are overblown and not really believable...as is the dutiful explanation of why Jake treats women the way he does. Mimi is a boring, stereotyped character--hesitant about marrying her fiance because the sex isn't so great...thus begins the voyeuristic relationship Mimi and Jake that somehow isn't very believable. And the mystery stalker that is watching Mimi just seems to be a diversion so the novel can actually go somewhere. This book is better as a TV script for Ally McBeal or something..."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"9-1/2 Weeks\\" in a book","review":"This book is horrible. I must admit i only got 1/2 way thru, and HAD to quit reading it, it is so bad. It is a like the movie 9-1/2 weeks, but instead of 1 Kim Basinger character, there are many. So, it is about the many conquests of this one guy. But it is so fantastical and the women are so weak and stupid, it is agonizing. There are SO many other quality books out there, don't even bother w/ this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?! THAT'S IT?!???","review":"The title of of my review was basically my reaction when I flipped the last page only to find out that it REALLY was the end. So what happens between Jake and Mimi? I suppose the story leads you to believe that they \\"end\\" up together but the ending doesn't give much of an indication. I'm just glad I didn't have to spend $$$ to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot! Hot!! Hot!!!","review":"This is one of the sexiest thrillers I've ever read. The sex scenes are so vivid that I felt like a peeping tom just reading them. But the book is way more than that to me. I found both Jake and Mimi to be very compelling and believable characters. I think every woman will identify with Mimi's struggle between marrying the man who offers her security vs pursuing her attraction with the dangerously seductive Jake. After I'm finished writing this, I'm going to get my search engine roaring to hunt down Frank Baldwin's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of more coherent works cover this material","review":"While this book might have been a useful resource during the nascent self-help field of the 50's at this point it is regressive garbage. I read this book several years ago while in college when it was given to me and I was exploring several other self-help books that don't require you to learn a new dianetics dictionary to understand the concepts. If Amazon existed in the the 50's I would have given the book three or four stars but for today with thousands of better written, more coherent books available there is no point in wasting your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a leader for Scientology","review":"Hubbard claimed he could make a person \\"clear\\" using this technology but then failed to ever produce someone who could demonstrate they were \\"clear\\".

Now don't say that I didn't read it correctly. The first page of the book tells you to look up any words you don't understand. I followed that rule. The words make sense; the sentences, paragraphs, and ideas don't make any sense whatsoever. I was told this was a self help book.

The key elements of Hubbard's so-called science don't seem testable, yet he repeatedly claims that he is asserting only scientific facts and data from many experiments.

What began as a third-rate self help guide written by a hack science fiction novelist has turned into a diatribe against common sense.'Dianetics' has been described as the ultimate self-help guide, in fact nothing could be further from the truth. In reality, 'Dianetics' was written by an author of pulp science fiction who believed he could transform his arcane theories into a workable religion. What L Ron Hubbard never truly realized before his demise in 1986 is that he had succeeded beyond his wildest expectations. The minions of $cientology have infiltrated all walks of society, thanks to the gibberish which graces the pages of 'Dianetics'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Rubbish","review":"Don't buy this junk, filled with trash that won't do you any good.

In order to understand my euphory about this book you have to know that I've spent my whole 47 years on the Bauernhof (farm with pigs and cattle and fish and swine), I only ate bratwurst all the time, and that I never before got the chance to read something sooo amazing like \\"Dianetics\\".

I highly recommend this audio version.Try it yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DOUBLE WHAMMY!","review":"I've read the book, DIANETICS: MODERN SCIENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH in the past and found it absolutely amazing. The later edition with glossary made the read even easier.But, to be able to sit back and listen to this very fine presentation reading of the book was just icing on the cake.It was wonderful!I think the combination of both visual and audio really increased my understanding of the materials as I read along with the dvds. You don't have to do it this way - you can just listen, of course.These three dvds cover a really incredible body of data about the mind. It ends up being so simple, though the search for it was rife with traps. I don't see how Mr. Hubbard figured it out.I know I would not have gotten there from here without falling on my face!Whether you are a Dianeticist from the 1950's (or 60's or 70's or 80's) or someone interested in self-improvement, you don't want to miss this one.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good sound quality for an audiobook","review":"When I was reading the paperback version, sometimes I would listen to the audiobook at the same time. It is very well paced (the speed of the person's reading), and the audio was very clear. Whoever they chose for the recording of this book was very good, and the benefit of listening to the audio is is helps pull you through the book at a nice pace. Definitely worth getting if you do a lot of driving or just prefer audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why read this book?","review":"I thought the book was very hard too read, for the author had a very high vocabulary. However, after receiving the \\"auditing\\" for ONLY twelve hours my life completely changed for the better! My IQ rose higher, i felt happier and even more attractive. When before i had a hard time confronting people and handling situations i am now am able to be better in life. If you have a high vocabulary or are willing to look up many words i recommend it. This is no ordinary book! L.Ron Hubbard sure did his research well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not fiction","review":"The audio was to the note. It was read like a storybook.

Very dynamic information - definitely worth the read for the seekers in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why people have weird impulses is not so mysterious now.","review":"After reading this book I could understand why people acted horribly, hurtful and stupidly. I realised there was something that came in and tangled thoughts and teared apart reason. I also realised that the people's whose thoughts were being tangled didn't know why. Dianetics sheds lots of light on why you have weird unexplained feelings of doubt and depression and fear. Although this is a serious topic, the mind, the author writes in a simple, clear way. He's quite funny in places and he certainly answered a lot of questions that were hovering in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but judge for yourself by reading it...","review":"I read Dianetics several years ago and when i was in NYC, I ran into a \\"Free Stress Test\\" booth which was not only giving out free stress tests but was selling many of Mr. Hubbards works. One of which was Dianetics. And I purchased the book just to lend my support.I implemted the Dianetics therapy from the book, and after an hour, I felt loose and happy, and a lot of stress for the day was gone. It then hit me, that there was finally something that did me some good.[...]So to conclude this review, ill say this: you may question the books upbringing but judge for yourself for as Ron would say \\"whats true for you is what you have observed for yourself\\". As a recommendation,yes I highly reccomend it, especially if your going through a rough time. And finally, look out if your in NYC for the stress test booths. You just might get your hands on Dianetics-its worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave the beaten track","review":"Dianetics is not a complicated book, but I'm not surprised some readers don't really get it at first. The field of the mind and mental health has been stuck in a rut of failure after failure. I have seen more people ruined by faulty mental health practices than helped. If you're looking for the standard \\"cures\\" like turning people into prozac zombies, you won't find it in Dianetics.Once you get into the book and realize that it is a new science all in itself, off the beaten path -- that it's not \\"like\\" any other science, then it makes sense.Remember the story of Alexander Graham Bell -- when he invented the telephone, everyone laughed? Perhaps like the telephone, Dianetics is a discovery ahead of its time.Alexander Graham Bell said:\\"Leave the beaten track occasionally and dive into the woods. Every time you do so you will be certain to find something that you have never seen before.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets of the mind revealed!","review":"Dianetics, The Modern Science of Mental has been a continual best-seller since its release in 1950 with good reason.

I've heard a lot of things secondhand, but I wanted to make my mind up for myself. The book is fairly interesting, but his writing style really lacks the structure and clarity you'd want in a book that often times is very technical. He rambles on a bit too much in places as well.

Our society is in a bad state of affairs with drug addiction, crime and divorce at record highs. A book like Dianetics is a blessing only because it puts the individual in a postion to change their undesirable behavior.

I had to come right out and say it. Children cover your eyes and ears. I never imagined there would be such a thing as an abortion fetish, but there it was. Every other page of Dianetics is either a case history of an attempted abortion (people remember what happened even when they were zygotes in Hubbard land) or a pregnant mother being unfaithful or beaten up or both( I repeat: people remember things from the moment the sperm finds the egg)...and they founded a religion on it! I have to admit, I only read the first 2/3, but the pattern was there: Attempted abortion, over and over and over. I couldn't do it-I couldn't keep reading this book. I understand that this was written before Roe v Wade, and such things did happen, but not on every other page.

I read it once when I was young, and again recently. I still cannot find anything worthwhile here, not even in the sexy bits.

It claims that if it's techniques are applied brutality will never again be needed to regulate human affairs, and mitigates specifically against operations upon the human brain which was widely used by psychiatry at the time of its publication and electrocution of the human brain which, sadly, is still widely used. Unsurprisingly it is a fairly hard study, but if you want to change the world that's exactly what you should expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps you understand what you're all about","review":"I read this book many years ago and have since re-read it.

It has changed my life tremendously by allowing me to get rid of those unwanted, irrational aspects of myself that prevented me from achieving my full potential of happiness.There *are* answers, and they are not difficult to understand. Dianetics explains the different parts of the mind, how they affect you, and how you can rid yourself of upsetting and painful experiences in your past and become more able and happy.Dianetics is a hefty read, but it's well worth the effort. Anyone can find useful information in this book and immediately begin to use it to change life for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective and Workable Procedures","review":"As an engineer I read this book with a fairly keen interest in the application of Hubbard's findings. I've read many, many other books on 'self-improvement' over the years which seemed to have weaknesses when it came to actually applying and getting a result. Many other books I've read appear to work for some people but not all people. As an engineer I was more interested in finding self-improvement procedures that were universally successful. The techniques in this book are amazingly powerful, and as a test I practiced these techniques on others and found that they obtained consistent improvement. As a final note, these reviews are just talk (good and bad) and the test is really in the seeing it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I should have read this a long time ago!","review":"This is the most thorough book on the mind today! When you read this book, you will know that you are reading truth and you will gain so much understanding about yourself and others! This book really gets at what is causing insecurity, self-doubt, jealousy, and other emotions that are holding people back in life. This book gives you the answers to get rid of what is causing pain, upset, and preventing you from achieving your true goals. It is the only self-help book that addresses the actual cause and gives you a way to get rid of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has the answers","review":"Reading this book was a revelation. So many questions about my own past, about why I react the way I do and why others act and react as they do were answered.

They were talking about topics like managing mental and emotional stress, and how to feel better emotionally and psychologically.

Some people are simply not used to getting that involved ; but If you are serious about improving yourself , you will be amazed by the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolutionary.","review":"The book has to be read to truly do it justice. I believe one does not really believe anything until he, or she, sees it for himself. This book makes current mental practices, psychiatry and psychology, look like ............ barbarism!I did not read all of the 3rd part of the book that gets into the fine procedural details (who needs to study surgical procedure to know that surgery works?) but soon after I read the book I saw a Dianetic practitioner and the truth in the text that I read was borne out. This stuff like the bomb!Why does the current mental health establishment feel so threatened by something that will really make a difference in a world in so much need of a change for the spirit of Man! Could it be that there really is such a thing as a spirit? And psychiatry and psychology have chosen to overlook, and COMPLETELY neglect it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not for me I guess.","review":"I tried to read this book in college for a report on self help books. I had enjoyed some of L. Ron Hubbard's science fiction, especially Battlefield Earth (much, much better than the movie) so I thought that this would be a good fit for me. Unfortunately I just couldn't stand it. It was so dull and it is now one of the few books that I have started, but that I had absolutely no interest in finishing. This means a lot considering I managed to slog through the entire \\"Mission Earth\\" series that he wrote which is full of deviant sexual behavior (including torture and pedophilia, really why ruin a perfectly good sci-fi story with all that?). So I thought it was just plain bad. More \\"Mission Earth\\" than \\"Battlefield Earth\\".

Hubbard assumes the reader will believe what he says is true just because he says it's science and has been verified experimentally. He provides no proof or documentation of these claims. If you want a good laugh and have any experience with science or engineering, check this book out from the library. It's not worth buying.Also, check out the Complex by John Duignan, it gives an excellent account of what it's like to be in scientology's sea org."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this book was labeled as Science FICTION, I would love to give a 5","review":"Well after reading about this book and Dianetics and what the scientfic and freethinking community had to say, I'd say that this is an awful piece of pseudoscience that nobody with a Ph.D or a decent education in general would agree with.However, L.

It would have made an excellent science fiction book, and I would personally participate in the rewriting, since L. Ron Hubbard is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Science Fiction","review":"This is one of the worst science fiction books I have read. In fact, if it wasn't written by the renowned science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, I wouldn't have pegged this book for science fiction at all. Almost seems like Hubbard was trying to write something more along the lines of a philosophical or religious text. I guess his mind went off on a tangent. Oh well.

This book rambles on for far too long in many places, introduces concepts out-of-step with their field in a brash manner that is not thoughtful, and does not sufficiently refute its interlocutors. It is also hard to tell how seriously the author himself takes these theses in the course of his writing. As a piece of rhetoric, self-help, or literature, this is a failure. Also, I can only speculate on why there is a bursting volcano on the cover; this makes the book less credible and more sensational in my opinion.-JAK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptively appealing to non-critical thinkers","review":"I read this when I was young, before I had a real capacity for critical thought, and found it deceptively engaging in a rebellious \\"anti-establishment\\" kind of way.

Therapists no longer use such methods as repeated regression because they can retraumatize a client, especially those with moderate to severe PTSD.

After I bought this book I went into a Scientology organization and got on a home study extension course. I recommend it because it paces your reading with key questions you fill out and mail in.

Unfortunately, you get what you pay for in this case.The stylus will 9 times out of 10 bring up the letter next to the one you are trying to use, the phone book is set up weird, the appointments/memos start in date order and the format of them are odd. There's not much room to write. You constantly need to switch between numbers and letter keyboards and it just gets to be a pain by the end of entering 1 contact or appointment. The translater is a little hard to use - sometimes it won't bring up words or it will bring up a completely different word that has those letters in it.

It ended up costing $350 to fix it. I'm still not convinced that repairing it was the right move, but that's what we did. Maybe I just expect too much from these modern day electronics.

Namco Museum 64 features 6 games: Pac-Man, Ms-Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaxian, Galaga, and Pole Position. These games all came out in the arcades in the 1980's. I remember pumping quarters into these games when they first came out in the arcades. All of the games are pretty straight forward. Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man focuses on a yellow circle (with a mouth) that eats pellets. 4 different colored ghosts chase after you in a maze. Galaga and Galaxian are basically Space Invader clones. You are a ship shooting invaders down. Dig Dug is sort of a Mr. Do clone. Your a person in a garden destroying monsters with a pump. Finally, Pole Position is a F-1 racer. Your car does a qualifying race, then onto the main race.Overall, this a great game for me!

Individuals 25 years and older will remember these games well. For those individuals who are younger than 25, Namco Museum provides an opportunity to play some of the classic videogames that started the whole video game frenzy. Namco Museum consists of 5 games. Ms. Pac-Man, Galaxian, Galaga, Dig Dug, and Pole Position. Ms. Pac-Man everyone knows about. Galaxian and Galaga are Space Invader type games, Dig Dug is a unique digging and destroying enemies game, and Pole Position is the classic arcade steering wheel racing game. All games are great fun for a quick pick up and play. The lack of a battery save feature for high scores (reasoning for 4 stars) is sort of a disappointment, but writing scores down is not that tedious of an ordeal.

I found this book terribly confusing with the story jumping around between past and present and the assortment of characters. I thought that the character of Charlie Taft was very undeveloped and that he should develop a \\"passion\\" for the dead Imogene rather laughable. I could not understand why people had such sympathy for George Remus and was disappointed by the ending. Any book that I start, I force myself to finish. Many times I'm surprised halfway through. But I now wish I had bailed out on this book after a couple of chapters. It wasn't worth the time. I read in Holden's notes that he had two editors for this book. Perhaps that was a big part of the problem. This will certainly be my first and last Holden."},{"rating":"2","title":"his best, like, EVER!","review":"seriously, this is tom waits at his absolute best. it's very well-rounded. a perfect introduction to his work. this and bone machine. black rider is awesome too (although very kitschy). buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd","review":"This was really the first Tom Waits CD I ever bought and it's still my favorite in many way. It was practically the soundtrack to Jim Jarmusch'e 'Down By Law', which also starred Tom Waits. I like trhe tracks uniformly, though 'Cemetery polka\\" kind of stays with you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One song only","review":"This album deserves 5 stars for one song alone, Blind Love.

He has gone through so many it's easy to lose count. Weird yet beatufil album, hunting melodies and new sounds along with Tom's original formula.

This is the one to choose if you want to introduce Tom Waits for a newcomer. First time I heard music from the album was at a cinema, watching Jim Jarmush's magnificent \\"Down by Law\\". It goes without saying that film is a must see for fans of Tom Waits, not just because he has a prominent role in it, but because the atmosphere of the entire film fits the universe of Tom Waits like a glove. Seventeen years later, I never get tired of listening to \\"Rain Dogs\\". An album like this one is simply more than our sad world deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album changed my life","review":"After seeing Tom sing \\"Tango Till They're Sore\\" on David Letterman when I was 19, I rushed out to buy Rain Dogs the next day. I have listened to it more than any other single album that I own and never get tired of it. Now that I am older, with three kids, listening to the album is a completely different experience for me. It's evocative of that time in my life, when I could stay up drinking till 4 am and still show up for class at 8, but it's so much more. Poignant, profound, and moving as ever, this album will always be near and dear to my heart. I give it a 5 and this is the only review I've posted on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dang 'ol creepy carnival music!","review":"While I wait in agony for \\"Blood Money\\" & \\"Alice\\" to hit the stores in May, the best I can do is turn to the uncountable number of albums Tom Waits has already put out. Among the best of them is \\"Rain Dogs\\". Tom Waits, who has the voice of a 'Muppet' & a flair for genius as a writer, gives another top notch look at bottom-of-the-barrel characters. Right from the start of \\"Rain Dogs\\" we hear a blanket of jaunty tunes of all shapes, sizes, & colors. The title track is just one of the wonderful glimpses we get into Waits' world. Right from the 1st track, \\"Singapore\\", the listener gets to cavort & carouse & rabble-rouse alongside Waits' various nighthawks until the end. We even get to hear the original version of Rod Stewart's hit \\"Downtown Train\\". (Waits' version is better, duh!)I've never heard Tom Waits put out a bad album, but if you're looking for one of his best, \\"Rain Dogs\\" is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This is just such a fabulous album I don't even know what to say about it. Each song is a mini-masterpiece.The first time I heard Rain Dogs, in 1994, it was so different from everything I had ever heard, so weird, that I wanted to reject it and all of its fans as pretentious. Fool! Fool! If loving this album makes one a pretentious fop, then let me be chairman of the board of the pretentious fop club.No, this is just amazing stuff, an album that fills me with gratitude and wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 good songs","review":"I got this cds because I have read all kinds of good reviews and only liked the songs clap hands and jockey full of bourbon the rest I think is complete junk those of you who are fans of tom if any of his other albums sound like those two for the whole album please let me know because I loved those songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is music?","review":"Thank god this was a gift. A friend of mine gave me this album to introduce me to Tom Waits. I listened to it three times and I still don't get it. Yes, it's way out there, and that's enough for me to at least give it a chance. But there's almost no melody to speak of on most of the tracks, and Waits' voice is so deep and grating that sometimes you can't even tell what notes he's singing. What a joke. How did this guy get a recording contract? This album was absolutely painful to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"I really like Tom Waits, but this is just awful.

I can dance to this album all night long and all day too. Rain Dogs is oh so groovy and it can hold it's own in any record collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best O' Waits?","review":"It's incredibly tough to choose, but this is probably my favorite Waits disc. It combines some of the more out-there crazy sh-t, like Rain Dogs, with the more melodic ballad-y strain of his songwriting, songs like Hang Down Your Head and Downtown Train (great song, even if Mod Rod had a hit with it).Other highlights include Gun Street Girl, a story song that, although it doesn't follow a strictly linear path, adds up cumulative detail very powerfully and sends a powerful message. I'm not sure what it means or why, but I will never kiss any women that hail from any street called \\"Gun\\", and Walking Spanish (a phrase that actually means something, it's not just a \\"Waits-ism\\"...)...And let me not forget another pair of absolute stunner songs: Tango Till They're Sore and Jockey Full of Bourbon.It seems that a lot of the essential stuff from the Waits canon resides on this here LP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I truly do like Tom Waits","review":"But I think this album is extremely overrated. It just doesn't do much for me. Not too exiting. I dig BONE MACHINE and MULE VARIATIONS and I consider HEARTATTACK AND VINE to be quinessential Waits. But I'll only listen to \\"Downtown Train\\" and maybe one or two others before I've had it with this tedious album. Sorry if you'd prefer me to jump on the critical bandwagon, but it's my honest opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Waits Seminal Work","review":"Waits moves moves away from the California singer songwriter persona and creates instead the beginnings of what would become the Barking Maestro! On Rain Dogs he begins his interest in Eastern European ethnic music creating a whole new genre of music. Countless bands have been influenced by this incarnation including such well known bands as the The Pogues, Nick Cave or the much more obscure but worthwhile Raving Noah."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's more than incredible!","review":"If there ever was something that change my life.

If anybody had an impact onmy life Robin certainly did. For many years ago, in Copenhagen, I meet licorice in a park, I wasgoing the same evening to a concert with the I.S.B. And there I was..... together with Licorice.. what a thrill... Until this day I remember that day. And the concert was great. There was light everywere and I mean light,because wereever the ISB played, there was light. I love these persons I know that they loved me.

It would make a nice coffee table book for elves. Doesn't even have the heft of a quality book."},{"rating":"2","title":"(3.5 stars) Good but not as good as its bookends","review":"The closest thing to a mainstream album that Nick ever recorded. There's even a near-rocker (\\"Hazy Janey II\\"), albeit one in Nick's usual somber style. I actually don't think this is nearly as good as the previous record or the next one: a bunch of weak instrumentals (title track; \\"Sunday\\"; \\"Fly\\"), and \\"Poor Boy\\" is the closest to overproduced Drake gets. Regardless, there are several fantastic songs: \\"Hazy Janey II\\" and its psychedelic-folk counterpart, \\"Hazy Janey I\\"; \\"At the Chime of a City Clock\\", which is some good jazzy stuff; \\"One of Those Things First\\" is charming but slightly rambling; and \\"Northern Sky\\" is one of the most resonant pieces in Drake's catalogue, which is saying something. So it's slightly uneven, but the best songs make it very worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid album from one of folk music's more underrated artists","review":"For fans of Nick Drake, this CD belongs in your collection. In my opinion, it's not his best work (I prefer the more stripped-down tracks that are found on \\"Pink Moon\\") but it's a great and mellow acoustic album nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighter hater","review":"Steeper, breezier arrangements on BL compliments his other bare-bones melancholia, rarely smothering the elemental sadness and acoustic excellence prevalent in near everything Drake composed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryter Layter-Nick Drake","review":"The \\"taster' that was on the Garden State Soundtrack proved to be just an appetizer for the full meal provided by this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Drake's Astral Weeks","review":"It's a shame but I'm just listen to Drake's work by now, at 29. Here in Brazil we don't have these releases and the imported ones are the only solution for this \\"bossa-nova syndrome\\". This album has great and happy songs. Yes, happy songs. Drake sounds happy singing At The Chimes of City Clock and others. But the great charm here is the similarity with the most beautiful album ever made, Van Morrison's Astral Weeks. Horns, flutes, acoustic instruments and an haunting voice under service of wonderful compositions. There's no cut here (and on the others Nick's albums) less than perfect. Seems Nick had \\"the formula for the perfect songs that make souls more bryter\\". Since I've heard Pink Moon, Five Leaves Left and Bryter Later life has become a little more bryter than before. Thanks, Nick, wherever you are now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drake's lightest touch","review":"Drake's second outing has neither the dark edge of his first record \\"Five Leaves Left,\\" nor the brooding emptiness of his magnificent \\"Pink Moon,\\" but the ensemble does some complicated and interesting stuff all the same. John Cale's presence definitely felt, giving the album a funky classical and jazz feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"sophmore album, but probably his greatest achievment","review":"the soft fingerpicked guitar at the beginning of introduction just gets you into this masterwork of an album. nick draakes second album is considered to be his masterpiece, and rightfully so. it is definetly his most up beat album, but thats to nick drakes standards. the album is full of beautiful poetry, nicks humble fingerpicked guitar playing, lush instrumentation, and even horns. northern sky, fly, and hazey jane 1 are probably 3 of the greatest songs ever written by anyone. if you are new to nick, this should be the second album you pick up, after pink moon. but all three of his albums should be in everyones colection"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...I never held emotion in the palm of my hand...\\"","review":"I never held emotion in the palm of my hand - until I bought this album.

Nick Drake at his happiest - which is funny because most of his stuff is so depressing.While Pink Moon is my favorite, based on the sheer simplicity of the album, this one is great in its own right.

The lead singer has a vocal styling similar to Mick's, and Keith and Ronnie can clearly be heard in their guitar contributions. The band has a great, compact and tight sound which I liked immediately. The sound is very similar to the Stones material from their \\"Exile\\" era. I'm a big Stones fan, and new material just isn't coming...I would say it's not exactly like new Stones material, but clearly the next best thing. The songs and music are quite good. I'm giving this 5 stars, and would buy more material from this band. If you're a big Stones fan, I'd almost guarantee that you'll like this album. What is also appealing is, in my opinion, the fact that I do not get the impression that the band is trying to sound like the Stones (unlike the Black Crowes, for example). It's highly enjoyable music and I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the General-Books.net edition","review":"I didn't realize I was getting an edition which had been scanned by a robot and interpreted with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.

They were just suddenly together, and did not even seem to like one another that much. Hannah's story is just too depressing for words! I kept hoping that something would bring her some joy in this book, but there was nothing! Even the romance between Eliz & Nathanial seemed dull....like it was something that had to be included, but she really didn't want to put much effort into describing it.I guess I will re-read some sections of the book to see if I missed something.....I find it surprising that everyone else gave this book 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Sara Donati definitely has the knack to keep the reader \\"glued to the book\\".

While I've enjoyed all the editions I was dissappointed in this game overall. It only came with one pack of cards and several plastic dispensers so you could divide the cards by year. The idea is that you roll a 10 sided die to select the year your queston will relate to. We have played this game only four times with between two and four people and we have already run through all the cards and are getting repeat questions. I definitely wish it came with more cards, or at least the option to buy supplemental cards. Another thing...in the older editions if you got a question that you didn't know the answer to right off many times you could at least come to a pretty good \\"guess\\" by deductive reasoning.

I think that they should just sell the cards (2 boxes please...most games do consist of 2 teams, do they not?), charge about 20 bucks for them, and still continue to sell the entire set if you are new to the game.

I was highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Thought this would be like the standard Trivial Pursuit game with questions from the 90's.

In \\"Stiletto\\" there is much to like with a huge character cast of accomplished actors and Stana as the stunning protagonist. My reservation was the almost silly gore accompanying the violence. In my opinion I think this reduced the effectiveness of the script and acting as well as the market. Given the ranking of lower than 23,000, I'm guessing this is not one of the producer's finest moments...it could have been a wonderful opportunity to weave a complex story with great acting, but isn't. Enjoy Stana's on-screen moments, and fast-forward the rest. By the way, on a recent late-night talk show she pronounced her name STAH-nah KAH-tick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stana is stunning","review":"but the movie is more like a \\"straight to DVD\\" movie.

I don't want to tell you the story line (and I won't).This is a book to read out loud to anybody, but especially to children.

I don't normally like radio-oriented pop, but this album has excellent musicianship and the songs are incredibly enjoyable without giving your teeth a cavity. The first eight songs are delightful and even a little poignant. Even though I lean toward progressive rock and metal, I will definitely buy \\"The Feeling's\\" next CD, if only to get respite from the crunchy metal riffs that have caused permanent damage to my psyche.

This record is an example of this - great songs combined with songs that never seem to end - making it difficult even for a seasoned ISB-fan like me. In fact, only two songs seem to lift themselves out of this pool of sound, and the record starts off with them. Heron's songs \\"Black Jack Davy\\" and \\"The Letter\\" are among his finest songs, but in the songs that follow even Williamson must have lost track of what he was doing. \\"This Moment\\" sounds alright, but the album as a whole suffers greatly from a lack of direction and a tendency to hold on to a format which was so gracefully introduced on \\"Wee Tam & the Big Huge\\". In contrast, I must admit that this album seems to have a lot of the original and hard-to-define spirit left.

Like most of the books in the \\"Idiot's Guide\\" series, it's easy to follow and practical. So why do I rate it one star? Because in this case, clear and concise instructions are a negative. It's like a book that gives great instructions on how to become a drug addict. I strongly suggest taking time to consider the dangers of communicating with demonic spirits before taking this leap. It's actually very EASY to communicate with demonic spirits, even without instructions. They WANT to communicate with you, but you can bet it's not to help you in any way! No one dabbles in the occult and comes out of it for the better. I have to assume that most readers interested in this type of book are open-minded.

The precursors to modern Baptists who hold to dispensationalism were either holiness folks like A.J. Gordon, or radical sepratists like William B. Riley.

'Five Leaves left', 'Bryter Layter' and \\"Time of no reply' all have their weak points. 'Pink Moon' doesn't. It is, quite simply, one of the best album ever recorded and one of the most powerfull emotional documents in the history of popular music. So Stark and melancholly, yet so beautiful and charming.

What I must say, this is not for people who enjoy bubblegum hummable top 40 tunes; or most other people I'm sad to say. The songs are tuneless, melancholic droning without any distinct structure. Pink Moon is the only redeemable track. Nick Drake the 'tortured' genius the legend has become intertwine with his music so that its not his talent alone, but the sad story of his premature death which has carried this decidedly mediocre record.If you're into depressing music then Elliott Smith offers much more listenable fare. At least his songs have beautiful melody, harmonies, instrumentals.etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bore...","review":"this record is all myth, no songs. after having heard about it being \\"haunting\\" for so many years, I finally picked it up.

What a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mood That Passes through You","review":"Trying to describe Nick Drake's music is like trying to describe the taste of chocolate to someone who's never eaten it before. In the end, you just have to try it for yourself.In the film 'The Piano', Holly Hunter's character Ada plays the piano to express her emotions - curiosity, yearning, jubilation. Another character describes Ada's playing as 'a mood that passes through you'. The same could be said of 'Pink Moon'.Stark? Yes. Haunting? Yes. One of the most completely satisfying collections of music you'll ever hear? Absolutely. I love music. And I love books and movies. The one quality, in my mind, that separates a good movie or book or piece of music from the rest and makes it truly excellent is it's ability to create it's own world and draw you into it. It can transport you and make you forget your surroundings. 'Pink Moon' certain has that quality. If any music make you feel like you're sitting outside, or ambling along, enjoying a moonlit night, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"another 5 star review","review":"I'd really love to give a different rating, for Nick you can't. So few bands or musicians or artists of any description can maintain a consistency throughout a career, and though it's doubtful Nick would have never set a foot wrong were he alive today, what he would have done following this masterpiece is fascinating. For me this is his peak, though it is very hard to compare any album with another since they sound as though they were done by three very different versions of Nick. Recurring themes of seasons, time and nature link them, as do the mellow introspection that brings you back and back, but it sounds sometimes that they should have been reversed. This is the sparse one, the low-fi one, the one that launched a thousand bedroom troubadours to write painfully intense and obtuse songs for themselves. An utter classic that seems never to age."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tear on the sun","review":"Apparently, a lot of modern young musicians have looked to Nick Drake for inspiration. That sense of despair, that sense of loneliness, irrelevance, that kind of thing... Maybe that's one reason why they walk around like tramps, loud-mouthed and stupid. The search for individuality has surely drifted into the hands of ignorant swine.By Pink Moon stage, Nick Drake had drifted into isolation and heavy depression. But the sound of Pink Moon is not crushingly depressing nor is it tediously claustrophobic.The album has an overall quality of sound. Some bits are higher tempo and, so, more uplifting. The instrument playing is precise, like Drake's voice, carrying the listener over desolate hills and stillwater beaches. I can't really pick out the highlights because it's like taking the chicks away from the mother hen.Pink Moon is worth more than a listen. It deserves to be thought of as a beautiful, melancholic, classic on anybody's list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the despair?","review":"I bought this CD in the expectation of being blown away by melancholy grace. (No, I had not seen the Volkswagen commercial, but I had read reams of reviews and comments.) The album, in fact, is slight. The songs are not concise--they're simply short (and some are simply inchoate). And the melancholy is vague and unpersuasive. I will stick with Belle and Sebastian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boycott Volkswagon","review":"What a disgrace that such a passionate and powerful album would have one its songs bastardized by being used to sell a car.

It's introduced so many people (including me) to something wonderful. Pink Moon is 2 minutes long, but it is enough to hook right through you and pull you into Nick Drake's beautiful, albeit fragile and melancholy, world. \\"Which Will,\\" also a deep, quiet song, is probably his second best-known song for being covered by Lucinda Williams a few years back.I've yet to hear anybody blast Nick Drake for writing bad music, so that's good news for new fans. Although I like \\"Five Leaves Left\\" a bit better, this album is also essential to any music lover. \\"Things Behind The Sun,\\" for example, is equally brilliant. As is \\"Place to Be,\\" \\"Parasite,\\" ... ah, hell, they're all great. The real challenge would be to decide on which Nick Drake album is the best, not whether or not you should buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Drake - Pink Moon","review":"Pink Moon is the one of the most revealing folk/singer-songwriter records out there..which is odd, because the lyrics are impenetrably nonsensical. I think the reason Pink Moon is such an emotionally stirring record are Drake's melodies and the intimate recording style; as well, the strange guitar tunings provide the mystique necessary to buffer the lyrics' surrealist imagery. The magic of this album is in it's less-is-more approach that conveys Drake's mental state at the time. A fitting elegy for one of folk-rock's most talented, and troubled, songwriters."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly refreshing","review":"I just want to say that I took this CD up camping and it really set the mood. My buddies wanted to hear it over and over again! Real good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"25 Minutes To Heaven","review":"It's impossible listen to Pink Moon without tears in the eyes. Drake's would be dead months later and music would be in the listeners minds forever. But the sound made by that 25 years-old englishman with his words and single guitar remains stronger than poetry, than VW commercials (that I didn't and I won't see here in Brazil), than all the simple things. This disc is a statement of life and how big it can be, Drake is saying death is possible. And only someone who knew the life can say it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who does the song for the Audi commercial?","review":"This isn't a review since I just added this to my shopping cart today, but I'm willing to give it five stars so as not to detract from it's overall rating.

Sad story","review":"I first heard the last piece, \\"From the Morning\\" on the famous AT&T commercial with the pseudo-Christo orange drapes. I fell in love with the music and checked to find out more about this incredible artist. His life was way too short. He only released three albums in the early 70's before dying of a drug overdose at age 26. The music is thoughtful and sad with a haunting soul quality. This artist didn't live long enough to see his music appreciated. In his words, \\"It's beautiful!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Missed Him in My Youth","review":"I missed Nick Drake in my youth (I am in my late fifties). My youngest son who plays the guitar and has a very eclectic library played him for me. His melancholy, intricate, complex use of the acoustic guitar and simple lyrics (In particular, I like \\"Road\\".) moves me. My only compaint is that \\"Paracite\\" sounds like \\"Dear Prudence\\" by the Beatles. The collection of music in \\"Pink Moon\\" is by far my favorite because it showcases Drake's guitar and voice and is not over-produced. This is not the case in Bryter Layter. I was dissapointed in the song \\"Fly\\", which in its original version, highlites his very intricate guitar work. In the remixed version of Bryter Layter, it is lost in the production. I would very much like to hear \\"Way of Blue\\" released on CD, but not if it ends up like \\"Bryter Layter\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulously melancholic","review":"I discovered Nick Drake amongst my uncles vinyl collection back in the 80s. I fell in love immediately with his beautiful and subtle voice, his great, intricate but undertstated guitar arrangements, the moving lyrics and the general feel and mood of all of Nick's albums. Pink Moon is probably the most melancholic of the 3 albums, but oh so beautiful. I used to listen to it driving around the Po valley in Italy in the thick autumn fog and drizzle. Such a soft and moody introspective journey. As I listened my heart always went out to this talented but very sad man who left this world so early, but which gave us such wonderfull beauty in his songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Moon by Paolo Severini","review":"Voce e chitarra.

Pink Moon is the deepest form of romance, borne out of dispair and a haunting wonder-lust. And yet Nick Drake breathes magic into the soft words and deceptive guitar. There is today, really no equivalent to this tormented genius. We can applaud Roy Harper's defiance and John Martyn's grace. Nick Drake was almost angelic. This album stands as a final chapter in the trilogy of Nick Drakes's recordings, and in my opinion, is so personal and direct, so intense and uncluttered, it remains timeless and liminal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Melancholy","review":"I know that's an oxymoron, but don't harmonious contradictions make life so interesting? Nick Drake's \\"Pink Moon\\" is pleasantly melancholy, perfect for a lonely rainy day, when you have time to reflect on your own life and feel sadness and joy at the same time.

I've heard that, while recording it, Nick was so depressed that he could barely speak. Thank God he could sing, at least, and sing as hauntingly as anyone I've heard. As Shelley wrote of John Keats upon his death, \\"Here lies one whose name was written on water\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the most influential \\"unknown artist\\" ever.","review":"All Nick Drake fans will know of that simultaneously joyful yet disappointing feeling of discovering another fan. Joyful at sharing the inexpressibly beautiful, uplifting but mournful pleasure that his music brings, tinged with regret that the pleasure is not solely yours and yours alone. The knowledge that others have wished, dreamed and cried along to this genius somehow detracts from his intimate hold on our hearts. He should be the most lauded and revered of all the 70's singer songwriter guitarists, but if he were then thousands would have to share with millions his unique ability to capture their hearts. Tell everyone, but tell no-one."},{"rating":"2","title":"More people need this","review":"I remmber the day clearly when I first heard this record. I was in a record store( Live music? in Berkely) and they had a listening section. The cover really fancied me and I decided to give it a listen. I fell in love with it from the first strings. I listened to the whole album and that day \\"Pink Moon\\" was in my head everywhere I went. I finally bought it and I still feel the same about this record. It has the imagaination of a Lewis Carrol work mixed with a haunting depression that Dylan could only reach a few times. In my life I have only met less than a handful of Nick Drake fans and one day I was cleaning my room and from the T.V. in the other room I heard \\"Pink Moon\\" and saw it on a car commerical. Atleast that gives me a feeling some people know Nick Drake. This album just does something to you inside. You'll just have to buy it and see."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"First of all let me say that I bought this CD because I had heard the song \\"Pink Moon\\" in the VW comemrcial. As soon as I found out who it was and found the CD, I bought it. I was not disappointed, as the entire CD is very, very good. Most of the other reviewers have well described the music and its mellow, haunting beauty. Let me just add that as a guitar player, I really love the sound of the acoustic guitar on this album. You can hear the nuances in the subtle chord changes even on the lower and midrange strings, thanks to the simple and straightforward production.For me the bottom line is, if you liked the snippet of song from the VW commercial and are wondering if it is worth it to buy the CD from just that short introduction, my answer is yes, absolutely."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T BUY THIS CD-WAIT FOR THE NEW REMASTERED VERSION","review":"DON'T BUY THIS CD-WAIT FOR THE NEW REMASTERED VERSION.

I bleed my brakes once or twice over a race weekend and I can do it in a matter ~10 minutes with this bleeder. I do however have a couple tips:-Do not fill the tank with brake fluid, that is just asking for dirt and contamination. Instead just use the tank for air pressure.-Install and air hose quick coupler in the line. The quick coupler allows you to connect and disconnect the bleeder tank to the brake fluid reservoir without losing pressure. This makes it much faster when you have to disconnect the bleeder to add more fluid to the brake fluid reservoir because you don't have to re-pressurize the tank each time. Make sure you keep a good eye on it and dont run it dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product.

I pressurized the system and opened the bleeder valve and heard a hiss of air coming out. With a new clutch master and slave, it was bled in about 10 minutes.

Unfortunately, most of this book attempts to convince you that Extreme programming is better based on the author's experiences. A lot of the principles are counter - intutive and the author exhorts you just try it out and get enlightened. I'm sorry but these kind of things belong in infomercials not in s/w engineering.The part about \\"code is the documentation\\" is the scariest part. It's true that keeping the documentation up to date is tough on any software project, but to do away with dcoumentation is the most ridiculous thing I have heard. It's like telling people to cut of their noses to avoid colds.Yes we are always in search of a better software process. Let me tell you that this book won't lead you there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glosses over the negatives","review":"This book is simplistic. It glosses over the complete psychology involved in developing code with a team. I was very disappointed comparing what this book preaches and what it uses to substantiate its percepts. The analogical nature of the book doesn't allow one to anticipate problems and resolve them. As a programmer I don't think the book describes things as they are in team interactions. I'll keep my copy of the book. Some of the things written in it are so ludicrous as to be funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Useless! So is CSCI477.","review":"This book is absolutely useless. The methodology taught is not \\"extreme\\", but rather ridiculous...His techniques will never be applied in actual software engineering, as they are completely impractical. For half of the ideas that are practical, they are simply common sense. Such as the 4 values: communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage. Every decent software engineer practices these values. In addition, the author fills up pages by telling stories of his childhood and other needless tales in an attempt to convince the reader that the techniques explained, truely work.Don't waste your time or money. You'll only be aggravated once you open this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radical ideas!","review":"Kent Beck explores some interesting ways of improving the software development cycle. If you are not interested in some big changes, then this book is not for you.One of the more intersting concepts that Kent is pushing is this book is the concept of programming in pairs. This means that whenever code is written that you have 2 people working on the same computer to write code. My first thought was that this would slow down the process, but Kent explains that it does not actually slow down the process, and it actually speeds things up.This book contains many radical ideas that would really change the development process. For instance Kent explains that its better to meet the requirements as they exist at the end of the project, rather than the requirements that have been set at the begining of the project.In a day time when progress is measured in \\"internet time\\" and requirements are constantly changing, Extreme Programming provides some usefull ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough to give you a flavor, but just...","review":"This book is just enough to give you a flavor for extreme programming, and to tempt to implement it. It will help keep the embarrassment wolves at bay, but it's not enough detail to actually implement something. This is manager fodder (it's short), but it's a good intro. For details, check out another XP book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"gossip magazine diet plans\\" style of programming.","review":"This book reminds me of the \\"gossip magazine diet plans\\", you know, the vinegar and honey diet, or the fat-burner 2000 pill diet etc. Occasionally, people actually lose weight on those diets, but, only because they've managed to eat less or exercise more. The diet plans themselves are worthless. XP is the same - it may sometimes help people program better, but only because they are (unintentionally) doing something different. People look at things like XP because, like dieters, they see a need for change. Overall, the book is a decently written \\"fad diet\\", with ideas that are just as worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a hacker guide to the old \\"dive into coding\\" extreme","review":"This author is trying to destroy all the great works in object-oriented software engineering that was developed by the great methodologists (Booch, Jacobson, Rumbaugh, B. Meyer, Coad, Yourdon, etc.)This book is trying to bring back chaos and dive-into-coding hacks under a desguised name to make it acceptable. Make no mistake. This is no RUP or OMT or OOSE. This is an attempt to legitimize hacking and chaos that happened many decades ago.Don't waste your money on this and go read the books by Booch, Jacobson, Rumbaugh, Coad, Yourdon, Odell, and Meyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"an \\"extreme\\" departure from well-respected methodologies","review":"This book advocates extreme coding. It's a disguised way to legitimize \\"dive-into-coding\\" with no proper analysis and design. This author advocates little if any comments, documentation etc. He actually states that \\"design is in the code\\" and documents get out of date and that's an excuse not to do it. How is that in comparison to the \\"traceability\\" principle advocated so strongly by Jacobson and Rumbaugh who believe that the final code should be traced back to the analysis documents (use cases in Jacobson book) He advocates programming in pair instead of code reviews!In short, this book gathers the industry \\"worst practices\\" exactly the opposite of OMT, OOSE, RUP etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introduction, but Needs More Teeth","review":"Kent Beck's book does a good job of synthesizing a lot of programming concepts and putting them forward as a coherent methodology. The book is deceptively easy to read, though that's not necessarily what I look for in a book on theory and methodology. I look for a challenge, because that means I'm learning something difficult.As it turns out, the difficulty is not in learning XP concepts, but putting them to work in your everyday software development process. Here Mr. Beck's book falls way short. To fill in the gaps, I recommend Rick Hightower's \\"Java Tools for Extreme Programming\\"--it gives you detailed information for coding and building tests using open source tools. The books complement each other and together present a complete thought on XP development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the most important book of the year.","review":"Kent has a knack for looking at things in new ways and explaining them simply and clearly. He is showing us the \\"middle way\\" between the usual alternatives of kludging without design and designing as if only the paper mattered.

They all repeat themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"XP considered harmful","review":"The XP approach to development is just another weak rationalization to explain why hacking is an OK approach. Design doesn't enter in until you've hacked yourself into a corner. While making bold claims, such as the claim that the cost-curve for early versus late changes to a product is actually flat (at least using XP), the key claims relied on in the book are never verified or quantified in any manner. Another annoyance of the book is that it seems to talk about *all* software development, but in actuality really only ever deals with issues of concern to IT organizations. Granted, that is a huge chunk of the industry, but the author never so much as acknowledges other application areas. There are some good things in the book, but only a very experienced engineer would be able to sort them out from the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I don't recommend this book for someone on a real OO project of any size. While there are parts of the book that might be useful, many of the suggestions are downright wrong IMO from the many OO projects I've been on. CRC cards are all well and good, but they don't scale to significant commercial projects. Open group areas with desks pushed together is a bad thing, not a good thing. As much as the author wants everything to center around programming, it doesn't. Some thought in analysis and design and refactoring @ that level is more powerful. Programmer pairs is an interesting idea to try (though I think it's taken too far in the book). There are much better books out there (e.g. Larman's OOA/D book; Fowler's UML book) - get them and leave this one on the bookstore's shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"Chapter after chapter I kept thing that the author would get to something substantive. He never did. Not one example. Not one piece of concrete evidence. He had some good common sense ideas, but they are all presented in such general terms that they are self-evident. The author makes grand assumptions and goes on to explain (in generalizations) his theories which are based upon these assumptions. I often envisioned the author standing on a street corner proclaiming the end of the world or espousing the \\"scientific\\" basis of creationism while exposing his complete misunderstanding of science and his willingness to ignore facts that disprove his assertions. This entire book is written as if it were an introductory chapter. It reads like a psychology text - a lot of verbiage which hides the fact that the text has almost nothing to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"The book is a summary. Too many assumptions are made of the components involved in the XP model to give the readers a good base to use. There are some good ideas but not enough to actually implement the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a great read that even I could understand","review":"At one of Kent Beck's talks I went to, he described Xp in terms of \\"building software like software\\" instead of like archetectur or craftmanship or mathmatics or anything else.Reading this book, though, it would seem that programing is actually like raising kids. You have to start small, use the simplist thing that could posibly work, make sure everyone does only their job, that everyone contributes and no one is overworked. In a very real sense, everything you need to do Xp, you learned in kindergarten. Take turns, work together, if you break something, fix it, none of the concepts are that dificult, which makes you wonder why some people hate it so much. If you really want to learn the philosiphy behind Xp, take a look at his bibliography.

I used to welcome books about James Bond because they were far and few to be found in the world of publishing. This book falls into the plethora of recent publications about Ian Fleming's creation. Being part of that trend this book carries the stigma of glaring inaccuracies when it tackles Ian Fleming's written word. Many authors do not do their homework and the research into the actual words that Fleming put to paper. Fleming's sublime knowledge into the world of espionage, esoteric life styles and curiosity pieces is something analogous to the riddle of the Sphinx because in many instances the reader either misunderstands Fleming's prose or the reader just glosses over his words totally oblivious to the intent Fleming implied.

Although these illustrations lack the colorful details she's known for, the complexity of the mostly black/white drawings keep it engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good!","review":"This book was falling apart in my hands when it arrived, which I was not aware of but the price was very low so I didn't bother returning it but just recycled instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"brings the noise, leaves the music behind...","review":"Quite simply, Atari Teenage Riot is so bad it's good. Almost. The music is terrible, not just performance-wise, but recording quality, too. It sounds ATR leaned a Fisher Price cassette recorder up against a blown amp and then cut thier album. But, I guess that's part of ATR's charm. the lyrics are almost completely incoherent broken english, but honestly are fun to scream along to and make fun of. It's hard to believe this is a real band, but I love them anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is okay, but inferior to Burn Berlin, Burn!","review":"Burn Berlin, Burn! makes you want to scream and shout like the band; it's just got so much energy. 60 Second Wipeout is a poppish album that has lame coruses to tracks that are supposed to be real screamers, and while the songs are okay they just don't sound as 'hard' as ATRs earlier stuff. Burn Berlin, Burn! had a lot of meaningless revolutionary rhetoric that accompanies so many punk albums made by people who are no more than kids themselves, and while it worked in Burn Berlin,Burn!, the same can't be said for 60 Second Wipeout. Sometimes I just wanted to tell the lead singer to shut her mouth.

Because she brings a frog to school, and frogs are icky, and Harry likes anything that is icky.--How does the narrator learn of Harry's secret? Because love notes keep falling out of his pocket.--Why is our heroine so averse to people fighting with each other?

Besides the line on the TV, our TV picture goes 'out of whack' after about 10 minutes and lasts for 3-4 minutes. After 5 calls to Westinghouse they still are coming up with cute fixes and are not willing to authorize the TV back for repair. I would not recommend purchasing anything from Westinghouse! They don't back their products, they are not a proven name in TV's, they build krap and blame it on other operations. My recommendation, stay away from this Poison Oak!!

The only reason I didn't give this drivel 0 stars, is because it wasn't an option. If this movie is supposed to be about the influences that shaped J.R.R. Tolkien's writing, it is seriously lacking in some of his most fundamental influential elements: Tolkien's devout Catholicism, Tolkien's friendship with Oxford colleague C. S. Lewis and Tolkien's family life (the fact that he wrote much of his material for his wife and children) are completely ignored. Instead, the folks at National Geographic seem to have opportunistically decided to glob onto the success of the Lord of the Rings movie in order to push a left-wing anti-capitalism environmental agenda. For sheer pretentiousness, the ending in which we are asked the rhetorical question \\"Who will be the ringbearer?\\", takes the cake - it sure sent my gag reflexes into overdrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really pretty tedious.","review":"NG manages to make even Beowulf and Sutton Hoo tiresome, and that takes some doing. The WWI battle scenes are endless; by halfway through, unless you have a serious fetish for old newsreel clips, you'll be shouting \\"Yes, okay, WWI, I get it already!\\" at the TV screen. Hardly anything about any of Tolkien's actual influences, and not enough footage from the movie to make it worthwhile. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll hold you over for a while","review":"This DVD provides an interesting, concise look into Tolkien's eternal epic, 'The Lord of the Rings.' Interviews with people who knew Tolkien as well as the stars behind the new movies (including Peter Jackson and Elijah Wood) tell the story of the man behind the legend. An educating and entertaining movie- this is worth the money because of the movie footage alone. I only gave four stars, however, because the program does go off on a typical National Geographic tangent about saving the rain forest at the end. Like I said, this may be enough to hold you off for a while until the movie comes out- rumors now claim August 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Disgrace to Tolkien","review":"Having read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and being a large Tolkien fan I was sickened at how the makers of this video tried to twist Tolkien's visions into their own independent agenda. Tolkien outwardly warns against this type of misinterpretation at the beginning of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". I used to have a very high opinion of National Geographic, but they've really let me down here."},{"rating":"2","title":"cultural background for epic fantasy","review":"When I saw this tape, I wondered how National Geographic could review what essentially was an epic fantasy stressing good v evil and friendship. They have done an excellent job.The video explores three points. First, how the degradation of industrial England destroyed the environment of small village life. (a typical Geographic theme: Ecology).Second, the effect of World War I on the fantasy, mainly in the battle scenes. Readers of LOTR know that one of the major themes is that the heroes do not seek glory on the battlefield, but when it is required, they do indeed heroically fight. It also points out how the war democratized Tolkein's view of the then stratified British society.Third, it points out the roots of the fantasy in Finnish poetry.For those who dismiss LOTR as a childish fantasy, this exploration on the cutural and intellectual basis explores why this epic tale has such a hold on so many people of different backgrounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely misses the point of the story","review":"The writers of this review appear to be more interested in advancing an agenda than reviewing the story. They draw allegories with World War II, which Tolkien specifically rejected; Tolkien hated allegory. The writers relate the story to deforestation, which is also completely forced. The discussions of Beowulf and the Kalevala are interesting, and the movie clips are good, but overall this DVD is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could they completely miss the point?","review":"As many other commentors have mentioned, this DVD is very biased. It importantly ignores how deeply religious the trilogy is. What makes it even worse, though, is how NG tries to tie ideals to Tolkien that he never espoused. For example, NG argues he was anti-industrialist. While he certainly appreciated nature, in LOTR (from what I understand) he was trying to get across the idea that evil projects itself upon the landscape, not some eco-friendly ideal. Nor was Tolkien against war. The most egregious error, however, is that NG completely ignores the THESIS of the trilogy, which is that the desire for power and control, especially if it is well-intentioned, is destructive. This would include NG's political aims to supposedly \\"help the environment\\" through over-bearing governments. (PS: Tolkien roughly considered himself an anarchist or minarchist.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good documentary..good to have for Tolkien's fans.","review":"I love the movie and I love the book. This documentary helped me to understand more of the movie I like so much. It has both how the movie was made, talking about finding location and stuff like that and also, telling about what inspired and influenced Tolkien to write The Lord of the Ring and how he got all the ideas about elves and the origin of Tolkien elvish language..The price of this DVD might be a little high for just 1-hr documentary...But I can say it's one of the best national geographic documentaries. So if you're Tolkien fans, love the movie, love the books, I highly recommend you to buy this DVD.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has nothing to do with the film.Do not buy it.","review":"This National Geographic DVD has nothing to do with the actual film. It just compares the characters with real life characters.Save your money and do not buy it for it is irellevant to the film. Tolkien repeatedly said that his Lord Of The Rings books were not allegorical and yet we still have those that like to use it to make up their own revisionist history.Shame on you National Geographic for selling this piece of tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Geographic own interpretation, not accurate","review":"I do believe that NG has a great deal of experience in producing background information for our social-political-ecological problems, but the video ignores totally the fact that a world can be created out of sheer imagination.Anyone who is familiarized with J.R.R. Tolkien's life should know that his intention was to create a world of fantasy for children and adults as well. He specifically denied any relationship with actual real conflicts or characters of our history. Surely he is influenced by the nordic myths, traditions, legends and landscapes but if you get to read his own introduction to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" you will find an aversion to the specific line of thinking used in the production by National Geografic.I do not recomend this product. It is educational but has nothing to do with the real background of J.R.R.T. and his idea of creating the longest story ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"how disappointing : - (","review":"Thanks for this DVD. Now we all know at least that the background of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is the world war and no longer just a fantasy story. Endless scenes of fighting, bombing, Hitler (Sauron), factories, soldiers and all this between Germany (Mordor) and the rest of the world (Shire) is never ending.J.R.R. Tolkien made clear that he had the idea with the ring, the fight, between good and evil in his head before the war even started. The whole story is strongly linked to the hobbit.All I can say \\"what a waste of money!!!\\" If your a real fan of the movie please don't buy it !!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Another attempt to capitalize on the renewed popularity of The Lord of the Rings.

The worst part of the film was when they spent 10 minutes on deforestation in Gabon, comparing it to the quest to destroy the ring. Really?"},{"rating":"1","title":"See the infamous car-in-the-background scene!","review":"Is this documentary worth watching for its literary or environmental value?Heck, no!But, if you can get a hold of it for free, it is worth watching to see the car driving down the road behind Frodo and Sam.That's right! Remember the big thing about a car in the background of FotR?Well, it's true (the producers make reference to it in their audio commentary for FotR).However, nearly the only way you'll ever see it is in this documentary, b/c the scene was \\"fixed\\" for the DVD release of the film.If you don't know, it's the scene when Frodo and Sam are leaving the Shire and Sam notes that he's never been that far away from home before.It's silly, but fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commentary Behind the Scenes","review":"This is a look at what went into making The Fellowship of the Ring movie by Peter Jackson based on a book by J.R.R. Tolkien. How Middle Earth was created, good vs. evil, -places- heroes- villains in Middle Earth. Who are the real life Frodos? Looks at the lush New Zealand and U.K. landscapes the film was shot at.

Pretty hard to impress me with something Tolkien related, I've read the main books at least 3 times each, the entire 12 volume History of Middle Earth series from Christopher, the entire Tolkien Studies series from West Virginia University press, and numerous others. This would be good additional information for anyone that was a fan of the Peter Jackson trilogy, but if you're the type that's as far into Tolkien as having read the Silmarillion, this will disappoint. For many I'm sure the information about the rune singers and the Kalevala is info you might otherwise not find unless you read some of the more esoteric of Tolkien histories, so rent it for a night (there's hardly an hour of content here) but don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless Marketing","review":"The marketer should be ashamed at the attempt to lure people to buy this DVD under the guise that it is the actual movie.

They talk about Tolkien as if he's some anti-industrial, radical environmentalist. And on top of that, they inject political correctness into the system by leaving out any references to his deep Catholic-Christian beliefs and his references to LOTR as being a fundamentally religious work. This DVD is an insult to Tolkien and everything he believed in. Although there are some interesting things in it about the Kalevala and Anglo-Saxon stuff, this DVD as a whole, lacks any kind of focus or single subject and has numerous blatent inaccuracies about Tolkien. Supposedly, this is about the Lord of the Rings movie, but they barely talk to the cast/crew of the movie at all. And as just about every reviewer has said, what in the sam hill does some guy hiking across Africa have ANYTHING to do with LOTR or Tolkien?! This DVD doesn't even deserve one star. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better rental than a purchase","review":"I purchased it with high hopes that it would really give some good insight about how Tolkien came up with the LOTR. Unfortunately, the insights were rather weak. It was really well researched, but there were no interviews with Tolkien of any kind. One would have thought that some insight from Christopher, his son and editor of the Silmarillion, would have been included in this, but it wasn't.There was never any mention that the story of Bilbo Baggins was a story he told to his kids, and because they liked it so much, he began to write it down.I found out more about Tolkien by reading the CD sleeves of the radio dramatization of LOTR (ISBN 0553456539) than I did with this DVD, I feel completely jipped.If you want to see it, I recommend renting it.

Pinnacle support's answer is: Dont have other external devices connected oon firewire or USB when you capture video from from your camcorder with Studio 10.

I could not get the software installed, so I called tech support and they informed me to uninstall the software, and then reinstall it, but to uninstall it I would have to download a uninstall utility to do this. I did this and it wiped some of my Windows software out. I had the 10.6 version I think. I sent it back and asked for my money back. Amazon informed me they would, but have not received yet.My son came over and helped me with this program, but he could not get it to install either. He is a Computer Science graduate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downgrade from Studio 9!!","review":"Studio 9 worked but would occasionally crash. Thought I'd upgrade to 10.6. Installed the program, which took forever. Then installed the patch. Then installed the new driver. Now it will not show transition thumbnails, so it is like playing \\"Concentration\\" trying to remember which blank square holds which transition. Then, it refused to remove clips from the timeline, despite the fact that they were deleted from playback. It just made a frameshift, so that the timeline no longer matched playback. Then, it would not show any thumbnails in the timeline except those originally visible.Don't waste your money. I may re-install Studio 9 or just bite the bullet and learn to use the more difficult but more predictable interface of Premiere Elements. Studio 10 is a very disappointing product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pinnacle or Nadir?","review":"Among stiff competition, this has to be a contender for the worst software ever, particularly in its price category. Almost nothing works, options are preset and cannot be changed. For example, if you use a separate HD you cannot select it as an option. Forget about the monikers 'plus' and 'special' with 'extras'. If the package I got indeed comes with 'extras' the bare-bones software must consist only of an opening screen that says, \\"got you sucker...one born every minute\\". The software is counter-intuitive, doesn't actually work and it is very time consuming to establish this. If you bought it, uninstall it, toss it and cut your losses and buy something else. This will drive you to drink."},{"rating":"2","title":"very happy","review":"I bought this product for some basic editing and the ipod conversion feature and I'm thoroughly impressed thus far (although I have less than 20 hours of editing under my belt).

(Unless you have crappy equipment and think you're tv speakers cut it for a loud rock show).If you have a problem with this release then you should probably just stop listening to Rock music altogether and look into country or even jazz..."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic band and this is a amazing concert","review":"Fantastic and outstanding and a great buy and graphics and the camera angles are wonderful and its a grear buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the money ...absolutely","review":"I agree with most of the previous reviews panning the editing of this concert. For me, this could have been a 5 star review if they had left the songs in their entirety. But having said that, what is left to see and hear is some great stuff! From their rock favorites to some Blues tossed in for good measure, I doubt you will hear Aerosmith or Steven Tyler at this level ever again. I just saw him perform the now infamous rendition of the National Anthem prior to one of the NFL Football playoff games. He sounded a little rough around the edges now, voice wise...but gave what I expected of an old rockers version, so to me, it was not a bad rendition at all. For the price of this concert DVD, the extra CD included, some damn good songs with excellent sound quality to watch. Have some friends over for a few cold ones, put this on and you will get positive feedback ...for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Consensus Is: They Blew It!","review":"Yes it's true, the bonus material is better than the actual feature. This type of editing is getting very dated and I think it impresses no one. I repeat what many have said:1. Good music, performances, and sound quality but so irritating how interviews intrude on the performances.2. Headache inducing rapid fire edits that rival the movie Catwoman, band members somehow change guitars in the middle of songs, visuals don't match what's heard, producers show no affinity for the music.3. Too many shots of the crowd, many of which seem to be planted strippers, etc.The people that made this show just should have let Aerosmith and the music do the talking. This hard-sell editing seems more suited for an up and coming boy-band or somebody else that is trying to establish itself and create hype. This DVD should have tried to please it's established fanbase and given them a pure concert video. If only the feature was more like the songs in the bonus video material!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable. Simply Unwatchable.","review":"To summarize:(1) Horrible editing. Six cuts per second made me disoriented and angry. Please, Mr. Director and Mr. Film Editor, just point the camera at Steven Tyler and give us the film of him doing his thing.(2) Voices talking over the music. Hey, guess what Mr. Film Editor - I bought this DVD thinking I'd see and hear a concert, not somebody's irrelevant comments over the music.(3) Shots of the audience instead of the band. Obvious plants of paid models in the \\"audience\\" (although they coulda been filmed separately in a studio, for all I know), acting as if they are jamming to the music. I gagged.I hope someone (Aerosmith, maybe?) will take the raw camera footage from this concert, and re-cut it into something coherent. THAT would be the DVD to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the music do the talking...Pleeeeaaaase !","review":"If you enjoy watching middle-aged bleached blonds and drunk geeks waving their arms and lip-sinking \\"Walk this way\\"... If you enjoy fast-cutting editing, split screens, interrupted songs, and interviews in the middle of a guitar solo... Then this \\"live\\" Dvd is for you !If you like Aerosmith for their music and energy, just listen to \\"Nine lives\\" \\"Rocks\\" or \\"Toys in the attic\\" . Or better yet, go to the show !The making of \\"Honkin' on Bobo\\" is very good though, but makes the main concert even more frustrating to watch, because you realize that the real great live performance is happening INSIDE the recording studio !!!What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEY MR. DIRECTOR, GET A GRIP! YOU RUINED THIS DVD!!","review":"This DVD COULD BE GREAT but IT IS BAD, AWFUL. It looks like it was edited/directed by a 14-year old that has just discovered that he can use 100 different cameras. There is so many distractions going around that you just can't enjoy the show! You can not even LISTEN to the show because there are all these stupid interviews going ON THE TOP of the songs! This coulda been a great DVD had it been recorded with 2 or 3 cameras and 10% of the budget if only the editor/director had half a clue of what he/she was doing. Avoid it unless you are 12 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Details you have to know before buying.","review":"Positively. The sound is very good, the band is very good, the choice of songs are good (I would have said great but they played..Elevator..Crying..Don't want to miss a thing - a too commercial period for me).Negatively. This is NOT a non-stop concert. we see footage of the band speaking between songs and even sometimes when the song is already started(easily 30 seconds into the song sometimes). We see an awful lot a silicone babes and stripper looking girls...really I never saw a DVD concert with That much shots of the public. I didn't have the feeling I was there, which is what it takes for me to make a good concert DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard rock at its best","review":"This a superbly well done live album. The only problem with showing the crowd is that the shots of the chicks were too short!! Aerosmith hard rock is about sex and drugs (in the old days) and rock and roll, and this DVD delivers. Joe Perry plays with a frenzy. I may need a new amp as the protection circuit keeps going on when I play Baby Please Dont Go. Not perfect perhaps but mighty fine stuff here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done video","review":"Should this be the first DVD of this band? Hell no. I can't believe that they haven't put out stuff from the glorious 70s. This was a great tour. When they were with Kiss, they ripped up the joint. This video captures their fire and ability to put wanna be bands to shame. This is real rock and roll (with a detour here and there Don't Want to Miss a Thing)Next time, I would like the ability to track individual band members so that I can watch Joe's guitar playing or I have the choice to not switch camera angles every other second. When I am at a concert I take in one thing at a time and then do a quick scan of what is around.These videos are cheap to film, no reason that there can't be ten different angles to switch to.If you like Aerosmith, this is a bargain. DVD with bonus songs, a song you can mess with on the computer, and a live cd is thrown in so you can hear them live on the way to work. Good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can mix it yourself!","review":"I like the fact that the bonus disc has Umixit, so you can do your own version of the title track right on your computer with no need to buy anything. I even plugged in and added my own guitar track and recorded along with Joe and Brad's."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland and disappointing","review":"this once great rock band's first ever official DVD release is not what it should be. Before you buy, consider this - it's NOT a proper concert. It's a selection of songs chosen from one of their gigs, put together but hidiously edited with pointless interviews and behind-the-scene footage in between the songs that are so annoying they even run over the concert footage. In other words, during the cool intro to \\"Sweet Emotion\\" you don't actually hear it coz an interview is still going on!! so if you're expecting a full concert start to finish - avoid this DVD now.Aerosmith better bounce back with a major comeback soon before their fans get bored - their \\"Honkin' On Bobo\\" album was dreadful and this poor excuse for a DVD is not much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quiet Please","review":"This could have been a great DVD. As mentioned in earlier reviews the voice over introductions during the songs make this DVD a garbage can special. Why would anyone want to hear the same comments over and over while trying to listen to music. In the words of the late Frank Zappa just shut up and play your guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a concert video (DVD)","review":"Terrible editing, 5 songs (maybe 6, I forget since I watched it once and threw it out). If you are looking for actual live footage of a Aerosmtith concert, that DVD does not exist yet... Save your money, the DVD is just chopped up interviews, with a few minutes of concert footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Let Down!!!!!","review":"I say BIG with capitol letters, because as in the case with a previous reviewer, I am a life long Aero fan. I can go on, but I won't bore you with the details. The fact that they decided to talk over the top of otherwise perfectly good songs is a complete let down and absolutely horrible decision. Like the other reviewer, I can't put into words how disgusted I was with this disc after waiting for it for so long. Bad move guys. Please try to get it right next time, if there ever is one."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY EYES ARE STILL SPINNING","review":"I thought the scenes changed fast in the Eagles Hell Freezes Over DVD, but those last forever compared to this concert. I was hoping that after the first or second song the constant scene changes would settle down, but I was wrong....I was terribly wrong. My eyes couldn't focus fast enough to lock in on any one band member or people in the audience, for that matter (oh and by the way, the audience made up about 40% of the video).It's really a shame, the audio was great even in the PCM stereo mode.These new generation producers and editors have to get back on track and slow the roller coaster down a bit.Enough said, I'm off to ebay to sell an \\"only been watched have way through\\" DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-watchable!","review":"Whoever produced this 'lemon' missed the mark. I thought MTV style editing was a thing of the past. There's not one shot that lasts over 2 seconds in length in the entire DVD. Even in those longer 2 second shots, the camera-man keeps adjusting the zoom. This thing gives me a headache. Was it designed for 14 year olds to watch that just ate to much sugar?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Printer/Scanner fanatic","review":"I've had a variety of different mediocre printers and this one is just great. For its price range, this thing is awesome! It talks to you!! The menus are very easy to understand, pretty much self-explanatory. Prints fast too. The thing I like about it is if you want to cancel your printing, it cancels it immediately. Some of my other printers would print another one, two, three pages before they decided to cancel. I haven't used the copy or fax yet, but the printing and scanning are great. There is a graphic on the print menu that keeps you up to date on your ink usage, which is very useful. It does seem to be using a lot of ink, but I don't know if that's because I'm printing a lot or because of the printer itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"better photo quality","review":"I originally purchased a HP All-In-One, and ended-up returning it. The photo scan quality was horrible. I then purchased the Lexmark AIO X5150-and love it. It scans so clear, that I was able to scan and edit photos like a photo scan/printer would do. The quality of fine print with the fax feature is outstanding. My brother faxed me a photo, and when I printed it on photo paper, it looked as if it was a professional photo. I love this printer, it fits perfect with my needs for school and home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap parts","review":"This headset broke after using it for roughly 2 months.

It inspires the reader to strive for great things. It also shows us how that life is a collection of small, wonderful choices we make in every day, and every interaction. Upon reading this book you will want to share it with all your friends of faith. I ordered several copies for friends after reading only the first 3 chapters! I especially liked the fact that it's stories apply to people of faith across many religions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspires Both Youth and Adults","review":"I read Positively Dangerous because it claimed to offer a chance for teens to live a passionate and committed Christian life. And I was delighted to discover that Frank Mercadante has written a book that appeals directly to young people's innate desire to find an ideal that they can devote themselves to. But I was also pleasantly surprised that the book also spoke to me, a sixty-two-year-old grandfather, and challenged me to renew my commitments and revive my disciplines. Frank has a way of speaking personally and directly to the heart of his reader. He writes well, gives practical advice, and uses many examples to illustrate his points. Young people and older folks like me will take away great benefits from Positively Dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reminders","review":"While this is a book directed at teens, it offeres a strong reminder of what anyone can do to be a person of faith whose faith will make a difference in the lives of others. I was particularly taken with the chapter that reminded me that in order to have a strong personal relationship with the Lord that I needed to spend more time in prayer. I would strongly recommend that anyone who is interested in strengthening their faith read this book. It is a quick, easy read that will make a difference in your life and the lives of those you give a copy to as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book that should be read to children of any age.","review":"This fabulous book stole my heart. I feel so lucky to have a job that allows me to share my love of books with my wonderful students. I do my elementary counseling through children's literature. UNCLE JED'S BARBERSHOP is a book I enjoy reading over and over to kids of all ages. What a marvelous lesson. I think it is important for kids to be reminded of how unfair things were to African Americans many years ago.

Even after reading this book to six different classes in one day, I still cry my eyes out on the last few pages--the most perfect ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book should be on the required reading list for Middle & High School Students.I would also recommend to book to adults as well to understand simple business procedures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This book was a great read. It's a great book to use when talking about the depression and even segregation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exegetical excess","review":"Mr. Bernasconi, in a far flung attempt to trace the problem of twentieth century racism to certain nineteenth century theological positions, has taken highly selective and controversial studies done in that century, in what appears to be a backhanded attempt under the guise of objective scholarly inquiry to paint with a broad brush the entire religious community of that era with a simplistic and in many cases unfair portrayal. He has unfortunately overreached himself in this endeavor, taking on a task fit for a more philosphically objective personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable, maybe. Entertaining, definitely!","review":"I can see how some people would almost place this book in the \\"Young Adult\\" section of the bookstore. It's light and playful but well-written. It's been one of three fiction books I own and the only one I've read more than once in the past six(?) years. Can't wait for Arnold Schwarzenegger to play this role sometime in 2002-3, although when reading it I pictured Mike Starr (Frenchy from Goodfellas) as the lovable hitman."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS good","review":"I agree with the above review. A light comedy, worth reading over again. A keeper on these bookshelves.

It's a hoot to see it again after all these years!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing/missleading terminology","review":"Too much tutorial for VS.NET, not enough on C#. If you know something about C++, then steer clear from this book. It uses confusing terminology in wrong context. For instance they inaccurately refer to an \\"object of 'type'\\" as \\"Object derived from class\\". Derivation in OOP has a very different meaning. Also they repeatedly call a class as a \\"template\\" for an object. There are more similar confusing wordings and terminologies. I understand they wanted to be illustrative but IMHO they fell over the fence and rather confuse the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giant Read Me for Visual Studio","review":"Oh My God...This book is a giant read me for visual studio.It is impossible to read this book when you are anywhere but on your computer because everything you do involves using Visual Studio which the author annoyingly calls \\"C#\\" hence the book title.This book is of no value to people who want to learn ABOUT c# and is a waste of money.Buy Programming in the Key of C# if you want a good book for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is really Teach Yourself Visual Studio and little C#","review":"The book is excellent for beginners who have never seen an IDE before. The author uses the term C# where he should use the term \\"Visual Studio .NET\\" instead. C# is a programming language. For instance, the second chapter is titled \\"Navigating C#\\" but he really talks about navigating the IDE. I suspect a search-replace of C# to VB.NET you could convert it into a VB.NET book.(of course with a bit more than that).I was looking for a book to quickly learn the LANGUAGE C#, not a study of Visual Studio .NET, which takes all of about 1 hour or less for an experienced software developer to learn. If the title were changed to \\"Teach Yourself Visual Studio.NET in 24 hours\\", I'd give it 5 stars.Bottom line, if you are a C++ or Java software engineer who wants to come up to speed on C#, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start for beginners!","review":"I wanted to see what the hoopola was all about with this new language. This book got me up and running with C# in relatively a short time. Good rundown on the main points of the new language and VS IDE. There is some rundown on .NET framework which was helpful.

I thought this game would be something like Syphon Filter. But this game does not even come close. But the one thing I did like about the game is the opening to this video game and the music. Only if they could have made the game for gamer friendly and have an option of first person shooter and third person shooter, this game would have been a great shooting game.

The game has an excellent choice of weapons everythng from MP's to M-16's. It is worth it to buy for PlayStation, just wait til the price goes down ... to a little bit less or buy the used version. Overall it is alot like Medal Of Honor, except its only 1 player and you get lots of weapons."},{"rating":"1","title":"sounds better than it plays","review":"I heard nothing but good reviews about this game from friends, so I picked it up. With the exception of the 11th mission it was pretty basic & easy. It's done nothing new with the 1st person shooter scenario. Graphics are poor, movement is irratic, controls are difficult to use, and it only has 13 missions. You might as well just re-play a 1st person shooter that you already have rather than waste money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Six.......Medal of Honor wanna be!","review":"This game was pretty terrible. Controling and aiming the guns were terrible. Graphics were poor at best, and the most bothersome thing was when your fellow personell or hostages were to follow you, you couldn't back track. They won;t let you pass beyond them. Go get Medal of Honor, way better game play. Rainbow six was boring, and plain out annoying to play. Good concept, they just didn't pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I spent money on this game.","review":"Not nearly as good as the PC version. I suggest you just buy the PC version if you have a computer and if not rent the game first. Just make sure you play the game first and know what it is like before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST GAME, Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six for the computer was a totally cool game. Now that it is a video game it is great. The action in this game is intense and and missions are so good. The story line to this game is great and i know anyone who liked GoldenEye would totally love this game, i do. And 2 player action is very good. There is no bad points to this game except how adictive it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Playstation Games","review":"Rainbow 6 is very nice. The playstaion version is best. It uses real weapons gear. I can't compare it to any other playstation game. This is a great first-person shooter. I would recomend it to anyone who likes shoot-'em-up games."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME","review":"If you have heard anything good about Rainbow Six from Reviewers and such, that was about the PC game. They changed soooo much for this PSX conversion and it was all bad. B-A-D BADBADBADBAD. The levels bite, the planing stage is all messed up. All you can do is put three guys (In the PC vesian you get like 8) where they enter the building. In the PC version you tell your teams,(yes, teams) where to go once they're inside the building. The terrorist couldn't hit the sky with a shotgun, their aim is so bad. And your buddies are all deformed. You deserve so much better. Get the PC game. And if all you have is a PSX, get Rouge Spear for the PSX. That is very good and an excact dupicate of the PC Rouge Spear, which is even better than the PC Rainbow SIX. DONT GET THIS GAME AVOID LIKE SHIVA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGRASE TO CLANCY, AND PLAYSTATION","review":"I recently rented this game. I played it once and it SUCKED. The graphics remind you of an old atari game. The controls are so hard to control I practically broke my controller trying to turn a corner. Another thing, if you see a terrorist it takes you at least 6 seconds to aim at him! This has got to be the most horrible game I have every played in the 10 yrs. of my gaming life. I would rather start playing my old NES then this HORRIBLE GAME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Match The Hype","review":"This game isn't very good at all.

All i'm tring to say is rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything but on Playstation","review":"This game has a good plot and gameplay, as you get to run around killing people... (it's fun to me!) and the sounds are remarkable... but those few things are not enough to save the game from the crappy graphics it has. The suits are so pixelated that their body and face looks like they have a bunch of square pimples. THE GRAPHICS ARE VERY BAD... if that factor doesn't bother you then it is a very fun game... graphics influence me a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game Stinks To High Heavens","review":"This game does stink the control is practicly crap mostly because you have to press almost all the buttons at ones to open one stupid door which pretty mutch has nothing it but 500 guys to kill ya instently kill you in like 1 in a half shots because you have to press R2, R1, and the direction buttons just to move the dumb gun up and down. The gameplay is not fun at all, half of the game is all just kill terriorist and save hostages. Don't waste your money on your game."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst games i've ever played","review":"When I heard that Rainbow Six would come out for Playstation, I was very excited. Being a Mac user, I was insanely jealous of my friends who were playing an awesome R6 on their PCs. When I got this game, though, I was almost sickened by the complete crapiness of it.The akward control set up make a terrible FPS. The aim buttons (R1, R2 for up and down)are hard to reach for in a rush and are so sensitive that one touch can have you pumping the ceiling or floor full of lead.The selection of guns is formidable, but in combat, the only difference between the guns is between the silenced and unsilenced guns. The main flaw of this game, though is that it eliminates the wonderful strategy aspect of the PC version. Instead of mapping your teams' routes, the only strategy is choosing which of three entry points will you enter from. Taking out one of the best features of the PC version make this game one of the worst made for any platform"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best but still a great game.","review":"This game isn't the best but its also not the worst there is a total of 13 missions in the game.

A terrifying bad guy that is a real psycho, totally ruthless and crazy, and it's set in one of the most eerie and nightmarish places ever, down in the catacombs beneath New York City. You will never feel more hopeless when you see the heroine down in this dark underworld and you know nobody can help her. Check it out. Similar to \\"the New York Ripper\\" but better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stranger Is Not Watching","review":"This movie caught my attention with it's name, \\"A Stranger Is Watching\\", more or less because I enjoy a good horror movie. This movie had none of that. What you get is mostly a very uninteresting movie about a killer with a good chase scene coming too late to redeem this uninspired B-movie.The only true suspense was wondering when it would ever get off the ground and really get interesting. Long story short, it never happened, the best part of the movie was the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could it have gone on a little longer so I would really get nightmares!","review":"This was a terrific film. Faithful to the book and cast with two fabulous actors -- Rip Torn and Kate Mulgrew.Any story that takes place underground is destined to scare me and this one did. I didn't expect this film to be a gritty and as detailed as it was. The scenes with the dumb-waiter were so realistic that I felt the rope burns on my hands. Rip Torn flings a wicked knife right into the center of things. Kate Mulgrew uses every resource of the story and her talent to bring Sharon to life.Creepy music too!Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey frustrated mulgrew fan","review":"I can't really add to the comments already shown, other than to emphasise the fact that its a must watch.

And a cat and mouse game goes on down there as they try to escape from the hell hole that they are in. But everytime they try to make their escape, he seems to come back at the wrong time, and meets them at the door. Some viewers might find this movie suspenseful. But it didnt do anything for me.

They do what they must in order to survive,\\" This educational book focuses on various animals that have been unfairly feared or hated throughout human history.Animals covered in the book include sharks, bats, grizzly bears, cobras, vultures, and many more, including two of my personal favorite misunderstood creatures: the rat and the hyena. As the book progresses Simon generally sheds some light on the myths surrounding each creature. The photographs are striking, although 2 or 3 may be a bit gory for some readers.

You just have to get over the long plot developement scenes between the action. These plot scenes are really not that bad, though. All of the fight scenes are spectacular especially the final one.

As it is, being a hardcover book its not a book you can read with one hand but its not too big or heavy either. The cover has a cloth feel and dull green colour with gold print and border, adding to the vintage charm. This has no fancy dust cover but came with a slip of black paper around it with print on it saying it is 150th anniversary luxury edition with an introduction by P.D James. Book was delivered intact and well packaged and arrived in good time. All in all its a \\"must have\\" for any Sherlock Holmes fan, something you can pass down to your kids and grand kids if looked after well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want a refund.","review":"Many illustrations in this book are corrupt.And there is no real table of content, which means completely disaster for such a big book.\\"Active table of content\\" is hyperlink. -- This is something like cheating.I heard Amazon.com cared about customer satisfaction, then please stop selling this book, at least take a look yourself, you will agree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife loves the book.","review":"I purchased this book for my wife and she hasn't been able to put it down since starting to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sherlock Holmes","review":"I read about three chapters and quit.

I have been reading Holmes on and off for over a year. This book has been all over America and traveled hundreds of miles but it still looks like new. Secondly, The Complete Sherlock Holmes is the best mystery novel available. You will never find a better mystery than those in this book.

The digital printing press is revolutionizing book production. Today, it is fast, easy and inexpensive to print 100, 500 or 1,000 books. It is no longer necessary for an author-publisher to invest in 3-5000 copies.Every book must go through four stages: it has to be created (written), produced (printed and bound), distributed (shipped to stores and other outlets) and promoted (let the world know your book is available). John Harnish covers them all and even discusses how to set up and run your publishing business.Harnish is a writer who works for a POD publisher. This is a fine and handy guide by a fine and successful author.As a publisher and the author of The Self-Publishing Manual, I can attest that Harnish's book is a fine addition to the literature on books.Dan Poynter, ParaPublishing.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read for Writers","review":"As the title of this book indicates, Mr. Harnish has compiled a wealth of information about the print-on-demand publishing method available to anyone who wants to publish a book these days. Drawing not only on his own considerable experience, but on input from a great number of POD book authors, John Harnish delivers what he promises. Indexed and properly organised, the contents of this 606 page tome offer concise answers to just about any conceivable question on the subject. Well done!RDP"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed but useful for the surveys.","review":"The title is misleading. There is no such thing as \\"POD Publishing\\" POD is a printing process available directly fromfirms such as LSI, or indirectly through a subsidy house. What this book discusses is subsidy publishing. The author holds a position with Infinity.com, a well-known subsidy publisher.The widespread prejudice in the industry against subsidy published books is never discussed. Subsidy publishing makes it easy to print books but hard to sell them. Reviewers, libraries, bookstores etc. will generally not consider books with a subsidy imprint. The alternative is true self publishing, which involves dealing directly with a printer, either POD or offset, but this option is never discussed in this lengthy book.The value of this book is in the surveys the author has conducted among those who used subsidy publishing, and what they would do differently if they had it to do all over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash of original Fighter Destiny","review":"If you already have the original Fighters Destiny, do not buy this one.

In books that spend more time on examples and explanation, a student might notice a typo or two, but particularly in such an abbreviated book as this, a typo can be very bewildering if you don't already know the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping tale of courage and faith!","review":"I love this book! I have read it at least three times. In the early 1500s, Sarah Poyntz, the daughter of a merchant in Antwerp, Belgium, is caught up in the life of William Tyndale. Because of his work in translating the Bible into English, he is a wanted man. Although it puts them in deadly peril, Sarah's family shelters him from his enemies. Sarah Poyntz, the heroine of the book, risks her life to take an English Bible to the court of Henry VIII. Although the king is hostile to letting the Bible be printed in English, eventually he relents. This book is excellent story of a young girl's courage, and it is based on truth as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Max und Moritz","review":"\\"Ah, the wickedness one sees or is told of such as these!\\" This is the story of the little boys Max and Moritz and the trouble they get into. The book is written in six languages, given consecutively paragraph by paragraph: German, English, French, Spanish, Italian, and Latin. What is even more clever, all six versions rhyme! \\"Ay, los ninos revoltosos suelen ser los mas famosos!\\" To make it even better, the book is filled with black and white illustrations. It is worth it just to look at the pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting story and an easy read.","review":"I thought the use if the 1989 San Francisco earthquake and the ensuing problems was a very interesting vehicle for starting the story and then weaving the murder investigation in between the aftershocks and other dilemmas.

None of them really works well because of the oblique illuminating angle. Finally, I figured goose necks are necessary to provide a coverage.This little music stand light works really well for me to play guitar at midnight. It is a little dim but is completely acceptable for night usage. The atmosphere it creates when the surrounding is completely dark is just wonderful.But, the ambient is not as dim, this light is kind of weak.The goose necks are made with very good material and are very stable even they look thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Lighting","review":"The only thing mighty about this light is it's dimness. This works only for pianists who have already memorized the score and like playing in the dark. I can't believe how many good reviews this product has received.

Because of the twin heads there are no dark spots or shadows on the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bright enough","review":"These are decent portable lights, however they are not bright enough. They will work in dark areas, but in areas with dim to moderate light these are not powerful enough. They are battery powered and the batteries last awhile but for the light output this is Negligible. The lights are flexible and I like the clip, but overall a poor product."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe answer I was looking for","review":"My wife got this for me as I tend to play the guitar in less than ideal lighting conditions. THis is the neatest little light I have ever seen. It takes 3 AAA batteries (included- but I did not find them until I was tossing the package out). And has 2 nice LEDs. The lights are bright enough for my 40 something eyes but not so bright as to introduce glare on the sheep music. The clip is plenty strong enough and even hold to my rolled edge music stand. Battery life so far has been at least 8 hours (actually probably 12 hours as my daughter has been using the light also). I love the ease at which the lights are adjustable. A real needed item is you play in darker rooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not meet expectations","review":"I purchased this music stand light in order to better illuminate my sheet music stand for practicing. I found that the Mighty Bright Duet was not as bright as I had hoped. While the clamp and the bendable parts were of good construction I found that the light parts were not. The switches on top seem very delicate and the left LED light flickers on and off so poorly that it is now unusable. The product was new and only lasted a few days before I removed it due to its ineffectiveness.I am not sure if this is common amongst Mighty Bright products or if I just received a poor model, but I will not be a return customer to any Mighty Bright products. I would rather pay a little extra to get a better quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mighty Brite XtraFlex","review":"This is my second Mighty Brite.

It's great to have portable lights when performing in new venues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"Mighty Bright\\"","review":"I'm an adult taking music lessons and bought this based on recommendations here, and also because it's cordless, and I like to move my music stand around and practice in various locations, including out on the porch at night (in nice weather). I'm frankly very disappointed with the strangely faint blue light this casts on the sheet music. One or the other of the lights went out several times as I moved the heads around to illuminate dark spots on the sheet music. Then, after only 9-10 hours total use, it appears the batteries (the recommended high quality ones) have died. Strangely, my music teacher bought one after I did, and he told me he didn't like the light either. Based on reviews of other stand lights, I think I'm buying a cheap, goose-necked, plug-in clamp lamp for this purpose, and giving up on the high tech solutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product. Great value.","review":"I am very pleased with the lights. A lot easier than the electric stand lights with extension cords and having to find an electrical outlet. Plenty of light and so far battery life has not been a problem. I have tried other battery lights which were a much more expensive, and felt fortunate if the batteries lasted through one gig. We have had these for a month and have used them for 6 weddings so far. The batteries have lasted through several hours of use and the lights are still as bright as the first use. They are light-weight and compact for easy storage and transport, we carry them with us in our stand case."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice emergency music light","review":"This is a perfect light for someone who doesn't want to carry around a big stand light with a power cord, or plays in places where electrical outlets are unavailable. I picked this up because it's light, bright and cordless.I've been in too many situations where I've had to chart a course through a sea of cords from traditional stand lights. This solves the problem. It weighs very little and is extremely compact. The LED's are bright for their size and easy to adjust. Battery life is good and the bulbs will never burn out.That said, I think this light is best for low light situations where you need a little extra help reading the page. The coverage of the lights isn't quite broad enough to fully illuminate anything bigger than a two page sheet of music in a completely dark pit. For those situations, a traditional big stand light is in order. For everything else, the Mighty Bright works just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might-be-brights","review":"Might-be-brights. Slightly Brights. Disappointing. Whatever you want to call them - these lights take a lot of batteries (3 AAA!), and drain through them quickly. Once the batteries get a little bit low, the lights start flickering and are pretty dim. I bought about 20 of them to use on stage at our church, and we've been using them for a few months with disappointing results - as indicated by the affectionate nick names that our band has given them. I'm not sure there's a decent alternative in this price range, but we are surely shopping around for replacements."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so","review":"The lights are not very bright and one of my lights does not stay lit and with turn off with stage vibration.

If you Avril fans really think Avril is a great guitarist, than why don't you go take a month of guitar lessons from a skilled music teacher?

Keep it down though or you may be hearing from the neighbours. I know a lot of people that would complain just to have a pic of her in the house. Poor girl. At least she has her so called fans. Her strange fans who think she can sing. Her strange fans who believe her Grandad is dead and she actually wrote a song about it. Anyway, back to the album. Don't buy it.

No offence Avril!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why such rage?","review":"How can you Avril fans enjoy something as vile as Avril Lavigne's music? Its just so harsh and aggressive...every song is packed full of hate from one end to the other. Loud, noisy, aggressive and bitter, Avril screams out loud in furious expressions of rage and frustration. She sounds like she wants to kill somebody! The noisy guitars are played at deafening volume, making the anger and agression twice as bad. You Avril fans need to start listening to positive, optimistic music. Now I know you probably think of all optimistic music as \\"cheesy\\" or \\"manufactured\\", but you're wrong. Just because a song is subtle and finely crafted rather than aggessive, noisy trash does not mean it is cheesy. DOn't listen to Avril Lavigne.

She's learning that it takes more than flashy studio work and having two older guys pen the songs to make a good album.Still, even though her lyrics are more personal, the music doesn't really appeal to me; though it is slightly less annoying than on \\"Let Go\\". If you didn't like that album, I'd suggest this one instead and maybe she'll keep learning as time goes buy and turn into a decent artist someday.One can only hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow..this is called Music?","review":"Its sad because some people thinks this is music.

And people don't listen to the other people because they are wrong and they want her gone because there jealous of her. All of her songs are very good. and all of her videos are very delightful. If I could be any pop or rock star I'd be happy. Her expression shows of how her life was. And her clothes are just the latest style. Avril likes to be who she really is not another person. Her style is the expression on her face that she wears everyday. I think Avril is very talented and the words describe her life how she and her boyfriend broke up and that stuff. She is very pretty and has a great voice. That's why she's here right know because of those good viewers!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avrils Latest Masterpiece.","review":"this CD is a must have. i give it 5 stars. every song tells a story, one which every person who listens too it, can relate too.this is why we love it when Avril is mad, she creates masterpieces like \\" TOGETHER\\" and \\"MY HAPPY ENDING\\" that will have any one who listens to it fall instantly in love with it...and the canadian punk rocker. this is my favorite cd of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril is done it","review":"I am is proud of Avril.

The lyrics in this album are much serious and you can relate to them more. The voice of Avril is great in this album, she is a good singer. The piano in the whole album makes the songs better. The best songs in the album are My happy ending, Nobody's home, He wasn't (the song may seem to hilary duff pop, but the lyrics are deep \\"He never make me feel like I was special/ He isn't really what I'm looking for\\"), Take me away, Fall to pieces, and Forgotten. There are no fillers here. If you really like Avril, I recommend you buy her acoustic cd at Target, she sounds awseome."},{"rating":"2","title":"too poppy for a \\"punk queen\\"","review":"this CD is good...i definatly like her 1st CD better...it was more more lyricly inclined.

It's a bit more evolved and grown up, and is better in my opinion. The songs are more diverse and you never really feel like you're listening to the same thing over and over again. Overall a very good CD, highly recommended :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu-Metal?","review":"apparantly with the fading of the pop punk scene Avril had to slant her image and music towards the nu metal scene to stay popular.

There is no better example of how bad popular cuture has become in the 21st century than Avril Lavigne. 10 years ago, or maybe even only 5 years ago, Avril Lavigne would have been handed a bar of soap, a washcloth, and some prozac, then laughed off the stage. Today she is a \\"rock star\\". The fact that this CD has sold 6 million copies is meaningless. Big record sales don't prove that a performer has musical talent. All they prove is that people will buy anything if it is hyped and marketed enough. If you want to be Lemming #6,000,001, than by all means, go ahead and buy this sensationalized piece of garbage.

Very listenable, with much of it potential hit material. Not the same as her first album, but suprisingly, still good, and listenable.

She has really gone to far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real talent, real music...","review":"In regards to everyone's extremely harsh and farfetched comments about her follow-up album not living up to her first, I dont think you truly understand what it takes to be a real musician. This girl is far from what you could consider a pop-star. She does her own make-up for goodness sakes...and she doesnt lip-sync her concerts. Just because there isn't a \\"sk8er boi\\" track on the album, you are so quick to say that it sucks. Sk8er boi was the worst track on \\"Let Go\\" by far. If you take a second to actually read the lyrics of the songs (which she wrote) and listen to the music (which she also wrote) then you might actually see what good music is instead of this pop-princess Britney Spears crap. Thank god for Avril Lavigne, maybe all these other \\"pop-stars\\" will go away and music will be what it once was. Buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kurt Cobain of the 21st century","review":"All you Avril loving juvenile delinquents are probably too young to remember this, but back in the early 90s, there was an awful alternative rock band from Seattle called Nirvana. They wore baggy clothes, didn't bathe, and had limited musical skills. Sounds familiar doesn't it?I think the 20 plus crowd should clearly remember that awful band and realise that Avril Lavigne is a reincarnation of Kurt CObain. So many similarities:1. Neither one of them bathe2. Both of them have limited guitar playing ability3. Both of them yell the lyrics as opposed to singing them.4. They both constantly complain about how miserable life is.Maybe if we're lucky, Avril will follow in Kurt's footsteps and blow her head off. I sure wish Avril was dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"POSER","review":"avril lavigne is a huge poser and should not be allowed to make any cds or anything. why does she say that she hates britney spears when she goes on trl just like britney!!!! if you want some real punk music, listen to rancid, offspring, and bad religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"I like a lot this album, i think that is better than her debut cause she is more mature in this one. Avril is an excellent composer she writes all her songs, she is very talented in that way. She can perform VERY good, but sometimes she screams so much!. My fav. songs are: Together, Don't Tell Me, How Does It Feel, My Happy Ending, Fall To Pieces, Slipped Away. Those are my personal favs. but all the songs are \\"cool\\"!.Go Avril!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good CD","review":"just when people thought complicated would lead her to one hit wonder status, she came back with this well produced album in which she had a hand in writing a lot of the songs, which are far more superior to the ones on Let Go.

Well, then if you can wade through the terrible, grating lyrics, the shrill voice and a modicum of flawed melodies, you can treat yourself to this overplayed mass-media catering pap. With the impressive lyrical flair of constant 'na na na nas' and (many many more) 'yea-ee-aahs,' you'll never get tired of the mind-numbing repetition! It's also really cool to spell your song-names and lyrics with (outdated) internet speak.

All she sings about are boys, how much she hates her life, and \\"the pain inside\\". Who wants to listen to that? Music is supposed to be entertaining. How can you be entertained by an entire album full of songs about \\"the pain inside\\"? There's nothing entertaining about hearing someone whine about how hard their life is.And thats all she sings about. Every song is bitter, hateful, and completely miserable. How anybody could enjoy something this negative just makes no sense to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"eeeew, this sucks out loud","review":"Did somebody say this was supposed to be punk?

Under My Skin, though, is an excellent commercial rock album, full of youthful energy. The music is not that different from what many other popular artists are producing nowadays, but is certainly far to the right of the bell curve. As for the lyrics, even though they sound odd at times (and make me really believe that a teen-ager actually wrote them), they convey a toughness that I would like to see a bit more widespread among girls today. I'd much rather hear how Avril kicked an idiot would-be boyfriend than groan while listening to another of the innumerable \\"I luuuuuuuv you\\" songs so common in pop music.The album also gets better with time, which is always good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just can't get the songs out of my head","review":"This album is generally far better than 'Let Go' cos all the songs are equally so much nicer than those previous ones. Wanna highlight two generic songs 'Don't Tell me' and 'Happy Ending', they are really really 2 of the best songs I've ever heard. Thank u Avril for bringing us such a well-explained emotion out this album.Besides, 'How Does It Feel' is stunning, too. Don't you guyz think the ending part can only be performed by Avril with her unique voice and she's been shouting out loud just great to touch everybody's heart.Hope to see her third single coming out as this song and I wonder what the video would look like. She's too cool to resist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented young lady","review":"Worth every penny, Avril is extremely talented. She stated that when she was writing for this cd she had more music in her but that they had to tell her to stop so that they could get the cd out in time. Her first cd was a tad too young sounding for me (much like He Wasn't, which is my least fave song on the cd), but this cd is much better, I can only imagine what her next cd will sound like. My favorite songs are Nobodys Home, Together, and Slipped Away (written for her grandfather after he passed away)."},{"rating":"1","title":"How in the hell is this a top-seller ?","review":"Where is the world going these days ?

Yes and we all often get lost on the way, then everyone judges us on our mis-steps.The overall feeling I get is theres a great deal of real true feelings here.

We both have country roots - as you all know, she tried her hand at country music, but since she failed at it, she went PUNK! And she's really good at the punk scene, too. The second I saw her wearing studded bracelets and ties, I thought, \\"She is such an individual!!\\" And I knew we were sooo destined. Her latest CD has continued her tradition of hardcore punk rock, and leaves me speechless every time I hear her whiny Canadian voice! I read this article about Avril saying how much she hates Hilary Duff because she isn't punk. That's so rad, Avril!!! If Avril hates her, then so do I. I think to myself \\"What would Avril do?\\" before I do ANYTHING!!! So mostly the only thing I do is shop at Hot Topic and get stoned a lot.

Her sophomore record it's sold to the masses, obviously she wants to sell more and more. many of the tracks in this album are cardboard copies of SKE8R BOI(HE WASN'T) or I'M WITH YOU(DON'T TELL ME), no wonder only one track manage to arrive at the top 10 MY HAPPY ENDING that is not that original....only NOBODY'S HOME was more original painfully real, but the damaged was done and the track only made it to #41, so sad for Miss Lavigne, but that's what happen when your album is not different from Lindsay Lohan and Hilary Duff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under My Skin","review":"I'm not an Avril fan although I do enjoy some of her (previous) songs from Let Go. However, I have to say that 'Under My Skin' was a HUGE dissapointement.The only song on the album I actually play is 'Together' and still I try to avoid the ending of it(not a fan of her screaming, sorry). 'Take Me Away' has got quite good lyrics, I can partly relate too but again, the chorus ... not for me. 'He Wasn't' is probably one of the most annoying song ever.Plus crap lyrics. So all in all, not a good song.'How does it feel' has nice melody but again, I think the lyrics are a bit pointless. 'Don't Tell Me' was overplayed so much that I almost hate it same for 'My Happy Ending'.As I said before, I expected a really great, outstanding album but most of the songs either sound the same, have lyrics I'd not call 'good written' or some annoying screaming in it. In conclusion: Let Go was far better and clearly more various."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!","review":"The first time I listented to this CD, I was a little worried.

They could actually sing, play instruments, write songs, and generally please the ear, as opposed to this day and age, where performers wear oversized clothes and spend more time breaking things and shouting obscenities than they do singing. I mean what an irratating, god awful racket this is! Avril Lavigne just screams aggressive lyrics over the blurring racket of noisy guitars. Its not even music at all really, its just loud...loud and irratating. How can kids actually ENJOY such an eardrum threatening noise level? It hurts my ears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Hate Avril, But...","review":"I LOVE this CD! I know it's terrible to admit, since I'm one of those pretentious emo-listening fools. But, what the hell. This CD is catchy and melodic. It might just be the production, but when it's done well, it's done well. For pop music, this is damned good. Just hide the CD when your friends come over."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can I put this?","review":"Horrible! I don't know what's with this \\"synthetic music\\" but I fear that it may be carcinogenic. I might have to report this to the FDA.Avril's Image: Dark eye make-up and clothing (omg its a TIE), but with pop songs. I guess she's for all you TruE AlTEnaTivE PuNK RaWk kids out there. It pained me to type that.Avril's Music: Trite, repetitive and boring. Has she done anything Britney/Duff/your little sister hasn't? With talent?Ok, so I covered both aspects that a music fan (of today) might care about. That means that I have provided valid critcism of an invalid \\"artist\\", which means that you can't dismiss me saying I'm just a faux-depressed little mallgoth who is obsessed with slipknot and can't take another incompetent group being more popular than their's."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS POP MUSIC!","review":"Ok, avril fans, lets just get one thing straight. AVRIL'S MUSIC IS POP, NOT ROCK!!! Obviously y'all have never heard real rock music. I don't see how you could say it's rock???? REAL rock music has LOUD guitars, bass and drums. Where as Avril's music has been polished over way too much creating a crappy pop-rock sound.I'm not hating on you for liking her. You can listen to Avril, but don't go around saying she's a rocker.Just face it, this girl will NEVER ROCK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"y0, where da white women at?!","review":"Y0 Y0 Y0 HOME SKELLETZ!!!1!!

I can listen to it over and over without getting tired of it. It's a very enjoyable CD and I can listen to the whole thing without skipping songs all the time. Most of the songs are fun to sing along too and they are really cool. This album is a lot more \\"rock\\" than her other album which is probably why a lot more people like her now. Her other album was more pop, but I love both the albums.This is what I rate the songs:1. Take Me Away, 3 of 5 stars2. Together, 5 of 5 stars3. Don't Tell Me, 5 of 5 stars4. He Wasn't, 4 of 5 stars5. How Does it Feel, 4 of 5 stars6. My Happy Ending, 5 of 5 stars7. Nobody's Home, 5 of 5 stars8. Forgotten, 4 of 5 stars9. Freak Out, 3 of 5 stars10. Slipped Away, 5 of 5 starsAll in all, I'd say this is an awesome album. It's pretty rare that you find an album where you love about 90% of the songs. But this is one of them. Go Avril! You're albums rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is An Awesome Album!!!!!!!!","review":"this was an awesome album i listen to the songs every day! she is very energetic and shows incredible songs! This album is awesome. i love her song \\"dont tell me\\" because it has cool lyrics and the backround really sounds like whats her song is going through. Avril Lavigne is awesome!!!!!!!!! She is the best!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good album for her this go around","review":"I don't keep up on most music that is aimed at the younger generation and am a huge 80's fan myself but after seeing her on Jingle Bell Rock I decided to give her latest album a try. Much to my surprise I was quite impressed overall with her singing style and the overall feel of the album. I think if she can manage to grow her music as she matures she will have a very successful career ahead of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"So help me If I hear another Avril song","review":"The problem I have with this singer is the job I work at plays the songs: \\"Sk8r Boi\\", \\"Im with you\\", \\"Complicated\\", \\"Happy Ending\\" and \\"Nobody's Home\\" 50 BILLION times a day. I know the all the words, rhyme schemes, and rhythm patterns like the back of my hand. She might be alright if I didnt have to listen to her songs over and over and over and over and over and OVER again until I get so pissed off that I slam a keyboard into the speaker then head-butt the stereo system while stomping her crappy albums into the ground. Now THAT sounds like a Happy Ending to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To the MTV Supporter.","review":"Hey MTV Supporter, this is for you! Seriously, do you watch MTV from 6am to 8pm? Because I think your mind is filling with useless commercial c**p that in 5 years it would be forgotten. Seriously, Avril Lavigne, the best? Ni**a! She plays as good as those poser guitarist trying to act cool in their garage and she sings as well as those unqualified contestants on American Idol! Better than Jimmi Hendrix?! Boy, you sure are one stupid person let me tell you. At least Jimmi Hendrix makes REAL MUSIC while Avril Lavigne makes forgettable \\"babosadas!\\" Yeah, she may be #1 on MTV, but only on MTV.........HA! I think REALLY she may be like #52 on the BILLBOARDS..............the REAL MUSIC DEAL!!! Ha......................take that!Do yourself a favor and stay away from MTV for at least 10 years. It's really destroying your mind. Listen to REAL CLASSICS INSTEAD!!As to the rest of the people: ANYTHING THAT GETS PLAYED ON MTV IS 100% TOTAL GARBAGE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avril who?","review":"She's an overblown wanna-be punk but sounds like Britney Spears nobody. She's overrated. She's the Shaq of music. She's just a marketing tool and this album sums it all up. The songs are not up to par and has she ever had singing lessons cause she needs em. She sounds like she's hurting herself. And what is wrong wtih her? She rich and seems happy so why does she dress and act like she's got a chip on her shoulder or pretend skateboarding is her thing. Avril fans need to take a look. This is not the real Avril and the only thing we know about her is that the lyrics in \\"Complicated\\" describe her perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avril, please take a class in creative writing","review":"I recomend this album to any girl around the age of 13 who doesn't read much and won't mind the cliche and immature lyrics like, \\"Walk around with my hands up in the air cause I just don't care,\\" and \\"I don't want to fall to pieces, I just want to sit and stare at you.\\" The very grown up,\\"Try to tell me what I shouldn't do, you should know by now I won't listen to you\\" and my personal favorite, \\"I looked away, then I looked back at you.\\" Clearly Avril is a talented story-teller.Other than the lyrics the music is a canned sort of pop that tried to sound like punk rock and failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just horible","review":"I've listened to a lot of music in my lifetime. I've heard everything from opera to gangsta rap to death metal, and I can safely say that this is the worst singing I've EVER heard. That squeaky, screechy voice...its just so awful, so utterly talentless, so...IRRATATING! When Avril hits the high notes in a song, she sounds just like a pig getting slaughtered! Its just so awful, how could anybody listen to this???"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this one","review":"I like this CD a lot. It's very Avril with lots of angst, and hurt. Lots of ballads, a lot of songs you can sing a long to.Fall to Pieces is a favorite of mine on this CD, and upbeat song. It also includes \\" My happy ending\\" with a different beginning- a different sound. I am not sure the album shows much growth from her last album but it was good too, and Avril is in pretty uncharted waters here anyways....as most of her counterparts are less rock, and more bubble gum. It's a CD you can listen to more than once over and find a new one you like. There are a few songs on here that are a little weak....but otherwise it's a good cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of improvment","review":"Considering I had a field-day ripping her first album, I feel obligated to point out the improvment Avril's made in her second effort.Clearly she's placing the right people around her and it's starting to show. She's still got a long way to go before she gains any TRUE credibility, but she's quickly making up a lot of ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under My Skin is Quality","review":"Avril's new CD really shows that she's matured since Let Go was released in 2002. Under My Skin a more hard rock than Let Go but there are still soft songs on it. Overall the CD is very good, lyric wise and musically. There are thriving bass lines and guitar riffs which quality drumming. The CD overall is very good and is a must own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril - \\"Under My Skin\\"","review":"I bought this album the day it came out. It is by far the best buy I've made this summer. Avril really opens up in this album, her music has really matured since her first album \\"Let Go\\" I recommend everyone go to your local music store and check out Avril Lavigne \\"Under My Skin\\" It's great!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable..","review":"She has a decent voice that I don't mind listening to, but her lyrics are just really predictable and simple. Not really that creative. Some are really stupid and childish. \\"He wouldn't even open up the door\\" that line to me shows that she needs to take time and perfect her writing or have the Matrix write her songs again. Some of the melodies are pretty good, such as Take Me Away, but you can tell that she is trying hard to get radio airplay. None of it is really impressive to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"avril makes garbage again..","review":"Let go was BAD enough..I listened to the whole album (my friend is obsessed with her..) she sucks.. common avril! put just a little effort into your music! If you are looking for decent pop DONT BUY THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, rock on Avril!!!","review":"I didn't really listen to Avril's first CD Losing Grip because it was good. ONLY good, not great. I just decided to buy this CD because people said that is was good. When I listened to it, I couldn't stop listening to it!!!!! It was great. My friends and I always sing her songs. You can really tell she doesn't use back up singers. She is a REAL punk rocker!!!! Not like Hilary. But Hilary Duff is great also.The last song made me remeber my grandpa who died. I started to cry! It definatly touched my heart and broke it.!!!! But I loved it. BUY THIS CD! IT'S GREAT! NOT GOOD, GREAT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant...","review":"Something tells me that Green Day, Sum 41, the loathsome Avril Lavigne, and the rest of the genre could have achieved as much musicality if they were playing car horns and trash cans as opposed to musical instruments. Do you self-deluded 'rebels' really think pop punk was about non-conformity and individual-ism? It was about finding a new way of separating a bunch of gullable, immature fools from their money. Mission accomplished.\\"Pogo on dudes! Duh!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"For all the demoter...","review":"Don't get jealous dude and dudettes, I mean if you think she's not good why in the world you come into here in the first place and if you hadn't listen to the whole album how could you review at all? And if you've bought and listen to this album, then if you hate it you gotta be stupid to buy it in the first place? Either way....its irrational to hate something before giving it a chance and above all its stupid. When you already bought this album, heard all through, give it a chance, then come back and review! I love Avril for her style, fake or not, live with it, every star out there has a fake image, that's called entertainment business dudes!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This CD is very boring. Its a good CD if you want to fall a sleep.These songs are dull and lack character."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHO CARES A @#*%!","review":"Why does everyone care what they listen to? \\"It's not goth\\", \\"that's not punk\\", \\"what do they think they are, they're not country\\". All this stuff about not being true goth, punk, country, rock, pop, etc. is all stupid, IT DOESN'T MATTER, QUIT CARING IF IT'S THE REAL STUFF OR NOT! JUST AS LONG AS IT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME!!! So instead of wasting your time and breathe by being picky if it's true this or true that, JUST LISTEN TO WHAT SOUNDS GOOD TO YOU!By the way, I think Avril Lavigne is the co0lest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"......","review":"First off, I never ever EVER want to hear ANY avril song referred to as punk. This girl is as poppy and fake as all the people she critisizes. If you do think this is punk then you plain and simple have never heard punk. Avrils songwriting hasn't \\"grown\\" or \\"matured.\\" The few songs she actually writes are still the same old stuff from the last cd. Its rediculous that this girl sells any records period. It proves single-handedly that all record companies do these days is snatch up someone with a little talent, give them a whole new band, and throw 14 songs their way. Then they leave it to MTV to shove it down peoples throats and they start buying the cds. Music is sad these days and people like avril lavigne are the reason why."},{"rating":"1","title":"I need an Advil","review":"My god! I hate Avril! She is so fake! I mean se denies that she is \\"Punk\\" and yet she wears a \\"Kiss me Im punk\\" pin and she is always in picsturs trying to look the part. Also she is not a nice person. She hates all her preppy fans. Go listen to good music like CKY or The Distillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avril Lavigne--\\"Under My Filthy Skin\\"","review":"I don't know why everybody likes Avril Lavigne but me. Her voice is screechy and tinney. The lyrics are self pitying and whiney. The guitars drone and make noise far more often than anything even remotely passable as music. Not to mention the fact that she was manufactured by her record company!Also, the biggest reason why I don't like her is because she is the trashiest and sleaziest pop star I've ever seen. It looks like she hasn't bathed in 10 years! Its disgusting! She looks like a hooker who has to sell her body in order to pay for her heroin habit.Can you belive Derik Whebley from sum 41 wants to marry this filthy animal? I wouldn't want to come within 100 feet of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"avril no longer an idol","review":"u noe i used 2 like avril b/c she proved that u didn't have 2 use sex 2 get attention. but this album is dissapointing she wore mak-up in her videos. and then i heard her sing live and was like wats up with her voice. i also heard her voice in her 1st album and it was alanis morsitte. its also dissapointing because this album songs are about the same thing w/ the exception of don't tell me. and she says its a rock album and its so not a rock album its a alternate rock/ pop album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril At The Top!!!!!!!!","review":"Do you like this album? Well guess what? I loved it! In this CD Avril sings a lot of her songs and the lyrics to the songs come along with the CD. There is also two bonus tracks to the CD and they both rock! If you love this album you should also buy Avril's other CD \\"Avril Lavigne Let Go\\" this CD includes songs like Avril's #1 hit song \\"Complicated\\". The CD also has \\"Sk8er Boi\\" \\"My World\\" and a lot more!. So I reccomend you to buy both CD's! I hope you enjoy this CD as much as I do. I guarantee you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blew me away","review":"This CD is amazing. I enjoyed the first CD. This CD, however, blew me away. I could relate to so many of the songs. I especially like number 7 (nobody's home), because I could relate to it in my own way, just as I could number 8 (have you forgotten). If you didn't like Avril's first CD, I would recommend buying this CD and giving her another shot. I think we see the true Avril come out in this CD, not the Avril that the producers wanted to promote on the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"Avril is completely and totally fake. She's a no talent ass-clown, and it doesn't surprise me one bit that she sells a lot of records since she's being marketed to today's youth. She calls herself punk. Hahahahaha. What a joke. Punk? Has she heard herself? The Ramones are punk. The Buzzcocks? Punk. The Clash? Yep, you guessed it -- punk. Avril is a little brat who thinks the world owes her something. Well honey, no one owes you a damn thing, and if someone did somehow, in some way, owe you something, I think it would be more along the lines of telling you the truth about how much you frickin suck!And on a side note, why do people write reviews using letters and numbers instead of whole words? It makes you look very ignorant."},{"rating":"1","title":"whin whin whin...","review":"wow avril. u really done it this time. she started with the whole skater mentality and now shes gone to the sobbing crying baby she is. this cd is filled with nothing but her problems. way to go avril....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Yo thugs, how r ya!!!!.

She claims to be the \\"anti-Britney\\" or whatever, yet writes songs that are just as poppy, and basically aimed at the same audience.

If you want to hear decent pop music, listen to something like U2, or even No Doubt...at least they are good songwriters, with music that will stand the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"For what its worth, this this a bitchin' albulm!!","review":"I first heard this entire CD on mtv.com. I was surprised. For not previously owning an Avril CD, I loved it. Most of the songs are catchy which is great depending on what your looking for. Defenitly worth buying. I went out today to do just that, after hearing the CD several times, initially for one song \\"How does it feel\\". Miss Lavigne depics herself a punk rocker badass, but if you listen to the lyrics on some of the songs on this albulm she is not afraid of being real and a down right girl, feelings and all. Call it rock, or pop, or pop/rock, its awesome. Her sound on this albulm? think Alanis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Growth!","review":"I have always been a huge fan of Avril, but it wasn't until I listened to Under My Skin in its entirety that I realized what an amazing artist she truely is. She has shown so much growth since the release of Let Go. Not only has her song writing tremendously improved but the her voice has continued to get even better. I would definately reccommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Avril... and even if you were not before you may be after you listen to Under My Skin... It really rocks!!! Highlights of the album are the first single Don't Tell Me, as well as My Happy Ending, Nobody's Home, and Fall To Pieces. The entire album however is truely great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's point and laugh!","review":"This sh i t ty Canadian emo girl known as Avril Lavigne is making ears bleed everywhere.

How can anyone in the entire fu c king world compare this cr a p to The Sex Pistols?! Man is the apocalypse coming, just like what Mills said... Avoid this waste management and listen to real punk like The Ramones, The Misfits(Danzig), The Sex Pistols, The Clash, Black Flag, MC5, or Pennywise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The year: 1992. The mag: Sassy. The results: Fabulous.","review":"Avril is canadian, and as her country loves to flaunt, it is a half-english-speaking, half-french-speaking country. Therefore, when Avril says \\"Skayer (I'm a punk because I spell phonetically) Boi\\", don't you think she'd be pronouncing it \\"bwa\\", similar to the way the french word for drink is pronounced (\\"bois\\")? Just askin'. Oh, wait a minute, I'm a Avril fan, so I can't be an intelligent person or show my vulnerable side. So, um...I hate you!!!... and school sucks!!!When was the last time Cobain was the main feature of a teen mag some kid below asks? The year was 1992.

Its horrible.","review":"Ok, I didn't listen to the whole album. I didn't even buy it. Why? Cause I knew if I did, it would be a waste of my money.

Then when the album came out I heard it was harder music than first album. So, I downloaded \\"He Wasn't\\". Bad idea. Avril's vocals are horrible. Her voice is annoying. She's also a horrible writer...thats if she even WRITES her own music.I hate it. I knew that if I heard only one song from the album and I hated it...I would hate the rest of the album too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Living off of past success","review":"I have to give Avril credit, she really knows how to market herself. You are Pop, but you call yourself punk and you act all hard. You attacked Britney Spears and say hurtful things about her when you have not even met her. Avril the anti Britney, is more manufactored than Britney, all the way to that stupid tie.It funny that the production team the wrote 98 percent of her lyrics, actually worked with Britney Spears and Hilary Duff.

First off the girl is a bit annoying if you will. She is rude to her fans, she calls herself things that arn't true, and have you ever seen this girl on a skateboard other then in her videos? She needs to change her attitude or prove some things, and not just flip off the camera and wear a tutu with combat boots. She is the reason we have one of the worst word in the history of time today: \\"The poser\\". She practly made that a house hold saying...and it's not something a real \\"punk\\" would say. Now on to her music. She's a bit...let's say whiney. She's way to pop punk for her own good. Anyway...I guess I don't know alot about her music other then I dislike it. But to all the Avril fans out there...more power to you..I prolly wouldn't beable to stand an idol that was rude to me for dressing like her and acually liking her.

Do something!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"I would like to apologize to all of the people who saw a good review of this cd, went out and wasted 15 bucks on it, and then realized that it was the worst album EVER. In 2002, Avril released \\"Let Go\\". I thought nothing could be as horrible musically until I heard \\"Under My Skin\\". Avril hardly writes any of her music, then she sings it horribly with abysmal guitars, bass, and drums. She is a poser. She bashes Hilary Duff and Britney for being to artificial, then to show it she goes on trl and says shes punk. The first thing I thought when I saw a commercial for it was \\"wasn't Britney on a few days ago?\\" She is not hardcore by any means and is a disgrace to any musician or music listener. Also, I believe that people that are truly punk rockers HATE CORPORATIONS. Avril is a postergirl for everything artificial and bad. This is not real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note to Avril Lavigne","review":"You can't sing. Your voice is more annoying than Gilbert Gottfried and Fran Drescher's laugh combined. You are not fooling anyone with your \\"punk\\" image (except maybe 11 year old girls). You make Munky (from Korn) look like Tony Macalpine or Steve Vai with your ability for playing the guitar. You are as about hardcore as Lindsay Lohan. I could go on but I don't feel like it. If you want to listen to good female singers, listen to Sarah Mclachlan, Tori Amos. If you want to listen to good punk, listen to Bad Religion, Strung Out. Anything but Avril Lavigne. And while I'm at it, anything but Ashlee Simpson, Lindsay Lohan, and Hillary Duff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hilariously awful approximation of rock music","review":"Avril Lavigne does not write songs. She writes lyrics. Other people write the music. Avril Lavigne whines constantly that she is not given recognition for her abilities on guitar, yet does not play guitar even once on this record. All Avril Lavigne has to do is show up at the studio with terrible, monosybillic poetry of the junior-high variety, and she goes triple-platinum. With all of this in mind, it's hard to figure out what has to be angry about. Nearly every song here is a faux-grunge dirge, polished and compressed, ready-made for the shopping mall. Avril Lavigne was kind of cute and funny when she released her first album; her tremendous attitude and lack of any musical talent, though, have rendered her irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter tripe","review":"Do yourself and everyone else a favour and don't buy this.

Now back to the album, it sucks, every song sucks, everything about this album sucks. She can't even play a guitar. I bet I'M better than her, and i'm still taking lessons!! There's really nothing else for me to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok...","review":"Har! Lets flame everyone who doesn't agree with us! The fact is, you guys who think this 19 year old \\"genius\\" *cough* is good are complete morons. The fact is, don't mistake lack of talent for genius. I don't even have to listen to this album. I know it sucks. The single was on the radio on the way to school (unfortunantly) and I already know every song on here will be horrible. I agree with antiradio. Listen to some Dream Theater, or Opeth, or Slayer for bands that are much, much more talented than Avril laughasosgah... and don't bash The cure just because MTV doesn't tell you to like them and you can't appreciate them. But anyway, after my little tangent there, my point is she sucks, and always will suck, and should give up and stop giving everyone headaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mature review","review":"Avril has an excellent voice. You can tell from the comments made that many people have no idea what a good voice is. And I think her lyrics are completely right on for a girl her age. What kind of lyrics are people expecting? I think it's nice to see someone just acting their age and writing about what is important to them. I think she has matured from her last album and I think she's doing a great job. I really enjoy the song \\"Nobody Home\\". I felt that those lyrics were painfully real."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't stand rock music!","review":"Rock stars are a bunch of no talent @ssholes. Rock music takes absolutely no talent what so ever to play or perform. All you have to to is crank the volume all the way up as loud as possible, pound the strings of your guitar, and scream into the microphone in an aggressive manner. The fact that millions of people willingly subject themselves to this noisy racket is proof that with the right marketing, people will buy anything.\\"ROCK N ROLL FOREVER!

That's just another one of her lies!","review":"I'm sick of all these reviews talking about how the song \\"Slipped Away\\" is about Avril Lavigne's grandfather dying. Do any of you brainwashed Avril fans realise that when this cd came out, Avril Lavigne was 19 years old? If your granddaughter is 19, than that would make you what, 70 maybe?. I'm 21 right now, and my grandfather is only 72, he'll probably be around for many years to come. And finally, if you look at the writing credits for it, Slipped Away (like every song she's ever done) has like four cowriters listed beside her. I doubt she wrote even a single word of that song, or any of her other songs for that matter. I can't believe she's going around telling everybody her grandfather is dead when he's probably alive and well! She should be ashamed of herself for doing such disgusting things!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Avril singing a bunch more crappy pop songs...whiny songs about hating her ex-boyfriends.

Avril Lavigne is so untalented that it isn't even funny, it's a shame! Some girl who wishes she could be punk. This isn't punk at all, this is really pop music with a guitar. Don't waste your money on this clown who wishes she was punk. Instead, listen to The Dillinger Escape Plan, Psyopus, Fear Before The March Of Fire Ants, Remembering Never, and The Red Chord! Those guys really know what they're doing on their instruments, and unlike Avril, they can actually solo, not just stand there and strum 3 easy powerchords.

This poseur is as fake as a $3 bill. If she is punk then beethoven is speed metal. Songs like My Happy Ending, Don't Tell Me and Nobody's Home are as bad as tooth decay and listening to this album can lead to diabetes. Her and them Sum 41 fools are the worst Canada has to offer. If you want great Canadian music, buy Rush or triumph or HEEGOTCHA!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"who the hell said she's punk?","review":"do you children even KNOW what punk music is? If avril had released this album in the 90's she would have been called alternative music just like alanis morisette, green day, no doubt, oasis and countless others were called, because THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE IS! An alternative music artist! If you totally forget the term punk even exists while listening to this CD(cause she has nothing to do with punk) I'm sure you'll appreciate it for the good music avril has on this CD. It's much more mature than her first album with deep lyrics, good songwriting and great guitar riffs. It's not music for teenagers, she's obviously appealing to adult contemporary radio too. You can tell avril has let herself be influenced by other musical artists while recording this CD and it shows. Good job avril."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, Avril, you're cool","review":"Just wanted to address something real quick: I read on amiannoying.com (great site, BTW) that Avril called her fans a bunch of losers for \\"copying her style\\". Yeah, real sharp, Avril. This is what its come to. To Avril, as long as the unwashed masses keep buying into her schlop, and she gets more millions coming in, she's fine. Talk about biting the hand that feeds.Avril here, Ashlee Simpson, etc. not only are horrible \\"artists\\", but they obviously show absolute zero respect for their fans. This just makes me miss Dimebag Darrell (RIP) even more, because he obviously loved his fans so much. He would go back and party with them as if they were old friends. Now we have Avril Lavigne calling all the 13-year-old pre-teen girls buying into her junk \\"losers\\". (Actually, she may have a point...)As for the music itself, or, more importantly, whether she's \\"punk\\" or not... related searches for \\"Avril Lavigne\\" include \\"Britney Spears\\". 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody pass Avril some deodorant!","review":"Avril Lavigne is just VILE. I've never seen anyone this disgusting in my life. I don't think I've ever seen a picture of her where she looks clean and neat. Every time I've ever seen her it looks like she hasn't bathed in years! Everything about her is greasy. Her hair, her skin, everything. In that video for Complicated, she lifts her arms making sure the camera gets a good shot of her greasy armpits! I think I'm going to be sick! I can't reccommend this CD to anybody who bathes more than once a month!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not who you think...","review":"Avril is not the type of person you think she is. She cant play guitar,she just strums on any chord she can, she even said so in a magizine. She cant sing either, She claims to be punk but look at her. Shes not even close, Punk died along time ago. If you want real punk music, then listen to bands like..Sex Pistols,Ramones,Clash,Dead Kennedys,Operation Ivy,Bad Religon,New York Dolls, I dont see the newer punk bands screaming out there lungs or writing lyrics that make no sense. I dont see the newer punks doing crazy things and punks were never on MTV...What are you little kids thinking these days? I am not telling you to not listen to her or anything but shes not what people think"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wannabe!","review":"Everyone here is gonna give me unhelpful votes cause they think I'm jealous of her. YOU WISH! I'm sick of people calling her punk rock and a musical genious. If abusing your fans and yelling profanity's is what you call punk, then yes, I guess Avril is punk. I'm really sick of my neighbor's teenybopping 14-year old teenybopping daughter laughing at me 'cause I listen to Pink Floyd and Aerosmith.

Claim to be punk, even though emo kids are more punk than you2. Write music that claims to be punk, but is pure pop3.

If anyone comes up to me and says she is punk, I'd call them an MTV poser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"Well, actually 3 and a half stars, but you can't do that, so I'll round it up. Avril has matured a lot since the last one, and the songs have harsher lyrics and are rock more than pop. I like it, personally. High points: the hit My Happy Ending, Take Me Away, and Don't Tell Me. They're catchy and you can relate to them. Low points: He Wasn't and How Does It Feel. They have crappy lyrics and How Does It Feel barely even has a tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril Lavigne, Under My Skin...","review":"Avril Lavigne is really a wonderful singer! I got to see her afew months ago, she has a great voice and her songs rock. She writes her own songs which showcase her talent, so many artists today can't even play an instrument. She can, and she does, and she does it well. Losing Grip, and Nobody's Home by Avril Lavigne, Behind These Hazel Eyes by Clarkson, Down Home by Corinna Fugate, and of course, Shadow, by Ashlee Simpson. Fans of Ashlee Simpson, Michelle Branch, and Corinna Fugate will love Avril Lavigne's heartfelt release, Under My Skin. They write from their souls, and you can feel it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album talks about love the way it should be.","review":"This album talks about love in a way that is real and tangible. It shows how light and love can be together in a way that lifts. This is the essence of life. It can help you explore relationships in a new way. This album can save you in a way that one cannot mention.It describes love at a distance. This can lead to power, blood and death. This album gives you the hope that you can find someone new or old with out fear. You past comes alive with renewal. This album is about being sensual about love. It tell you to give and receive it in new ways that you never even thought possible. It is the way that love really it is today."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it...","review":"I don't quite get what is so good about Avril Lavigne. Cause she's certainly not anywhere near good rock music. And as for female rock musicians she stalls far behind the likes of Sheryl Crow. So is she just better than the average pop musician? And what's with her \\"punk\\" image. She's not punk at all, but it seems to be so wrapped up in her music that it taints it. Her music just isn't very good...so why does it pass?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"This album simply rocks!It is more mature from let go(although it was good too)and the lyrics and music are more much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A whole other side of Avril","review":"The Avril on this album is heartbroken, confused, angry, in love, melancholy, and a bit jaded. Avril penned all of the songs on this album, making it more intimate. The best thing about Avril's album is its realness. The songs themselves are not over-produced, synthesized tunes. If you listen closely, you hear guitars, piano, violins, drums, etc. That makes Avril unique because everything I've picked up lately has been so...fake.The songs are a bit more mature than her 1st album. They're a bit diverse, making Avril a chamelon. Her songs fit every mood. Angsty(\\"Take Me Away\\", \\"Freak Out\\"), retrospective(\\"My Happy Ending\\", \\"Together\\", \\"Nobody's Home\\"), and sad(\\"Slipped Away\\").5 stars all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"!!Avril rocks on!!","review":"First off I would like to say that this CD is better than Let Go. Avril's voice has matured, her songs sound more personal, and they have more meaning to them. My favorite song on the CD has to be #12 Slipped Away, it was decated to her grandfather who passed away. My other favorites were #2,5,6,7. If you liked Let Go then you will definitely like Under My Skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chantal Kreviazuk's mini-me","review":"Seriously, anyone who has followed Chantal Kreviazuk's music/songwriting/singing must agree with me,that Avril's new album is fully Chantal influenced and inspired! Which is great 'cause they're both Amazing Canadian Talent!! You can hear \\"Chantal\\" in the writing, music arrangment and in Avril's voice which she sometimes inmitates!! Very good Album, much more mature then the last....more songwriting and melodic driven!! (Chantal influence I suppose) So, even if you're not an Avril Fan, this is a great \\"Chantal Kreviazuk\\" Album as well!!! Go get it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !","review":"It's my brother who bought Avril's CD and when he did it I really thought I won't like it. Now I realize that I was wrong.I've been very very surprised the first time I listened the disc.First off I'd like to say that all the disc sounds as lots of bands I've already bought. But it's not a trouble 'cos in a way Avril came off to find her own style. I like a lot the way she sings. Even if some melodies seem a bit familiar, I really enjoy this CD. My favourite song is Who Knows I love the very begining of this song. The sixth is awesome too I like the chorus. Actually, apart from the eighth and the tenth I like all songs. Avril's got such a beautiful voice.Just to recap I would say that the disc isn't quite original but exciting a lot. If you like beautiful melodies and powerful electric guitars, you'll enjoy ze CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"her debut was better","review":"this album is just overhyped and overall pretty crappy. none of the songs stand out, they all blend together. the vocals are pretty weak and the lyrics are laughable at times. if you want a better album, buy \\"Let go.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A great second outing for Avril","review":"Avril Lavigne's Under My Skin is an exceptional collection of music from a sophisticated musician who shows wisdom and comprehension beyond her years. Some reviewers may dismiss her as a typical angry and angst-ridden skater teen or as a product of other performers, but the truth is evident in track 5 of her newest release. How Does It Feel, a piece that seeks to describe the experience of a newborn child, reveals a musician who has her finger on the pulses and rhythms of life. Track 1, Take Me Away, is a great rock n roll song, with innovative musical textures that are actually found quite often in Avril's work. As one listens to this and her first album over and over, those threads and textures reveal themselves. Yes, folks, she's a good one and she's here to stay. This album is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow up to \\"Let Go\\"","review":"Though many people have different tastes I found Under My Skin to be far from dissapointing. For many artists their second CD isn't as big of a success as their first. But in Avril's case, however, I'm torn between Let GO and Under My Skin. She mixes up the sound through out the cd and it could be classified under many different genres. It's written about old boyfriends, standing up for yourself, and even summer boredom. While seemingly a bit more mature than the the first, I recommend it to anyone who liked Let Go or anyone who is looking for something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Deal","review":"If you haven't bought Avril's Under My Skin album than you might as well get the DualDisc version, but only if you're fan. The 2-CHANNEL LPCM version of the album on the dvd side sounds pretty much the same as the regular cd side but you do get a few of her videos and a cute but somewhat unneccesary video documentary on her tour in the UK. You see Avril goofing off, flirting, and basically being an annoying teenager, all while being surrounded by her friends/managers/who knows. Interesting, but it takes away from the actual music, and that's what this album is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"sk8er boi was a fun song but the onley one of its kind from","review":"The worst cd ever.

The fact that these bratty, suburban, juvenile delinquent tunes could sell 6,000,000 copies just goes to show that a lot of hype will sell a pile of albums, no matter how bad the music is. If you want to be Lemming #6,000,001, go ahead and get this, but if you want music with any kind of substance or integrity, you need to move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, I didn't know Alanis Morissette had a daughter?!","review":"If you bought her first cd, at least you know not to buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good production but...","review":"The only reason I know of this CD is because my little sister bought it and left it in my CD player, so really I listened to it by mistake. Anyways...Avril Lavigne took over the writing of the songs, and really she isn't that great of a lyricist. While you're listening to these songs you can guess what she's gonna say next. It usually goes like \\"something something thoughts inside my head / I regret all those things I said\\" and so on. The most \\"unique\\" thing she says is \\"get off of my bed\\" which is supposedly rebellious for a girl her age.The production is well done for her style though. I find it boring and it gets old through one listen.Overall I guess this is something my little sister could enjoy but anybody who isn't 10 years old and says she is a mature, experienced lyricist is just ignorant."},{"rating":"2","title":"I so love this song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i love every song on this album it is so touching and Avril is one of the best.and the words are perfect very rocky punky i like all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than her debut","review":"This album rocks harder than her first, and is more mature.

She's clearly someone to watch, in the same way as an airplane crash, or a bloody car wreck, or a coyote mauling a kitten. Sadly the extent reaches out beyond its grasp. It grabs for the beer cozy next to it and falls down and shatters its hip. But if you already like Avril you'll probably like this album anyway, so there's no point.

In fact I think i can handle those two better than Avril. At least they are not pretending to be \\"Hard Rockers\\". But ,anyway, for the review part...it's a horrible Cd filled with pop ballads written by a bunch of 40 year old fat man, it's Avril's voice put through a bunch of machines to make it sound better, and has her face on the cover.

It's actually got a lot of serious stuff in it. It makes me think. You can definately see the influences of Raine Maida and Chantal Kreviazuk. I really love Raine Maida's band Our Lady Peace, so I guess that makes my opinion sort of bias, but still. It speaks volumes. I can't get over how much mature it is. It's got some really good themes. Especially Who Knows, it's cheerful and mature at the same time. I also like how it's not all about some stupid guy. She kept her voice and direction and just put it in a different sound. I like the new sound 20x better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music lover of all kinds","review":"I loved the first album!!! Yet, this album is even better! She totally rocks and rebels out on this album. It's more her! I love every song! And to the bad comment writer on here, Stacie sucks!!!!!!!!!!!! How can you even compare Avril with Jessica and Stacie???????? They are two totally different muscians based on genre alone!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"After an amazing first album, I couldn't wait to buy her second album. I was thoroughly disappointed. It is horrible. In my opinion, it has 3 good songs, top. However, that is based on her material from her first album. Perhaps, for a first time listener, this would be a good album. My recommendation...don't buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only there was a \\"zero\\" rating","review":"Absolutely horrible!My friend got this cd and you might as well sell it in a garage sale. Waste of 12 bucks, that's for sure.Save your money for something worth listening to"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avril is Amasing","review":"This new cd is the goods. I mean everyone keeps calling her a pile of loaf, but she is really good. I saw her on SNL and the Today show and she can really play the guitar!! Her fingers were pushing down on the wire thingies on the guitar and moving around. I think she is as good as any rocker on guitar, just give her a chance. Her singing is NOT out of tune live, she sings that way on purpose to sound different. It is only out of tune if it is not done purposely. I can't wait till her next CD, it is supposed to be all goth and black sabbath kinda stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"still a Alanis Moresette clone&Predictable","review":"nothing here shows me much Artistic Growth at all.Avril Lavigne is following a Set Formula at appearing a certain way Musically but She doesn't have the Depth as a Musician to pull it off.She reminds me of Alanis&liike Alanis a Image was crafted to sell her a certain way but after a few albums that formula played it's ownself out.the same thing is happening here again."},{"rating":"1","title":"noo","review":"I listened to this CD with an open mind and trying to ignore her obviously fake punk pose. But it wasn't like it had cute poppy songs like her first album, in fact, I found it monotonous, lacking of substance, and perhaps giving more importance to the photographs inside the booklet where Avril tries to come off like, yet again, a real (?) punk.Temptingly, it's called Under My Skin, like you really wanna go there (?) like it really takes you anywhere...? All the songs sounded the same to me, and it makes me think that she is no better than all the other crappy posers of today. This isn't rock, this isn't punk, it's some sort of strange dull teenybop.I didn't hate it, but I think it doesn't have any substance and it doesn't deserve the hype. A so-so album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it but the first one is better","review":"This CD rocks but the first is a lot better.She is a lot more gothic and punk then tom boy I like the tom boy look way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"???","review":"You want a genuine teen angst album...listen to Twisted Sister's Under the Blade, You Can't Stop Rock n Roll, or Stay Hungry albums.

Dee Snider would eat her dead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum","review":"Avril's sophomore album does little to boost her cred. The first album was ok, this album is a little bit below ok. More songs dwell on adult topics (as compared to Let Go songs). However, this I can say is not real punk rock. Nor any kind of rock music. It is plain, commercialized \\"punk rock\\". Radio-friendly songs but I am annoyed when singers (not artists) use the punk/grunge/rock/hiphop image wherein they are not actually immersed in that certain culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step in the right direction....","review":"Look, I don't give a s**t if you think shes a poser or not. If you really spend your time sitting around analizing who's \\"real\\" punk and who's \\"Fake\\" punk, then its time to find a life. As far as the music goes, i think its a huge improvement from her last album (which, I'll admit, I didn't like. too boring IMO). It's alot catchier and has more of the pop-punk vibe. Is pretty much every song \\"radio friendly\\"? Yes. Does that make it a bad Album? No. So if your a fan of bands/artists like Simple Plan, Skye Sweetnam or Wakefield, you'll love Avril and this new album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the first one but loving this one even more!!","review":"Avril's first cd called Let Go was a great album, there were many things I could relate to, but I enjoy her second cd I cant stop listening to it and cant help but turn it up soo loud, its different from her first album, much more angrier but i like it. Its not as poppy. Awsome CD I really reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"i,d give it 0 stars","review":"avril is so stupid and she is not tlaintid her music is sobadthat your ear will bleed she is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened 2 da real avril???","review":"i dont know what happened 2 avril but i hate it. this CD is all gothic and moody and shes tryin 2 sing hi notes 2 much. she totally lost her style and now she looks and sings like a prostitute. also, she isnt articulate at all. she just kinda moans and groans about her \\"pain\\" too much. she also throws random swears into her songs 4 no reason. she could choose other words 2 use in their place, but i think she wants to sound cool or somethin'. shes only got 2 semi-good songs on the whole CD, My Happy Ending & Nobody's Home. (she also had no sense of style for the CD photos. she has this really tacky poofy skirt for most of da pics, & they're not even halfway down 2 her knees. she wears black makeup, 2.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poser","review":"Avril is a poser! She is so ugly and can't sing or write music. Have you noticed that in almost ALL of her songs she goes I E I E I? That is sooo stupid!

Her voice sounds alike in all the songs, and they all just mix together. After awhile all the songs are old and sound the same so I just can't stand this CD anymore. The only song on this CD I can stand is \\"happy ending\\" because I like the lyrics. Even though I like this song, I think it should have been song by someone else. I think it would have sound a whole lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"i actually haven't heard the whole cd but....","review":"I needed to write this because I was sickened by all the reviews on the board. At least if you are going to write something make it intelligent and don't say something like \\"listen to good charlotte, new found glory, and simple plan instead\\" because none of those bands are good either. In fact they suck. If you really want to hear good music listen to Ben Kweller, or Cursive, or Sunny Day real estate, death cab for cutie, travis, modest mouse, guster, or the shins. Don't pollute yourself with stuff from the radio thats completely mainstream. Educate yourself about music. Do your research. And maybe Avril isn't very good but don't fool yourself into thinking that Good charlotte is better because it makes you seem ignorant."},{"rating":"1","title":"lets just say avril sucks","review":"okay...so i have never liked avril at all..not one tincy bit...but i decided to give her another chance. i borrowed her new album from a friend...and the verdict is..she still sucks. her lyrics are about boys and stupid little people..and she still can't sing or play the guitar. she is just a sad poser."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Should Call Avril \\"Average\\"","review":"She's not The Best But i Must Admit she's Better Then Some. She's got her own style and her own way of singing that I reapeat IS NOT PUNK! (Sorry but she's not.) This CD includes three of her best songs and popular singles, \\"Happy Ending,\\" \\"Slipped Away\\" and \\"Don't Tell Me.\\" Although in my opinion her first album was much better and easier to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"REVIEW","review":"OK STARTERS AVRIL IS A UGLY LOOKING DOG \\"PUNK ROCKER\\" THAT SHOULD GO BACK TO THE KENNEL.

O YA THE CD IS JUST AS BAD AS HER FIRST ONE. THE MUSIC VIDEO TO HER NEW SINGLE IS ANNOYING IF SHE SAYS TAHT SHES OVER HIM THEN WHY THE HELL IS SHE STALKING HIM.

In fact, she got \\"discovered\\" because she won a contest to get to sing with Shania Twain. How Sk8r of her!Oh, and one other thing, I did really like her voice the first time I heard it...I think it belonged to Alanis Morrisette (yet another poser, but at least she has some talent and isn't totally \\"put together\\" like a friggin Frankenstein monster by the record labels.BURN THIS FAKE #$*&$% POSER'S CD'S, IMMEDIATELY!!!!

You can really see the changes in this album from Avril's first one. Personally I think \\"Nobody's Home\\" and \\"Freak Out\\" are the best songs on the CD but they are all awesome. I think Avril has more than proven that she can rock and that she deffinately has staying power. If you don't have this CD yet what are you waiting for? Go Now! Get It!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i had my doubts...","review":"but wow this cd was really worth every penny.

Furthermore, she is also incredibly beautiful, sort of in a supermodel-like way don't you think? What a romantic, so subtle and witty! She's classically beautiful! Move over Cindy Crawford, get lost Christy Turlington, forget it Caroline Murphy! Here's a REAL babe of a woman----Avril! A real charmer! Hey, has she kicked anyone (...) this week?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Crap This Sucked","review":"Simply put this CD made me want to puke, it reminded me of all those hippies sitting around a campfire and singing songs about love. Maybe record companies should look into actually producing good music instead of crying about how music sales have fallen."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Just Kinda Bad","review":"I really liked Avril when she first came out, but I'm really not impressed with this one. I feel like she's trying too hard as opposed to being authentic, which I felt more with the first album. There's nothing that really moves me or stays with me like \\"Complicated\\" or \\"I'm With You\\" I dunno, maybe it'll grow on me. Try Alanis' So-Called Chaos instead. That's really good pop-rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"buy this album if you like watching grass grow or if you are a mindless thirteen year old. Like many have stated before, the lyric really suck. I know that some of you like shallow songs about breakups and crappily written songs that try way to hard to have meaning, but you're probably a thirteen year old :) There is, however, one remotely good track, \\"My happy ending\\" which I initially liked because it had a nice melody and I could ignore the silly lyrics, but now it just gets annoying. so this album gets two stars, because it entertains its target audience (thirteen year olds and people who like watching grass grow ie boring people) quite nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got \\"Under My Skin\\" with this...","review":"The only song I really thought was worth listening to on this cd, was the smash hit from the radio \\"Don't Tell Me\\".

This has fallen flat in my opinion and hope her third cd is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"unconvincing","review":"This album is well produced. The guitars rock. The drums bang. Avril's voice sounds great. What's not to like, right?Avril is supposed to be the edgy alternative to today's pop music. And she is. However, her lyrics lack creativity. I bored quickly of the predictable rhymes of an eighth grade poet. Listen to \\"He Wasn't\\" and \\"Fall to pieces\\" and tell me you don't know every line that is coming.She needs to take some lessons from Fiona Apple, Veruca Salt, and Alanis. All sang with real emotion and they all know what a metaphor is. Avril's singing lacks both the complexity and the sincerity that could make her music great.But, maybe I am forgetting what her demographic is.Avril will succeed in part because there are not many competitors in the teen angst department of pop music these days. But if you want to hear some young women rock with emotion see if you can dig up Fair Verona's album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice album but bad DualDisc","review":"The huge hype around DualDiscs is the option for multichannel (\\"surround\\") mixes of albums to be presented on the DVD side. Think of it - a multichannel mix of an entire album that can be played on anyone's DVD player, assuming you've got your DVD player hooked up to a nice surround sound system.And yet, strangely, this DualDisc of Avril's second album is not available in multichannel, but rather is only in stereo! True, it is a slightly higher quality, and there are some videos on it, but where's the surround mix of the album?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril's back...with a vengence","review":"Avril Lavigne, after a period of leaving fans in suspense, is back with another album. \\"Under my skin\\" combines teenage love ballads, with deep, heartfelt, thoughts.Avril's voiuce is beautiful...eerie in places. With every song you can almost visualize what she's thinking when she writes her songs.The new album is great. Avril crushes the image of a pop star, shakes it up and glues it back together in a whole new way. Thats what makes this album so great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock out loud","review":"This album is great! The first album that Avril made was OK. I never really listened to it. But this album is a much better effort. Although she sounds awsome on the CD, she sucks in real life. She is like Ashlee Simpson. Her voice is didgitized through the computer to make it sound better. Yes, she might have had a good voice when she was a kid. But she isn't a kid anymore. She is what, 20? Everyone thinks that it is cool that she sticks up her middle finger for the camera's to talk about. The latest trend. But, all of her songs are about hatred. Yelling, screaming, boys. I'll listen to one of her songs, and then my head will hurt. Don't get me wrong. All of her songs are great. It's just that she sounds very angry. And you may get a bad headache after listening to this CD for a while. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD SUCKS! THE LAST CD SUCKED! AVRIL SUCKS!","review":"Lemme make my point, although you can probably see it in the title. Avril freakin' sucks. If she's so 'punk', she would have more punk rock music, but none of her songs are punk, she's pop. She's a pop singer who has issues with the real punk bands. Dude, she calls herself 'Sum 41's biggest fan'. I mean, I have the Sum 41 cd's 'All Killer No Filler' and 'Chuck'. I doubt she listens to Sum 41 because if she did, she would have some clue of what the hell punk rock is and her music wouldn't be pop. Just don't listen to her. You might as well listen to.. wait I don't want a whole bunch of little Avril fans chasing the bands I like around so I won't tell you who to listen to. Let's face it, Avril is a poser."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD IN THE WORLD","review":"I was already an Avril Lavigne fan when I bought the album, but when I bought it and listened to it once the whole way through, I was truly exhilarated!!! Avril's newest single, \\"Nobody's Home\\" has been my favorite song since May! When she let it out into a single, I said it was the best thing it could do to make her career even stronger than it already was. I just recently saw her LIVE in concert, and she sang 10 tracks off of Under MY Skin. This is the BEST cd by Avril Lavigne, and I think even possibly by a Canadian artist. This CD really deserves much more than 5 stars. Really, it deserves 10 stars. If you don't already have this CD, where have you been? Go out and buy it right now!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avril Gets Under My Skin","review":"Avril is not a good song writer. \\"Yeah yeah yeah\\" \\"Na na na na na\\" Give me a break, she needs a dictionary or thesaurus so she can use bigger words and not rhyme the obvious single syllable words.

Fake industry girl.She doesn't 'write' any of her songs guys, come on, she's got the talent to 'scribble' down some lyrics, and with lyrics like these, how hard would that be for you or I to do?Stop falling for the music industry's ploy to give you something opposite of ms. Spears, that's actually the damn same thing.Steer yourself towards real musicians who aren't fake and created by the industry.SHE USED TO BE A SINGER IN HER CHRISTIAN CHURCH BEFORE SHE STARTED SINGING AND BEING ANGSTY. Get a clue. Don't be a tool to the music industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissers who consider their \\"Aerosmith, slayer\\" better is sad","review":"Give me a break,the girl is pop, she says she's pop, not punk/rock,she admits she sang country and in church,so just leave her alone.And for those people who dis Avril and think they are listening to \\"real\\" \\"hardcore\\" \\"noncommercialize\\" bands like Aerosmith and slayer, are just so pathetic.If you wanna make urself sounds more sophisticated,at least choose some real bands like Tool, A Perfecr Circle, Radiohead or something. gosh...Aerosmith, slayer, Rush are just poser Backstreet boys with guitar, with mindless repeating lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mother's Opinion","review":"As a mother of a pre-teen I am responsible for censoring her music, while, at the same time, being subjected to her tastes. I find that Lavigne's sophomore album has a more mature sound than her first, while still maintaining the teen pop/alternative sound. The whole family can listen to this CD, and I have had many of my adult friends ask to \\"borrow\\" the CD for further review. I agree with one reviewer who suggested that \\"Don't Tell Me\\" should be required listening for teenage boys and girls. This is exactly the type of message that teens should be listening to. The music is catchy, the lyrics are simple and that is exactly what it should be, uncomplicated fun teen music."},{"rating":"1","title":"That shrill voice!!","review":"Avril came around at a time when music was at an all time low. The rock scene has progressed little since 2002, when Avril arrived but someone should teach her a few lessons.Avril's songs just grate on my nerves. Day in and day out I see little girls dressed in \\"punk\\" clothing with their attitudes and playing their snotty Avril records. I have heard many songs from this album and generally they sound the same, nothing interesting at all.If you want to step up your music game pick up an Alanis Morissette album, she is Canadian, a similiar voice to Avril, but that's where it stops. Alanis has thought provoking lyrics, solid albums full of diverse songs and a VERY unique voice. Nothing for which I could say for Miss Sum 41."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad 1 star is as low as it goes.....","review":"What a load of bulls**t, this dumb b***h calls herself a \\"punk\\" band, she doesnt even know what punk is. \\"Punk\\" is not dressing up in loose, torn clothing, wearing spikes, and riding your \\"sk8ter\\" boards, anyone one who even considers this remotely punk or even remotely rock should be banned to hell eternally. Having guitars and drums doesnt make a rock band, if u want some real punk listen to the clash, the ramones, bad religion, dead kennedys, the misfits, or the sex pistols."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't punk, sounds just like britney spears","review":"This sucks, how does she call herself a punk rocker she sounds just like all the other crappy pop on mtv. What happened to true punk like the Ramones or the Clash, that was real punk. Avril Lavigne also claims that she plays the guitar, so what she plays it like crap, you could pick the guitar up for one day and be as good as her.

Music like this does not take talent to play, and it does not take talent to create. Along with her 12 barre, 3 chord redundancy, Avril Lavigne has a hostile, screaming, screeching voice. Every song on this CD follows the same pattern--Avril mutters some sarcastic sob story about how hard life was for her growing up in the suburbs, then the chorus comes in, over which Avril alternates in furious expressions of rage and frustration. Avril Lavingne NEVER sings, but SCREAMS. Every song features Avril's raging screams over walls of distorted guitar noise. Do you people really think that angry yelling requires talent? Making this type of music doesn't take talent. All it takes is the backing a multi-million dollar record company. Just about any teenage girl who can scream angrilly would be just as popular as Avril Lavigne if a record company speant millions of dollars to promote them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome second effort!!!!","review":"Avril rocks my house everytime i play this cd.

I still listen to Under My Skin but to be honest I do listen to her first album Let Go a lot more. Still this a great collection and breath of fresh air when compared to most attractive young female singers who cannot write their own songs and rely more on image and tabloid marketing to sell their albums than raw talent. Who cares if Avril is really a punk or skater?

I am disappointed by Griffin's frequent use of racial epithets in this episode. Granted, he attempts to be an equal opportunity offender by labeling the mayor the Dago and Peckach the Polack, but those usages did not come near the number of \\"schwartzer\\" (and worse)references.

My only quibble is the fact that a standard four-cup permanent filter doesn't fit, and I can't seem to locate one that does.

The chapters on the making of the film version of \\"Deliverance\\"--an abortive collaboration between father and son which ended when the father died--are both hair-raising and delicious.

Poor James Dickey: the guy was apparently responsible for his self-pitying son's every lament and weakness. In an attempt to make himself look normal, everyone else is severly faulted, include Burt Reynolds, Ronnie Cox, Jon Voight and Ned Beatty. In conclusion, what a boor Chris Dickey is.

I read this book when I was ten, and for me it's up there with The Secret Garden, The Little Princess, and Jane Eyre for telling it like it is about being a lonely little girl, just strange enough for the neighbors to talk and to know herself that she doesn't fit in. The cat could be possessed, or not; Jessica could be a witch, or not; but the big question for me is, is she really wise beyond her years or does her desolation just make her seem that way?

This book makes light of that evil, normalizing it and trivializing it.Zilpha Keatley Snyder blends good characterization -- Joy and Jessica are both believable characters -- with a moody other-worldism that goes past flirting with evil. Jessica performs a makeshift exorcism on her cat. Prior to that, Jessica acts on her worser instincts of jealousy, loneliness, self-pity, envy, petulance, insolence, and selfishness to ruin things around her -- stopping just short of burning her neighbor to death. All of this is blamed on the devil cat, Worm, who talks in Jessica's head and says EXACTLY what Jessica wants to hear.The powerful influence of reading books about the Salem witch trials comes through, as Jessica suddenyly realizes she has been behaving exactly as the Salem girls had behaved.Bah.

Then Jessica finds out there is a demon in her cat. She goes down to Mrs. Fortune's house in the apartment building to find out what to do.

But the author poorly displays the emotions and feelings, but the storyline about a poor painter who commits crimes weakens its affect. The life of a painter has little to do with injustice, and being deprived of splashing ink onto a canvas isn't a powerful topic, nor injustice in large quantities. If the story were something of higher stakes, the message would have been brought better. The works of Dalasquez have been forgotten in the snap of a finger. As stated before, the irrelavent topic of art is constantly replaced. Art is a fad, and I, Juan De Pareja is the tale of a painter being deprived of being part of a fad.

The first hundred pages or so consist of Washington cocktail-party chatter circa 1940, and it doesn't get much better as it goes along. The characters seem oddly detached from the epochal events unfolding around them, and as a result the reader cares little about them. There is much to be said about the machinations of the ruling powers during the period covered in this book; perhaps a work of fiction, although based on fact, is not the proper forum to explore them, as master essayist Vidal must himself have known before finishing this dramatically unsatisfying work. Perhaps he needed the advance to pay the mortgage on his Italian villa? Authors have to eat, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"Some of Gore Vidal's work has entertained me a lot (Julian), but this book wasn't one of them.

It seems that many of the reviews are saying that it's really only worth playing through if you're a fan of the show. I guess I'm a counterexample to that theory. If you are like me and are not a hard-core gamer and really just get into the simple games that do not require hours and hours of gameplay to complete, this game is for you. The fact that it was simple, repetitive, and amusing made it the perfect game for me to blow a few hours with. This was one of the first video games that I have actually taken the time to complete, so that must say something for it. Although the graphics are not stunning, the cinematics that go with the storyline are just awesome. And if you can get used to the crummy graphics that come with the split screen, the two-player game \\"run the jug\\" is pretty fun, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pete's Review","review":"This was a really good game.

First complaint: WAY too easy. It took less than an hour to complete the entire thing. 26 levels take you back and forth over the same roads, doing the same thing over and over. For some reason there only seem to be about four roads in Hazzard. Second: the handling of the General leaves much to be desired. It's actually more fun in the other vehicles. Too much time is spent trying to keep the car on the road to enjoy the ride. Third: too cheesy. Yes, so is the show, but this is overkill. If I hear Luke (\\"Dang it, Bo\\") one more time, this game is done. Bottom line: this game is fun, but gets old quick, and doesn't make you want to replay it. I suggest passing on the purchase, and rent for an afternoon. That's all it's really good for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racing for Boredom would be more like it!","review":"I waited forever to play this, and found out that it stunk. The car was easy to handle, and drove well. But as the game progressed, it didn't become more difficult. I was hoping it would be more challenging. I actually got to memorize the roads some.

So as a Dukes fan, I was pumped. Then I rented it.I beat the game in a couple of hours, despite the repetitive play and poor controls. In fact, the biggest challenge the game gave me was to be sure it hadn't cancelled my Analog light during the level transition (which it did frequently).All in all, the excitement of a Dukes game carried it for the first couple of levels, then it just got boring. And howcome Roscoe can ram me like I'm standing still when I'm going full-throttle and just flipped him on his roof ten seconds ago?The cool concept earns it two stars, but the poor gameplay trashes the rest.

I have taken classes in C++, VB, and Java and it was still difficult for me to follow this book. The author goes into some really unnecessary details and there are many lines of code that he should not even be mentioning in this type of book.

Both of them worked well and justified saving $30. Sure, they didn't keep charged quite as long, but long enough to get through a few days before recharging during a long trip when charging wasn't always possible. After my husband washed the last extra brand name battery, I was reluctant to drop $40+ on another one.

I ended up spending a little more and getting the nikon S60, which I love. The camera has an internal lens and a very easy menu. I also purchased insurance on the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive insurance.","review":"I recently bought two of these as insurance before a 2 week vacation. I figured that even if one was bad and/or couldn't hold a charge, then I'd still have another if I needed it. As it turns out, both of the Ultralasts that I received are absolutely perfect. I could not tell any difference whatsoever between the battery life of this product versus the genuine Canon that came with my camera. I am unbelievably happy that I got 2 backup NB4L batteries for $7 instead of paying close to $50 for the \\"real thing.\\" Even if I only use them while the Canon battery is charging, it's worth it and I won't miss a single shot!

If fact, after 6 months, it has become as bad as the Canon battery that I was trying to replace. Worse maybe. Now it barely holds enough charge for a short day of shooting. It would be a terrible ecological choice, but honestly, it would still be a valid idea to buy like 5 or 6 of these for the price of one brand name battery and charge them all before an important trip. But who wants to do that. In short, these batteries suck, but they are so cheap, they might still be worth it!Stick to eforcity's cables and adapters... skip the batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equivalent Quality - Amazing Price!","review":"The Ultralast is simply as good as any Canon camera battery. I always have at least three batteries when I travel, not always wanting to take time to charge batteries. There is nothing worse than having your battery go dead when you are in a rare moment of taken great shots. I also photograph while SCUBA diving and that is not the place to have your battery go dead. There are many types of batteries and I've purchased one from Korea. It worked just as well, but the battery life was less. You can also never be sure if a questionable battery may leak and damage your camera. For the price of the Ultralast compared to a Canon, I'd strongly suggest having at least one Canon battery and a few Ultralasts on the side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Battery...Beware!!!","review":"I purchased 2 of these batteries from eforcity and neither one lasted for more than about 10 minutes worth of casual shooting.

As an attorney who has toiled in the criminal justice system (both as a defense atty and as a prosecutor), I was moved by the book's honesty, compassion, and accounts of prison life.

Television shows on Animal Planet have made alligators seem cute, and humorously cranky, when they are actually fierce engines of destruction! This movie restores their horrific reputation.As an added bonus, Joe Bologna is a believable guy in unbelievable circumstances. The same formula worked for Bruce Willis in \\"Die Hard,\\" and it made him a household name.

I do a bit of work to read them in order, because that is my nature, but I guess it is not necessary. I am interested in the characters and the period detail is well done.

I fault her portrayal of Captain Lacey, a half-pay veteran of the Peninsular wars, because he lacks either the religious outlook or the sex life characteristic of an Englishman of the period. Lacey sustains several platonic friendships with upper-class women. There's lots of sturm und drang with an old friend who married a former military mentor and superior officer; antagonism alternates with reconciliation and apologies. No resolution appears on even the distant horizon and the reader grows wearied with the drama of the ultimately pointless subplot."},{"rating":"2","title":"INSPIRE YOUR BOYS TO READ!","review":"It is so nice to see beginning reader books for boys. This book would fall into the catagory of a first chapter book. The chapters are only a couple of pages long, with large type and a picture every page or two.

It explains the melt-down of 2007-2008 and our national moral collapse. It shows how we can fix some fundamental things in our society in order not to have worse failures.

(In my case, it's a textbook.) Anyways, there is one problem though. Like an average American, we don't really know much about Greece, maybe just names, Athens, Sparta, Plato, Homer and the film 300. This book gets into depth with the material, such as other tribes/civilizations (ex: Dorians, Lydia....) or places such as the Anatolian coast, Isthmus...it goes on. But that's not too bad, since you can just look it up.What bothers me the most is that the pictures intrude the text. For exam[PICTURE OF A VASE, PICTURE OF A TEMPLE]ple. See what I mean? They aren't bad when they take up 1/4 of the page, but sometimes you are in the middle of a sentence, or word, and bam: full two pages of pictures.

This play offers several memorable speeches, including Henry's orations in 3.1 and 4.3. In 2.2, we can see how effective Henry is against treason. I could not forget 4.1 if I tried. The scene where King Henry V disguises himself as a soldier and shares the burdens of his troops is a scene of such rare beauty (even to me an English Major)! And yet, Shakespeare still manages to squeeze in some comical touches. To be sure this is history, but Shakespeare paints the picture with his mastery of the language very well. If Shakespeare had not written \\"1 Henry VI,\\" \\"2 Henry VI,\\" or \\"Richard III,\\" I probably would have given this 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Few, We Happy Few","review":"On D-Day British officers read Henry's famous words to their men as they approached the beach. When Churchill needed material for his famous \\"Few\\" speech, his thoughts turned to the pages of Henry V. From \\"once more into the breach\\" to \\"we happy few, we band of brothers\\" this play resonates with Shakespeare's paen to England's warrior king. Oh, you'll be a bit confused at the start if you haven't read Henry IV parts 1 and 2, but this is primarily the story of Henry V's victory at Agincourt. Whether the play glorifies war or just Henry you will have to decide. There is much food for thought here for the perceptive reader. But then Shakespeare is always provocative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly formatted version of a great piece of literature","review":"I have been enjoying the play itself but it almost seems like they just scanned the book into Kindle format with no regard to making it an easy and pleasurable experience. Words, spacing, and lettering are not infrequently misplaced. A linking system to the footnotes does not exist but is basically mandatory for a body of work that uses so many archaic words. With some unnecessary work, I have been able to get through the material. I do not recommend getting this edition although it seems to be the most popular of all the Kindle editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"not on the kindle","review":"This edition is not suitable for the kindle, because it is not adapted to use the kindle's capabilities.

(I'm new to the kindle - if I discover there's actually an easy way to do this, I'll take this review down.) The layout makes sense for a physical edition, of course, but not for an e-edition. The sample kindle sends includes only the intro so it was impossible to see what the notes were like without buying the book. (Still - the intro and notes are probably worth the $4.70 - I'll hope most of that money goes to the editor not the person who said he or said had converted the book to an easily usable digital format.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"On, On Noblest Ken!","review":"Kenneth Branagh's first try at directing was magic. Not only did he bring his visual thoughts to the screen, but he also brought his acting talents. The few who got the chance to see this young man on stage knew the talent was there. For the millions who had not even heard the name Kenneth Branagh, Henry V was our first meeting with this brilliant man. Watching Kenneth bring King Henry to life again was magical. Through this movie, you cry, laugh, and are hopefully deeply moved by the threat of war between England and France, the wit of Falstaff and Henry himself, the moving speeches Henry gives the day and the night before the battle, and beautiful wooing scene between Henry and Princess Katherine. Being one of Shakespeare's greatest plays, and having one the greatest actors of our time play the leading role, makes Henry V a masterpiece that will be enjoyed by millions for many years to come.

And for the first time in my life I now have been able to find my true calling and will persue my passions with a sense of purpose and joy.Due to Mr. Wayne Dyer's gifted knowledge of the innerself, all my problems have turned into opportunaty and a sense of adventure.READ THIS BOOK AND BETTER YOURSELF AND THE WORLD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll See It When you Believe It","review":"I borrowed these tapes from the public library recently. I was so impressed and motiviated by them, I ended up sharing them with my co-workers. They enjoyed them as well. We can all relate to Dr. Dyer's analogies at one time or another. He has so many comment sense and simple ideas to apply to everyday life. I've played these tapes over and over and each time, I picked up something new. Despite the fact these tapes were from 1987, Dr. Dyer's philosophy is still alive and well in the year 2000!! There were sections of the tapes that I wondered how he got into my head and knew what I was feeling. Especially, when he describes the quiet zones. I've been transforming over the last few years and did not even realize it. There is still room for growth, and I am eager to move forward. These tapes come highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author has blissfully lost much of his mind.","review":"First, the good stuff: Positive thought and its power is described well. That, in and of itself, made this book somewhat worthwhile. However, Dyer's writing has become some jumbled up Christian - quasi Buddhist thought mulch pile in which he stars as the poster boy, or maybe even a figure of religious significance. Quantum theory is botched in an effort to support his half-baked ideas. I do think Dyer has gotten carried away with himself.

It left me wanting more action, more firepower, more scum and villany from these low life barves. I couldnt wait for the second book of this amazing series but I was kind of dissapointed in how some of the other bounty hunters were portrayed as cowards such as Zuckuss and a bunch of whiners like Bossk. However Boba Fett was as rad as he always is and well in the end i was satisfied with the Mandarlorian Armor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise....not such a great book","review":"I normally avoid any sci-fi books like the plague. I am an avid Star Wars fan though. So, the premise of Boba Fett surviving the Sarlacc's digestion was intriguing.

Like most Star Wars novels, the writing is dull and witless."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOSSK AND ZUCKUSS WERE TOGETHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH","review":"As my title should have indicated to everyone, I am well aware that Bossk and Zuckuss were partners in this book. Next step, get over it.4-LOM wasn't in the book. Maybe that is why Bossk and Zuckuss were working together.Granted Dengar didn't act like the superman we thought we knew, but oh well, he is in love (regardless of what we think about this, it did happen. Like he says in Tales of the Bounty Hunters now he has something to lose.)Barve was a little over used. Maybe a lot. Okay, I'll be happy if I never hear the word again. Now I'm going to get over it.I agree that Xixor should not have appeared in this book. He is perhaps the only villian that I really hated. I was so stinking when that barve was blown to atoms at the end of Shadows of the Emprire by Steve Perry, nicknamed the b-word.(Barve)"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but lacked the Star Wars edge","review":"I read both this and Slave ship, and I was severly disipointed. Jeter had a good idea but he ruined it by getting the plot a little too twisted. The Zuckuss and Bosck pairing really didn't belong at all. When compared to Tales Of The Bounty Hunters this book and its siqual sucked. Jeter should have stuck to writing Blade Runner and stayed away from Star Wars, because those long boing conversations that have little beariing on the plot don't Belong. All I can say is that I wish I hadn't bought this book because now I feel that I have to find out how the trilligy ends. P.S. Denger is not the bumbling fool he was made out to be"},{"rating":"1","title":"Part of the worst 3 book series in the Star Wars Saga","review":"I encountered this book and the two that follow it while embarking on a mission to read all the currently published Star Wars books from the beginning in chronological order. This is the first book of a 3 book series. The story might have been good if it had been condensed into a single book. Unfortunately, you have to wade through endless pages of meaningless dialog between meaningless characters. The way the story is told is also very annoying. You are constantly bounced back and forth between events that took place years in the past and the present. This technique manages to further confuse a very confusing story. Of the 20-30 Star Wars books that I have read up to this point, these 3 were by far the worst. You can skip them and miss nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and full of action...","review":"I read the novel versions of the three Star Wars movies but I've never read any of the dozens of Star Wars-related novels that have been written by other authors over the years. So, if these aren't as good as others that are out there, I wouldn't know. The primary draw for me was that the story revolved around my favorite SW character, the enigmatic Boba Fett. And I wasn't disappointed in the read. I enjoyed the entire trilogy, though I could've done without the sappy ending in the final book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the next book in this series!","review":"This book adds intrigue to the 'behind the scenes' action of the main Star Wars story. If you like Boba Fett, you can't miss this book. Kud'ar Mub'at is an ingenious character addition. The spy video of Luke's Aunt and Uncle being killed is fairly interesting. Great story for anyone interested in the bounty hunters and subplots of Star Wars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was a good setup for the rest of the books.","review":"I thought that it was cool how they had two different time periods at once even though I don't know why. But I was glad that they took off with a boba fett story because I felt that he was greatly ignored in every other book except for the Han Solo Trilogy of course. This book had good detail but in my opinion lacked a little in action except for the parts with the shell huts and the remnants of the sarlacc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has the author ever seen the trilogy?","review":"The author of this book believes, among other things, that you can fire a blaster by pressing your thumb on a \\"Trigger Stud\\"This book was full of inconsistancies with the rest of the Star Wars Universe and is recommended you dont waste your time with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"all I can say is man what a book.","review":"I thought this book was great because it was the first book about Boba Fett.It answered the question when he fell into the Pit Of Carkoon and came out alive.

I have read many of the Star Wars novels and this series takes the cake for the slowest reading, most confusing, and biggest waste of money. I was looking forward to a book that gave me a background possibly on how exactly Boba Fett came to be, and who he is. Guess what? That didnt happen in this series. I was thoughly bored. I have read many novels and have found myself on a few where I couldn't put it down because I was enthrawled with the story. This series I couldn't wait to put it down. I strongly suggest if they are going to take a character that didn't play a large part of a movie and glorify him, they give a better background and up the tempo. Well, off to bed....aww too bad I can't sleep. Guess I'll have to take my nytol (AKA reread the first chapter of this series.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD BAD--Painful to read","review":"This is the first Star Wars novel that I had to stop reading because it was too painful. The characters are WAY out of context. Vader and Palpatine bickering with Xizor? Please. Speaking of that conversation, it took 5 pages to describe what could be done in one paragraph. It took me 2 days to trudge through those pages. Don't get me started on the word BARVE.Stay away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"i think this book was very good","review":"i think that anyone who loves the star wars books should read it the only problem with this book is that they dont tell you more about some of the main characters"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've done better","review":"Jeter should have reviewed more. I saw several mistakes in the story line. Dengar messed it up alot, Neelah is a mystery and the droids are flat out annoying! But, the Transhodan Family ties are not very close. Bossk was plotting against his own father and his father was plotting against him. And, Zuckuss was portrayed as a wimpy little side-kick. Boba Fett showed far too much emotion then is portrayed in other books. The book is mainly for information only. If you're only into information, get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeter just messed up","review":"I feel that Jeter just didn't research his book well enough. He made several mistakes(in my opinion, I may be a little behind on what has happened in SW books lately). The plot was boring, no real battles fought. The idea to flash back an forth was a good one, it was one of the things I liked, and it helped. In the end of the book, it had Bossk seemingly kill Fett, yet this was during RoTJ, yet Bossk supposedly died in Tales of the Bounty Hunters. If he somehow escaped, Jeter should have at least touched on that. Jeter made some of the same mistakes he made when he continued on Blade Runner, but at least he did it, when no one else did. He is a newcomer to the SW universe, so maybe his second book will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy book for such a great story line","review":"Of all the star wars novels, this is the only one that I struggled to finish. From very uninteresting dialog, to very short and lame action parts, my interest lagged many a time. I also felt the author tried sticking in to many different characters and then left out putting any depth into them, may be in the next two novels the story will fill out, but I for one am not holding my breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is action packed and you won't put the book down.","review":"I loved this book because the book compines the charecter of Boba Fett with the typical type of book that you come to expect from any Star Wars Book. It combines well with the overall storyline of the Star Wars series. Boba Fett survies against all odds again and again to take revenge on his enemeis. The book also gives you several hints to Boba Fetts background as well as several new characters. You won't be able to wait for the next book in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Really Bad Idea","review":"I have no idea why George Lucas would allow this book to be published, and my only possible explanation was that he didn't read it. This trilogy was meant to be a story about the infamous bounty hunter Boba Fett, and his adventures after the events of Return of the Jedi. The attempt might have succeeded except that the author makes Fett out to be some sort of super-human reminiscent of a Marvel superhero with a much darker personality. This has the effect of reducing everyone else to a level of total obscurity. All of the other characters are dull and almost identical in that none of them are as good as Fett. The only redeeming quality of the series is the occasional flashback to Fett's hunting career prior to the original trilogy. If you want to read a good bounty hunter book, get Tales of the Bounty Hunters, but don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boba Fett is a lot better than Luke Skywalker","review":"A friend of mine read The Mandalorian Armor, I guess that's why I read it. After reading other Star Wars books about Luke Skywalker it's good to read one that's actually about the better characters (Boba Fett). The best part was the battle at the Shell hutts' planet. I'm going to agree with the last person that 'Barve' was WAY overused. If you're a Boba Fett fan read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"two stars is way too many now that i think of it","review":"\\"The Mandalorian Armor\\" lacked any kind of plot or suspense and is an all around bad book. K.W Jeter left me no reason to keep on reading. Bobba Fett talked way too much, considering Fett only has one line in the entire Star Wars movie trilogy, but appears. It has lots errors. Like it says the Slave 1 is a high speed ship, and yet in the Essential Guide to Vehicles and Vessles it says that the Slave 1 is about as fast as a Y-wing. I would reccomend that no one buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book","review":"I gave this book \\"Two Stars\\" because I have reserved \\"One Star\\" for the even worse \\"Slave Ship\\" (and \\"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\\", should I ever review that)There are some interesting parts in the book. I liked the spider being and the parts with Dengar, but on the whole, I found myself saying every few pages, \\"Has this author ever read any of the other books? Doesn't he know that.... (fill in what ever inconsistency I had just read)?\\" The plot was lame, the characters better suited for a comic book, and the inconsistencies with the rest of the SWU just too much to overlook. Read this book only if you are determined to read EVERY Star Wars book (and if you managed to read Dark Saber and Crystal Star, you'll make it thru this one)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.................because of Boba Fett","review":"I liked the book, but mainly because of Boba Fett.

Shayne Bell.2.) no mention of 4-LOM anywhere, instead Bossk is teamed with Zuckuss?3.) One character Dharhan is introduced as a tease into Boba Fett's past and then summarily killed a hundred pages later.4.) IG-88 is a different character than that presented in all previous material, especially \\"Therefore I Am: The Tale of IG-88\\" by Kevin J. Anderson.And there are more.If you prefer material that is consistent with the SW universe do not read, buy, or even acknowledge the existence of this book.

It's for your own good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum.","review":"Okay, I've never been a big Boba Fett fan. But I read this because it was Star Wars, and it was a Star Wars book I hadn't read ten billion times. I think I could have liked an interesting book about a character I never cared that much about. But this...it made me feel like I had mono again. Even the chapter with Darth Vader (my favorite character) and Palpatine was very boring. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who looks for any kind of human element or connection in a book, because it just wasn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I have some toilet paper","review":"This whole three-book series was a month of reading garbage. This is a whole month of my life I'll never get back. The author made the bounty hunters look like an incompetent bunch of keystone cops.

There doesn't seem to be anything in this book that captures my interest. If you're looking to start reading a new Star Wars series, I'd advise you stay far away from the Bounty Hunter wars.

For instance: \\"You better stay away from that barve!\\", or \\"He is such a barve, man!\\" What is that? 'Barve' isn't even in my dictionary! And it was used like, 200 times!). In addition, the whole premise of the book is \\"unrealistic\\" in Star Wars terms. A bounty hunters' guild? Right...P.S.: The character \\"Kuat of Kuat\\" also annoyed me. I think that's a dumb name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crud from someone who should know better!","review":"WARNING! This from K W Jeter. The man who aspires to be P K dick. Ha Ha Ha! The guy must be hard up for cash! His other works are great, but this...? I love Star wars, but with the exeption of Heir to the Empire the quality of the novels has been terrible! This is no different. The plot is terrible with many contradictions both within itself and Star Wars lore. How much padding!? this is a blatant attempt to turn a single book into a trilogy by filling the pages with rubbish. For example; Xizor telling the Emperor his \\"master plan\\". Waffle waffle waffle. Avoid this book if you have any love for Star Wars and it's originality. This book just drags a wonderful phenomenon into a Dagobah like swamp!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"While no Star Wars book can be called literature, this novel makes a mockery of the writing profession, as well as showing a lack of respect for the Star Wars Universe. Jeter seems to have done NO research into the characterizations--particularly Boba Fett. None of the bounty hunters is believable. His dialogue is amateurish. The plot is incredibly simple. I regret that this book is Jeter's first foray into Star Wars, and not his last."},{"rating":"1","title":"MANDILORIAN ARMOR? NOT IN THIS BOOK!","review":"It is a shame to see such a great part of the Star Wars Universe wasted by an author like K.W. Jeter. It seems to me, that the author did little or no research into the people or places that are in this book. The one thing I enjoy about the Star Wars series, is that more recent books build on the storyline before. Jeter has esentially thrown out all that has happened and will happen in Tales From The Bounty Hunters, the movies, or the rest of the Series. His character development and General knowledge of the S.W. universe is poor at best.Bantam Books and George Lucus should be ashamed at putting there name on such a book. There are much better authors availible to give such a colorful part of this great story to. Spend your money elswhere, Mandelorian Armor ahs nothing to do with its title and even less to do in the great Star Wars Universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"err....","review":"I thought the book was ok but, there is not enough character development. The book described Boba Fett in great detail and he never acted out of character. This did not apply to the other characters. I found that they were always acting in ways that contridicted previous descriptions. Example: When Cradossk and Zuckuss are talking, Cradossk goes from a guy hooked on Honor to a bookie.If you've never read any other SW books i suppose this is ok but if your a SW freak, like myself, you might find this a little dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"ogre","review":"This a really good movie I saw.It has gore,creature violence,action,terror.And the mostimportant thing a happy ending.So do more good reviews ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent movie with HORRIBLE VFX","review":"This was actually a decent movie in most aspects of production EXCEPT the visual effects. The story is the usual story you would expect to see on a SciFi channel flick. The acting is was certainly decent and the photography was pretty good. The VFX....HORRIBLE. I'm embarassed for the Bulgarian VFX company that did the Ogre effects. If you can get past that (I actually anxiously waited for the next horrible vfx shot in anticipation of seeing crap) you find a decent popcorn flick.I would suggest this flick to anyone that is a visual effects fan, since these effects are an EPIC FAIL.

Each plan tells you how much time you should spend on cardio and strength training, which exercises (cardio and strength training) you should try, and how much time you should spend on flexibility and power. Then, you just turn to the chapters they note to get a description of the exercise you should do!
