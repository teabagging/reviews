There is a way to control the speed of the lights, and thus the movements, but there is no way to synchronize the Dance Maker 2 with the beat of the music you play on your CD or tape player.

I've checked and double checked that our shower head is installed at a typical height and the mirror is still too high to be useful.Also I have experienced the issue with the valves comming undone when you attempt to operate them, that is the valve to divert water to the mirror comes completely out of its seat if you twist just a little too far.

Most of the songs are written by Berne and those seem to be the most interesting, although the one written by Hank is also very cool. Baron's song is a little detached for my taste, but to each his own. Overall a good album - and the vocals are a very nice touch.

I've had other HRM's that didn't pick up my wirelss bike computer signals, so I don't know why Polar can't figure out how to prevent this from happening.

At the beginning of the movie, they see trenches, they see German soldiers, and they remember what they've recently learned about WWI, the reparations, the assassination, everything leading up to WWII.

It brings back memories of the early to mid 90's when R&B; music was the best. I highly recommend this cd.

Most of the cuts on the record are good. There are some that aren't. This cd was circulated in 1995, and re-released in 2002. I have the version from 2002. There is no difference between them, however.My 3 favorite song from this album are 1,2, and 4. Jaccin' And Assasin' isn't even a song. It's made with sound effects and is only 8 seconds long, but it's a good one. Murder That He Ritt is a spectacular track. He raps real good on it and there's not excessive cursing on it, even though I don't mind that sort of thing. Hard Core is a great piece, the best on here, that has a satanic beat to it, hence the title.In conclusion, this is a good album by C-BO and if you're new to him then this is the way to go.

I don't have the trade paperback, but the 12 arc series. I found the sexual references out of place and pointlessly sickening, and the characters difficult to understand. THe names were childish enough, but the storyline was destationless and impossible. I wouldn't advise anybody to buy this. Yeah, it's imaginative and yes the watercolour plates are interesting enough, but the storyline needs complete help. As a comic collector, I'd recommend the Mandrake/Ostrander Spectre series from the late 90's for a real adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful watercolors","review":"Fantastic artwork, thought provoking writing.

Cameras can be rather intense of a sytem bus and like CD-Burners are best left on a direct system port rather than running off a HUB so im not suprized this happened.

So if you have the Complete EL CAPO, don't waste your money, you will be watching the second part of El Capo again, from the chapter where the Police chases them when they are hiding in the cave.Este set de DVDs no es mas que la segunda parte de lo que ya se vio en la serie complete de El Capo, no muestra lo que pasa despues de que Velandia le apunte con una pistola, si lo mata o no.

Without question Le Guin's best works in this series are her great novels \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" and \\"The Dispossessed\\". One of my favorite stories in the current collection - and the very first - is \\"Coming of Age in Karhide\\", which is a fascinating, often hilarious look at a character's adolescence on the planet Gethen, taking place a few decades after the events chronicled in \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\". The final tale \\"Paradises Lost\\" is set aboard a multigenerational starship whose crew must contend with religious fanaticism and the ship's unexpectedly swift arrival at another world. Most of the rest are just as good as these, exploring Le Guin's interests in cultural anthropology and gender relationships. All are graced with Le Guin's lyrical, often spellbinding, prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eos Sound System - Poor Sound Quality","review":"I purchased the Eos system with the idea of finally being able to use my computer to play my itunes music collection wirelessly elsewhere in the house.

The unit is small and mostly unobtrusive. I got the extra speaker to have my music going on all three floors at once. Every so often I unplug a speaker from an outlet and put it into another room to change things up, and it doesn't need to be reset or anything. All the buttons are simple and you don't need a manual to figure out what turns what on. I have had this maybe a year? - and am still happy with it.

I found it refreshing to read a 'Romance' novelthat had deep family values and a well written love scene allwrapped up together. Ms. Andorka has managed to write an exciting and caring book which she magically centered with a very serious and painfully difficult issue.

I keep everyones birthday scheduled a few days in advance so it warns me before I run out of cash. Important numbers like wife and kids SSN's, DLN's phone numbers, etc are seconds away. Now the bad news.... every data bank watch has had a band go south on me. If it's the metal it kinks and if it's the black plastic it tears. Doesn't matter because I am so use to it I buy a velcro band the same day. Looks dorky but it's the function that sells this product.

I got this watch to use at the office because it had a dressier look. While I am happy with this watch, it has one major flaw which has been mentioned by most other reviewers... the light sucks BIG time!! You can see the hour and barely see the minutes if you are dependent on the light. If you want to see the seconds, wait til you have another light source or forget it. The light on the Databank 150 is like the sun compared to this light. If you need to see your watch at night a lot, get the silver 150.

It cleaned my soleplate very quickly and with only one application. I know its a little on the expensive side but it lasts a long time since you only need a little. It polishes really nice and doesn't scratch the plate and comes off really easy. Just be careful because you have to use when the iron is hot so watch out when handling the hot iron so you don't burn yourself. It comes with a really think washcloth to apply it with and then a softer cloth to polish."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works....but","review":"We used this to clean a soleplate of a Rowenta iron we've owned about 4 months. The kit had a couple rags and a small tube of cleaner. It did work but required using the entire tube for one cleaning, so kind of expensive for only one cleaning. Now less than a month later the iron needs to be cleaned again. Would be nice if you could just get the cleaner by itself. Not sure if the problem is with our iron or maybe the water since we are living at a new address since we bought the iron. I will probably try and find a homemade remedy instead of paying another $12 to buy a cleaning kit. It does make me wonder why the company that made the iron also makes the cleaner, does that say something about the iron?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works as described","review":"Within ten minutes of opening the box my Rowenta iron went from unusable, with spandex melted in several areas over the soleplate, to shiny clean and new-looking. This product works as described. The product description says it's non-toxic--being sensitive to chemicals, this was a concern for me. While the cleaning process does cause some smoke to be produced, the smoke was not toxic. If you are super-sensitive, open a window while using and I don't think you will notice any difference in air quality at all.

Throughout the book, the proofreading is poor; that is, if it was proofread. Numerous captions are incorrect, and the authors research and conclusions are questionable at best. Conversely, this book does have some excellent photographs (many of which I have never seen elsewhere).

I just happened to notice the active ingredient in those treatments is the same thing as the active ingredient in these towelettes...Hmmm...I searched here on Amazon and found these. The price is amazing...as the Vyroxin/Walgreens brand cold sore treatment cost anywhere from 10 dollars(on sale)to 25 dollars for 2 treatments...using 1 of these towelettes even 2 times equals 50 treatments for half the price!! These towelettes are also a great topical antiseptic. We only use these towelettes topically and on the outside of the mouth.

It's better.","review":"SLIP 2000 is a very good weapon lube and I liked it alot, that is until I tried the EWL version. The regular SLIP 2000 does its job well and is much longer lasting than most other gun oils and lubes when run on my AR-15. I run my gun HARD and it does pretty well. I need to reapply every 100-200 rounds or so to keep the AR running wet, but that's better than most lubes given how hard I'm firing it (sequential 30 round mag dumps are common). Using SLIP 2000 EWL I only need to reapply it every 500 or so rounds.SLIP 2000 is good, but SLIP 2000 EWL is awesome. Both are non-toxic, which is a HUGE plus. The other lube that works very well with firearms is Mobil 1 10W30 synthetic motor oil but that stuff isn't non-toxic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"Have used this for several cleaning's very impressed with wear aspects having put about 300 rounds through the gun. I also like that the gun is reasonably dry compared to what I see at the range from others. It is a very light oil so I use it with a q tip and wooden tooth pick to get it where I want it.

Unfortunately, it appears it's out of print. I first read NORWOOD when I was in high school in the 70's, and it is the ONLY thing I've ever read that has actually become funnier and richer in repeated adult readings. I can quote entire paragraphs by heart, and I have my husband read it out loud to me when I'm blue. We both use phrases from it to describe absurd situations. Charles Portis, of TRUE GRIT fame, is a wonderful writer, and this book deserved better than having a mediocre movie starring Glen Campbell made of it. My humor runs to Woody Allen and Cohen Brothers movies, Young Frankenstein, A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES, and sassy Southern writers. If any of these match your taste, try NORWOOD. If you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite books.","review":"I have read very few books as finely crafted as \\"Norwood.\\" Each word in every sentence seems to have been chosen for maximum comedic value....there are little kernels of humor sprinkled throughout every page.

The characters were forgettable except that I wanted to slap most of them before committing them to oblivion, and the content as flat as the tires should have been on the stolen cars. Had they been flat they would have gone nowhere, which is exactly where this book went for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, it's just dumb","review":"You have to give Charles Portis credit for a well written book. He certainly has an ear for dialog and the nuanced speech patterns of the South, but in the end this is a book with no plot to speak of and little redeeming value. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charles Portis And His Unique Writing","review":"This is pure Charles Portis. What more can you say? He's a strange author who's written only a handful of books over a 40-year period and is kind of a recluse. You've probably heard of his second novel: True Grit, but the other four might be unknown to you. Well, check them out - at least this one (his first) and Dog Of The South. These are his three best, in my humble opinion. They are different from anything you've read.Not a whole lot happens in this story but it doesn't need to as Portis makes it fun to read regardless of what our titled character \\"Norwood\\" thinks and does as he travels from Texas to New York and back and meets some strange characters along the way.Almost every page has some interesting thought or account of something, such as encounters with a weird midget and an educated chicken! That gives you some idea of this unique story and author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norwood","review":"Great book, I laughed and it made me long for the simpler time! Charles Portis is brilliant!

It's really a practice run for the truly brilliant The Dog of the South. I wanted to like Norwood, but he's just not an interesting character, and implausibly slow on the uptake. If you've never read Portis, DO NOT read this first. If you are, you must meet Edmund B. Ratner, but be warned, this wonderful character doesn't make his appearance for some time.

As I went deeper into the story, I grew more bored. The murder plot was so unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid buy!","review":"I bought this radio recently. Of all the portable shortwave radios that I've used personally, this one has the best shortwave reception. It's very easy to use. I was able to listen to the BBC, RCI (China), Australia, Denmark, Radio Havanna, and others.It has a nice clock, excellant layout of the controls, and a handy light for the tuner that you can leave on or just turn on momentarily. On the downside, when listening to shortwave it can be drifty till it warms up. Once it warms up, it tends to not move around much.All in all, the Grundig S350 is a strong performer at a good price. If you are looking for just AM/FM and would like to save a few dollars, take a look at the GE Superadio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toasted with backwards batteries [EDIT] easily fixed ok after all","review":"Accidentally put the batteries in backwards, easy to do, markings are poor. Burning smell & no longer works on either batteries or AC. A $100 item should have a diode to protect it. Very very disappointed, what a cheap piece of junk![EDIT] Well, I opened up the back & found that it does indeed have a protective diode & this was shorted over. I removed it & now the radio works again. Four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"GRUNDIG SHOULD NEVER HAVE PUT THEIR NAME ON THIS PRODUCT !!","review":"This is just like the old, old radio's we all threw away when the new \\"Digital Tuning\\" came about several Decades ago. Don't waist your money like I did thinking it was a GRUNDIG radio that held up to their name. I have two other Grundig radio's and would highly recommend them. The \\"AFC\\" does NOT work very well. The Antenna is so long you would think it would really make a difference NOT !! Grundig is a great name however, this is not your normal quality you EXPECT. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this thing work?","review":"This radio sounds great for AM and FM stations, but surprisingly, it has no presets. For the price that you pay, this is very disappointing. Also, I can't get a single station on the international bands. The manual is worthless. I gave it two stars because it looks good on my desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"OLD radio.","review":"I bought this two years ago but stopped using it because of the following:1-Poor Frequency drift. It's an analog radio with digital readout so the tuner knob jogs a bit after being set. On FM I will be listening to 99.1 and the radio drifts to 99.3 requiring me to adjust it yet again. This happens on every use. It also occurs on AM and SW. This is the most annoying aspect of this radio.2- No frequency memories whatsoever. It's not a digital radio.3-The radio shuts off after 90 minutes requiring me to turn it on again.4- SW is spread across a couple of bands so you have to adjust the band to tune. When listening to SW or AM or FM you are always changing the position of the station on the corresponding other band. Too many knobs. THIS IS AN ANALOG RADIO WITH DIGITAL READOUT. GOOD ONLY FOR SOMEONE USED TO OLDER RADIOS."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Advantage Over the GE Superadio","review":"I own both. Some claim better reception with the GE Superadio III. I honestly can't hear much difference. However, the digital frequency display on the Grundig S350 makes tuning to the station you want much easier (and quicker). I've stopped using the Superadio just because the S350 is so much more convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicest radio I have ever had but...","review":"I needed a good am radio, went with Grundig because of reputation and I liked the way it had a retro kind of look.Nice feel and good reception. I guess I am spoiled as I prefer a digital preset kind of dial. The turning of the knob can be a drag at times and no presets really suck. Also, the backlight only stays on for like 2 seconds and I want it on all the time when I want it on, esp as it is plugged in. I don't like the sleep function which is annoying, how can I bypass or disable that. All in all a great radio which needs to be updated, a remote would be nice too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A strong caution","review":"Don't let aesthetics fool you. Whether you're new to shortwave or a veteran listener, avoid this radio. I liken it to a moderately attractive girl who turns out be insipid the moment she opens her mouth. This radio has none of the features normally associated with modern shortwave radios (e.g., memory presets) and I experienced annoying signal drift that required me to continually re-tune the radio (what you'd expect if you put a digital tuner on an analog tuned radio.) If you're looking for a great shortwave in this price range, check out the Grundig 400. See . . . I'm not prejudiced against Grundig, just against the radio that turned out to be such a tremendous disappointment last Christmas morning after weeks of anticipation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grundig S350 AM/FM Shortwave Radio-Review","review":"I am pleased with the radio, the packageing and shipping.

I popped the card back into a card reader on my PC and tried to reformat it but it was completely dead. I even took it to a specialist computer store to see if they could reformat it and they couldn't. The adapter was so poorly made that it fell apart as soon as I put the card in it too and I have no idea what happened to the plastic lock slider out of it because it just disappeared.Even though the equipment freeze-up was probably my own fault due to inexperience, it seems that I'm not the only one who has had problems with these memory cards.

Simple structured and to the point with short chapters and understandable english. Very practical with a storyline (with white river raftering guide experiences- will enjoy) and questions - journal type, at the end of each chapter, made it easy to follow in a busy work schedule. The core messege quickly communicated and background given of authors, was easy for me to buy-in. The free online accessment, that come with it, was a bonus and my family, friend and staff confirmed the accuracy of the results - the profile of your strenghts and how you should continue with free downloadable guides.

The slide looks soo much fun. Well- unless you weigh 10lbs...you will not be able to slide down the slide. I have a 6 year old,4 year old and 2 1/2 year old and the only one that can come close to using the slide is my 2 1/2 year old son. And even he has to push his way down the slide.The slide also is supposed to conenct to the bottom of the pool...it doesnt stay connected.The water that comes down on the slide does not help. The only thing the kids can really use is the pool itself...forget about the slide. Its a waste of money. DO NOY BUY!!!! Its a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE.","review":"This pool is a the worst constructed pool I have ever seen and my 6 year old niece that I bought it for, severly hurt herself when the slide detached from the pool. The pool arrived with a hole in the slide section which we patched in order to put it up, the sprayer dislodged from the slide and the slide slipped off the pool causing injury."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough time in the day.","review":"It takes forever to fill the slide part. You have to hold the water hose and wait for it to fill the double portion of the slide (they dono't connect together). If you do not put enough water in the slide before you add air the top of the slide sinks in. My daughter loves it, but it's way to big to leave up and it keeps getting holes in it. It took me well over an hour to set it up and the water part of the slide is soo huge that I can't leave it where it is. I ended up grabbing a plastic slide that we had in the yard and putting it in the pool for her to slide down. It is very difficult and time consuming, but my daughter did enjoy all of my work. Wish I had more time and my back could handle leaning over forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Looked nice in the picture, but had a manufacturing defect. The air chamber at the bottom of the slide wasn't sealed and didn't hold air. So, of course the slide didn't work. Also, the first time we emptied the pool, the plug ripped out. Contacted the manufacturer via e-mail for a replacement, but never got an answer. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"My family is very disappointed in this item, the slide isn't a slide at all. It sits so far back from the pool that there isn't a slope in it. The hooks in the pool to hold the slide in place don't actually hold the slide in place. We have used it twice and i can't get my kids to want to play in it anymore. If you take the slide out there are a couple black things that you have to be careful to not sit on.

I bought it one year ago. I was at the time hopeless regarding my two dogs barking. At this time they are even worse and I am considering shocking collars because they are driving me, my family and neighbors crazy. I just used this device for one month. Every time my dogs barked the light would turn on and the dogs would stop barking to look at the device.

She's really too small for a bark collar so we tried these.Since the signal is ultrasonic, the only way you know when the unit is working is a red light flashes when activated. While our dog barks loud enough you can hear her in the house while sitting outside with the front door closed, the PetSafe won't work even as close as 4 foot away.Simply put, it's not sensitive enough and there is no way of adjusting the sensitivity.We've been round and round with the manufacturer, who has offered no solutions.Highly recommend against anyone buying one of these units.

The vibrating bark collar works best, though with her thick coat it is hard to keep a patch of skin shaved for the close contact over her voicebox it requires, and it is a higher maintenance approach, needing to take the collar on and off (for walks, etc.). So, we have been looking for a more user-friendly, humane, consistent deterrent and hoped this product was it, despite mixed reviews. Unfortnately it was not. We tried it for two weeks before it was evident it was not going to make our dog stop barking. We could tell she detected the sound emitted from the device and even tried to manually \\"practice\\" with her associating the sound with her barking, but it never phased her at all, much less make her stop the barking. We returned the device and will continue the search."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not seem to work for our dog","review":"The unit has lights to let you know when it is on (blink green) and when it is sending the ultrasonics (red). But since humans can't hear I can't verify if it is working. It senses when the dog is barking and shows the red light blinking. But it does not seem to slow down the barking. So it could be the dog is just immune to the correction and loves to bark. The unit is moderately low priced and was worth the experiment to see if this would work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made Him Mad","review":"Our chihuahua, who never barked unless people were knocking on the door, but as this was annoying we decided to purchase this for those few minutes of barking a day.

I didn't want to use a shock collar, so this seemed like the best solution, but I'm not so sure that it was. First of all, it drains the batteries really fast. If you are going to use this item, I'd suggest pulling the battery completely out until you actually need to use it.As far as preventing my dog from barking, it certainly did help. It didn't stop him completely, instead he just lets out high pitched yips, but that's an improvement from what he used to do.Summary: The product does help to prevent loud barking, but the battery drains way too fast (in a matter of a couple of weeks). I think there are other products out there that are better. Maybe if the price were lower, this would be worth it. (Like around $10). I wouldn't buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"bark control","review":"did not like the product, I could hear it myself and it activated with any loud noise such as coughing or shutting a door and my dogs just got used to it.

He just kept on barking and barking, so I tried manually pressing the button and he heard it then but he only just turned his head to the side and then returned to barking. If I could turn it up louder then maybe it would work, but as of right now it doesn't work. So not worth the money paid for it.

This product nevers goes off when my dogs bark and I have to manually push the bottom in order for it go off. The reason I bought it is because I live in an apartment complex and when I come home my dogs will bark and bark and bark until I come through the dog and I'm hearing complaints. I wanted something that would work automatically. I didn't want to put collars on my Chihuahua's (I would never use the shock collars but I'm looking into the spray collars). They're only 6 pounds each and they never go outside. The last time I tried to put collars on them they totally flipped out. My puggle is trained to go outside so she wears a collar 24/7.

She has no problem being in her crate but will bark whenever we leave the room the crate is in. So we placed this near the crate and as soon as we walked away she started barking and the red light lit up and then she kept barking and howling in a way I've never heard her do before. And barking and barking and barking. normally she will wear herself out after about 10 minutes so we think she was either barking at it, or the noise was causing her anxiety to keep building, she stopped barking after 25 minutes as soon as we took the device away.

So the few times I did walk up behind her with it, I'm convinced the only reason she stopped barking for a moment was to wonder why I was following her around with this thing.The one star is because she CAN hear it; however, it's apparently not annoying enough to make her stop being annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"This is crap!

We saw immediate results. No more waking up to him barking in the mornings - now he stays quiet in his crate until we get up and let him out.---Updated review: After about a week, the box no longer deterred our puppy from barking in the mornings.

But after 2-3 days the barking is noticeably less and he has adjusted nicely. He barks much less and also has adjusted his volume when he does bark. Now he goes outside and barks to work it off, but no longer is the entire house fixated on the dog any time a guest comes to the door.Wish List: If we had to buy this device again, we'd want an off switch because there are times when you want to shut it off and the only way to do it is to put the device upstairs or pull the battery out."},{"rating":"1","title":"bark suppressor","review":"Does not seem to make any difference at all!

We have tried 2 different ultra sonic things and a spray collar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"This worked on my dachshund about 3 times and then she decided the noise wasn't quite annoying enough to stop her from barking. Another problem was that if I tossed my keys on the table it was sitting on or my children squealed while playing, it set it off too. So we had to be quiet around the thing. I continued to change the batteries in hope that it would eventually work on her and, in about a month, I had gone through 3 battery changes. If I had continued to use it, I would have been buying batteries out the wazoo. All in all, it was a good idea but didn't work at all for my dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably works better for less dogs","review":"I am sure this product would work much better if fewer dogs were involved.

We tried different locations, and different angles, but it simply did not make any difference. The battery had to be replaced within this 6 week period, although they say that it should last longer.

She flew up the stairs like a bat out of hell as soon as it went off! However, after using it for about a month, she became so neurotic about it that she wouldn't even come downstairs to eat.

So when I got this product I tried it out immediately & he stopped barking. He looked a bit confused and curious at the same time at the device. So it worked for a bit in the beginning. I noticed now, if my dog is in a very hyper mood this device won't stop him from barking. I can also hear the high pitch sound. It doesn't hurt my ears unless I put it directly to my ear. So if you have a dog that looooves to bark constantly, this product isn't for you. I also have another dog at my parent's house that is spoiled rotten and loves to bark at anyone & at anything.

It works well in cleaning your glass stove top of burnt on messes. I'm sure it may be handy for scraping other surfaces as well although I have never tried it on anything else. The fact that it retracts allows you to store this safely. It gets the job done but the price is a little high for what it is, especially since you will need to replace it from time to time as it gets cruded up and starts to rust.

I think this is mostly due to the author not having diagrams to show lighting positions. Also if the lingo is new to you, you will probally spend a little time going back and forth from the subject to defenitions of terms.However if you want to learn to light, you want to undertand how light works in various scenarios, you should buy this book.Tim SkipperVision Poto Imagewww.visionphotoimage.co"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This book was not very helpful. While the table of contents looks promising, the content is not what was expected.

While there are tons of pictures to give examples, there are none of the lighting setups. Occasionally there is a flat drawing, but that is all.The book uses call-outs to highlight what should be important information. However, the text that was used seems to be just a cut and paste ezperiment, with no basis for the choice of text.

This is the closest I could find and it isn't close. Disappointing - crammed and densely packed with information, I found this book difficult to navigate and use, and similar to using Acrobat itself--so you might as well just muddle through the program and its help files directly rather than muddle through this book. It may be good for mature intermediate or advanced Adobe practitioners as a reference or review, but if you're looking for a teach yourself book along the lines of the SAMs, ...for Dummies, or the Microsoft press books, my suggestion is don't bother with this Acrobat PDF Bible.

But to me this book smacked of Robert Anton Wilson's Illuminati books, which meant it definitely was not to my taste. It even had a bit of Wilson's slapdash quality to it, although for the most part I considered it well-written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical John Shirley novel","review":"If you are looking for spatterpunk, Shirely's other books, like New Noir (my favorite), may be more up your alley. If you are looking for something a little more thought provoking, however, read on. Brushing away the constraints of genre, Demons is an allegory for the ages. Exploring political, spiritual and environmental undercurrents in out lives, Shirley's not-to-distant demonic tale is anything but your standard \\"horror\\" story. The tale does exact full participation from the reader to reap its bounty, but if you are looking for a more cerebral scare, Demons is your ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just fair to middlin'","review":"I'd like to say this was terrific, cause the story itself sounded great.

She was formerly a writer and performer for SNL. she is also a character on the show but is a comedic foil for them, not competition.left to his own writing devices, tracy morgan descends to a very raunchy, foul mouthed stand up act which is a very poor imitation of what comedic giants have done so much better before him, including richard pryor and george carlin. if you want to see someone who does raunchy present day a whole heck. of a lot better, go watch Louis CK's standup shows,if you buy this on dvd or instant, i think you will feel you wasted your money by the time the show is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but Good","review":"I can't really think what to call this music.It's not one of those Windham Hill acoustic guitar albumsthat have lots of notes, harmonics, and thumping sounds.It doesn't have that overly bright steel strings in your face sound that gets old quickly either.There is a great variety of music here all based around steel andnylon string guitar playing.

What a powerful book.","review":"I'm a big fan of the Sonora Blair books, and I live in Cincinnati where they are set, so I was doubly concerned that Lynn Hightower's newest book was not a Sonora Blair book.Wow, were my socks knocked off by this book! A dysfunctional Southern family could be such a cliche or very trite, but Hightower pulls it off without going either way. Her characters have depth and humanity -- and you find yourself really rooting for them. Even when that means for them to do something really messed up <grin>.High Water takes Hightower from a formidable mystery author to a serious character-driven author with a mystery involved (think James Lee Burke). If you're hesitant because you love the Blair books, go ahead and read High Water. If you haven't read any of Hightower's previous books, this one will hook you on her writing, and you can go back and read the Sonora Blair books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I miss Senora but I love this book!","review":"I love Lynn Hightower's writing.

Until quite recently I just accepted that trying to crush anything round in it would result in the objects flying out of the mortar, so I didn't bother. However, I've become less willing to accept that limitation recently, and decided to try to find a solution. After reading a number of reviews of various iterations of mortars and pestles, I decided to try this product. I find it does an excellent job cracking and crushing hard round seeds, like peppercorns. The pestle fits well in my hand, and while not so heavy that it's uncomfortable to lift, it certainly has heft, so that it doesn't require as much muscle power to grind hard spices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke during first use","review":"Don't know if I had a lemon, but I while I was using it to crush almonds, a big chunk of the bowl broke off.

Well, mine arrived broken, too. The packaging is inadequate for shipping--the pestle is very heavy, and the only thing separating it from the bowl was a piece of cardboard. Since another reviewer said their bowl broke during use, I now think the bowl is probably just too thin to handle this heavy, close-fitting pestle. I still think this style is ideal for my needs (crushing pills) but will try a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in the box","review":"Well I was really excited about this mortar. The second I picked up the box I knew that something was broken. I mean broken into so many pieces and fine marble powder. The bowl part was broken but the handle was not.

I am apprehensive to order another- for fear that will arrive broken as well?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for garlic","review":"I have been looking for a set of mortar and pestle primarily for crushing garlic. This set looks like one that would fit my needs because the pestle has a mushroom shape that can prevent garlic cloves from flying out of the mortar when being hit. However, the fit between the mortar and the pestle is too close to have sufficient force to crush garlic. The set may be good for mixing herbs but does not work for crushing garlic.

I'd either recommend using sparingly or find a skin-moisturizing alternative (Desert Essence Pure Jojoba Oil + FREE 100% Coconut Oil). I've personally settled on a combination of jojoba and coconut oils to suit my skin needs.I keep the hemp oil around though because in extremely small quantities, it can enhance taste in thick shakes or things like that.

His style is to integrate into the story a lot of background on the places, people and events in the book. In earlier books this exposition has been balanced and did not distract from the plot. However \\"Burnt Bones\\" was more exposition than plot. The story could have been very frightning but the jumps from storyline to historical facts was not well planned and diminished the enjoyment of the story. I like Slade's style and most of the factual material is quite interesting, but when it completely overshadows the story it is annoying. I still am a fan and have his two latest books to read this summer. I hope more emphasis is placed on telling the scary stories he is famous for in these two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ohhhh what could have been","review":"I was disappointed in this newest book by Michael Slade but admit I finished it anyway.

However, with a villain as evil and as dear to my heart as only a great villain can be, this book captivated me from the beginning. Very believable characters, and the history lends it a feeling that it was all destined, or perhaps it really did happen. Far and away the best bad guy I've ever encountered, in part because he is so alluring. What was it...money, power, and lust?"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much of everything..","review":"I quickly tired of all the ancient history lessons, the constant referrals to earlier books by Mr. Slade. The main plot is buried under and between all the talk about Druids and Romans and Scottish wars, hoards, kilts etc. Mephisto, his evil hero, is almost unbelieveable and why he has to be so cruel in order to find his \\"hoard\\" gets lost somewhere. Lots of blood in this book...if you like rape, torture, sadism, masochism set in the beautiful San Juan Islands...then this is the book for you. I didn't finish the book...when body parts started being cut off, I called a halt. But I had been skimming and skipping sections for quite awhile. Not too difficult to put the book aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much history, not enough story","review":"Michael Slade seems to have gotten so caught up in showing off his knowledge of history and the research he does for a book that he has forgotten to tell a story.

While the premise could have been interesting -- tying back ancient history to a madman's quest for knowledge -- this author writes information about history dryer than most history text books that I had to read in college.Another annoying thing this author does is repeat sections of the book verbatim from chapter to chapter -- bad editing job or how the author really writes?I'm giving the book two stars because I think it had the potential to been something really neat had he let the story come out instead of burying it in with so many facts of history. He could also do a lot with character development if he gave it the same passion as he does with his history research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much","review":"When Stephen King writes, he draws you into the character's fear and really makes you dread what's coming next. From Slade - nothing. Horrifying gore - but no emotional link to the characters. What is that? Gratuitous horror? Whatever. When I love a book, I read every sentence and don't skip ahead (don't want to ruin the plot for myself). Jumped all around the pages of \\"Burnt Bones\\". I will say one thing for Slade - his research is thorough and his coverage of ancient history very interesting. It was also fun to see my hometown (Saskatoon) brought into the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Far Cry From Good","review":"Judging by the description written on the back of the book, I assumed that Michael Slade's Burnt Bones would be a great read. I was right at first until he started getting into a whole bunch of history mumbo-jumbo. It seems as if he wrote this book, not for the story, but so he could brag about how well he knows his history.Slade some how finds every way possible to fit in little tidbits of useless historic information. Through dialogue and just plain old writting, he ruins what could have become an excellent plot for an excellent story.Next time I look for a Michael Slade Novel, if there is a next time I look for one of his books, I will be sure to skimm through the majority of the pages - but is it even worth all my time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointment","review":"I've enjoyed Michael Slade's other books, but I was sorely disappointed with Burnt Bones. He's always provided historical background in his other books but, this time, he went overboard. There was so much historical background that the murder mystery part of his book slunk into the background. I found myself skipping sections just to get back to what was happening in the present. I felt the mystery itself was an afterthought he threw in between the history lessons. And, the only character he really developed was the villain. His other characters weren't fleshed out enough to drum up much sympathy and I really missed following the case with Le Clerq. Much, much too wordy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special X is back!","review":"Robert DeClercq and Special X is back with a new thriller.

However, if you plan to make muffins in this muffin pan, think again. They are just too small for anything other than small corn muffins.

About the size of a small apple."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\" EXTREMELY TOO SMALL \\"","review":"I was shocked when I received my pans. They are like cute little toys for my daughter to play with.

Wife and kids claim they tasted better than the batch out of the aluminum muffin pan too. A bit paranoid so I disregarded the \\"pre seasoned\\" bit and seasoned it. As with other reviews I will note it was smaller than I was expecting, but having checked \\"what the...?\\" the measurements were accurate as stated in other posts. Just keep in mind its half the size you think it is. I just ordered another one to prevent grumbling about not enough yorkshires. Easy to clean - just wiped it off and oiled it. Nothing stuck. It is fiddly to handle when its hot and full of oil and batter so I had it in a baking pan/oven tray thing to avoid skin grafts.

I left the pan soaking in water over night and I notice rust after doing this a couple of time, yes I should have used a non stick application but I didn't and I was really surprise that the product didn't have a longer lasting life, most people do not prefer cooking with cookware that has rust on its surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight side muffin pan","review":"I sprayed the pan with a non-fat aerosole spray before filling and muffins (corn) still stuck.

Thinking it was an optical illusion, I took one of my regular sized pans and filled the cup 2/3 full with water (normally the amount you would fill a cup with batter). I then poured the water into the cast iron pan and it filled to the rim. So if you are using a mix that makes 6 muffins, you would probably have batter left over and smaller muffins.

After making a half-recipe of blueberry muffins, I went ahead and ordered a second one so I'd be able to make a dozen at a time. You need to heat the pan along with the oven, but it makes a muffin with a better-textured outer surface than the regular muffin pans I had been using. The size of the muffins is a bit smaller than in my other (non-stick) pans, but I put the whole recipe for a dozen in two pans, which makes for a taller top on the muffin. My wife loves 'em (so do I.) The muffins also come out easily - I wasn't sure if it would be a challenge removing them from the pan, but it is very easy to remove them.Overall, a great product. If you like baking muffins, try this pan - it beats the heck out of regular muffin pans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sized to help you stay normal sized too","review":"This company has been around a long, long time and the quality of their pots and pans is excellent. Cast iron consistently produces a nice crusty outside and a moist but well cooked inside. However, what I think is most admirable about these pans is the fact that they do not create mega muffins. The size is reasonable. We are living in a world where too many foods and drinks are just plain too big. Using pans like these helps keep portion size sensible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too small","review":"The only disappointment I had was that I was expecting a full sized muffin - though they did accurately give the measurements - I just didn't check.Really though I was ordering Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Drop Biscuit PanB00063RX7O Item model number: L7B3 --Cost too much to send back!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not perfect","review":"I just got two of these muffin pans. They are compact size and accommodate all the batter perfectly in one pan for Jiffy brand muffin mixes that are much less than most muffin mixes. You will need two pans for a typical Betty Crocker box of muffin mix. Their compact size make them easier to store and reduce weight. The pre-season is good. I oiled the pans and my muffins came out as free as they would in an aluminum pan. I gave only 4 stars instead of 5 stars because they are a little hard to handle. Being so small there is little room to get a grip on them taking them out of the hot oven. I wish they would have made the end edges protrude out a little further at the middle to serve as handles. Also, the sides are steeper and deeper (not entirely strsight sided as implied) than a typical muffin pan resulting in more soft spongy muffin bottom and less crusty top. I like the top side of a muffin over the soft bottom side. If you like the bottom sides more this is your muffin pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"I thought the muffin cups would be bigger, these are quite small, so was a little dissapointed, not regular size, like for cupcakes, actually smaller...if your going for \\"small\\" and \\"cute\\", this will workl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muffin wells are sloped, not straight sided","review":"I bought two of these to make Yorkshire puddings and popovers and specifically wanted a straight-sided muffin pan.

The fact that people are hyping this record makes it all worse - so I feel compelled to say what might just be said if the poor guy were still alive: Treble & Tremble is the LEAST ORIGINAL record I've heard in a while.Here's an idea: go back to the drawing board, write some tunes that don't rob someone else's spark straight from the grave and earn your fans for a change.Or, just stick to ripping off a brilliant dead guy and bask in the moonlit glow of his tombstone.This record sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Are a Cooks Dream","review":"We have used the doughmakers products for several years now; and just love them.

I hesitated jumping into this book at first due to not really knowing what kind of book it was, it is far out, side splitting funny fantasy at it's best. Not only does Doc Solammen give us two great stories with talking animals, homicidal lawyers, and polish food, he is also a great word smith and it is a joy just to read his descriptions of places and events, not to mention all the unreal situations that take place.

I even called McGraw and they do not even had the paperback listed as being available.Mr. Edmonds is an educator. You would think that he would see to it that a more affordable book like the paperback version would be available especially during this financially tough time for college students and their families.Shame on those connected with this book that they did not make available to students the more affordable paperback version.

For instance, in her version, the prince doesn't want to marry the beautiful, fussy princess who can feel a pea through a pile of mattresses, he'd rather marry Griselda because she's \\"sturdy\\"!

The storyline didn't seem to follow from the previous book, some of the story lines didn't make sense at all, and worst of all, it was mildly boring! I gave it the benefit of the doubt and reread it, simply because I WANTED to love it just as I love all the others. But sadly, I do not. I definitely don't hate it, and I'm glad I have it and that I read it, but I'm still a little disappointed that the book isn't characteristic of Tomoko Hayakawa's typical work.

Richard Sinclair's absence was a thing of the past but a loss the band never was able to adequately compensate for. On this recording, Dave Sinclair is also absent, having left the band for the second time. This proved to be the one two punch that would knock the band out for good. The songwriting is at best anemic, and instead of influencing others, as they had done so with brilliance in the past, they are too influenced by the mediocrity of popular music at the time. There is nothing of value here. On the fine compilation titled Canterbury Tales this album was completely passed over. Even the weak Cunning Stunts managed two cuts.

This is especially true close to the end of her life where the grief from her failed relationship with Onassis is so evident in her voice. Generous samples of Callas's key performances are also woven into the bio. I had never heard Callas sing so these samples were welcome and helpful in understanding Callas. (Her antics on the stage and behind the curtain are how you get to know Callas best. Not to mention that the samples allow you to witness firsthand the fiery, brave voice that made her famous). Overall, this was a strong, unconventional bio on a tragic heroine of the stage. I enjoyed it in its entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and easy read","review":"This book stands out because it is one the most readable books you will find in the history section. It is very clear and you do get a lot of information about the time that representatives from all the states were in Philadelphia during a hot summer to write the Constitution.If you are a highschool student it is therefore very interesting because it gives you a good insight in how this remarkable document came into being. For more advanced readers it is also very interesting, it is especially better than any other book on this subject, it makes the whole process clearer than in a standard history book. It also gives a great explenation of the men who were involved. Through looking at the private documents of the participants she makes the process more human, and therefore more easily understandable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry as the Nevada Desert","review":"I was forced to buy and read this book for an American History class and I KNOW some may say that I am biased because I was required to read this book, but I must say, it is absolutly horrible. As a journalism major I found this book very hard to read. Every chapter talks about the same thing. The delegates can't decide on anything, everything is based on property and nothing is resolved. (well, until the end, obviously) Perhaps that is how the real constitutional convention happened, but i don't need to read the same thing over and over for 200 pages. Often, the author side tracks on little tid bits of personal information about the delegates that seem totally unrealted to the story at the time. Unless you are a seventy year old man, I don't think you will find this book interesting at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore!

It tells you about the troubles the deligates had getting down there, the heat, the citizens, the secrecy, what they did after meetings, etc. After reading each chapter you think \\"Why would they sit through that?\\" and then it goes on to tell you. I found it fascinating to see who really talked, who was prepared, and who was there just to say his name was there in history. I am pleased with how this book turnned out, it not only appeals to the history lover, but to the general public."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Weather was very hot and humid","review":"This book gives a very good accounts of the ins and outs all around the Constitutional convention in Philadelphia from foreign visitors accounts to the inside jokes of Benjamin Franklin.

Aside from the specifics of the Constitution, Ms. Bowen does a superb job of painting a picture of the personalities involved, and more broadly, what life was like in America in the late 18th century.My only criticism is that the book sometimes glosses over the actual drafting of the document. While Ms. Bowen does a fine job of identifying the issues that were discussed, the explanations of how various issues were resolved are at times superficial. Perhaps because I am a lawyer I was looking for more substance than other readers might, but I think at times the desire to talk about the personalities and the times they lived in came at the expense of some of the substance of the Constitutional debate.Still, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and learned quite a lot. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about this critical event in early American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best work EVER on this subject","review":"I read this book some 30 or 40 years ago.

Also, he neglects the Jewish heritage of Christianity and its fight for freedom. Obviously he has not read Michael Walzer's \\"Exodus and Revolution\\".

It hangs up the game.You are forced to run the program from the CD, no Hard Disk only install. If you have more than one Disney Interactive CD, you are left constantly changing CDs because we know how our kids love to change games in the middle.There are 2 minutes of credits at the end of the game that you cannot bypass when exiting the game.C'mon Disney.

Unfortunately, this book droned on and on and on (in my opininon).I don't know what I expected, but if you're looking for a jaunty read about oil and Saudi Arabia: this isn't it.

His ability to rewrite others' conclusions into understandable terms is far from effortless. He has a firm grasp of extending the number of pages within his book by prolonged repetition.If you cross out every last sentence in every paragraph, this is where Mr. Simmons has added some far fetched, irrelevant, or completely contradicting conclusion, and if you can concentrate on the poorly translated technical issues within the body of the paragraph you may be pleased with the information you have gained. But then you may wonder if you couldn't have received the same information in 50 pages or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twighlight in the Desert","review":"The book gets some of the technical facts on the oil recovery process incorrect.

Isn't that the primary reason other production hasn't come on line?How many thousands of oil wells have been shut down because they couldn't hope to profit with oil at $1.00, $2.00, $10.00, $20.00 or even $30.00 a barrel with all this cheaper oil on line?How many thousands of these oil wells will come back on line with $60.00 barrel oil? How much oil can be produced from oil sands at $60.00? How about oil shale?

A must.","review":"The book provides insight and hard data on a topic of great concern for all. Oil, unfortunately, is the foundation of the world's economy. And I say unfortunately in view of the great amount of pollution that our generation has produced. We are paying a great price for the convenience of traveling and many of our comforts of modern day society. When I was a child in the 1970s I had many questions concerning the long lines in the gas stations. The book looks to the past answering many of my childhood questions and tries to predict the future of the Arab oil industry, i.e. oil reserves, and it does a good job. It is on my bookshelf among my other prized oil industry history books.If you want another good read on the oil industry's history I recommend The Prize by Daniel Yergin, which I also enjoyed reading some years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Book","review":"This is a nice book logical with many facts and numbers.

When is the big question. The author did a very good job of providing a basis for his assessment in terms that the average non-oil engineer can understand. I would not be surprised if his book is banned in Saudi Arabia as it does not present a very happy future for that nation.

Simmons' work points to a looming problem - that Saudi Arabia has vastly overstated the country's oil reserves and production capacity. He gives sound technical analysis drawn from opinions of independent oil experts.While it is an important book, the author could have covered the same ground in about half the 464 pages that he used.For a succinct, fictionalized account of the types of non-economic problems besetting the Saudi regime and the future stability of oil markets, you might take a look at SAUDI MATCH POINT, published recently and available online from Blacksmith Books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies, damn lies, and statistics.","review":"Simmons is a delusional wacko. Next thing we'll hear is that there really are little green men from Mars. Only the most gullible would believe this nonsense.The world is awash in oil. The only thing that has changed is that all the cheap oil is gone. We may have to spend more to find it, extract it and refine it, but that's a normal progression. What about the oil sands? More reserves in Canada than all of OPEC combined. And then we have the oil shales, the heavy oil deposits in Ven, etc etc. And then we have vast reserves of coal and natural gas, all of which can be readily used as fuel.Use your brain.

I was thinking maybe that Sen was doing a \\"reductio ad absurdum\\" and at the end, he would offer an alternative approach. Unfortunately not.

The format actually highlights how vividly Cortot could make a musical point: Some of these ideas leap off the CD, and will send you heading to the piano to figure out how he did what he did. For instance, his interpretation of Mozart's C-minor Fantasia, though stylistically anachronistic, makes almost all other performances of this piece seem emotionally stultified.

It may also prove to be a collectors item of the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best shoes I ever bought!","review":"I bought the raccoon print when they came out last winter, and I have to say they quickly became my favorite shoes of all time. The fur lining in the raccoon print (and a few others - fox, llama, and rose kitties) makes them extremely comfortable and, believe it or not, warm enough for normal winter wear (despite the amount of open space in the shoe). Not only are they my most comfortable pair of shoes that aren't sneakers, they are also completely adorable. Later on I bought the panda print as well. Although the comfort level was reduced without the fur lining, the shoes are still incredibly cute and fun to wear. With the huge line of womens flats that's out now, these are certainly some of the most original I've seen. Everyone comments on how fun they are when I wear either pair. I'd recommend them to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Interest to Scholars","review":"I purchased this book because I am a Joseph Conrad fan, and Conradians know that he relied heavily on Wallace for his description of what is now Malaysia and its people. Wallace tends to sentimentalize, and of course he is often very condescending by today's lights, but it's still an interesting bit of scholarly evidence. If you are a birder, you will probably find this more fascinating than I did. For my money, this is a book to dip in and out of in bored or at-loose-end moments, for example while waiting in a doctor's office. Ten or fifteen minutes will give you some interesting vignettes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who thought this one up?","review":"\\"Can you imagine, I mean, can you imagine\\" a musical about spelling bees...it has its humor...and its thoughts...but how many times can you listen to this one...purchase only if you are a Broadway musical fanatic...like me!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voices are wasted on an uninspired and BORING musical.","review":"This is without a doubt the worst musical I've ever seen on Broadway - or perhaps anywhere.

The entire cast of 20 something individuals playing these characters is something to be seen. It is hard to listen to the music and not have seen the show because it's really what is happening with the character on stage during the song that makes it what it is. If you don't like the CD, look for a synopsis of the show and follow along. You'll love it. From A New Brain to this...great show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"A great purchase! 5 STARS!

I might sometimes use it as an elasmosaurus but it might not be as realistic as the Safari elasmosaurus. The feature that makes it bend is holes in its neck. I would have expected it to be a little more durable because one of the stripes on the top of the body seems to be cracking a tiny bit. Overall I am very pleased with this toy and it is a very nice nothosaur."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree it's a little snug.","review":"Good quality hat - 100% wool. I found the brim to be somewhat \\"cheap\\" feeling, though (hence the 4 stars). On the best hats I own the brim is very rigid and forms a beautiful curve when I shape it. This one was kind of \\"mushy\\" and doesn't form or hold a really nice curve.

Not from the law, but from her past. Will she be able to slow down and live life peacefully with the guy she's fallen for?

The book is very contemporary and avoids cliches."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable, easy read filled with mystery and love","review":"This book appears to be the first of a series involving the five members of a security agency. Reminiscent of Dee Henderson's O'Malley series, the five are a tight group, forming family for each other. They solve mysteries while falling in love in the most dangerous situations. In this case, Lily is running from a stalker. She hopes Josh can handle her past as Josh deals with his own past mistakes. While not as intense or as long as the O'Malley books, SHELTER FROM THE STORM is an enjoyable, easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love military SF then skip this","review":"This author wrote the Dorsai-novels which are readable, with \\"Spirit_of_Dorsai\\" perhaps the best.

The leading character is supposed to be a super-super-soldier, but all he does is snoop around (serving as a spy) and gathering information from which he finally draws a conclusion that is so stupid as to be beyond belief.Probably has too much magic in it to be counted as SF.

Specifically :The Genetic General (1960)Necromancer (1962Warrior (1965)Soldier, Ask Not (1967)Tactics of Mistake (1971)The Spirit of Dorsai (1979)Lost Dorsai (1980)The Final Encyclopedia (1984)I prefer these older sci.fi. books to the current crop of fantasy works that ever Dickson indulged in during his later years (Dragon Knight Series). I suppose there's precious little difference between dragons and spaceships however I haven't read any factual accounts of anyone riding a dragon in the 20th or 21st centuries. Note that these books aren't particularly deep and make for a good restful read when you have the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Ultimate Gary Glitter","review":"This is a must for anyone who has a slight interest in glam rock. The unique glitter sound is present on all the 32 songs in this double CD. There's also all the classic Gary Glitter hits featured on this Double CD, which include: Rock and roll(part 2), I'm the leader of the gang (i am), Hello Hello I'm back again, I love you love me love, Do you wanna touch me(oh yeah), I didn't know I loved you (till i saw you rock and roll), Another rock and roll christmas and Always yours.There's also some of the great hits by the Glitter band on this album too, which include: Lets get together again, Just for you and Angel face.Overall a superbly good bundle of songs, all holding their owngood-vibe-glitter drum beats, infectious lyrics and fun loving Gary Glitter energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gary Glitter - the anti-Elvis","review":"Glitter is more famous for his sex crimes (the latest in Vietnam) than for his pathetic music. An Elvis-imitator updated for the so-called glam rock scene is all he was, and the lyrics of his songs are pathetic.Glitter, in fairness, can do some good songs like an okay version of Elvis' early hit \\"Baby let's play house\\", but - that's just what he is, an Elvis imitator who is okay to see on a seaside holiday, but not to buy. As for his own songs, they suck. Maybe his sex crime activities in the UK and Vietnam have biased me, and I think that nobody should support (inclusive of buying his CDs) or have sympathy for this man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This guy is a convicted paedophile and is currently wanted for questioning about co-habitating with a 15-year-old girl in Vietnam.

Had I known what it was going to be like I would have returned it before watching. Although I applaud the effort of the film crew for the time spent and quality of aerial photography I didn't like this perspective of Italy. I found the video to be monotonous. The descriptions were very plain and lacked interesting detail. I fell asleep a few times during the view.I agree with one other reviewer. Italy is best seen up close and not totally from a helicopter. I don't think I'll watch this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visions of italy","review":"I found the dialog very difficult to understand and the music was very loud.

It's not only a great watch, but probably lowers one's blood pressure significantly.-Jane"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its like being there!","review":"This DVD set is superb. The video and sound quality is excellent. It's much better than it looks on PBS. The pannoramic views are stunning, the narrator enchanting and the music is really nice.

If you've never seen this on PBS, but have been to Italy, you will reminisce at the places, monuments, etc. this DVD adventure takes you on. I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Visual Treat","review":"This is undoubtedly some of the most stunning views of Italy you will ever see. We can't say enough about the creativity regarding shot selection and visual composition. Having said this, we are preparing for a trip to Italy and would have liked to see more than just aerial shots.

Quite often when the heliocopter would rapidly ascend while turning, a wave of nausea would linger. Place names intended to appear across the corner of the screen were out of the viewing area. Palermo, as an example, would only allow Pale to be seen while the narrator was mute. This was a constant. The narrator, I felt, was the worst choice made in the production and the wonderful music just about drowned her out because it was too loud over her voice....which means you really needed to crank up the volume so that your neighbors could enjoy the music while you listened intently to try and hear what she was talking about. Pitiful. Rather than narrate a travel film, such a sultry voice would be better suited to a dark cabaret scene. Thumbs down on this malarky .....I won't even bother with the second of this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidest voiceover","review":"Beautiful views spoiled by utterly banal commentary delivered by an irritating female voice trying to be seductive"},{"rating":"1","title":"More like an Italian Screen Saver","review":"Yes, the images are beautiful - and the quality is good.

I was dismayed to find numerous factual errors throughout the book including: Incorrect translations of Icelandic terms, incorrect gender names of characters, incorrect descriptions of food and incorrect descriptions of Christmas traditions and many more.In fact the errors were so many that this book should be considered useless.

Maybe when my granddaughter gets a little older..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini typist","review":"I got this for my 4 yr old, who has older siblings that have typing cd-roms to learn with.

So far he is only in the beginning, and there is only one game to play (besides the standard drill). I think there will be more games available as he progresses. If you can't downgrade easily, however, this game is probably not worth buying.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Win2000, WinXP version","review":"I will wait untill the game comes out in Win2000, or WinXP. I have an old one that worked on my old computer and the game was fun. Now it's worthless. I will sell it for a penny but no one will buy it.

And it dosen't work on the the current model computers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! Boring! Boring!","review":"While this program appears to be cute and engaging at the onset, it quickly becomes very boring. My daughter likes the ONE game, but can't get past the first row of typing because it's so monotanous. There is nothing to challenge her to keep going and improving - no incentive. Just more boring repetition like we had to do in high-school."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD broke after 2 times using it","review":"At first I was very excited to get this CD from the company since my son is dyslexic and a teacher told me this was a great way to help him. It came quickly in the mail and the first time I used it, it worked fine. But the next time I loaded it, the CD didn't work at all so I'm very disappointed of course. The computer screen just turned all different colors and it was obvious that it was a bad quality CD. I would and should have returned it, but obviously for the price I paid, it really didn't make sense to go and pay shipping or make the extra trip to the post office for this. Still if the company happens to read this, I would be very appreciative if they felt that they could just find my past information and mail me another one of these Disney's Adventures in Typing programs that actually works. If not, than I guess I learned my lesson to try to only buy new CD's from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy","review":"I have had a terrible time getting this program to run.

When she first began to play, she was very tempted to look at her fingers...I sat beside her and held a lg. piece of paper over her hands, which solved the problem. The first night she learned to type f,d,j and k. She liked to \\"shoot bugs\\" (by typing the correct letter) but mandatory pages of just letters was a bit frustrating for her. I think that this game should go a little slower and therefore be more of a game and less work. I rate this game a solid B. It seems that it would be perfect for an 8 or 9 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to teach a child to type","review":"This is a great game/teaching tool which will help any youngster ages 4 - 15 to use a keyboard.

We bought this game over 10 years ago. It has remained the favorite for all the children. Each child starts out with a tree house and a mailbox of his/her own. The program enables many children to have their own 'account' or tree house. The prizes for mastering each section of this game are things for your treehouse. When you visit your tree house, you can 'play' with the items you won. This gives wonderful incentive to complete the 'lessons'. We have purchased many educational games since, and none have come close to this one. I wish they had updated it for the newer computers. Put it this way, I love this game so much that I am purchasing another computer with Windows98 just so the kids can still learn with it.

We read it over and over, and then it was lost on an outing.She is a big girl now and we bought another copy for her baby brother who just turned 1. She loves reading it to him. Because the puppet is made out of rubber (and let's face it, rubber does age) and it was stored with the puppet squished flat for a very long time, it formed little cracks - hence the 4 star rating i gave the product.it would be great if this book would be published again!Bottom line - i am glad i was able to find this book online after so many years and ordered it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mrs.Pat Siwiec","review":"I have only used this 1 time, but it was great..I will be using it more now that the holidays are approaching, and looking forward to make the cookies I have not been able to make for some time, as I did not have the proper Marble Board..Thanks for carrying it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"Arrived in little pieces, so I had to send it back.

Where's the emotion? Where's the feeling? Ah, youth! She may have entered the great wilderness of artistic development which in the old days of show business went unrecorded.

His insight and clear writing will help the most risk averse recognize the risks they're overlooking in doing nothing. \\"Right Risk\\" will also coach the adrenaline junkie on how to actually make progress with all the risky behavior - instead of just taking more risks.Treasurer's conversational style, strong organization skills, and use of wonderful quotes (both familiar and new), make this a delightful read while challenging you to do better, leap higher, be more true to yourself.

However, I was pleasantly surprized upon watching this film.The setting is German occupied Rome toward the end of the war. The story line evolves around the conflict between resistance forces and the occupation forces. What is unique in this film is the brilliant way suspense is developed, keeping all of us glued to our seats during its showing. The fine acting by both British and Italian stars brought an enhanced sense of reality accentuated by the moral dilema encountered by both military men and clergy.

I have taken Calculus several times (picky colleges won't accept Calc credits.. UM, UA, HU) and eventually I even taught Calculus. Texts like this are the reason why people hate math. The examples are nothing like the practice questions, the warm up (early questions) have very complex answers and the text itself overuses mathematical jargon to further complicate things. Even the equation and trig reference charts are crap. Calculus is designed as a basis for higher level math. If you make it ugly and confusing from the beginning, it spawns entire classes of students that have a weak foundation and end up more confused and frustrated later on. When the semester ended, my copy sat in the fireplace. At least it was useful for keeping warm, because it certainly was no good at teaching math."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this book!","review":"Examples are too hard to follow which makes this book difficult to read.

The examples in the chapters aren't always that good. The practice problems give very little practice. As one problem is completed successfully and you move on, the next problem has a little twist to it that isn't covered in the text. The student is left on his own to figure out how to negotiate the twist and solve the problem. You never feel like you've really practiced because you rarely get more than two or three basic problems solved.

It's a great way to get kids familiar with using the sewing machine without wasting thread or fabric. The projects are fun and simple to do and the games and puzzles are fun and informative.The only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I was hoping for more usefull patterns.

The novel follows the life of Ted Mundy, son of a drunken cashiered British Army major, starting with his boyhood in Pakistan and following it through his schooling in England, his student activism, his troubles in Berlin, his fling as a writer, his work at a lower level government position, and his recruitment for work he can't talk about. Women pass through his life starting with Anya, the family servant in Pakistan. Now he is on the skids, looking for work, and being offerred something new.The novel is filled with political philosophy, activism against the establishment, criticism of the US role in various wars, etc. It is an interesting plot, but perhaps the author gets a little to involved on a personal agenda.

It was amazingly poorly thought out and completely unbelievable - an incredible \\"thud\\" after a great character study.

Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunning Disappointment - A Waste of Time","review":"You begin reading this book and hope it will get better...but it doesn't. It becomes so painful that you simply can't give up out of sheer hope it will improve. The only reason it is a page-turner is because you can't believe how bad it is.The story is extremely weak, the characters bland and stale, and the timing is horrific. Le Carre could have spared us all 350 pages of bland writing and wasteful detail, to instead write a short-story of this work.LeCarre had an opportunity to make a statement about many things related to terrorism: it's foundations in a person, events leading to becoming one, how countries deal with and seek to turn the tide. But he doesn't. LeCarre wastes all his time bouncing back and forth, all over the map with his characters, creating a void of any substance.\\"Absolute Friends\\" is an absolute waste of time. Do not bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Angry, Manipulative LeCarre","review":"I oppose the war in Iraq. That said, Mr.LeCarre's rageful, bitter declamation is a disservice to the reader, the story, and, mainly, his characters. Ted and Sasha should have been two of the author's best--baby boomers with major chips on their shoulders and a world of pained idealism in their hearts. Instead, Mr. LeCarre uses their fascinating life arc as a rank device to spew his hatred of American imperialism and my country's reactions to the horrible events of 9/11. At the end, we're supposed to be even angrier than he is at the USA, a country he seems to feel will kill any and every innocent on the planet to shore up its world supremacy. It's a shame. Mr. LeCarre has written eloquent essays expressing his disdain for all things American. He didn't need to resort to his beloved medium, fiction, to flesh out his hatred. This is a sad work of multi-layered character assassination; and the characters are Mr.LeCarre's own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vituperative hate piece","review":"If le Carre weren't at the end of his career, I would promise never to read another of his books.

Instead of the wonderfully complex humanist George Smiley, in \\"Absolute Friends\\" we are now presented with one-dimensional characters such as the hapless Ted Mundy and cartoon villain Jay Rourke. Rather than the tightly-woven plots of his earlier books, we now have rambling storylines that barely mesh. And in place of the morally ambiguous universe that made his earlier novels so compelling, we are now given the didactic dreck and leftist political clichés of Le Carré's newly-acquired weltanschauung. A deeply disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An author past his time","review":"This book was a major disappointment. The first half of the book was a rambling montage, with little to do with the main action which occurs in the second half. Le Carre's writing style was disjointed - hard to follow a logical path.

I was concerned that I must have missed something when I read glowing reviews. This book meanders without any really compelling action and I felt at times Le Carre was parading out his knowledge of 60's politics rather than telling a story. The ending almost absolves the book as it is quite tense and has a bitter twist but it was a lot of work for ten good pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"LeCarre's World","review":"is always a pleasure to visit. I've read his novels since Call for the Dead first came out. The man is a great story teller and the characters always seem like people I've met. In this story the world of the late sixties is vividly recreated as a world stage. The friendship lies at the core of this novel and how it starts and then develops occupies a nice portion of this book. Mundy's early life also is a neat story within a story. All aspects of this friendship rang true to me. I have and had friends like Sasha. The anti American plot element is deserved but certainly not vitriolic by any means. If this is the first time reading this author, I would not recommend starting with this one. I'd say start with the Constant Gardener, then the Smiley novels and that will give you a great sense of how this author peoples his world."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is probably how it is","review":"John le Carre is an angry old man, kicking out at the avarice of Global Business and the mendacity of Government. Good luck to him.This book is in the tradition of \`A perfect Spy'. Not all secret agents are 007's. With \`Absolute Friends' le Carre presents a biography of Ted Mundy, a secret, naive and gentle man, who somehow meanders into a life of espionage.After the shenanigans of pre and post war Iraq, nobody should be surprised with the novels poignant finale, no matter how predictable. This is probably how it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down-Spoiler Review","review":"I've read all but one or two of Le Carre's books and I need to get it off my chest that the ending of this book was a cheap out in my view. The author's writing for the first ninety + per cent of the book was typical and interesting in the way Le Carre usually writes. He had me go through the entire life of this critter, Teddy, having me sympathizing and speculating in each new circumstance. That was very nice, however the pace suddenly sped up and made a messy, truncated job of the sudden demise of...well, actually the plot. The last 30 pages of the book must have been written to get it over with. The last 10 I just skimmed to assure myself that it was nothing more than boring filler commentary by minor characters. It was like, as they might say in Le Carre's fictional world of espionage, all foreplay and the bride fell asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"2/3 of a good book","review":"After the disappointing Constant Gardener, I thought I might not even give this one a look--and sad to say, I should have saved myself the money. I think that after all these years, le Carre just can't keep his politics from interfering in his art. For 2/3 of the book, we have credible characters and an interesting plot; then it all goes away in a polemic with cardboard characters and a plot made up from the fantasies of the radical left. Too bad...he was always such a find writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"He ripped off G K Chesterton!","review":"The book feels like two and I didn't buy how he connects the two. The first part is cold war stuff recycled. The second is his diatribe against the war in Iraq. The glued together pieces of his story ultimately portray Islam as noble and stoic and the West as evil and probably deserving of what they got. The observant reader will undoubtedly see similarities in the story line with le Carre's other works such as \\"A Perfect Spy\\", \\"The Looking Glass War\\" and, yes, even \\"TSWCIFTC.\\"What really put me over the edge was le Carre ripping off lines from one of G K Chesterton's \\"Father Brown\\" stories. If you read the book and didn't catch it, it was the part about what the best joke is.Don't waste your time on this book. If you want good reading, start with Chesterton. His books are easily and reasonably available from Ignatius Press."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Jumble","review":"I've long been a fan of John Le Carre, but this effort is a dud. I read through all 451 pages just to be sure I was not having a bad day. If it were not for the notes on the book jacket, I might still not know what the story was about. I did learn that Le Carre has mastered the use of the \\"f word\\" along with \\"s\\" and \\"a\\", too bad. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely hypocritical","review":"Le Carre has lost his way in a book that is more a political statement than an espionage novel.His sympathetically idealistic character Sasha, described on the book's jacket as \\"seeker after absolutes\\" labels Israel's creation a \\"monstrous human crime\\" but doesn't want to be called anti-semitic.. He lambasts the Colation of the Willing's bombing of innocent Iraqis buts says nothing of Sadam's torcher and executions of hundreds of thousands of his own people.The author is clearly trying to make a statement but in so doing destroys what could have been one of his better books. The nuance and artfullnes of his previous books is replaced with the author's own obvious disdain for America, Israel and the war.The reader should be cautioned. If you cherished the Smiley trilogy, The Perfect Spy, The Little Drummer Girl and his other works as I did, do yourself a favor and don't read this book. You may become as disillusioned with the author is as the author is with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away from this book...swiftly!!!","review":"John le Carre used to write very good, suspenseful, exciting spy novels. I picked this book up to read on a cross-country flight. This book was nothing more than a horrendously boring, philosophically inept, left-wing socialist rant. It did have a few exciting pages when the two main characters were actively engaged in espionage, but this small, short-lived homage to John le Carre books of the past was overshadowed by the leftist, anti-American political diatribe that the rest of the book consisted of. I'll admit, I am a conservative politically, but I can't begin to see how even the most died-in-the-wool liberal/leftist/socialist could stand all the endless pages of drippy left wing philosophy and pseudo-intellectualism.I highly recommend that when you see this book on the shelves, you very hurriedly turn and run the other way, \\"Absolute Friends\\" is an utter waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical European anti-Americanism","review":"The ending is totally unrealistic.

I'm not bothered by the anti-Americanism that other negative reviewers note, though it is indeed there and center-front.What struck me was that here was most of a very well-written novel that LeCarre seems to have gotten tired of after, oh say, page 400. At that point all of the naunced and thoughtful character development and observation gets heaved for a fantastic comic book finish done in large black and white strokes. The \\"Heidelberg Seige\\" as I believe its called in the book, is more the stuff of Tom Clancy than John LeCarre.In the end even LeCarre's sense for people fails him and the last few pages are simply an accounting lacking in skill and subtleness that only serve to further beat his political drum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing effort","review":"I found \\"Absolute Friends\\" at an \\"everything's a dollar\\" venue. While I wondered that it had been remaindered so quickly, I picked up a copy. After all, I had enjoyed much of the author's earlier work.I finally finished it, although it became harder and harder to continue. This is one of the most seriously overwritten works I've ever encountered, dragging on for page after page of excruciating and mostly useless detail. What remains are the thinly disguised leftist political opinions of the author telling a story that will appeal to those who believe that governments are oppressive and inherently evil.Rather than donate this one to my local library, I trashed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Le Carre gives long winded introspections into the life of a boring character. He goes on and on on political positioning and social engineering that are irrelevant and incredibly predictable. This book is tedious through and through. It's le last Le Carre I will pick up. I read to entertain myself but when the main character is more boring than me; why bother?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book not the message","review":"A book of strength and character. I fear that people are rating this book on blind patriotism rather than on the more important writing style and story. This book kept me engrossed, surprised me and enticed me into wanting more. What more could you ask? A great book to help one keep an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 Words or Less","review":"As a casual fan of Le Carre, I headed into this novel with mild expectations. Yet, even that minimal emotion was too much. His writing style is excellent, as usual. His characters are well thought out and complex. Everything seemed in place ... and maybe that was the problem. It was all so mundane. True, he's not known for action-packed spy thrillers (and that's what I appreciate about him), but in this case the dialogue and plot plodded along. Maybe it might pick up the deeper I read? I'll never know because I ran out of curiosity by pg. 100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britain's most brilliant novelist","review":"John Le Carré has never been a simple spewer of mechanical little spy yarns. He has always been a fine novelist with a style and a point of view all his own. His Cold War novels are the defining literary monument of that period; quite aside from plot details and other entertaining minuti, they synthesise a world. And they do it with unforgettable brilliance.In his latest undertaking, he relates the Cold War era to this age of single-superpower dementia. He does it with style and a point of view of his own. Like all great literature, ABSOLUTE FRIENDS holds up a mirror to reality-and some people don't like what they see. Too bad.This is John Le Carré's NINETEENTH novel, and one of his best: as engaged and utterly himself as ever, he remains one of the most important writers of the last half century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats it about?","review":"I almost put the book down after a 100 pages as I couldn't figure out what it was about or where it was going.

It was the first of his books I have ever read and I doubt i will give this hack another shot.I am guessing his success has been propped up by wealthy activist who support his obviously extremist out look on the world.There was no story. It was simply an anti-America, anti-Britain, anti-West, anti-business, anti-Christian, anti-Israel anti-everything the most radical euro trash could possibly come up with diatribe.I do not know much about this guy but he left me with the distinct impression of someone suffering a mental breakdown of some kind.How does garbage like this get printed?

Almost James Bond in reverse.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"meandering plot with political diatribe thrown in","review":"This book has a slow, meandering plot with the author's anti-US/UK rantings thrown in. The characters, aside from protagonist Ted Mundy, do not stand out and are entirely too predictable. The dialogue is contrived and unrealistic.I was very disappointed with this book and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best, certainly his worst ending","review":"Having read all of LeCarre's previous books, I expected fantastic writing with a bit of a downer ending. Well this one had only mediocre writing and his worst ending ever! I really was disappointed. His writing still outshines most, but pales in comparison to that of his previous books. And the ending? I don't mind if it's a bit depressing, but this one was downright obscene. In the last chapter he stops writing and starts preaching, and the sermon is bad for any Americans--we're arrogant imperialists who faked the war in Iraq for oil and power, and worse than that, we're at fault for our response to terrorism. Seeing as how that was written by a man whose country didn't lose thousands of citizens on 9/11, I'm afraid I take offense. My recommendation: Wait for us his next book, probably he'll do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The usual","review":"The same boring Le Carre characters with a dash of anti American sentiment thrown in. The author doesn't like us but he isn't too proud to take our money, it seems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Boring Friends","review":"This is LeCarre's most pedestrian work. It starts well, getting one involved with the two major characters. But then it seems to tread water for much of the remainder of the book, at times making very little sense. One character becomes a caricature and unlike some of LeCarre's main characters in other books, I found I didn't really care what happened to him. He behaved in unexplicable, erratic ways that simply were not convincing. The denouement at the end was equally unconvincing. Sorry I cannot be more positive, but this book was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Should be Left Out in the Cold","review":"David Cornwell, a/k/a John Le Carre' certainly has enough hits under his belt. He's made his literary bones big time. Why then, this recycling of cold war weltschmerz with an editorial and slap dash cartoon ending? Those of us who participated in the cold war in intelligence will wax reminiscent in the Sasha Mundy relationship, but Hell, it's been done to death already Mr. Le Carre'. You don't like American politics? Fine, but put your essays where they belong. And that \\"Gee, I'm sick of my own book, so I'll kill everybody quick,\\" ending? Your readership deserves better, and no doubt you can do better.Sometimes it pays to know when to throw in the typewriter and hit the showers. Maybe it's that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"Over the years, I've eagerly sought out and read every one of Le Carre's novels. I looked forward to this one just as much, and in spite of some of the claims here, wasn't at all offended by any \\"anti-Americanism\\" in the book. Perhaps that's because I didn't really encounter any. Somewhere about two-thirds of the way through the novel, I realized I didn't care. I didn't care about the plot. I didn't care about either of the major characters. I had absolutely no interest in who eventually did what (assuming someone finally got around to doing anything). Life is too short to read books just because the author used to get it right. I'm just glad it was a library copy and I hadn't sunk my own money into this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Le Carré as barking moonbat","review":"John Le Carré still writes beautifully, but this former master spywriter's latest book - set partly in the post 9/11, post-Iraq War world - boasts all the political nuance and acumen of a Ted Rail America-hating screed. It's a genuine pity to see that he's become a barking moonbat who's only a half-step back (if that) from the folks who seriously insist that the CIA directed the 9/11 attacks on instructions from Evil Dubya & Co. Once an author whom I eagerly bought in hardbound, he'll get no more of my bookbuying dollars (or pounds sterling or Euros)."},{"rating":"1","title":"how have the mighty fallen","review":"Lecarre fall from the pantheon of great writers has been sudden and suprising. This book is unbelieveable boring. As you may know this novel is vehemently anti-war, but that is not its downfall. No matter hat his position on the war, that was not the reason for my poor rating. This book is weak, no character development and no excitement. It plods along like a snow monster in a blizzard. With 3 straight disappointments, maybe Lecarre should step aside for a newer generation of spy authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Australian SF Reader","review":"This book is too long and too messy, and for a fantasy book, none of the characters were interesting enough to put up with for that long.A man and a woman, mythological and historical characters that you have probably heard of, but changed in this book, end up opponents down through the ages, a conflict that his its root in their original meeting.The first part is not so bad, then, blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Themes, Different Cover","review":"If you've read The Wayfarer Redemption, you're likely going to feel a sense of déjà vu.

While I eventually felt some small sympathy for Cornelia, who at least shows some positive changes in her personality, the other characters might have gotten swallowed up into Tartarus, and nobody would have much cared.Perhaps in future novels of the series, the male protagonist won't be a jerk, through and through."},{"rating":"1","title":"big waste of time","review":"Had some interesting ideas but none of them really went anywhere. Characters spend literal years - the REST OF THEIR LIVES in some cases - having the sort of communication difficulties that normally occur in brief exchanges in a movie where two people couldn't quite manage to say the right thing. By the end absolutely nothing is resolved, everyone's life was pretty much a waste, and they're all going to die to reincarnate in some other time period and do the whole thing over again.

While sympathetic characters are not necessary to all stories and writing styles, it does not suit Douglass's. The characters in this story are cardboard cut-out characters. They do not progress or grow believably from one behavior to another. First they act in a certain way, then all of a sudden, for no apparent reason, they do a complete one-eighty.She tries to have heroes, but her heroes act so replusively that you cannot root for them. Or, they act so pathetically that you would rather scream at them then root for them.This writing style is choppy and does not progress well form one scene to another. Plot threads go nowhere. Actions happen for no apparent reason.I will not buy any more of Douglass's works, and I would recomment that you either check this book out from the library, or wait for it in paperback. It is not worth the hardback price."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"This book was utterly dissapointing for a sara douglass. It's a confusing (but somehow manages to be boring) plot, and it's waaay to graphic for its own good....Cornelia, Sara Douglass's main character (actually I'm still not sure WHO are the main characters) is a pompous, arrogant spoilt brat, and she doesn't have much of a character at all. Her husband, Brutus is not much more than a complete and total .... The characters do not really support the story. Nothing that they do makes sense.Also, she mixes different types of mythology, which I must say brings out a totally confusing and muddled theme.This book is NOT worth reading. If you want to read REAL fantasy, read Sara Douglass's other books like Starman, or Beyond The Hanging Wall.

After reading Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordan, it was a awesome to finally read an epic that showed how REAL people act. The storyline flowed, and I enjoyed the mixed perspectives. Cornelia's point of view really added to the story. I finished the book two days ago, and I cannot stop thinking about it. Douglass's writing style really allowed me to connect with Cornelia, and the mistakes and misunderstandings that occur are true to life. I have never read a book that explains the ways of men and women as well as this book does. I really feel for Cornelia and Brutus, and I wish that other readers would give this book a chance. There are violent scenes, but the emotions of the characters and the era in which the story is set make them believable. I look forward to reading her other series, and I hope the next book in this series comes out soon. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it is from Hades","review":"What a huge disappointment to me. I first discovered Sara Douglass' work when I was in Australia and I loved the Starman trilogy.

There is something so innately wrong with a modestly talented modern writer who cannot leave the modern age behind her when composing, who insists on recasting classic figures in a pseudo-classic style that threatens to break the fourth wall altogether by the end of the trilogy. Ick. These characters are sort of the stock from bad twenties movies, with the dialog to boot.Now, on the good side. There is less of the silly, predictable stuff of the Wayfarer Redemption, Douglass's earlier effort, though the curses are as flat here as the prophecies were there. The characters are still not very well drawn, but they are somewhat better. On the whole, Douglass is improving, but this icky combo of fakey modern classic era god-knows-what is still not worth paying hardcover price for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good.","review":"This book is the reason I will never buy Sara Douglass in hardcover ever again. With her Wayfarer Redemption series I actually enjoyed it enough to order the rest of the 5 online from England in order to not wait on US publication.

I'm not a big fan of fantasy anyway, but I'd hoped that the ancient setting would be a saving grace in the way that David Gemmell's trilogy failed.

The rhymes really keep them amused for a few minutes.I enjoy this book as well. Although the illustrations could be better.Surprisingly, this book was not written by a mother of twins, but by a woman who had babies about 10 months apart. Regardless, it is still a great book for twins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, easy read for toddlers","review":"My b/g twins love this book! They think it's funny, they like the pictures and it's a quick, easy read. I like that it's about b/g twins rather than identical--so it helps them identify with the book. It mentions bedtime prayers too, which reminds them that they should say their prayers after we read the book at bedtime. I recommend this book for anyone with b/g twins!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Twin to Twin","review":"Great product , gave it as a gift to a friend who was expecting twins, parts were homorous and yet educational how twins react to one another .

It got such great reviews that I didn't bother to check it out through interlibrary loan first. On the positive side, the illustrations by Thierry Courtin are very sweet. This is the same illustrator of the \\"Tchoupi\\" series of children's books, popular in France. Okay, back to THIS book. I couldn't believe I had shelled 12 bucks out for it. Can a book be too simple for a young toddler? YES! If this book had been a small carry-along book in board book format, I would've rated it a bit higher. Having it in a large hardcover format is overkill. I have to keep my hardcover books out of reach from little hands, and this book was so dull and unispired that I certainly was never going to reach for it. I sent it back at my own expense to Amazon. First time I've ever done that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a DDR with a new Twist! This game is great!!","review":"I love this game! I quite frankly don't understand why people say this game is not as good as the regular. It has fun songs from previous mario games and is more like an action game, but you still get to dance as much. I have been playing the regular DDR for 3 years and learned how to play on HARD level which is very difficult. I could barely keep up with the VERY HARD LEVEL on Mario Mix and there is even a harder level than that! This is an A PLUS game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BE CAREFUL!","review":"This game has been recalled because of problems with the dance mat. That is why it is no longer available from retailers.

I only gave it 4 stars because of the classical songs I liked the mario songs a lot though.This is MUCH easier than DDR, I can barely play ddr on easy but this I made it to hard. This is good for whole family i think"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a DDR game for GameCube!","review":"This is a great game if you enjoy playing DDR games, or want to start playing them. The songs can be catchy, though I prefer the real DDR songs, and have good beat.Some of the bad points of this game though are that you only start out with one song, twinkle twinkle little star. You have to go through story mode, which only take about 1-2 hours to finish, to get some more songs.Another bad note is that even if you play story mode on normal it starts out insanely easy. Also there are no hold notes, and note very many eighth or sixtieth notes.One of the cooler points of the game if where it'll track how many calories you burn. You'll be amazed at how much you can burn off with one hour of playing. xPf you are a very serious DDR fan, you might not like this game.

The only gaming system we have is a GameCube and this is honestly the only DDR I could find for the GameCube. (So, if anyone knows of a more adult one, let me know please!) It has been perfect for my son, who is currently 8 years old and has some trouble with coordination. It starts out slowly enough to give him some practice, and he has been able to improve his coordination quite rapidly by following the story mode.As an adult, I'm horribly out of shape, so for a better workout, I do the free mode (I had to go through the entire story one time first, which I was able to do in one sitting). In the free mode I can put the difficulty up a little higher, which is great for me. For someone who is more experienced with DDR or more in shape than I am, I imagine this game would be too easy. But it has been an excellent fit for our family."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAH!!!!

It only takes like an hour to get through the whole game and it doesn't burn nearly as many calories as the other DDR games and isn't as difficult. My suggestion is to go out and get the Madcatz MC Grooves if you really want a dance game for gamecube. It's cheaper and a lot more fun. Don't waste your money like I did on this game.

Neither one of these are as impressive as her debut solo single, \\"Emotional Rollercoaster\\", which is one of the best club songs of the last decade.Of the mixes on this CD single, only Junior's \\"27th Street Mix\\" stands out.

They are, by the way, another of my favs. Long story short, I'd recognize that voice anywhere -- it's one I've come to know & love!

As an author/illustrator his enthusiasm and imagination never ebb as he again fashions collage illustrations that catch and hold our eyes. Seahorse is one more achievement.Basing his witty and informative tale on fact young readers are introduced to Mr. Seahorse, a fish father who looks after his young. It is, of course, Mrs. Seahorse who lays the eggs, right in Mr. Seahorse's pouch.Mr. Seahorse is not the only fish father (we might think of him as a house husband) in his watery world - there's also Mr. Bullhead, Mr. Pipe, and Mr. Kurtus.As always, Eric Carle both enchants and illuminates.- Gail Cooke"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truthful, Loving Dad plus Education and Vivid Colors Galore","review":"Mr. Seahorse carries eggs in his pouch and passes time visiting other Seafaring/living daddies. Beautiful acetone pages teach little readers about the plants underwater and how the fish creatively camouflage themselves to stay safe.Carle's signature style of illustration captures the delight of my children and of me, too.I personally laughed at the \\"babysitting\\" comment of one of the fish dads. How many times have I heard my friends complaining about fathers terming the time they spend alone with their children as \\"babysitting\\"?Perfect time for the parent reading the book to laugh with the child and say \\"He isn't babysitting, he is Daddying!\\"I learned a couple great \\"fishy\\" lessons from this colorful book.

Glad I looked back into the archives for this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Villa","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I have been a huge fan of Nora Robert's for years but I think this is the worst one I have read! The problem was she never fully developed the characters. There were too many different story lines going on so you never really got to know any of them well. Sophia and Tyler are supposed to be the main characters yet you go several chapters without them being mentioned. I also felt like I was reading a Sidney Sheldon novel with all of the conversations between the police! Because there were so many characters I felt as if she was not able to develop the whole sabotage plot and the real reasons behind it were. I hope in her next book, she gets back to the style that she excelled at before with less characters and more well developed ones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best...","review":"If you enjoy Nora Roberts page turners, try The Reef, Montana Sky, Hidden Treasures, or Three Fates.

It was very engaging, and even got my husband interested. He wanted me to wait to finish it when he could listen, too, but I couldn't wait. The narrator told the story beautifully, doing Nora Roberts great credit with her intonations and abilities. I can't wait to see it made into a movie, and wish I had the Lifetime channel to watch the ones that were already done. I loved Blue Smoke and Angel's Fall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not her best work","review":"I did not like this book because I did not feel drawn to the characters or the storyline. If you want great reading from Nora Roberts, I highly recommend Carolina Moon and A River's End. While reading the Villa, I found myself reading ahead to the ending because I did not care about the characters to engrose myself into their pettiness and insecurities. I found most of them self-absorbed and unnatural. A teenager named Maddy was probably the most redeeming because she actually brought a sense of reality to the idiots around her. The character of Tyler had potential at the beginning, but eventually lost his appeal and charm. Save your time because this was a huge disappointment for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"As usual, I picked up a Nora Roberts novel and couldn't put it down. The dialogue was great and there was a great cast of characters -- a lot of characters, but after you got everyone figured out, they were great.

I should have waited for the paperback. Lately we've been waiting too long for something to come, this could have waited a little longer. Perhaps Nora Roberts could have thought of a better ending.

The characters in The Villa are so life-like that it seems you are with them through every hardship they come upon through the book.

Once you begin it, you won't be able to stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal ending","review":"Wasn't anyone else bothered by the ending of this book? How can one justify taking the law into one's own hands and decide who has paid retribution for murder? I was horrified by the ending and disgusted with all the women characters. Roberts in trying to make them strong failed miserably, by making them above the law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay","review":"This book was mostly good with just a little bad. The good first: It was nice to finally have an Italian family at the forefront of the story instead of the never ending Irish ones. It was fun learning about wine making and the vinyard. I enjoyed Tereza and Piliar completely. After the break up of Pilar's marriage it was fun watching her fall in love with someone who deserved her. I enjoyed Tereza's toughness and no-nonesence. I liked Tyler a lot and the family dynamtics. The murder mystery was very good. On the bad side I didn't care for Sophia at all. She was far too annoying for me to care about her. About half way through the book I began skipping all of her parts. The charactor Rene was unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"a vintage Nora...","review":"THE VILLA is a work of art, as is the subject of the book, winemaking.

There were too many stories going on so the characters weren't developed as they should have been. There was no chemistry between Tyler and Sophia as they were either boring (Tyler) or self-centered (Sophia) and unlikable. The story was mostly about Sophia and her mother and grandmother and it seemed as if the men were thrown in as an afterthought. If you feel you have to read it because it Nora's newest, save your money and check it out at the library. It's not even worth the price of a paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This was the first book I read by Nora Roberts, and it will probably be my last. It's hard to believe that the villains were as bad as she made them out to be. There is good and evil in all of us, but these folks were 100% evil. If that were true in real life, they would have been bumped off long ago. (I'm especially referring to the female villains.) The characters were exaggerated, and the ending was predictable. Give me Mary Higgins Clark any time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great source for escapist reading","review":"Nora Roberts is weaves wonderful tales and while The Villa may not be her best, I wouldn't say it was her worst either. While there were a couple of instances where something surprised me, overall after reading multiple novels by her, that she seemed to have fallen into a bit of a rut with her characters. When I read Tyler, I could easily see some of her others heros, such as the lead from Carolina Moon, in the lines. While that's not necessarily a bad thing for me as I liked both characters, I would love to see some of the earlier variety she displayed. I don't mean to say that Tyler is a carbon copy of the earlier character, but they seemed to have quite a bit in common. Roberts is capable of wonderful stories, and while I firmly believe this book bears a place on the shelf of any Roberts fan, it has room for improvement. Nevertheless, it serves the purpose of most romance novels, great escapist reading :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One....","review":"As a long-time Roberts fan, I snagged this tantalizingly thick paperback right away....and was so disappointed. Cliche characters, flat dialogue, and a beautiful setting (CA's wine country) completely wasted. Gave me the feeling that maybe this is one of her very early works that hadn't been published before. I just finished her \\"Seaswept\\" and enjoyed it so much more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora Roberts does it again!","review":"The Villa is a wonderful story of winemaking in the California Napa Valley and family bonds and conflict. Sophia Giambelli is the granddaughter of the Giambelli wine dynasty and the head of marketing for the company. Tyler MacMillan is the grandson of the MacMillan wine company and Ty is in charge of the vines, the grapes, the harvest. Ty and Sophia, who have grown up together in the wine business, are thrown together in a torrid attraction and competitive business rivalry. The women in Giambelli family are all strong, determined businesswomen and know how to handle themselves. Tereza Giambelli, the family matriarch, heads the Giambelli women and the winery. There are business rivals, murders and surprises in this book. Twists and turns villians and heroes. The Villa is a great mystery and romance all at the same time. Anyone who likes Nora Roberts will love this book, she doesn't disappoint us."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't win them all, Nora!","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a huge Nora fan. I believe I've read just about everyone of her books and have loved them. Unfortunately, not this time. The Villa's main charecters left me cold. Sophie and Ty were just a little too self-absorbed for my taste. David and Pilar were much more interesting. Too bad there wasn't more of them. There were too many characters. The ending was awful. Nothing like lying your whole life and taking the law into your own hands and getting away with it! Puh-leese! Better luck next time, Nora!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not up to her usual standard....","review":"I've always enjoyed her books, and look forward to new ones, but this one is a disappointment. It's crammed with characters and plots that don't meld into a gripping story, or hold onto the reader's interest. The central characters were not particularly sympathetic, and I didn't really care how the book ended. I gave this book away without finishing it - a first, for me, with a Nora Roberts book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk.

But if it goes south, as mine did today (shut off intermittently, failed self-test by shutting down because the battery was on its last legs), here's what you can look forward to:Tripp-Lite's support line isn't toll-free. Their support staff, however, was friendly and courteous. Unfortunately, I was informed that a unit in warranty must be returned to them for service; no local service can be obtained. You are required to pay transportation costs both ways. Given that the unit is rather heavy, this alone could be quite expensive. Unfortunately for me, my unit was out of warranty, and so the offer I received was a replacement for $191.00, along with the aforementioned transport costs. Prohibitive, to say the least.I opted instead to purchase an APC BR1500LCD locally, for which I've read great reviews here.

Both units failed within 3-4 months during moderate use in a home theater/ audio setup. The company (Tripp Lite) was very un-cooperative in making an adjustment - I argued both units were defective. They disagreed. One issue with the Tripp Lite units is they are shipped with the batteries already hooked up - like everything else they are made in China and most sit on the shelf for a long time before being sold. When they go into service the batteries are already depleted and beyond recharge.Ultimately I threw both Tripp Lite units in the trash and replaced them with APC 1300 VA UPS systems - which actually perform better and were less money to start with - if only I would have known. Too bad I wasted over $500 on Tripp-Lite products. Avoid this company and its bad products !!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Piece of Junk","review":"We bought 3 of these for two different locations. 100% of them have failed with the same problem. If the power goes out even for a few seconds the unit shuts down completely taking the servers along with it. The problem is that it appears to be doing it's job but when it really matters you find out otherwise. Tripp Lite has been good to replace them but it can't restore my faith in their power protection products. Also of note the batteries in the Tripp Lite units are half the size of those in APC products with the same rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine Quit, Too","review":"My TrippLite quit without warning and lost my work.

Shopping for another brand. Good riddance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently \\"U\\" does not mean \\"Uninterruptible\\"","review":"Once the batteries get old, or run low, this \\"UPS\\" will drop power to the connected equipment without warning. Apparently it tests the batteries by switching the actual load over to the batteries, instead of running an internal test and alerting you when the batteries are low. I contacted Tripp Lite support about this issue, and they claimed that this is standard behavior. Obviously someone at Tripp Lite has failed to grasp the basic concept of an \\"uninterruptible\\" power supply.

Its just survival horror meant something alittle different back in the day. Back when the games really drove into that primal fear of being afraid of what we can't always see. Also the games balance of horror and problem solving is among some of the best in the gaming world, past or present.

I didn't feel compulsion to go any further.Trying to come up with some good points, the following two finally presented themselves. In the middle of the book is to be found a picture of Niven flanked by two of his sons, the elder of whom is a most presentable, semi-nude young man, whose appealing aspect roused my spirit a bit from the apathetic lethargy it had succumb to in the course of reading the first few chapters. Also, the index looks quite comprehensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly uplifting!","review":"I just want to quickly add to all these other five-star reviews that this is one of the most inspirational books I have ever read.

I've used them twice now and I am very pleased with their effectiveness. They're a reasonable weight and fit nice and snuggly. I have a longstanding tinnitus, so I'm rather concerned about the performance of this particular piece of equipment. I'm happy to say that a couple hours of shooting at the pistol range is quite tolerable. The only thing that has bothered me is that my ears have become somewhat sore from the pressure of the earmuffs after a couple of hours.

I originally bought them because I wanted to wear them on the subway over my ear buds, so that way I wouldn't hear the subway noise and wouldn't need to turn my music volume up as loud. Nope. Not only did I look absolutely rediculous wearing these, I could still hear a lot of things on the subway. Yes everything was much duller to hear, but the fact that for the size, they couldn't block out even conversations being had near me makes this not worth the money. Now they're hanging up in storage. However I'm sure they'll work just fine for a more practical use, such as protecting your ears on a construction site."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price","review":"I was surprised how well they worked at the range.

FAIL!","review":"Honestly, I don't know jack about hearing protectors, so I'm not going to say whether this is a good product or not, HOWEVER, what I do know is that they did a horrible job of insuring it arrived safely. This product was shipped to me in the original flimsy box and nothing else. The box was not placed inside a sturdy shipping box, nor was there any bubble wrap, packing peanuts, styrofoam, or any other protective packaging to minimalize the possiblity of recieving a broken product. The box I received was torn and in terrible shape. I sent it right back to them just the way it was sent to me. The postman looked at me funny.. Like I care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable and not that great at sound reduction","review":"The huge number of positive reviews of this product convinced me to buy these, but I returned them because they're extremely uncomfortable and they don't block sound very well. They are heavy and the band presses the top of your head so hard that my head hurt in that spot for hours after I had them on and I was only just trying them on for a couple of minutes. I adjusted them but to no improvement.For all this discomfort they don't even block much sound. I turned the TV volume up and then put them on and I could still hear the TV sound pretty clearly (and I have an older TV, not a fancy new surround sound system).

At any rate what I ordered is not whatI recieved. The item I ordered listed earmuffs which were alsoheadphones with a radio and the ability to connect an externalsource to the headphones.

It adjust to the size of my head, which goes something like 24\\"+ around. I have tried to use ones with plastic couplings before, and I have a tendency to break them. First, if you leave them out over time, UV degrades them, and then they crack when I put them on my giant head.

I am particularly sensitive to keyboard noise at work and dogs barking. The Peltor doesn't block out all noise - I didn't expect it to - but when I also put those little purple foam things in my ear, it blocks out almost all noise [and I only do this sitting at home or at work :)]. If I use earbuds playing music under the Peltors, I'm not disturbed by any noise. I have smallish ears and this model is fairly comfortable. Of course, I look a bit dorky at work, but lowering my stress is more important."},{"rating":"2","title":"noise caneling earmuffs","review":"they work great.

Noise reducing quality, excellent. Very comfortable. I made a small project out of them as i wanted to embed headphones. They would not easily pull apart. The thin cord of the headphones does not irritate me to have the cord running out of the open ends. A couple toothpicks held the headphones in place. If I got bored i might drill a hole in the red part and have the cord run that way, but works well as is.

Holding up very well, considering using them for hours, 5 days a week for 2 years. Scratches (which can and will happen) are not noticable and the ear padding is still firm. The metal bands still look new. The first part to have any noticable wear is the vinyl padding between the metal bands. Highly recommended for quality and price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely great item for the price","review":"This was the first set of ear protection that I have bought other than the foamy earbuds. And let me tell you when you use foam earbuds and these peltor earmuffs, WOW! can't hardly hear anything!Great for running anything from a table saw, router, planer, to a hammerdrill. If i was doing something like jackhammering all day i would probably want something more, but for the price its a small price to pay for my hearing. I wish I would have had this years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved!","review":"I bought the Peltor Hearing Protector in desperation. The woman in the apartment upstairs is a terror. I don't think she means to be, but nevertheless she is. The noise! I call her Elephant Girl. Mostly because she and her friends - often at 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. - sound like a herd of elephants in combat boots about to bring down my ceiling. Do you know that late 50's film with Elizabeth Taylor, \\"Elephant Walk\\"? Think climactic scene and you have a good idea of what Elephant Girl is like. [I pass over the fact that her voice is so loud on the phone that I can hear her conversations. Advice to the lovelorn at 11:00 p.m.? Wonderful.] So - being on the verge of suicide or madness, I turned to Peltor. They work! Admittedly, they are a bit bulky to sleep in; but I'm learning - with some creative use of pillows. But they work and I'm saved. And if you just want to work or walk in them? No problem - very comfy. I'd give them 20 stars if I could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peltor H10A Professional Noise Canceling Earmuff","review":"The product is much better than expected.

It drops the garden tractor noise down to a very quiet hum in the background. If you concentrate you can hear your own pulse.Very comfortable. I wore it for two hours with no discomfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work great, but they're HUGE","review":"If you're going to be doing work with loud equipment, these are great. They block out a lot of sound. But, they are much bigger on your head than they look in the picture, so you do look a little silly wearing them.At first, they were too tight on my head, but I put them on a cardboard box for a few days to strech them out, and now I can wear them for hours without discomfort. I'm usually quite senstive to having my head squished by headphones, so I'm glad that they stretched out eventually.They can also be combined with earbuds for very isolated music listening. I do that when using loud equipment. Just don't turn the music up too load, or you won't here anything outside at all, which could be unsafe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peltor Professional Noise Canceling Earmuff #H10A","review":"Blocks the sound good and is comforatable with earbuds underneath it.

They do an excellent job of noise reduction and hearing protection in my woodshop.

Not true. Even when you follow the instructions (i.e., avoid glasses, hair, and anything intrusive under the padding), they still let in noise. These are probably appropriate for machinery and sounds in a certain decibel range, but not for reducing office or noisy neighbor noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Small","review":"These work to block out sound, but they're incredible uncomfortable to wear. I suppose for a small man, a woman, or a child, they may work, but a normal adult male, say anything around 6 feet or bigger, I'd stay away. They barely clear the crown of my head, and end up crushing my normal sized ears. Making them uncomfortable to wear for long periods, which kinda defeats the point.The ear pieces need to be about half an inch bigger, and the top strap needs to be adjustible.

The pair coast me $24.95 and were labelled \\"professional\\" grade.The pair I bought there barely covered up the noise. Sure they helped, but they were much better than putting ear plugs in my ears. So, I returned the muffs to the store.After seeing the reviews on here, I decided to give these Peltor's a try. What a difference! These nearly completely eliminate the noise.

Noise cancelling implies active circuitry to detect specific frequencies and emit an inverse signal to counteract them.

Although These earmuffs are not completely comfortable because it is a bit tight for my head, They cancels out quite a lot of noise.

Hoped that product would create vacuum seal about the ears. Sound is reduced, but disappointed that I can still hear low freq vibration/sounds; in fact while wearing the product, low-freq sound vibrations seem to be clarified/intensified. Don't doubt product claims to protect ears from LOUD volume sounds, but that was not my main goal.

However I found this earmuff not an idea product for this purpose. I guess it works to filter out most of the high frequency noises (background noises from cars, machines and other things) but didn't do well in the range of human talking--it only decreases the volumn. Effectively this is making the human voice even more obvious since now the background sound is lowered. It may still be good if you want to filter out machine noise in working conditions, which I didn't test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hear no Evil","review":"I really like these 3M Hearing Protectors.

I can clearly hear everything people are saying to me in low/normal voices with only a slight muffle - almost could hold my hand over my ears for the same effect.

With the ear plugs and these on my Mosin rifles sound almost like mouse squeaks. Well maybe not mouse squeaks but surprisingly quiet.

The fit is firm and very good. The adjustment is a bit limited but they fit my big head fine. As I write this I am sitting in front of a television watching some political talking heads.

I am sitting here in blissful silence.Whether your noise reduction need is guns or TV, these will do a great job for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Target Shooting","review":"I bought these for target shooting. They are the highest earmuff protection in the price range I looked at. I usually double it with ear plugs since indoor target shooting can be loud.

Otherwise, really happy about the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"ahhh.... i can finally relax","review":"i just received the ear muffs today, and i can't stop wearing them. i live in an apartment that is about 100ft from the freeway. the traffic has been making me more and more aggravated. and i'm afraid it was damaging my hearing! whenever i visited my parents at their home, my ears would ring because it was so quiet!so i finally took the initiative and purchased these ear muffs. and i have never been happier. i can't hear the traffic AT ALL. i have noticed a drop in my stress level already. i can concentrate a lot better on reading and studying.i would suggest these to anyone that has a constant, annoying noise at their place of residence. you will not be disappointed if you purchase these ear muffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Protection, but a bit bulky","review":"Pros: The noise cancellation is excellent. Yesterday I shot .45, .40, .357 magnum and my 12 gauge shotgun, and the noise was dramatically reduced. Additionally, I had little difficulty engaging in conversations with my shooting partner/s. Since ear/sound protection was/is my number one goal, these earmuff's are awesome.Cons: While the Peltor H10A is constructed very well, I did find them to be a bit bulky when shooting my shotgun (and presumably, a rifle). This, however, may be the case with any earmuff, since I normally shoot with ear plugs. Therefore, the \\"bulkiness\\" of the earmuff when shooting shotgun/rifle may not be exclusive to this particular model (or brand) , but it may in fact be the case with all earmuffs.Despite the Peltor H10A's being a bit cumbersome in the aforementioned situation, I would unequivocally purchase these earmuffs again, and would recommend them to others.Best regards, and happy (and safe!) shooting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearing Protection","review":"Peltor Professional Noise Canceling Earmuff #H10AI have lost much of my hearing over the years and do not want to lose any more, so I have tried ear plugs and other earmuffs, but this Peltor is more comfortable and effective, and the price is right.

Bates' character is addicted to puzzles of all kinds, and his search for the author of his favorite crosswords leads to an investigation of a high-level corporate conspiracy. The result is a quirky part thriller, part travelogue, part middle-aged love story, which is utterly British, literate, comic and engaging.As Bates and Cusack travel the length of Britain from Wales to the Orkneys, they interact with characters from all strata of society, reveal their own roots and banter with each other about their encounters and their growing affection for one another. As soon as you relax into the pace of the travelers, the subtlety and brilliance of the acting comes into sharp focus. This is a warm and likable series that bears many viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Alan Bates and Sinead Cusack fans","review":"This movie is only for Bates and Cusak fans.The story is only a pretext to showcase the actors.

Every year or so since, my wife and I watched it with great enjoyment. Needless to say, that tired old tape was showing its age. Finally, when whatever issues preventing official distribution were resolved (I seem to recall the author was not happy with the adaptation, but it might have been other things that prevented release) I jumped at the chance to order the DVD. Wow!! Better than ever, both in quality, of course, but it turns out a few scenes left out of the television version are here!Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you loved Oliver's Travels. . .","review":"The 5-star reviewers here have pretty much covered the territory--but I'd like to alert you who loved Oliver's Travels NOT to miss the Beiderbecke Trilogy (The Beiderbecke Connection, The Beiderbecke Affair, The Beiderbecke Tapes). Lighthearted mystery, appealing protagonists, lovely country, the same loving themes of jazz, just a very familiar feeling throughout--I was sure it was the product of the same writer, and indeed, it was written by Alan Plater. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss this DVD!!","review":"I can't help but add my comments to those already submitted. I love this DVD. It took me forever to finally take the wrapping off this unexpected present and watch it one rainy morning. It took 1/2 an episode and I was amazed I'd never heard of it. The script is witty and entertaining. The acting is fine & the quirkiness of Alan Bates' character grows on you to where I, too, look for his other films. I love a good mystery, but more than that, this is a very heart-warming journey of quest and family and relationships. The scenery is wonderful & and music is a wonderful mix of classical and jazz.(For those of you who wonder about Alan Bates' quirky character in this series, it's very like the character played by David McCallum in NCIS. Subtle sense of humor, mature, and quite endearing.)I would like to one day find the joke about the horse that sits on eggs..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oliver's travels","review":"This movie is what used to be called ,'A romp'.

Very Very good fun indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I had read many positive reviews for this book so I took a chance. Boy was I sorry I spent the $25. I did not think the main character was believable in his role as security guard turned super hero. And all the instances of sex made me think this was written by a 14 year old. I thought the pace was wooden and plodded along. As a reader I simply did not care for the outcome of each character. The dialogue at times was trite and trivial. Finally, the cover of the book is one of the worst I have seen for this genre. It does not seem to fit the right time period. What am I missing? I have seen beeter POD covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight reading. Not worth $25. Honest.","review":"I too got sucked in by all the positive hype. Obviously, the author has a lot of friends and family in the business not above shilling. This book is just plain bad. Security guard Harvey lacks any drawing power. You heard of larger than life well this book is just the opposite. The attempt at humor is misplaced and often just not funny. The amount of sex is troubling. Save your $25."},{"rating":"1","title":"The problem with this book...","review":"This is a very slow starting book with little happening and quite frankly I was bored at the beginning but I read on. Also it is a very thin read. I would have like to seen more desription of many areas. Harvey Mapes is a throwaway character--here today gone tomorrow. Goldberg enjoys a good reputation, this simply wasnt his best work. I agree with the other reviewers, twenty five dollars for this book was a tough pill to swallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun And Entertaining","review":"This book has suspense, intrigue and more twists than Lombard Street in San Francisco. Harvey Mapes is a security guard at a wealthy apartment complex,low man on a low totem pole. His only excitement is watching Cop shows and reading detective novels.

In almost Wizard Of Oz fashion, a tennant decides to have Harvey trail his wife to which he finds out that their is an added dimension to the trade--pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book!","review":"I started reading this one yesterday afternoon and was instantly wrapped up in the story. There were things I had planned on doing last night, but they all got pushed aside so I could keep reading this book.It's rare that I read an entire book in just one day but that's what I did with this one. The story was so good that it was very hard for me to put the book down.Author Lee Goldberg has a lot of talent. Not only did he craft a fantastic story here, but he also gives us very appealing characters. Harvey Mapes (The Man With The Iron-On Badge) is one of the most original and likeable characters I've come across in a long time.Goldberg is a very busy writer. I recently read that he's already contracted to do more books in his DIAGNOSIS MURDER and MONK book series.Still, I hope he someday finds time to give us more stories about private eye Harvey Mapes. Harvey is too great of a character to appear in only one story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces were missing.","review":"My grandson was very disappointed to have a toy that didn't have all of the pieces.

It was a life saver for me when I was nursing my son. I probably would have given up breast feeding if it wasn't for this cream. It is so soothing and moisturizing. The best part about it is that it is edible and all natural so you don't have to worry about your little one ingesting it. I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing this product because of the cost/small size but a little goes a long way. You only need to use a small amount at a time, one jar was all I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best for cracked nipples and a newborn's chapped lips!","review":"Used the lantosh (however it's spelled) because the hospital gave me a sample. Got home and found my motherlove...worked so much better! When my newborn's lips were chapping in the first weeks I used both nipple ointments as lipbalm and again motherlove was the winner.

This is the one and only thing from my baby registry that I could not have survived without!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STUFF!!","review":"I would definently recomend this to all nursing mothers! It goes on smoothly (unlike lansinoh) and doesnt hurt to apply. My first container lasted me about 6-7 weeks applying it about every other time I nursed.

I now believe that I have thrush and am ordering there cream for that and using it as a nipple cream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: Unable to use this product","review":"I'm very disappointed. I saw all the excellent reviews about this product and I was hoping for the best.I placed it on my nipple and the consistency was great, it was easy to apply and not as messy as the lanolin I have been using. A few seconds later my nipples started to feel very sore and kind of burn. I went to remove my cloth nipple pad and my nipple was stuck to it. I washed off the cream and instantly felt better. I suppose I had a bad reaction to something in this cream. My nipple may have stuck because I hadn't put enough of the cream on it, but the fact is it did make my nipple burn.I actually hate it and want to give it only one star but because the consistency is nice and it is less messy than the lanolin I will give it 2 stars.I just want other people to know this cream doesn't work for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not BF without it!","review":"This product SAVED my nipples .. within a day, they were healed.

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Use lanolin instead","review":"This product didn't do much for me.

It works."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"This is such a great product. I just had my first baby and was very nervous about breast feeding, hearing all the stories about sore nipples and pain. I used this cream from day one and never got sore or cracked nipples.

I highly reccomend it to all new moms."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIfe Saver!","review":"I am nursing while pregnant - which for anyone who has ever done this it is uncomfortable . My nipples were so sore and swollen that I was about to give up on nursing all together. I started using this product and my lactation consultant told me to put it on before and after each nursing session to alleviate the soreness and swelling. It worked within a day. There are some reviews that say it dries out the nipples or that it just rubs off and to prevent this you need to 1)apply the balm before and after nursing or pumping 2)reapply often in between nursing sessions and 3)then give it a few days. I highly recommend this product as I've tried everything else out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't help...","review":"i think in this case (sore nipples from breastfeeding) the only thing that helped me was to put a few drops breast milk on them every time before and after feeding."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for sore/cracked nipples","review":"sore/cracked nipples are very common on breastfeeding moms especially first time moms who doesn't have any clue about latching.1 oz might seems very less but it is good enough. Latching will get way better after the first 3-4 weeks and you might not need to use it afterwards. So there is no need to get a 5oz bottle. Motherlove Herbal Nipple Cream helped me a lot with soreness. Also note that this cream is better used for prevention than cure. So apply it before feeding itself. Also remember to air dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Mistake","review":"I bought this because I wanted a vegan alternative to lanolin for breastfeeding upon the arrival of my baby. After I had the baby I applied this diligently after each feeding and wound up with dry cracked nipples that were very painful and bleeding within 3 short days. I had to supplement with formula because it was too painful to continue until I bought something else for my sensitive nipples and started healing by using the breastpump. I was nearly in tears. I switched to lanolin and my nipples are still sensitive but it keeps them supple through to the next feeding, unlike Motherlove."},{"rating":"2","title":"heals soreness more quickly","review":"I bought this nipple cream based on my friend's recommendation. I don't find Lasinoh too thick given I gave birth to my baby during a summer month but I can certainly see how it could be thick and hence painful to apply during colder months/climate. i am using both motherlove and lasinoh at the same time. I find motherlove cream heals sore nipples quicker given its ingredients but doesn't offer much protection for them during showers, which can hurt tremendously (I favor hotter showers) - Lasinoh offers a thicker coating and is hence more protective. i do favor motherlove cream more and find myself reaching for it but i still apply lasinoh before my showers."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better than Lanolin!","review":"I have two kids, and used Lanolin (Lanisoh, Medela, etc) with Kid #1. Used Motherlove with Kid #2, and man, this stuff is like butter. I love it. Lanolin is completely sticky and messy, and doesn't glide on so nicely. Lanolin has the consistency of honey, and it feels like you're ripping your skin off when applying it. Enter heaven: Motherlove. It's like a smooth butter. Completely soothes and heals any irritated skin. Love it, Love it, Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps with Pumping","review":"I originally bought this product because I anticipated have cracked and bleeding nipples from initially starting breastfeeding, from what others had told me. I did use this product for the first week or two of breastfeeding, and never developed any bleeding. I did have some blisters that went away with this product. I like this better than Lansinoh because it's not as sticky as lansinoh and absorbs quickly. I can breastfeed immediately after applying if baby wants to that soon.HOWEVER, I was left with lots of product leftover because I didn't use it for my original purpose. Since then, I have been using it prior to pumping. IMO, pumping is the most difficult part of breastfeeding and this makes it bearable. I also intend to use it on the baby's diaper rash, but haven't tried that yet. I would buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for pumping","review":"I use this right before I pump and it greatly reduces any chaffing and makes pumping more comfortable. I Ike that it's all natural and won't contaminate my milk with synthetic ingredients. I am an exclusive pumper, I don't think I would have gone this long pumping without this product. I will definitely order again before I run out. I also like that it's really easy to put on and not sticky like some of the lanolin products."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this!","review":"I was surprised when I received this to find that it was in such a small container. (I suppose I could have read the amount when purchasing, sheesh.) To my delight, this stuff goes a LONG way! You only need to use a tiny bit at a time. Also, importantly, it works WONDERS. I had a painful, cracked nipple less than a week after my son was born and this stuff healed it up in a matter of a few days even though I continued to nurse him with the cracked nipple. I just tried to remember to apply it after each nursing session and it worked like a charm. Also, it's safe for baby to ingest... but, just as important, the baby didn't seem to have any problem with the taste of it or anything like that. Highly recommended! I've used it many, many times during the past two weeks and it's probably at most only 1/6th gone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for first-time moms, worth the money!!","review":"I had never breast fed before and was nervous about what seemed to be the inevitable pain and cracked, bloody nipples. I don't know if I was lucky, if my son was just a natural nurser, or if it was this salve, but I applied it when I started to get sore and it would stop the pain before the next feeding! My baby was picky about taste (he went on a nursing strike after I started taking fish oil supplements), but he never minded this stuff. I was also prone to plugged ducts and this was gentle enough that it didn't exacerbate them. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"This cream works! It is very soothing, goes on easily (which is nice with such a tender area), doesn't smell funky, and started healing right away. I was using the Lansinoh nipple cream and it was horrible! Motherlove doesn't block your scent. My baby wouldn't nurse using other creams because it overpowered my scent and I had to wash it off every time I tried to nurse. With Motherlove she doesn't mind the cream and will nurse even if there is still some on there. This is a must have and I won't use anything else. I'm hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver!","review":"For the first few weeks of breastfeeding I was just using Lanolin. It worked okay, but I was in serious pain. On top of just being a new mom, I was having breastfeeding complications that were threatening to make me quit. As a last ditch effort to help I tried Motherlove. The relief was almost immediate. After just two or three applications I was no longer in excruciating pain. I am now happily exclusively breastfeeding my 2 month old and use Motherlove on occasion when I'm feeling chapped. It always works wonders and baby has never noticed anything at all. It's a great feeling to be happily breastfeeding and using a product which I can trust to be safe for my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe for Baby and Mom","review":"Great product for mom and baby - safe enough to eat, though I haven't tried.

The ingredients are simple and all natural."},{"rating":"1","title":"May work great but be aware...","review":"I bought this based on all the great reviews and bc I had problems with severe soreness and trauma with my first child. However when I showed it to my lactation consultant, she said it had everything in it that they don't recommend, and that it has ingredients that can cause allergies. She said to feel free to use it on cuticles and rough feet but not breasts. I just wasn't willing to take the risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"On a pricey side but worth it:)","review":"I LOVE this cream. I recommend using it before baby arrives and after!

I applied it generously before and after breastfeeding and although it did not take away the pain, it did help heal my nipples between feedings."},{"rating":"2","title":"helps the first-time BF mom -- but be careful, it melts!","review":"I ordered a pot of Motherlove before I gave birth to my son. I packed it in my hospital bag and used it the first two days after I delivered. It worked really well in soothing the pain from breastfeeding. It goes on smoothly and leaves a little oily residue, but doesn't feel overly greasy. The day I went home from the hospital, it was a little hot, and I left the hospital bag in the car for an hour or so. When I brought the bag inside, the cream had liquefied and leaked out of the jar, getting all over the toiletries. A great product -- just make sure to keep it at room temperature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't have done it without this amazing stuff!!","review":"The first 10 weeks of nursing were so miserable!! I almost quit several times. I cried almost every time I nursed my son. I was using the lanolin but it wasn't helping and was so thick it actually hurt to put it on. A lactation specialist who was helping me recommended Mother Love to me and it was almost an immediate improvement. Since I started using this cream nursing has stopped hurting and my son is now 9 months old and is still nursing. I wish I had had this from day 1! So glad i found it as nursing and providing my son with breast milk was really important to me. I would have regretted it if I had given up. This is a must have for any new mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"Works great; I love that it's all natural and the diaper rash version is safe for cloth diapering. Soothes me when I'm chapped and beat up-which, with a baby who has never latched well, has been unfortunately often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for pumping","review":"I couldn't have pumped without this cream. All the other creams and lotions that you buy are sticky, not what you need for pumping. This cream is slick, take all of the torture out of pumping. Also the ingredients are fine for breast milk so you don't have to get worried about some getting in the milk or about nursing after you have used it. This is one of the items that I always buy all my friends who are having babies. Every mother should know about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven Sent!","review":"After only 8 days of being a mother I can honestly say this is one of the best pre-baby purchases I made for myself. Within 24 hours of use on a very chapped almost scabbed nipple it was as right as rain! I am SO glad I made this purchase and recommend it 100%."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously, the BEST","review":"I can't say enough positive things about this nipple cream. It is by far and away the best, and believe me, I've tried almost everyone out there, including the Lansinoh cream. I used it multiple times per day as I pumped 10x/day for my premature babies, and again as I was learning to breastfeed. It made my sore nipples feel better instantly on contact, and kept them moisturized and pain free (relatively!). Most importantly, it was safe for my babies to ingest, which was a real concern for me, as the last thing you want to have to do is wipe something off your nipples right after putting it on! A single jar lasted me several months, and now I give it to every new mom for a baby shower gift! Seriously, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for maintenance","review":"This nipple cream is really nice because it goes on smoothly and much easier than lanolin (lansinoh is other product i have used), which is a must for sore nipples. The size doesn't bother me for two reasons: 1) I doubt I will ever make my way through this little tub-it isn't like nipples are that big, and 2) I pay for department store make up, so this isn't a shocker. If you buy Walgreens cheaper brands, you will probably be shocked at how much this costs for the amount you get. Anyway...I like it, however, for really cracked nipples that came with the first week or so, this didn't do as well as pure lanolin--maybe it just rubbed off on nursing pads or on my bra. My recommendation is use the lansinoh at first then switch to this. It's really nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver for breastfeeding mom","review":"This product has saved me. I have dry skin and developed chapped nipples 8 weeks into breastfeeding. Unfortunately I didn't moisturize quickly enough, the skin cracked and voila - mastitis. My baby didn't like the taste of lanolin, so the Motherlove cream has been a godsend. Moist skin and a happy, nursing baby! I highly recommend this in a new mother's kit - good to have on hand when your skin gets dry. The organic olive oil etc are completely edible."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Amazing* product that brings instant relief!","review":"I'm a mom of 4. I've been through the cracked/scabbed nipple thing with my daughters too. My sons, for some bizarre (Freudian?) reason have been marathon nursers without problems. Minor problems, but nothing like looking at the raspberry that used to be your nipple (even with proper latch and positioning and all that) and wondering WTH went wrong? LOL... I recommend Nipple Cream by MotherLove.com. It's cheapest through LuckyVitamin.com. That, plus the Ameda Comfort Gel pads... and your nipples will *adore* you. That's what I've been using with my newborn (2nd) son. I alternate between the Comfort Gel pads and the Nipple Cream. I love Lansinoh as well, but I find the Nipple Cream *much* easier to apply to abused nipples.One application of the Nipple Cream will have you seeing instant results with instant relief. I was introduced to it at the hospital, and couldn't believe how much the Nipple Cream helped the pain.

While it doesn't hurt when you put it on and it does spread easier than lanolin, it allows my nipples to dry out and essentially rubs off on my nursing pads. When I go to pump / nurse again, my nipples are dry and cracked, so I have had to revert back to lanolin as it seems to be the only product out there that doesn't do more harm than good."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO much better than Lansinoh!","review":"I never write reviews so you know I must LOVE this product to actually take the time to write one! motherlove nipple cream is a MUST for nursing mothers!!!!!

I thought it would just come in handy with sore cracked nipples but i have also discovered it helps the nipple shields so they stick and do not move around on me and make feeding that much easier. The nipple cream they gave me in the hospital didn't do that, nor did it feel as well as the Motherlove cream feels.

Only time it was taken off the tank was when we went camping last summer. I called the company to inform them, and was told the report would be passed to the production department. When asked if they would replace the item or conduct repairs, I was told since it didn't happen when I purchased it then they wouldn't assist me any further in the matter.

This is not a top end gun, but perfect for someone like me, who just needs to do tune-ups on my old firebird. So it won't get heavy use, if you are going to use a gun all the time, I suggest getting one with an advance dial on it.Plus always remember to mark the timing mark with white paint, or at least clean it and remove any rust on the timing markings.

I ordered it as a gift to my husband, as this candy is not available in our area. It was shipped in a regular old cardboard box, and I was home to receive the package. Thank goodness I was, because it was 90+ degrees outside, and the candy was already sufficiently melted. He can't even enjoy his favorite candies, as they are melted to the sides of the package. I was not happy to have spent nearly $20 on candy, only to have it arrive in an indigestible condition.With that being said, this candy is delicious in it's true, unmelted, form. It's one of our favorites. However, if we were to ever buy it again, we'll have to go out and search for it, since shipping is apparently a terrible idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Moisture!!","review":"This candy is my daughter's favorite.

A MUST SEE for all who love a great and unforgettable story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought is was ok...","review":"At first when I got the book I was expecting stories about the soldiers and Civil War more then a first time nurse. The book starts with two really boring first chapters that tell about her trip to the hospital, and then finally starts up with her time spent helping patients. Though it never tells in depth anything about the wounded. It is more about how Lousia May Alcott and other nurses handled the jobs given them. I was expecting something that would make you sympathize more with the soldiers then a nurse, and something that would bring you into the time and setting. I learned nearly nothing about what it was like for the soldiers from this book, I only learned I don't like Louisa May Alcotts writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted mystery/romance is very enjoyable.","review":"I love all of JAK's books and never miss one. I liked Lost & Found a lot - it had a great premise on which to develop a relationship and a good mystery (I didn't know until it was revealed), but not so much chemistry between the main characters until the end. The relationship didn't work as well as other relationships in previous books, partly because we didn't get as much insight from the main characters into their feelings about the other until the end. I wonder if JAK spends too much time fleshing out a large number of peripheral characters and their relationships with each other and not enough embroidering the main story. However, these characters were not so distracting that I didn't think the book was a great, lighthearted read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened Jayne?...","review":"I've been reading and loving Jayne's stories for years and years! This book has me stumped... The story line was great as far as the suspense and intricacies of the plot ... but, the characters' love stuff was terrible! The few times they made love, it was over in seconds every time! I can understand that happening once ... But, ALL the love scenes were kinda' \\"wham, bam, thank you Ma'am\\"! I was astounded! Why would anyone want to have that kind of sex life?!?!? I realize that some people do, but that's not why I've been reading Jayne's books for so many years. There was a lot missing in this book. I was sorry that I bought the Hard Cover ... My advice (if you have to read this book anyway...which I would do myself despite any reviews :) is to wait for the paperback or buy a cheaper used one! I love you Jayne, but please work on the love scenes more next time!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost and Found","review":"Fast pace. Good story. It's a good mystery but the romance end is definitely in the background. This book is essentially a mystery with a dash of romance. The hardcover copy is beautifully decorated on the inside. I loved the way the page numbers were set off the the side of the page with a little decoration on each side. It's a truly beautiful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable - back on track","review":"Like so many others, I am a big fan of JAK who has been disappoined by some of her books. I agree with the other reviewer who enjoyed Eclipse Bay as the characters, dialogue and plot reminded her (and me) of the earlier books that were so captivating. However, I disagree with your Top 500 Reviewer in her review of Lost & Found. I thought the character development was very strong and the plot was fun. I also like the way JAK brings in enough reality to the book (e.g., single father, complicated families) so that readers can identify. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am happy to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jayne does it again!","review":"I read Lost and Found last night! What an enjoyable book. The mystery was just clever enough that I didn't know who dunnit, until it was revealed!

Also, no stalkers (thanks Jayne). This is a real winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened!","review":"I have read all JAK books (also those under Amanda Quick and Jayne Castle). She is an excellent writer and by far my favourite. I waited in eager anticipation for Lost and Found to be released. But something was lacking in this book. I found myself bored and skipping pages. The element that is JAK simply was not there, I found her usual wit and the chemistry between the couple saddly lacking.I hope this was a one off and look forward to reading Slightly Shady in April. Hoping it meets her usual excellent standards that set her apart from other authors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read the reviews before buying...sigh...","review":"No excitement, no \\"get my blood pumping passion\\", minor character developed in the story (NOT!) is murderer...just all around disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large Disappointment","review":"I have read many of Jayne Ann Krent's book and this is the last one that I will purchase, especially a hardback!!There is no romance, zero sensuality,a poorly constructed \\"mystery\\", and no meaningful conversation between the couple. In the last few pages there is a marriage proposal that had no build up and the heroine is totally surprised that the hero is in love with her. Save your money and get this at the library. I would ask the author to return to the romance genre and stop trying to write a mystery novel. I miss the wonderful writing she did in her romance paperback releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wulfpak","review":"Every time Jayne Ann Krentz writes another book I become more disappointed with her performance. This latest \\"attempt\\" is boring - full of windy conversations that go nowhere. Good grief, get on with the relationship between the hero and the heroine. It just meanders endlessly until the end of the book. There is no chemistry! Ms. Krentz' earlier writings were witty and full of action. I keep hoping for a return to this style. Enough with trying to make a statement in what is basically a romance novel. I doubt I will buy another of her books which is a shame because I have all of her previous writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"JAK is ALWAYS good!","review":"I know her story lines seem repetitive, but even a middling effort from JAK beats most other books by authors who prove to be like a \\"flash in the pan.\\" And, I don't think this one was middling, but actually very enjoyable. She always does a great job with family dynamics (some of my fave JAK family stories include the Sweet Fortune and Family Man) and I liked how the hero had a nearly grown daughter. She is an honest-to-goodness pro and one of the very best out there. If you have never tried her books before, maybe first try one of the many paperback out there--but if you are like me and many others, after the first, you'll be hooked and will always buy her books the second they are published."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENJOYABLE BOOK","review":"This is the first book by this author I have read in a long time.

His points are unusual in that they break some of the long-held notions of \\"successful aging\\". What's more, he relies on solid data to back up his claims.

About an hour into the movie there is a palpable sense of menace. It delivers with some nice twists in the last 30 minutes. Lots of great Hawaiian scenes in between. Give it a try - if you can take movies with a bit of character development and the patience to wait through a story - you'll probably like it. I wish there were more thrillers like this out there. It's pacing is kind of a throwback to the 70's and 80's. It may not make sense but in a way it reminds me of Pacific Heights with Michael Keaton and Matthew Modine - although not that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"HONEYMOONERS & SERIAL KILLERS IN A TROPICAL PARADISE","review":"For years I've been an enthusiastic fan of both Mila Jovovich (FIFTH ELEMENT and RESIDENT EVIL) and Timothy Olyphant (HITMAN and the DEADWOOD series on HBO), but this film is a clunker. Before you spend any money buying it, I would suggest that you view a rental copy first. Better still, if you can watch it for free during a plane flight, so much the better. I seriously doubt you would ever want to watch it a second time.Basically, if you like cheesy serial-killer movies with lots of violence, then you'll love this. If you don't, you won't.People who are hidebound by logical consistency and do not appreciate plot holes might also want to find something else to spend their money on, because this film not only misleads viewers as to who the serial killers are--it outright deceives them with false information.Otherwise, within the narrow limits of the genre, the \\"acting\\" is adequate, the stunts are well performed, and the scenery is very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girly man","review":"I rented the flick due to one of the positive reviews (\\"Pleasantly Surprised\\"). I'll know better next time. Zahns character is the biggest whimp that frets like somebodys overbearing mother. No woman (especially a Milla type) would ever marry this guy, hes a total whuss. I couldn't take anymore and had to turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good or smart","review":"Is there anything worse than a script that not only *thinks* it's smart, but then actually brags about it to the audience through one of its characters?! Pathetic. I don't want to hear a character brag about a mediocre script.This movie revolves around a big twist, which really doesn't come as that big of a surprise. This film has very little rewatchability value. Once you've seen the twist, that's it. The rest of the film isn't very likable. The characters aren't very likable. The dialog is annoying. The screenplay has a \\"better than you\\" attitude that really tries to talk down to the audience. The camera work is dated to the year it was made.Michael Bay is a name I avoid due to his superficial films. Now, this writer/director is another name I will avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, horrible.","review":"I don't know what kind of crackhead gives this movie a good review, cuz it sucks.

Painfully obvious twists, given away so early in the film, that it boggles the mind. The acting is fair, although Tim Olyfant is a bit over the top. Wanted it to be so much better than it was.

I thought that the plot line in this move looked interesting enough. Sadly though, I couldn't find it to rent at Redbox, or even to buy at most Wal-Marts. So I was really let down. I thought to look it up here and low and behold found a version to rent for cheap, so I jumped on it. I was really surprised by how much I liked the movie. Now I will say, it's not an Oscar nominee, but I don't think anyone chosing to watch this film is expecting that anyway. I will say that some of the plot explaination is shakey at best, but the overall energy of the film, I think, makes up for it. It's a great movie to check out if you just want to sit back and be entertained for a bit! Hope the review is helpful, oh, and if I haven't mentioned it yet... Watch It!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected thrill ride!","review":"We watched the director's cut so I can't speak to the theatrical version or whether it was different. But on the directors cut we say Yay! We enjoyed this movie far more than expected by the ho-hum \\"honeymooners\\" trailer. Timothy Olyphant was excellent and we were cheering for him and his girlfriend by the end. This movie had subtlety and action and you really will enjoy the second half more than the first. The first half of the film was a lot of storyline building and character development and some things just don't make sense in hindsight, but it was a really good weekend flick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly Good Thriller","review":"I liked this movie a lot.

The director came up with some originalusage of split scenes, that embellish the movie and made it more interesting. Whenthe action started, Matrix action took over.

That may be sufficient to convince some people to buy this book, but may discourage others from buying this book.One thing to keep in mind while reading this book is the following: The faithful shall be rewarded. If you're uninitiated, this book can be very intimidating, and Martin goes through the first parts (considered to be review) a little bit hurriedly, all the way through the end of Chapter 3.But once you get into Chapter 4, you will be treated with an excellent coverage of why wavelets are so great, and the state-of-the-art of its research and application.

This is an excellent introduction to gravity suitable for middle school to high school students. Gamov in his day put out some superb books for the general reader (remember '123 Infinity'), and this is one of those general reader books. However, much of the book is now dated especially the part on relativity and unsolved issues. Nevertheless for basic gravitational concepts such as orbits etc it is still a gem.

Heath, who are officially in charge of the investigation, have no explanation. A man disappears after diving in a pond named after a dragon in the midst of a party. His body is nowhere to find. An eccentric woman believes that the man has been abducted by a Dragon, giving credence to an old superstion. It will be the task of the great sleuth Vance to unravel the mistery in a purely rational manner. This is the only whodunit by Van Dine whose culprit I could guess straightaway from the very beginning (but I won't mention here the name in order not to spoil the future reader's pleasure). It lacks to some extent the complexity of the plot that accounts for the beauty and the crux of Van Dine's most successful stories (The Canary Murder Case, The Scarab Murder Case). Readable but if you have already read Van Dine's best cases not the kind of book I would hotly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant reading for mystery lovers","review":"What a sleeper!

I purchased it for my school work and was unable to use it as source material. The book is layed out with a bunch of statements that Artistic directors should follow and then it lists how or why Artistic directors should follow them. It dosen't really cover much ground that is useful for a small time director or artist.

I found the seeming stream of consciousness pleasurable and refreshing - sometimes she loses you when jumping from character to character, but I didn't mind it - it was more or less poetic and dreamlike. However, I found that each and every tidbit of information made me sadder, and more bitter, and not even able to place myself into Ellen's frame of mind or situation. I would like to write more, but, I will say only that I really didn't like the story - it left me empty, bitter, and just \\"dark\\"\\". Don't forget - I DO like the style of writing. I am interested to read other books by the same author as long as I don't feel like jumping off a bridge, not that I would, at the end of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vinegar Hill-perfect name","review":"I thought this book was a very good read. While the characters were terribly fustrating due to their lack of expression and communication, I find that many of us live in similiar situations. While I hope we all do not have as \\"salty\\" experience as Mary-Margret, Ellen and James you can't dimiss what they were all hoping to achieve as dreams of how their lives should turnout and what the true reality of thier lives were. I like the name Vinegar Hill because it suggest this quiet little subruban town with incredibly sour undertones, yet we must not underestimate the importance of vinegar... could have been wine gone sour yet could still be very purposeful; but if you originally wanted a fine wine you will be greatly disappointed. The important thing to do is work with your vinegar. This excellent story is about people who expected wine yet made do with their vinegar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down","review":"I am a very busy person but I made time for this book. I read it cover to cover in 3 days. The story was very eye-opening about how quick people are to accept the ways of society just because \\"it's the way things are\\". The story made me what to jump through the pages and shake the main character and scream \\"hello--do what makes you happy! \\" I really felt for what the characters were going through and I kept on reading hoping they would somehow get a happy life. The only draw back to the book was that there isn't anything really uplifting going on. I myself am getting married in a few months and this book gave an interesting perspective on what unhappy married life can be like it made me pull back and make sure I was doing the right thing--and I am!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative stars for this one","review":"I'd give this about three negative stars if that was possible.

As with every Oprah Book Club book I've read, it is thoroughly depressing. Sometimes Oprah books work out alright: the characters start making smarter choices and their situation changes. But it doesn't appear this will be the case with this book. Having read dozens of reviews, I find that it will remain a depressing story about a woman whose husband moves them back into the home of his cruel and abusive parents. And it gets worse from there. Although the writing is excellent and I can \\"see the movie in my head\\" (literally see it happening), I prefer books that are at least eventually somewhat upbeat. Not fairy tale endings, no. And not without conflict, because there's plenty of conflict and heartache in real lives. But not through and through to the end. Already I'm thinking, \\"Is she EVER going to leave that whipped husband of hers and get her young children away from that jerk father-in-law?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw it in the garbage after I finished it!","review":"I hated every character in this novel. It was written well enough that I actually finished it however, I was hopeful that the characters would have redeeming qualities by the conclusion; not so. If you are a reader who reads for enjoyment and escape, and finds joy in well written, uplifiting novels, do not read this as you will want to throw it in the garbage rather than share it with others. Depressing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OPRAH WHAT WERE YOU THINKING???!!!","review":"I will never read another Oprah-recommended book. After barely making it through \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" (another piece of garbage recommended by Oprah) I decided to give this book a chance. I didn't think it possible, but this was even worse than TPW. Possibly the most boring book ever written. I think I got to page 45 and then I threw it away. Do not waste your time. I don't know what else to say....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vinegar Hill - Sour taste","review":"I find it hard to believe that Oprah read this book before recommeding it to millions of people all over the world. Normally, I am a big fan of her selections (She's Come Undone, I Know this Much is True, Midwives, just to name a few) but this book was just plain awful. The story never went anywhere and I didn't care about any of the characters, especially Ellen. Ellen was in desperate need of a personality and a backbone. The in-laws were angry, frustrated and unhappy and the husband was cold, unfeeling and insensitive. I waited for over two hundred pages for something shocking or exciting to happen -- something that would redeem this book and justify the hours wasted, but it never came. I only gave this book one star because I wasn't sure if there was a NO Star option."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuk","review":"This novel is depressing. All the characters are basically without valuable qualities. Even Barb, who I suppose is the \\"saving grace\\" for Ellen, isn't smart enough to get out of this God-forsaken town. Sure, there's empathy for the children, but their point of view isn't central in the novel.Even those who think this book is validated by the last sentence are likely just too dreadfully bored and depressed to think about the story that was told. My best guess is that a \\"part II\\" novel would have Ellen and children moving back in with her husband, just like Ellen's abused neighbor on Vinegar Hill. Although I can't imagine how many more socially disfunctional and emotionally grotesque chapters could follow this novel, Vinegar Hill.How did this get on Oprah's Book Club?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Family cries","review":"The book was a page-turner, thought-provoking, but not entertaining. It has a dark, brooding sense of family, with no place to go. Each character has it's own destiny, but it didn't tie together. The secret sins may have unearthed emotions that were understood, but not necessarily dealt with. Also, no inner light was shed on Fritz, to circumvent his nasty behavior! The ending wrapped things up in a hurry, thank goodness, giving us some promise of hope. If the author's intent was to carry us into the reality of a dismal family life, it rallied!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It!","review":"This book is extremely depressing from beginning to end.

It is not one that I would pass on to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vinegar Hill is fitting title","review":"--as this is the sourest, most depressing bunch of people I've read about in a while.I assume we were supposed to feel for Ellen as she struggled against oppression, but I found her and the rest of this crew totally unredeemable and tiresome.Beyond the morbid turn of the story, there are too many side stories and subplots that leave you wondering, \\"Why?\\" or just, \\"Huh?\\"I bought this book about a week before it hit Oprah's list. If I'd known she was picking it, I probably wouldn't have bought it as I have found most of her picks to be celebrations of whining women or minorities. The only one of her picks I've really enjoyed was Ernest Gaines', _A Lesson Before Dying_."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEPRESSING AND WASTE OF TIME","review":"Do not waste your time with this one. The entire read is predictable and a downer. A narrow story with bleak circumstances and setting. Not full length novel material.

It takes place within a deeply conservative community, and examines with grace and care the roots, meaning and impact of such a world on its members. Though the outer conflicts (the \\"drama\\") in the story are muted, the depth of the inner struggles and fears are so carefully protrayed that it makes for a highly dramatic story. Six months after reading it, it still haunts my thoughts, expands my understanding, and populates my mind with strong images."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing story but I enjoyed it.","review":"I think at times I am a sucker for a sad story. I read this book a while ago and never got around to reviewing it but I felt it was time to.From the start of this book I was pulled into the story. Ellen I felt was a weak person who just took whatever came to her and just went with the flow. I felt that Mary-Margeret and her husband were tough on there children and sometimes didn't realize it.James on the other hand was just like Ellen weak in himself and couldn't stand up much to his parents.Overall this was a quick read and I enjoyed the book a lot but it isn't a book I could pick up again.

What a disappointment. What a bunch of losers. I know people like this exist, even today, but why would we want to read about them? A good book should provide us with some reason to read it. This has none, and I felt like I'd been duped. I feel pity for people who live like that, but also feel disgust at their weakness. I would not want Ellen for a friend. I would not trust her to do the right thing in a difficult situation. They are drowning in their own self-pity. Why glorify it by writing about it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter as vinegar...","review":"This book left me cold. The stuggle between feminist independence and old style religion was too cliche.

I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting for something to happen...","review":"When I first started this book, I enjoyed the way the author allowed us to feel Ellen's feelings and experience her life. But as I kept reading, it just got harder and harder to continue. I kept rooting for her to leave, to get her act together. I knew that it would take her a while to build up the courage due to the time period, but I was willing to keep reading provided she did leave in the end. I was also looking forward to her telling her husband she was leaving, to her telling off her in-laws, to her anger and frustration springing forth. Sadly, this never happened and that is why I am rating this book so low. This novel had a great conflict, excellent rising action, and even a climax of sorts, but lacked in denoument and resolution. I wanted closure, and received none. I feel like there needs to be a sequel where she moves on just to get the whole story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I can't imagine why this was an Oprah selection.

A poor book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sad and depressing!","review":"I recently saw A. Manette Ansay on the Oprah Show and was very impressed with her as a person. She captured my attention and her personality was engaging and delightful. Vinegar Hill, like many other of Oprah's recommendations, describes a woman's struggle and the way she deals with her life and inner-self. In Vinegar Hill, the heroine, Ellen, unfortunately doesn't really escape and make her situation better; instead the reader is left asking, \\"Why doesn't Elllen react? Do something? Go to her own family for help? \\" Rather depressing. The rest of Oprah's books, especially Where the Heart Is and The Book of Ruth also describe a woman and her battles, and in these the woman does triumph and find her seemingly lost spirit. Vinegar Hill is extremely well-written, I just wish the subject were different and characters more likeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"An annoying book with annoying characters..","review":"I really couldn't get into this book at all. I found each of the characters self centered, including the main character, Ellen. True she was trapped by circumstances beyond her control at first, but as the book progressed I found her decline into drug use to numb her pain while she allowed her children to continue to be exposed to the behavior of the rest of the family very irritating! There wasn't one character in the book who I could feel any emphathy with. Not my kind of book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to continue reading","review":"I found this book a little too difficult to pick back up, and start reading, maybe it was because I was distracted at the beach, but I wasn't that surprised by the ending, I think Ellen should have come to her senses alot sooner, and James needed to find his back bone!

The family moves in with the husband's parents. The plan is for them to stay for a short while until they can get back on their feet, but the stay becomes indefinite. Disfunctional is not the word for both the family and the husband's parents. The whole story is about the way each person handles problems incorrectly. The wife is the most stable one in the house and even she has her difficulties in handling situations.Although, in the end she finds herself and makes a future for her and her children. I did not injoy reading the book. Life has its peaks and valleys. This story never brings life out of the valley. I would have enjoyed the book more if there had been some happy times once in a while. Don't read this book if you are going through a rough time or if you battle with depression.

I suffered so much with Ellen that I found myself resenting my OWN husband, even though my life in no way resembles hers. I certainly hope we're going to get to find out what happens to Ellen and her children. Who cares what happens to that weak husband of hers and his disgusting father? I found the characters to be a little too caricatured for my taste, but I did enjoy this quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A strong start, but lacked closure","review":"After hearing many positive things about Vinegar Hill via Oprah and other reviews I decided to purchase the book. I completed the book yesterday and I can't help but feel a sense disappointment at being left without an adequate ending.I have not read any previous works by this author and I don't feel I'll read anymore. Vinegar Hill was very well written, the author has a wonderful 'story' telling ability, the language used was perfectly crafted and the character development was wonderful. Ms Ansay has a definite gift for writing but I was disappointed with the ending. I felt the author conjured a great visualisation of the characters but the ending seemed hasty and lacked closure.All in all a wonderful character portrayl, the author draws you in to really feel the characters pain, the story line is poignant but tragic, I feel Ms Ansay could have done more with the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter tale indeed","review":"Ansay gives us an anguished portrait of families trapped in a cycle of violence, stifled by religion and small-town culture. Ellen bucks the system by being a working mom, but when her husband loses his job must move in with her in-laws, and is exposed to their vitriol and dark secrets. This book is disturbing on a number of levels, and not for entertainment at all. I found the story extremely realistic but the ending all the more unsatisfying because although Ellen plans to escape, it leaves the guilty unpunished and the scars to her children unhealed. I'd rather have a happy ending,and I finished this book feeling sick. Two stars for gritty realism, but this isn't \\"light reading\\" or entertaining at all. Be warned"},{"rating":"2","title":"A promising debut novel","review":"A. Manette Ansay is one of my favorite authors. She struggles with two powerful forces in her personal life: an upbringing deeply rooted in Catholicism and a mysterious debilitating disease that saps her strength and endurance.In Vinegar Hill, Ansay's debut novel, Ellen Grier, too, is struggling against two forces: she's trapped in a difficult marriage that comes with some pretty sanctimonious in-laws and by, guess what? the demands of her Roman Catholic religion. Because of financial problems, Ellen, her husband, and their 2 children have returned to small-town Wisconsin to live with his stolid and alienated/alienating parents. Everyone is this little microcosm is suffering, a theme that Ansay has carried through all her subsequent books.This isn't Ansay's best book, but it was a good start to what followed. Don't miss her memoir, Limbo. When you read that, you'll recognize details from her life in her fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"From North Dakota","review":"I had to push myself to keep reading this book. It was very depressing and I kept waiting for something good to happen. The way that Ellen was treated by her husband and especially her inlaws was ruthless. Even at the end, I found it difficult to feel good about what happened because it took her so long to get to a decision making point. I like a book that can make you cry, but this one just makes you mad. Try Where the Heart Is. It's funny and it's sad, but it makes you believe that in the end things turn out alright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Frustrating","review":"I cannot get over how frustrated I was while reading this book.

It was depressing, gave me a negative view on following your religion, and I didn't feel attached to any characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"rich embroidery","review":"Maybe it was because I read this book immediately after \\"The Liars' Club\\" by Mary Karr, but I did not find this book depressing. In fact, I found it quite a satisfying read. As opposed to Karr's book, I read every word. Karr's sporadic ramblings about the past interspersed in the present were jarring and boring. Ansay, however, wrote a fine piece of tapestry, interweaving past with present in a way the was seamless and provided depth to the characters.I was surprised and fascinated when she suddenly wrote from the perspectives of several of the characters other than the protagonist, Ellen. James was waking up too late and he was in for a devestating shock, but he had become more multi-dimensional. Mary-Margaret became suddenly human. Salome's chapter showed how miscommunications between people can leave them lonely and isolated even as they wish for connection.This was a powerful book, written beautifully, and ends well."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READING","review":"THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD BOOK. EACH TIME I WOULD PICK UP THE BOOK I WAS IN HOPES THAT ELLEN WOULD REALIZE HOW MUCH OF A VICTIM SHE WAS ALLOWING HERSELF TO BE AND THAT SHE WOULD TAKE CONTROL OF HER OWN LIFE.

About a woman trapped in an unhappy marriage and a completely unsatisfactory living situation, this tale goes from bad to worse. Although the writing itself is not bad, there is no climax, no ray of hope to keep the reader pressing on. As you turn the pages, you just find out one more terrible thing after another and you wonder if Ansay is clinically depressed or driven to write her autobiography or someone else's. What else would drive a person to write such a novel? Don't read it if you have faith in marriage and family life. It will just dash all your hopes and dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vinegar Hill","review":"I read the book hoping, as I turned each page, that things would look up. It was well written, kept my interest, but I would not recommend to anyone, as I found it so disappointing. Yes, reality can be depressing, but this was gross, too, and I found it a little unbelievable. I didn't feel it was worth my time, and there was nothing to gain from reading this book. It is a story of a pretty pathetic family, and although the main character, Ellen seems to have a brain, she doesn't seem to use it. At least not till the the end, and then you still are somewhat left hanging. Some depressing stories can make you feel grateful about your life. This is not one of those....It doesn't make sense that Ellen put up with it...the 70's just weren't like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a depressing useless read","review":"Vinegar Hill was terrible.

And I consider myself to be a well-rounded reader; I read everything from Charlotte Bronte to Thomas Hardy, from J.R.R. Tolkien to Stephen R. Donaldson, and from Stephen King to Dean Koontz.I am glad of only one thing: I checked this out of the library and so I didn't have to pay for it.The book is slow, the story telling is disjointed, and the author didn't make me care about the characters or where the story was headed.If this is what a typical \\"Oprah Book Club\\" book is like then I will only read it if I can snag a copy from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and Boring","review":"This book was very bleak and depressing. It was one of those books that you read all the way to the end because you keep thinking something exciting is going to happen. But, it never does. Nothing ever happens in this book. No excitement, no punch. I really wish I hadn't wasted my time reading this book when there are so many great books out there. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good fuel for the fire","review":"After finishing this book, which was a painstaking and depressing ordeal, I tossed it into the fire and watched it go up in smoke. The characters are all pathetic, limp noodles; the story lacks plot and character development. Page after page, I kept waiting and hoping for something to happen, for someone to rise up out of their quagmire and make me care about them. The comment of a 30-year old friend who also read the book was, \\"now I understand what it was like to be a woman in the 70's\\". I couldn't disagree more - life was NOT as it was depicted in this book in the 70's. Nor in the 60's or 50's, and I've been around long enough to know. I wouldn't recommend this lifeless, twisted, joyless book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I waste my time on this book","review":"I kept hoping that something nice was finally going to happen to someone in this book. Why do I need to read about this entire disfunctional family when I have my own. Maybe I should write a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vinegar Hill","review":"I was very happy to be done with this book!

I never felt that things would really change for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"good potential, but never got to the point","review":"i have to say that i was amazed that this was an Oprah pick. There was definitely the potential for an excellent book here. The point was never gotten to. Characters were mentioned, but never fully explored. You were left hanging about 95% of the time with the question WHY?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Oprah Flop","review":"This book just kept skipping and skipping. After reading a chapter, the next would be so totally off that I wondered all the time what is this author talking about. The only book from Oprah's Book Club that I totally enjoyed was \\"Songs in Ordinary Time. Maybe, one day I'll try another of the authors books, but not right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packs A Real Punch!","review":"This is a hard one to describe. It's no easy read, that's for sure. It's deep, emotional and most of the characters aren't very enjoyable. But, some how it all works. The story of one woman's life has (of course) been done countless times before, but never like this. You feel each painful minute and day for Ellen. Her trapped life inside that house breaks your heart. You just want to run in there and grab her, shake her, and get her out. It's amazing to see the sad and downward spirl of one woman's soul. This is a really good book, not easy, but very enjoyable. Take some time and savor it. You'll be very happy you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vinegar Hill; Sour title, sour book","review":"I could not recommend this book to anyone and it baffles me that it has received such enthusiastic reviews. I felt no regard for any of the characters, least of all the main character, Ellen Grier. The other's had no redeeming qualities to speak of. I continued reading until the end, hoping that Ellen would drum up the courage to leave that wretched home. She ultimately made her decision but it came in the last two sentences of the book. It seems that the author had written all the horrible anecdotes she could think of so she decided to end the story just as soon as she let the readers know that Ellen would make up her mind. The end was abrupt and it left me feeling as though I wasted far too much time reading it. Life is short and there are so many wonderful books worth reading. Don't use up the time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"If you like fiction where abuse, dysfunction, and the morbid imaginings of the characters continue non-stop--well, then you're in for a treat. I felt this was a completely joyless novel with a very unsatisfying ending. Probably the worst I've read in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Please do not waste your time reading this book. It is extremely slow and boring. I continued reading, waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever did. I have enjoyed most of Oprah's choices, but not this one. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah...you're getting lazy!","review":"After spending ten hours on a car trip reading this book, I realized I would have been more entertained by watching the cold gray scenery pass me by. Is Oprah really reading these books she is praising? I would like to know exactly what she found in this book to recommend. I can find boring, average books to read without Oprah's help, thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and Unsettling","review":"Without a hint of melodrama, the secrets of a family ruled twice over -- externally by an abusive and hateful patriarch, and internally by an oppressive, formalistic, religious devotion -- are played out through the eyes of an outsider, the family's daughter-in-law, Ellen, compelled by her husband's job loss to move her family in with his parents. As we learn more of each family member's life story, we see that the only chance Ellen has to save her personal soul is to abandon her religious soul, as well as all of her female role models. Although I had absolutely nothing in common with the characters (the novel is set in a Catholic, German-American farming community in Wisconsin in 1972) I was unable to put this novel down. The prose is elegant, lean, and very special."},{"rating":"1","title":"15 hours I'll never get back.","review":"I've agreed with most of Oprah's selections, but what on earth was she thinking when she promoted this one? It was boring, boring, boring! Who was I supposed to root for? I didn't like Ellen. I didn't like her husband. I didn't like his parents, her nosey sisters, their bratty children. Everyone was miserable, and kept throwing Catholicism out as the reason they couldn't move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO DEPRESSING !","review":"I read this book because I have enjoyed other Oprah selections, but I think this choice was certainly not the best one. I found the characters to be almost unbelievable and Ellen especially seemed too resigned to the hopelessness of the situation for such a long time. The fact that she finally pulled herself and her children out of this quagmire of doom did not make me like her very much. I can't believe that a woman would let this torment last so long especially for the children she loved. Better late than never? Not necesssarily-- Especially in terms of reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprise! A good Oprah choice!","review":"A hauntingly moving story - I felt as though I shouldn't like it as much as I did. The writing was beautiful, if a little overdone in the \\"death\\" symbolism, but a true test for me is how I feel immediately after finishing a book. This one made me think a lot, and not feel as if I had wasted time by reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and well worth the time","review":"I bought this book on Thanksgiving Day and had it finished the next afternoon. This can be attributed to the fact that I had a quiet holiday and that the book's characters were mesmerizing. Besides the catchy title, the story line is one most married women can connect with, especially those who rebel against our mother's view of a \\"traditional marriage!\\" I would not describe Vinegar Hill as a \\"feel good\\" kind of book but rather depressing in a refreshing way. Please do not buy this book as a holiday gift for a recently engaged or head-over-heels in love friend. They'll hate it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unbearable Heaviness of Being","review":"This novel has been described as \\"bittersweet,\\" but I couldn't find any sweetness in it. Set in 1972, an extremely dysfunctional family in rural Wisconsin is described with care and skill by the author, who has a great talent but who unfortunately for this reader, has produced one long horror story, replete with ghosts, Christian imagery, nightmarish relatives, physical abuse and mental cruelty, as well as trials for the protagonist that not even a female Job could bear. Forced to live with supremely nasty in-laws because of her husband's refusal to seek work, Ellen Grier is treated by them like a slave, is trodden upon, ignored, overworked, insulted, and even robbed of her earnings by her husband. I kept hoping her rebellion would come early and count for something. Not a book I would earmark for rereading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dark But Interesting Journey","review":"As so many other readers have stated, this is a dark story filled with bitter and unfulfilled characters. Still, Ansay's prose is so adept that I was impressed with how, well, disturbed her words made me feel.Not all stories have a plot that winds its way around a framework of neat chapters. Vinegar Hill is as much a character study as a story, and Ellen, Ansay's lead character, is both a spectator and participant in her life. That balance shifts painfully slowly throughout the book. There are no easy endings and some characters are left to their own dark broodings. But such is the way in life.Sometimes it's the story that disturbs that stays with you. For me, this is one such novel. It's not a summer beach read, but it's well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"No story--no plot","review":"I was excited to read this book and it started out quite interesting, a family forced to move in with the father's parents. I thought the author would develop the characters more, but nothing happened, NOTHING. Several story lines seem to have started but nothing came of it, the history of the parents (German immigrants), the odd relationship with their only son, the heroine's resorting to medication to deal with her situation, etc. I do not recommend this book, its a waste of time, albeit it, it is an easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too depressing","review":"Ansay is a good writer but the story was too depressing. I was waiting for some bright spots but none appeared. Also, this story did not finish with much inspiration. After reading this book I had to buy the book \\"Aunty Mame\\" by Patrick Dennis to cheer me up. It's my third time reading Aunty Mame but I know I'll still get a good laugh!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vinegar Hill","review":"I have to say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I found the book to be disjointed, confusing, and extremely slow. There was not sufficient character development so I never got to the point of really empathizing or sympathizing with any of them. I really feel that the theme of the book had so much promise and was never explored thoroughly. A simple story with conversation would have been a more satisfying read than the way the author chose to tell the story. A definite thumbs down.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter to the end","review":"What a boring, depressing novel!It's an easy read, but I personally didn't get anything from it. The story does have some interesting characters but not much happens to them. Most of the characters aren't really likeable either.I have read and enjoyed novels with sad subject matter, but this one is so bitter it grows tiresome. Stick to books like White Oleander, and She's Come Undone, those were better Oprah selections that are more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Recommend this book","review":"Twisted! Is this writer an embittered person? Her skill as a writer is not in question, but I'm hard-pressed to know to whom I could recommend this book. It's off-base on Catholicism. Hard to care about any of the characters. Not much redeeming value. I kept looking for a light; do appreciate the briefness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vinegar Hill -- A Sour Place","review":"Vinegar Hill, highly touted and recommended by Oprah, is a disappointing book. The story is not one that takes us away from our own dysfunctional lives, but throws us into a seriously dysfunctional family who live on Vinegar Hill. The story is not enjoyable and I asked myself WHY did I waste my time reading such a story when I was through. I commend the author's talent at putting such a story together, but it certainly is not enjoyable reading. I will hesitate in the future over the decision to buy an \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"vinagar thrill!","review":"This is only the second book that I have read from Oprah's book club. It will not be my last. Vinagar Hill is a can't put down kind of book that I was able to finish in just 2 days (She's Come Undone took at least 8). Although I have never LIVED with my in-laws I found myself identifying and sympathizing with the main character on many levels. The bond between mother and son as described in this book was also riveting. The only thing I would change about this book is the fact that it ends so openly. Does she actually leave? The author really should think about a follow up on this novel so that we can feel a sense of closure with all of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"book of the month?","review":"I read this based on Oprah's recommendation and interview with the author. It was a quick read but I could not relate to any of the characters. Who would put up with such a horrible situation for as long as Ellen did? The in-laws were terrible but I found their actions were not true to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something smells","review":"Oprah, Oprah.... How could you possibly. I mean I rarely follow her book ideas. This time I did and it will never happen again. THIS BOOK STINKS. It is depressing and damaging. It is gray in Michigan in the winter. This book has made it even darker. I didn't finish it. This seldom happens with me and a novel. YUCK. Do not waste your money, people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but incomplete","review":"The premise of this book is great and easy to get into, however when you reach the end you're left with an unsatisfied feeling that nothing was really resolved. Lots of dysfunctional family problems/issues (some really horrifying), yet the book ends abruptly without addressing many of those issues. It's almost as though the writer got tired of the story and felt the need to wrap it up quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"What a drag and a chore at that! I got little or no pleasure from reading this book and found a lot of the long paragraphs both boring and skip-worthy after awhile. I stuck with it hoping Elln would wake up. She turned out to be a limp dish rag with no sense of self and it was too late by the time she came to her senses. The other characters were totally pathetic; the husband, James was a total baffoon, the grandfather, an unloved, pathetic & bitter old man.The daughter was the only one with a glimmer of hope and backbone. Oprah needs to get a grip on her themes and intentions when choosing such books. A disappointment indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real DUD","review":"This book was among my least favorite of Oprah's books.

Too sappy, too shallow, and a cast of undeveloped characters.On to Wally Lamb. Maybe I'll fare better there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"This book was definately not my type. I was frequently disgusted and could not relate to any aspect of the main character. There was little hope to hold onto as I read about a family full of dark, terrifying secrets. There was no silver lining, nothing to keep me reading except the possibility of closure from the sickening story line. I don't doubt there are people like these characters out there, but I hope to never waste my time on the likes of them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves a \\"vinegar\\" taste in your mouth","review":"I really didn't enjoy this book. It was well written, but certainly left me in a rather dismal mood when I finished it. I guess I couldn't see a point to the pessimism in the story, or at least a good reason why I should have read something that left me feeling so bleak. A good book doesn't always require a fairytale ending, but Vinegar Hill left me with such a \\"yuk\\" feeling I really did regret having read it. Perhaps I was not in the right mood, or I missed something? Either way, I wouldn't recommend this one to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"a stinker!","review":"One star for this one is over-kill! There is little progression of plot (where is it?). The listless (and shiftless) characters lack depth and importance. The author is struggling to take her people and story somewhere but they don't want to go. We keep flashing back to events that have no relevance to the story. I'm left wondering \\"What was that all about? Do I care?\\". These detours explain nothing, and do nothing to further the long awaited plot. The author writes beautifully but leads us in circles. I'm left wondering why I bothered forcing myself through this chaos of one-dimensional characters that don't get saved. They're left to wallow in this stinking dung heap. This one is not good enough for the thrift store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Would have made a good short story, book was too long and tedious.

This book puzzled me from the beginning. I've made it a point not to judge a book immediately after completion, but rather to wait for that \\"aftertaste\\" that comes in the days after. If I find myself referring back to a book, whether it be positive or negative, then I feel it moved me in some way; which I think is what any writer's motives should be. The only time I thought about this book in the days after was when my cat knocked it off the counter and onto the floor and I had to go pick it up. Oprah usually recommends books worth reading. I'm sure the purpose for the recommendation of VINEGAR HILL was that she finally found her \\"spirit\\" at the end and gave herself some \\"oxygen\\" in order to give \\"oxygen\\" to the others in her life; but, PLLLEEAASSEE, we have to muddle through 240 depressing, suicidal, confusing pages to get to that lone paragraph on the final page to \\"get it.\\" Take your Prozac before you read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to finish, but I did it","review":"This was a very difficult book for me to read. The only reason I read it was because my book club chose to read it. It was not normally a book that I would have picked to read. Having said that, I realize that I found the book to be confusing and hard to follow. Ellen seems to be the main character, and yet the author keeps switching the point of view from the husband to the mother-in-law to the daughter and even to the aunt, Salome. What the author didn't tell us and I was dying to know by the end was why the father-in-law was such a beast, and more importantly why everyone kept putting up with him. This story took place in the 1970's not the 1870's. The best part of the story was when Ellen turned the hose on her weak-minded husband. All I could think of was what took her so long?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something happen, Please!","review":"This book is all wind up and no pitch. Nothing ever happens. People move around but get no where. You never become attached or able to empathize with any of the characters. They seem inert and unable to move.

I was totally bored with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read.","review":"I can't believe I actually finished this book. The characters were totally dispicable and so was the story.

It was not a good Oprah pick - what a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vinegar (C)Hill","review":"The two best things about this book are the title and the fact that one doesn't have to invest much (financially or time-wise) in it. The characters are unbelievable because all of them (from youngest child to oldest grandmother) think in the same dark, depressing manner with religious undertones. The author's writing style leaves much to be desired. I found myself on almost every page trying to determine: (1) who was talking, (2) whether it was past or present, and (3) if it was a dream sequence. If this book was a real slice of life, I'd be looking for a new life, not the answer in a pill bottle. I found it to be a bitter, tedious read and, contrary to the New Yorker Review, the final line was not worth the pain it took to get there.

I'm not sure where he gets his facts from. If one doesn't have the facts, one could at least have an opinion and be funny about it. Churchill is neither.I bought it thinking it would be a good introduction to American history written by a great man (I am still a fan of his speeches), but this is not the right book. I don't know why it even got published - its edited form should already have given me a clue that the whole unabridged work was unreadable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self rewinding hose reel for drinking water","review":"I bought this hose reel to eliminate the tangle of hoses in my RV, for drinking water.

It is accurate and reliable with excellent sound quality. I find the settings easy to use and the screen easy to read. After many years of searching, I have found a clock radio that provides me with both pleasure and dependability."},{"rating":"1","title":"RS330 poor performer","review":"I like the sound of the radio and the FM reception is very good but that is all that I like about it. I have also found that my 330 hums, this is most annoying in a quiet bedroom. The super capacitor memory backup isn't super at all! Living in a rural setting where power outages are frequent has revealed a serious flaw in this radio, power failures of less than a minute cause the RS330 to forget all tuner presets and clock settings. When power returns the radio tunes itself to whatever station it feels like and comes on loud, not a pleasant experience in the middle of the night. This radio can not be depended upon for reliable alarms and is an annoying product to live with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"Clock radio-alarm does not work. Manufacturer does not list telephone number. Apparently Customer Service does not exist"},{"rating":"1","title":"Display Doesn't Dim Sufficiently and it Hums!","review":"I'm dissapointed, this thing emits a low level 60HZ hum continuously. The display brightness is adjustable but at the lowest level its still bright enough to cast shadows and disturb sleep. The buttons are described as backlit but IMHO that is not true. The buttons have a band of clear plastic surounding them, what you see is a row of lighted rectangles and circles that are dark in the center with no way to identify their function. I think the correct description would be perimiter lighting which isnt very usefull and adds to the excessive night time light output. Just what I don't want in the bedroom, a brightly lit noisemaker! This one is being returned. Thumbs down, I dont recommend this radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hums along","review":"The biggest objection I have to the RS-330 is that it hums continuously, whether the radio is turned on or off. Another reviewer suggested that placing the unit next to some other electronic device may cause the humming. Not true. Location of the unit has nothing to do with this noise, which is audible from across the room, if the room is quiet. I wanted to use the RS-330 in my bedroom, but I've found the humming so annoying that I'm either going to return the radio or banish it to another room.Otherwise, the RS-330 is okay. It has typical clock-radio features. Fidelity is adequate. The tuner pulls in local FM stations fine, but the more distant stations come in fuzzy, even with the supplied antenna attached. The thing I like the best about the radio is the presence of tone controls - one for treble, another for bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Radio","review":"This is the son (or grandson) of a Proton clock radio I have had for 15 years or more and which developed so many small glitches it needed replacing.The great feature of the old Proton was superior sound quality for the size & price.The new Sangean is the same size & weight (so I think the old speaker is still there) with the added virtue of digital tuning & station presets.I paid about the same price in dollars that I paid 15 years ago for a truly improved product.A good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superlative Clock Radio","review":"It you want a hi-quality, well made radio with excellent audio qualities and a dual alarm, this is the one to get...hands down. I have owned it now for 3 weeks and I'm absolutely pleased with everything, including the craftsmanship and fidelity. A particularly nice feature is the gradually ascending alarm, which is almost imperceptible in the beginning but gradually increases over the span of about a minute.

Don't be fooled by the fact that maybe only three of Bruce's songs still recieve any airplay; all of his songs are great! My father always referred to his songs as great driving songs; indeed, songs like \\"The Valley Road\\" have a steady undercurrent that really catch and compliment Bruce's wonderful and moving piano work. \\"The Way It Is\\" was a great debut album and \\"Southside\\" only builds upon that foundation. \\"I Will Walk With You\\" is beautiful. Somehow, he always manages to catch the feel of the open countryside... everytime I listen I am nostalgic for my home in Colorado.

The latter track,written or co-written by Hornsby,was first a hit for Huey Lewis & The News from their '86 Grammy-winning FORE! album. The other songs are good.

But the electronic variable speed control has an overload cutout feature that is a royal pain. You can't load it much at all until it shuts down and must be restarted. It invalidates the extra power.

It is on the NY Times best selling list. This was the worst book I have ever read. There was no plot, no story line. The author spent more energying describing every meal that was eaten than she spent developing a story. Even as a mindless airport book I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST READ IN A LONG TIME...","review":"I hadn't read a BTB in quite a while, but picked this one up off the library rental shelf for $.10 a day. I kept it for 2 days and felt that $.20 was overpaying for the torture of making myself read to the end. This book is terrible! It is one of the worst books I have come across in a long time. Do NOT waste your time or money on this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book for martyrs","review":"This is what I call myself after having gone through the ordeal of reading this book to the end. I kept on thinking that somehow, out of respect, I owed it to Barbara Taylor to finish reading it. I prayed for a miracle good ending, and was rewarded when I finally did finish this \\"junk\\". I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, boring, not up to BTB standards","review":"This book was so badly written and put together, that I'm glad it was a quick read. I'm an avid reader and have enjoyed, reading other BTB books. The only reason I kept reading, is to find out about the world famous painter and the relationship with the main character. What a joke!!! It seemed that the words \\"war photojournalist\\" were dropped into the text way, way too often -- as if the word processer was programmed to add those words whenever there was a mention of what the main characters did for a living and that the reader might just forget. It certainly didn't add anything especially since the descriptions of being \\"under fire\\" were really trite. Also the gratitous bedroom scenes were almost comical along with the continuous descriptions of meals, foods, clothes, etc. I certainly will think twice before picking up any other BTB books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Read...","review":"I can't remember being so disappointed by a book! I've read many other books by BTB - her reputation must have gotten this one published - if written by anyone else, it never would have seen print! I just finished it - shaking my head - can't believe she opened so many doors but never took any of those themes to fruition! What a badly written book - I'm just glad I didn't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Woman of Stubstance...not","review":"If it were not for her wonderful book, A Woman of Substance, I don't think any publisher would be interested in her writing. It has steadily declined. This book has unrelated subplots that are never resolved, very shallow characters that are so immature and basically stupid the reader cannot even become interested in their fate. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Kidding!!","review":"I read this book only because it was lent to me by an unfortunate person who was lumbered with it for Mothers Day. It was the only BTB book I've read since \\"Woman of Substance\\" and I fine it hard to believe that it was written by the same writer! The dialogue was unbelievably twee and some of it was out of a Victorian novel---the heroine calls her brother --Brother mine!!!!!Oh brother! I finished it because it was so bad that it was funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor writing style, shallow plot, simplistic characters","review":"Many years ago as a young teenager, I picked up the author's \\"A Woman of Substance\\" and could not put it down. That was the first novel that ever gripped me. Now after reading \\"Where You Belong\\" I don't know whether the author has regressed dramatically or my taste at 14 left much to be desired. \\"Where You Belong\\" is written in annoyingly childish sentences. The characters are ridiculously one-dimensional - her mother was a rip-off of Cinderella's step-mom - and there is no attempt at setting the stage so that readers could draw their own conclusions. The fact that the book is written in the first person does not help - The heroine/narrator spends most of the novel either describing her heroic efforts or stating that her family hated her. There really was no plot to the book. The heroine never grew or developed inn any way over the course of the novel. In short - I want my money back on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I snapped up the latest book and even though the inside jacket summary didn't thrill me, Barbara Taylor Bradford did write the fabulous Women of Substance so any of her books should be good - right? WRONG! I started this and after reading the first 71 pages I HAD to go on line to Amazon reader reviews to see if this book was as bad as I thought it was! The writing is disjointed, trivial and after skimming through the remaining pages, nothing I am going to waste my time finishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where You Belong","review":"While I found the book entertaining, it was not the quality of Woman of Substance or Act of Will. The book was simple but slow and I had to keep reminding myself that this is one of my favorite authors.This is a quick read and not realistic. One of the things I enjoy about Ms. Bradford's books is the realism and this one fell short."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I am glad to see I am not the only one who thought this book was bad. I listened to it on audio cassette and kept waiting for a plot to come along. I can't even imagine the author finding it at all interesting. I was expecting at least something of entertainment value having read a couple of her other books that were good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than awful -- Horendously bad and outrageously stupid!","review":"I threw away the book without finishing it; that's \\"where it belongs\\". I could not believe the shear badness of this book. Shame on the editors for allowing this story (if you could really call it one) to hit the stores so undeveloped and uninteresting! I kept reading and my only thought was how badly I wanted to write the author and tell her how transparent her characters were, how cliche the dialog between her characters was, and how superficial and one-dimensional the characters were. I could have cared less about any of them. What a waste of a tree!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book??","review":"Not having read any of your books since the triology \\"Woman of Substance\\", I was expecting a comparable read - especially the chemistry and excitement your other main characters displayed.Totally disapponted - are you sure you wrote this one??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book?","review":"I'd like to think it *wasn't* Barbara Taylor Bradford, as \\"A Woman of Substance\\" was such a wonderful read. This book has no plot that I've been able to discern, boring characters, predictable dialogue, and I'm only sorry I spent my hard earned money on such drivel. The author's introductory explanation should be a warning that this was not a well thought out book. I have my own ideas about Where (This One) Belongs... Sorry Barbara...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at Best","review":"I was so excited for this book to arrive on shelves that I could not wait to read it. Wow! What a disappointment! Lots of different stories within stories and no answers to any of them. I put it on the shelf in my den and refused to pass it along or waste anyone else's time with it. Boo. The only saving grace was the time spent in South of France. What happened to the Mother's health and the business? The chuminess of the lover's real wife and the main characters was unbelievable. I could go on and on-- but I won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Barbara Taylor Bradford please write !","review":"I began skip reading this book after the first chapter - no character depth and the story just seem to jump around with no purpose or focus. This book along with most of her books in the past few years have none of the qualities of that wonderful novel...Woman of Substance. The books now just seems to be quick put togethers to keep the author's name on the book lists.Thank heavens for libraries - would hate to be wasting good money on disappointing literature!How about it, Barbara - don't you have another Woman of Substance waiting in wings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Belong!","review":"I love Barbara Taylor Bradford. I hate this book! The ending was predictable. The plot was all over the place. There was nothing driving you to finish this book. Ms. Bradford's heroines are usually strong, intelligent women. The main character in this book came across as a whiner. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work!","review":"After anxioiusly awaiting the publication of this book,I found it very disappointing. It appears that Ms. Bradford wrote this book merely for the money it would bring. I'm just happy that I got my copy from the public library and didn't actually buy it. The characters were predictable and I really didn't care what happened to them. I just skipped through the last few chapters. Your faithful readers need you to do better next time, Ms. Bradford. We need another Woman of Substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say it ain't so, Barbara Taylor Bradford","review":"So sorry that the author who gave us Emma Harte and family presented so uninteresting and shallow characters in her eagerly awaited new novel.

Disappointed at best,questionable at least. Whatever happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted!","review":"I have read and enjoyed Barbara Taylor Bradford's books in the past, and I eagerly anticipated the latest, Where You Belong. However, I was very disappointed--the writing was stilted, the storyline one dimensional, and the dialogue laughable.

Well, it never did! It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point. The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens. The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc. Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky","review":"For such an experienced author I'm stunned at the clunky dialogue and often awkward writing.

I actually listened to it, and that always makes for a book to be at least a bit more interesting. I can see how people would get bored with it, it is long-winded, but how many authors aren't like that?I think people are just too used to the 21st century non-stop action and/or 3 minute sound bites excitement and drama, and they can't just calm down and listen to a good description of a beautiful house in France or England. I won't be able to go there anytime soon, but the descriptions have definitely transported me right in the heart of those fairy tale homes and landscapes. I think it's time for some of you to go back to the 18-19th century classics and remind yourself of the descriptive pages of those books.I definitely recommend this book to be listened to by a reckless driver while actually driving. This book has definitely calmed me down and I have become a much responsible driver. Try it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I rate it lower than 1 star?","review":"I always finish books that I start but it was never so painful as it was this time! Val is such a whiner about her treatment by her mother, I had no interest in how she washes every leaf of lettuce and her turnaround relationship with her brother was ludicrous!

I can fit about four Chardonnay glasses on it at one time. Call me a cynic if you must, but I submit that photojournalists in a war zone have better things to do than maunder on about their pathetic love lives. The characters were shallow and formulaic, and I loathed the title, proving that one can, indeed, judge a book by its cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Read in Loooong Time","review":"Even now I ask myself, why did I bother to finish it? I guess because it showed promise a few times, but nothing ever developed. It starts with a bang, but descends into histrionics quickly.

Does anyone edit books anymore? I am definitely not interested in ever reading anything ELSE by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOOOOOOOring","review":"Awful! Money down the drain! I was not impressed at all by this book. The main character was very shallow. The plot was very repetitive and with no point. It seems that the author didn't know how to develop the story, instead she just kept repeating many times how the character was mistreated by her mother...I felt no compassion for the heroin. As for the love story , it was very unreal without any emotion whatsoever. Basically, there was really no point ot this story..I just read it for the sake of reading it and putting it away, once I had started. Definatly, a very pointless read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Drivel","review":"I had to literally FORCE myself to finish this book, hoping for something to happen. No such luck. The set-up is of a very successful, independant woman who discovers she is (surprise!) not complete without a man. This book had the potential to bolster women's independance, but failed miserably. It was a terrible ordeal to read, very predictable and the ending was pure relief for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read many, not all, BTB books, and I must agree this was disappointing.

They made egg because the went in the alley and it is a short cut to the hat store. Also when they went back there some older boys where throwing some eggs at the door. Mr.Kodinski didn't give them a chance to tell him that it was not them, he said all I wanted is a peaceful life. Then he said I am calling your grandmother.

Los Animales is his favorite, but he also enjoys this DVD which teaches him the parts of his body in Spanish.

A great choice for Spanish immersion for your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"All of my children (5,3,2)love it. My youngest (2) loves to dance around to it. The songs are fun to follow and makes learning spanish fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"More for 3 and under","review":"Bought for my 2, 4 and 5 year olds. I thought it was a cute video, but the 4 and 5 year old had no interest. They said it was boring and refused to watch it after about 5 minutes. The 2 year old might have watched it if it were not for the influence of her older siblings. I would not recommend for children over 3. I feel like it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's watch Fritzi!","review":"I wanted to get my 3 year old son learning another language as early as possible, but without knowing any Spanish myself, I went the DVD route. I researched a number of different Spanish for kids educational movies before selecting this one, and I have not been disappointed. This uses immersion as opposed to translation, meaning the entire movie is in Spanish.\\"Let's Play\\" DVD is the third one of this series we have purchased. There's a lady named Maria who does most of the talking and interacting with the kids in the video. The movie connects with kids by introducing a mouse named Fritzi who my son loves! It's a very entertaining and engaging way to introduce a new language to small children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but tiring at times","review":"We got 3 of these DVDs, Maria - the host, will get on your nerves as she is trying to hard to be \\"warm and fun\\" - it's also very slow.

The only good thing is the singer and the songs they feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Beginner","review":"The concept is great.However, for an english speaking child coming into this at ground zero, it does not seem likely that this approach will be successful based on initial use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must buy!","review":"My 17 month old daughter loves this video. She usually watches it 2 times in a row. If your child likes sesame street videos they will like this one. The only thing that it is missing is more supporting graphics for the words that they are saying otherwise it is fun and educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"I bought this for my 18 month old granddaughter because she is part Hispanic and wanted her to learn some Spanish to impress her other grandparents. In only a couple of sittings she caught on immediately to the words for face, head and hat. Although she knows no Spanish this video makes it very easy to understand what is being said. It is repetitive and keeps her attention rather well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK...","review":"I was excited to view this DVD based on the reviews, but it did not quite live up to expectations. I saw it together with my 4-year old and it did not hold his attention. The format consists of a narrator/teacher who speaks entirely in Spanish. She uses hand gestures and puppets to illustrate the Spanish words. This becomes somewhat repetitive after a while. The narrator was remarkably unremarkable, which may be good in that she doesn't detract from the lessons. Now for the not-so-good. Every so often a song pops up. Unfortunately the songs did not add to the video as they were reminiscent of old cowboy tunes. The accompanying \\"booklet\\" was a single fold-out with the words and phrases taught in the DVD. It would have been more useful if it were better structured with some explanation. Finally, I was surprised that the DVD only ran 20 - 21 minutes as I had expected more for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly What I Wanted","review":"I love this video and, more importantly, so do my two boys (ages 2.5 yrs & 20 mos.) As another reviewer has mentioned, it has a very \\"Blue's Clues\\" feel- the hostess, Maria, is an actual person, but the background and other characters are cartoons. Maria speaks very clearly and has a very soothing voice. What I like the most is that it is very interactive. Maria asks a lot of situational questions, and the \\"audience\\" of children answer. For example, after she introduces different article of clothing she'll ask \\"does a sock go on my head?\\" and the off screen children will yell \\"no.\\" Then she'll ask, \\"then what goes on my head?\\" and the children will yell \\"un sombrero (a hat).\\" It's a lot of fun and makes learning Spanish easy. It's by far the best Spanish video I've purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I recently purchased this CD for my 5 year old daughter.

Huge fail, even worse, I purchased this for my Makita planer hoping to get a stand that I could level out the extendable arms even with my planer, no such luck with this stand....the problem is the cross braces don't fit into the bottom hole of the top frame like the instructions say, as a result you are UNABLE to get the top shelf any lower than the 4th hole down, which doesn't give you enough of a drop to even up the extendable arms with most planers...This was the reason I purchased the stand, so I warn anyone else to AVOID purchasing this stand until the manufacturer spends some R&D; money on fixing this glaring error, and rewriting their assembly instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, it's okay","review":"It took me a long time after getting \\"Wish her safe at home\\" to actually read it. Unfortunately, it wasn't really worth the wait. The premise seems promising and a good idea- Rachel Waring is a middle-aged woman (a spinster if people still used the word) who lives with a roommate that is not very likeable. So when a great-aunt dies and leaves her a mansion, Rachel leaves her old and boring life behind. For a time, all seems to be well. But as time goes on,Rachel changes and starts to descend into madness and the reader follows that journey with her.So though it seems like a really good book, I just wasn't thrilled by it. In fact, I found myself getting bored by it. After I started the book, it took me a long time to finish it. And that's pretty rare because I rarely take a week to finish a book and this took me over a week to finish. It's not a book that I'll feel the need to re-read down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enthralling little nugget","review":"Stephen Benatar is a wonderfully vivid writer. He is witty, exciting, and quite adept at creating memorable characters. Miss Rachel Waring has to be one of the most well written female characters since the likes of Scarlett O'Hara or Blanche DuBois (and the connection is intentional).Wish Her Safe at Home is a wonderful book of a rather rapid decent into madness. A spinster recalls her past and contemplates a brighter future when she unexpectedly inherits a house in Bristol. Fantasy and reality twist in an ebb and flow that becomes nearly indistinguishable. Suddenly you realize that Rachel is your only connection in her story, so whatever she decides her reality to be is \\"reality\\" to us as readers.I did not know what to expect, but this novel delivered a fascinating story and a remarkable character in Rachel. At once she is proper lady of an earlier, more refined time; and then she is a bawdy old broad.

And what about when this person did this & what do we think the main character thought of that? On & on. I stopped reading after 2 pages & went ahead to chapter one because I didn't want the story ruined. Little did I know that the story ruins itself.I think I made it to chapter 5 with a sore neck because I kept dozing off due to the sheer lack of anything remotely interesting. Dull. Dull.

Album title very misleading.","review":"As a teenager growing up in South Florida in the mid 50's I used to listen to music on Cuban radio stations. It was very rhythmic and upbeat or romantic, languid and sensual. I bought this album because I heard the artist interviewed on Performance Today and loved what he played. But that piece and 2 others by the same composer are the ONLY compositions I like on this CD. The rest is not music but guitar \\"sounds\\" which could have come from a 20th century composer anywhere in the world. I do not like atonal music or that which does not have a melodic line SOMEWHERE in it. So that leaves me with 5 minutes of playable music out of 65 minutes.

Terry Kay is certainly a gifted writer and a new author to me.I highly enjoyed this tale of Noah Locke, a quiet drifter, with a magical ability to catch fish. His travels take him to Bowerstown in North Carolina in 1948(the year I was born). It is known as the Valley of Light and Locke finds more than he imagined in this quiet farming town. The book is about much more than fishing.The novel rivals John Steinbeck's GRAPES OF WRATH and Hemingway's OLD MAN AND THE SEA for intensity and meaning. My favorite novel is James Hilton's LOST HORIZON and this one comes a close second.The Valley of Light is a modern day Shangri-La and a place where I would love to live.I will be checking out more of Terry Kay's work based on this book.

It was like reading some rough draft that was never intended to be read by anyone else other than the author herself. It did not draw me in at all, and I found myself skimming and glossing over a lot of what she wrote. To me, this book could barely even be called a novel; it was more like a sketch than a portrait.

His writing and directing are assured, nuanced and thrilling. It is hard to believe this is his debut feature. Mingo boldy breaks the unspoken rule of first films--keep it simple. Instead, he tells a complex and compelling story with a deft visual touch that never intrudes but always elaborates on the continuing shifting interior landscapes of his intriguing and fully-realized characters. Eddie Wretch's performance as Tom Dixon is a real find; his screen presence crackles with menace, charisma and energy. It is one of the breakout performances of the year, and it is a tribute to the overall strength of Mingo's directing and writing that Wretch doesn't steal the film. Instead, he is an equal part of a stellar ensemble that works together seamlessly and selflessly to serve this intelligent, engaging story.Brian Lindstrom"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy!","review":"It was great, but the original flavors weren't in there.

A young actress is invited to study privately with her idol, an older actress who mysteriously fell out of the public eye. Well, the older actress turns out to be a homicidal maniac and imprisons the younger actress in the home. What follows is a tense, exciting adventure as the younger actress fights to win her freedom and save her life.Since it was some time ago that I read the book and it is in storage, I can give you no names. And I don't recall the motivation of the older actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Disappointing","review":"Although I am possibly the greatest fan ever of Disney Children's Favorite Songs (see my reviews for Vol. 1-4), this CD disappointed me. I confess I expected Disney Family Christmas to exhibit the same sterling qualities that were so evident in the four volumes of Disney Children's Favorite Songs; however, in my opinion, it was sadly lacking. The songs are all Christmas classics, and Larry Groce and the Disney Children's Choir also perform this collection. It doesn't have the same high quality of original interpretation that was so appealing in the Disney Children's Favorite Songs collection, and I could not in good conscience give this album the same great reviews I gave the other four. It's Larry Groce, but I don't think he was given carte blanche to create the masterpiece he was capable of. The CD is OK, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it. Such a shame, in view of his other work on his other Disney albums. Altogether, it was rather disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood Memories of Christmas","review":"I bought this album as a present for my wife, who lost her copy several years ago and was disappointed because she could not play it for our children. It is a wonderful album. Both of us remember listening to it over and over again when we were young. This really made the season for her, as she nearly wore out this copy before Christmas day.The only downside is that this copy seems to have some volume difference between tracks. Those with the Disney characters are very loud, while the others are quiet. Neither of us recall this issue on our original album, so it may be a default with this copy.I would highly recommend for those who want a Christmas album for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true surprise!!!","review":"This video is great!!! It gives you that one on one trainer feel and you can tell it gives you results. My first time through I was sweating so much and I found it challenging and enjoyable.

It got me a bit winded since I haven't worked out in a while and boy did it make me sweat! I loved the fact that Kim's trainer was on there with her and she was able to show how you're supposed to look when doing these workouts. I would suggest this to anyone who wants to get into shape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth trying","review":"The video doesn't show the instructor and Kim's full body throughout the video. It often focuses in on Kim's body parts which makes following the exercises a guessing game. Also they seem to catch Kim whenever she groans in exhaustion which seems a little suggestive of what made her who she is. I wouldn't buy another of Kim's videos. Instead buy a Cathe Freidrich DVD... She is an awesome instructor and easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Liked It!","review":"This workout is a lot more challenging than I thought. I'm in pretty good shape and I really felt it the next day. It does take a little bit to catch on to because it's filmed more like you are working out with them, rather than they are teaching you how to do the moves...and the camera focuses on Kim's face rather than the exercise sometimes. I really do like this work out, its tough and you know its working! Plus I love the Kardashians, so I found Kim really charming.The only downside is that the description doesn't tell you that you need light weights and an aerobic step."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kim Kardashian Video","review":"If you're looking to tone your thighs and butt I recommend doing the exercises in this dvd.

As a trainer of 15 years I can tell you that Kims workouts (designed by her trainer in the video) are fun and effective. Its also very entertaining.

It wasn't cohesive. Actually I wasn't even sweating when I finished. I hate when I finish a workout and afterwards I don't feel as if I did anything. I'm sure if Kim would have shut up more and just went from one exercise to the next in a quicker manner perhaps it would have been more effective but the pauses were long and it just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Hard!!!","review":"Got this dvd and its hard to follow along with they do the excercises too fast.

It had a few good moves in it but it was way to fast paced. I was always at least one step behind and didn't feel like I could really get into a move before needing to be in the next one.I suppose it could be used as a reference. You also really can't do it without a step. Which is an expensive buy for a work out video.sorry Kim but your enthusiasm can't get you out of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Blade","review":"Seems like a good blade. Used it a couple times now and going strong. I have it in a table saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining...but lacking in plot development","review":"This fifth installment in the series is much like the rest of them:the main characters go their separate ways for the bulk of the novel and reunite for the subplot. The plot, in fact, is becoming rather predictable, with only details changing from book to book. There is very little of the \\"epic\\" in this fantasy series, as the plots of the now five books just don't seem to be driving at anything.That being said, the book IS entertaining, and I even found myself laughing at points. That's more than can be said for some of the other big names in fantasy at this time. While not intellectually stimulating, \\"Goddess of the Ice Realm\\" will provide a number of hours of good reading, and is certainly worth purchasing for readers of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining...with a caveat","review":"Drake's writing ability once again shines, but I would really like him to stop going to the same plot-well over and over. Yes, it has served him in the past, but it's time to branch out a little.That said, he is a master storyteller with a fine grasp of the art of smooth and entertaining prose, and this is more of a quibble than anything else. And his characters certainly do spring off the page and lodge themselves in your mind, which is why this one is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"last verse same as the first","review":"uh.....is the next book going to be the same story line yet again?

His constant review of the previous books is annoying. The whole thing is set up like a bad soap opera. If you liked this then you should really seek new authors, there is much better out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Audio Book Experience","review":"Scarlett Feather is a well written, albeit predictable, Irish family saga that is especially enjoyable as an audiobook. The narrator did a splendid job of capturing the many, many different voices of the characters and their personalities. In fact, the high quality of the narrator's voice really kept my interest even when I already knew how the book was going to end.The story will appeal to fans of Ms. Binchy and/or Irish fiction. There is humor, tragedy, love, and insight into contemporary Irish culture. And the audiobook version makes a wonderful companion on a road trip.Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It ll Keep you hooked","review":"This is a long story that took me nearly a week to read even though I was giving it all my spare time, but its told in a way that keeps you hooked.Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather have a dream to start there own catering business, with the help of family they fulfil this dream, at the start of the story I have to say I didn't much care for Tom, but it didn't take me long to change my mind. Cathy is the most likable character in the book.Other characters include Cathy's husband Neil, who's so busy trying to save the world to get recognition for it that he doesn't seem to care that his uncles 9 year old children are being neglected. Neil's mother snobbish lonely bitter Hannah who doesn't feel Cathy is good enough for her son. Cathy's parents Muttie and his wife Lizzie, towards the end I just loved them. Tom's girlfriend beautiful Marcella who doesn't realise what she's got and Geraldine, who's Cathy's best friend and aunt.This is one of Binchy's best, loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite author","review":"Maeve Binchey is my favorite author and I look for all her books. I have read quite a few and continue to do so. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon, Ye Scarcely Know Me","review":"I'm only writing this review because some electronic wizard decided that I would rate it a 3 1/2! Actually, I found the book to be not very well written and boring, the heroine(?)an unlikable prig with a chip on her shoulder and the required best-seller happy ending based on a deus ex machina. Notice, however, that I do not give it a \\"1\\". There are some redeeming features; a pair of enchanting though not very believable twins, and some catering stories that are quite fun.The amazing thing is that you based your judgement of my reading likes and dislikes based on the fact that I read Barbara Kinnsolver and P. D. James. Duh? Binchey can spin a tale, but is hardly in the same league."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on with it!","review":"Rubbish, I can't beleive that Binchy has got so bad with her writing. The book was too long and painstakingly slow. Just like her last book Tara Road, my only thought was \\"Get on with it\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book?","review":"I came on Amazon to read the reviews, to see how many agreed with my opinion that this is not a good book. I'm surprised at all the praise and agree with the naysayers. Plot-lines that go nowhere(Cathy and the mother-in-law), and, the main character, Cathy, is pretty unlikeable. This book reads like a soap opera and it is too long. I rarely read fiction, except mysteries, and this book reminds me why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarlet Feather","review":"(This review refers to the abridged audio cassette version). This is not one of Maeve Binchy's best books. It is a boring story about a catering company called \\"Scarlet Feather\\". The names of the characters just ran together and and there was hardly any plot. I couldn't wait until the end of the tape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and inaccurate","review":"I was SOOOO disappointed in this book. The relationship between Neil, and his wife, Cathy's with two charming nine-year-old twins is incorrect in over half the book...they're cousins, not aunt, uncle, neice, nephew....also, it felt as if someone else wrote the manuscript. bad editing as many words were misspelled or simply left out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring boring boring","review":"I've read two other books of Maeve Binchy - Tara Road and Circle of Friends. I liked Tara Road a lot even though it didn't get to the point till over halfway through. Circle of Friends was just tolerable. I wanted to give Scarlet Feather a chance since it was newer like Tara Road. It was waste of time. The most interesting parts of this book were the scenes with Cathy and Neil. I'm so glad to be done with this book and on to something else. I've purchased other Maeve Binchy books because I thought I'd like them based on a friend but I think I am going to sell them back. Her books are too long and boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Sorry, but even with the beautiful cover, this book was a waste of time. Now, if you have all sorts of time on your hands, read it. But if you only get moments to read, choose something more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ecchhh","review":"I'm amazed at the number of good reviews of this book. Aside from its appalling length for such a light-weight drama, the dialogue was incredibly amateurish. Definitely *not* one of Binchy's better works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maeve,what happened to you?","review":"I was very excited to see Maeve's new novel in my local library! I always feel like reading a new novel by her is like getting a long, chatty letter from an old friend.Little did I know how disappointed I was to be!The character development that she has always been so brilliant at was not there, the plot moved ploddingly along and I felt she was just tired of her characters.........as I was after about 100 pages. Well, I got through 269 out of about 530 pages and decided to call my friend, Jean, who is also a huge Maeve fan to ask her if she had heard any rumors that maybe Maeve had a ghost writer for this one!Sorry, fans, this one was not worth the time for me.........and I loved all of her previous novels!Maeve, I love you.........please go back to fewer characters and deeper plots!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go ahead and read it","review":"It's true, this isn't the best Maeve Binchy book, but hey...bad Binchy is better than a lot of people's best efforts. Actually, I wouldn't even consider this to be \\"bad Binchy\\". It simply is not up to her normal standards. But READ IT ANYWAY. The only thing wrong with it is that there are too many characters populating this novel and that ending of the book is a little too rushed. If you liked The Evening Class and Tara Road I think you'll like this. It isn't old fashioned Binchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book By M. Binchy","review":"I have read most of Maeve Binchy's works. It is fun to put myself in Ireland and follow Maeve's characters through their daily lives. While her mysterys are not real \\"Cloak and Dagger\\", they are easily imagined as being part of everyday people's lives. Scarlet Feather was another book I did not want to put down and now I can't wait for the next edition to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Step Down","review":"I love Maeve Binchy, but this latest book just didn't capture my interest like the others I have read. I didn't get very involved with each of the characters, and I ended up not really caring much at all about Cathy's and Tom's catering company. I think there is too little time and too many books- if you start this book and are not fully captivated by it within the first 100 pages, put it down fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!","review":"I have read all of Maeve Binchey's books and loved them, especially the earlier ones. Tara Road was the first hint of disappointment, but I hoped that this book would be more true to Ms. Binchey's talent. It was a struggle to read, and such a disappointment in the end! The book was wordy and the storyline was frustratingly redundant. What was the editor thinking??????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Poorly Written","review":"This book is my first Maeve Binchy read--it has been terribly disappointing, and difficult to get through. The text is wordy--with grammatical errors throughout. The characters and storyline read like a soap opera--ie. the characters are stereotypical and lack any depth, and the storyline is predictible from page 1. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maeve's written one too many","review":"I had heard that this novel was to be Binchy's last. Unfortunately I think she should have quit a couple of books ago. TARA ROAD was marginal, but SCARLET FEATHER is just plain awful. The plot line is so thin you can see through it. The characters are shallow, uninteresting, and self-absorbed - with the exception of the sainted Muttie and Lizzie who are drawn as caricatures of working class Irish, to the point of being insulting. The fast-action style of cutting from one character to another may work in the movies, but is oddly out of place in a novel of this sort. Too bad Binchy didn't quit with THE GLASS LAKE - now there was a fine book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't even rent it","review":"What a disappointment. Maeve was one of my favorite authors, and I liked everything she did prior to this jumbled up story. Most of the characters were unbelievable, and the few believable ones were boring. Don't waste your time. Maeve Binchey, what happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"After breathlessly awaiting her new book I was given it as a present and rushed right into it. However, it was not typical Maeve Binchy. Perhaps having read book reviews that promised she shed the old Ireland and gave us her version of the new Ireland, mainly with the business end of the theme - the catering establishment- therein lay my disappointment. The story kept one's interest but my main criticism is that it just wasn't the tried and true Maeve. Give me back a Circle ofFriends any day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"smashing read","review":"could-not-put-down-until-it-was-finished.engages the reader right from the start, plots seem to develop and merge fluidly, well- fleshed out characters, really makes an enjoyable weekend/ holiday read. My sister had a catering business for a year too, and Maeve's description of Tom and Cathy's struggles were realistic yet sympathetic. Love the precocious twins, they balance the greyer characters and side-plots e.g. the unforgiving modelling/fashion scene, the lonely old accountant, career-mistress etc., plot never loses its pace, yet throws in some pleasant, if unlikely surprises, e.g. the incorrigible gambler winning big-time. also deliciously restrained in handling Tom and Cathy's relationship.Read it, be comforted and entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a bore","review":"I have been a fan of Maeve Binchy since \\"Light a Penny Candle\\", but I have found this title to be so disjointed and predictable, I can't finish it.

I'm not even through yet but want to warn you away from buying it like I did, hoping that Maeve Binchy would be a comparable writer to Rosamunde Pilcher. Alas, she is not! It's predictable, wordy and redundant...a real snoozer. My first and last Maeve Binchy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarlet feather: not MY personal favorite...","review":"Do the main characters in Maeve Binchy books always get divorced? After Tara Road, I was told this was her best... I'm sorry to say that if this is her best, it's my last! Personally, I don't like reading through a long book to find an unhappy ending... I like to see characters building positive, happy lives for themselves..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and easy to relate to!","review":"I have been a fan of Maeve Binchy since I saw the film Circle of Friends in 1995. I had to read the book and was amazed that I enjoyed the novel even more than the film.Her books have rich detail, great story lines (which often interconnect, realistic and humorous dialogue. I had enjoyed her earlier novels whoch deal with young girls coming of age in 1950s rural Ireland. When she switched to more adult books (Evening Class, Tara Road) I wondered how I would like them. They are every bit as enjoyable and this is no exception.Scarlet Feather is entertaining, the characters are likable and have true depth. I enjoyed that the each chapter is a month in the first year of a fledging catering business. This story is told with more subtlety than some of her other novels and is wonderful.I couldn't put it down and I was sorry when it ended and hope that the story of Tom Feather and Cathy Scarlet continues in the future"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scarlet Tapestry","review":"This book is richly filled with the types of characters and everday life situations that make Maeve Binchy books so wonderful to read. While the plot is not riveting, the character development and handling of the various life crises are so beautifully handled that it doesn't matter that this book is just about everyday life and everyday people. In fact, you like the book BECAUSE it is about everyday life and everyday people. Anyone who cannot find a character to relate to in this book must lead a sad and boring life. I thought the scenes involving Marian's wedding plans were particularly funny and poignant. If you like Maeve Binchy's very particular style, you will absolutely love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarlet Feather","review":"I have read every single book Maeve Binchy has written and was eagerly awaiting this one. What a disappointment. It's almost as if someone else wrote it. I kept going expecting it to get better -- but it didn't and I found myself skipping though paragraphs and pages at a hectic clip. Usually when I get close to the end of a Maeve Binchy book I try to slow down in order to make it last as long as possible. Not this time. The character development is shallow and the story is just plain boring. Hope she doesn't leave us with this as her final work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I loved this book!I was so sad to hear that it would be her last. I loved that she included so many of Scarlett and Tom's relatives. It gave us better insight into them. I thought that the format was great too. It kept us up to date on all the characters, Marcella, Hannah, Muttie and Lizzy and the twins. The character were better developed than some of her other books. I would recommend this to anyone who really enjoys entering the characters lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another easy reading hit!","review":"I am going to keep this review to a short note. Maeve does it again. I know her recipe and I know that her characters always win, but there is something about the easy way her words flow! I couldn't put this book down. Her character development is her gift. After reading her works, I often find myself HOPING that people like these really exist somewhere. That way I can be assured that GOOD, loving, and kind people are alive and out there in this big confused world. Thank god for Maeve Binchy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a way to bow out","review":"I had heard that Scarlet Feather would be Maeve Binchy's \\"swan song.\\" I then saw the title, you know, with the feathers? Not so. The title comes from a combination of the two main character's names, Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather. Cathy and Tom, friends not lovers, form a cartering business. A story about a cartering business...how delicious I thought. Again I was wrong. Like all Binchy novels Scarlet Feather is a saga with characters and villians--and a mystery to be solved. As a fiction author I read for more than to just entertain myself but to appreciate writing style and to learn. Over the years I have come to know that Ms. Binchy has a gift for characterization and dialog. Come on Maeve just one more book...please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's on the menu tonight you ask?","review":"Lots, I answer with a grin...Love this writer and her book! \\"Scarlet Feather\\" by master storyteller Maeve Binchy is one fun read. Loved it! The characters are fun. The dialogue easy to follow. And, the plot is a real page turner. This was my first Maeve Binchy book and she will perhaps be glad to learn it won't be my last. I've ordered two more since I read \\"Scarlet Feather\\" and I look forward to reading them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review: Scarlet Feather","review":"We are first introduced to Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather as they have newly formed there catering company, \\"Scarlet Feather.\\" Cathy's mother-in-law disapproves of both Cathy and her new \\"hobby\\" and her husband Neil doesn't notice as he is only concerned about his job as a civil rights lawyer. Tom is happy with his new enterprise but his family expects him to follow in his father's footsteps. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, Marcella has dreams of her own.From the first page I was caught up into Scarlett Feather and felt indignant on Cathy's behalf. I'm sure many can identify with her. Tom and Marcella are both so sweet, but steadfast in their goals. I love that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book??? It can't be Maeve Binchy.","review":"When I saw that Maeve Binchy had a new book out, I was so excited that I stopped reading a very good book to start this one. What a waste of time and money, and I bought it in hardcover, no less. The characters are really caricatures and the plot was so boring that I reluctantly stopped reading. There are too many great books out there to waste your time with this. I have read all of her books and I truly find it hard to believe that she actually wrote this book. It is nothing like her rich and well developed past books, and I was totally disappointed. Our entire book club could not finish this book. I must add that any of her past books are terrific and she has brought me many hours of reading pleasure in the past. Perhaps my expectations were too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real bore","review":"What happened to Maeve Binchy? Her latest book does not compare with her others and I cannot reccomend it as a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is nothing like some of the other works by this author. I found it more like the terrible writing produced by Danielle Steele. In the future I will review Ms. Binchy's works more carefully before purchasing one of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, Excellent Reader","review":"I really enjoyed the reader. I think a good reader makes a huge difference in audio books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read, but I hoped for a better ending","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author! I couldn't wait to finish the story. It was great the way she developed all the characters in this story. I was truly captivated! Altough, I was disappointed in the ending! I guess you just have to use your imagination!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"I was so excited when I saw that Maeve Binchy had a new book out. I've read other books by her and loved them. This book was very long and the plot was predictable, the characters shallow. And so many characters! To hear the same story told by the point of view of 20 different people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed...","review":"I never thought I'd see the day when I wouldn't enjoy a Binchy book! My opinion on Tara Road wasn't favourable, but hoped that it was a one-off. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Scarlet Feather is written in much the same way as Tara Road - he said, she said, he went, she went....ad nauseaum. What happened to the depth of character and storylines for which Binchy is so famous? I could never put her books down, now I can't put them down fast enough. I really, really tried to like this one - but after the first 100 or so pages, I just gave a big sigh and put it down for good! Is this what happens when a well-known author is held for ransom by their publisher to get something in print every year? Please Maeve - bring back the good old days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Binchy does it again!","review":"I got so absorbed in this book that I stayed up until 5 am to read all of it! Loved the three-dimensional characters and the fact that no one was entirely good or bad. Agree with other readers that some of minor characters were a bit confusing (Who was Con again??) but that wasn't crucial. I liked the feminist theme and thought that she portrayed the conflicts of Cathy and Marcella very well. Cathy was a winner always and Marcella a victim, but one who grew with the story. Story provided excellent view of old and current class stratification in Ireland, with addition of how those who emigrated to US saw Ireland. I liked the fact that this book was more dense than Tara Road, but not quite as hard-going as Copper Beech. And, unlike some of her earliest ones, not depressing. I'll miss her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one from Binchy","review":"Though this is the least memorable of the Binchy novels I've enjoyed, it's still terrific. Like many of her fans, I was introduced to the author by the popularity of Tara Road. This is just another one of her wonderful novels that I find captivating, funny, suspenseful and delightful even though I hadn't any intention of becoming hooked on a series of novels set in Ireland. The setting is more contemporary than in other Binchy novels, and the characters are almost as lovable. Any Binchy fan will be happy to put their time into reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!!!","review":"Maeve Binchy has always been one of my favorite authors, so I wasn't about to miss her last book. What a big disappointment!!! I am not even 1/4 through & it is a struggle to continue. One keeps hoping it will get more interesting & it doesn't. There are too many characters by far and too many story lines. It's like she decided to throw in the kitchen sink & more for her last book. Too bad she's leaving on a bad note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the most spectacular, but still wonderful","review":"I really liked this book. I don't think it's nearly as good as Tara Road, but it was worth the read. I found that Maeve Binchy ties in a lot of characters from Tara Road and other previous books in Scarlet Feather. The story was well set--it's a little predictable at times, and the ending was not surprising to me. She kept dropping hints here and there throughout the book. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves Binchy and say that you will not waste your money reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"surprised that I didn't enjoy it","review":"I love Maeve Binchy, having read everything she's written since Light a Penny Candle. The Glass Lake is my favorite. In Scarlet Feather, I found myself thinking, \\"she's off her game\\" It seemed predictable, and, for me, just dragged on and on. The bits where each of the characters was touched on with a paragraph, switching from one to another was trying. It was like a repeated, \\"meanwhile back at the ranch\\".Some things didn't make sense, mostly that neither Tom, Cathy or the police suspected the evil cousin for the robbery & vandalism. It would seem standard procedure for the police to suspect a recently fired employee, and Tom & Cathy were not so stupid that they'd never have thought of this-it was so obvious. This was irritating.I'm now reading Quentins, which I find better than Scarlet Feather. Still, I think I enjoy Maeve Binchy more when she travels back in time, though I did like Tara Road."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's no Tara Road","review":"I really enjoyed Tara Road and I thought I would give more of Maeve Binchy's works a try. This was not one of her best pieces. No 8 year old children speak like that. Cathy said it was a shame for the children to go back to their parents when they were almost HUMAN! Cathy continued to drink knowing that she was pregnant. After going into detail with the children about the code for the shop and mentioning several times that the children had big mouths, how could it not occur to them that the children told someone the code? Does Maeve think we're all stupid or does she not care?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't my favorite","review":"I really like Maeve Binchy, but I found this book disappointing. I always enjoyed how her characters came full circle at the end. This one does a little, but it is not as fulfilling. I didn't feel this was her best at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I enjoyed many of Maeve Binchy's novels and was eagerly awaiting this one as well. However, I must say it was extremely disappointing, especially in view of her other books. The characters were uninteresting and the storyline was dull and boring. This novel was really below par for someone of Ms. Binchy's writing abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical meetings book.","review":"Tired of bad meetings? This is the book for you. As an HR professional with years of experience in bad meetings, I can say with confidence that this book will transform the way organizations are run. This book is about much more than just meetings, it is about a new approach to business!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read - Good meeting philosophy","review":"This book is an easy read. The fictional story is a good vehicle to get the messages across while keeping the reader's interest.Lencioni's suggestion of no preset agenda for a weekly tactical is in contrast to many other management recommendations, but makes a lot of sense.A good companion to another good book: \\"Overcoming Five Dysfunctions of a Team\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"let me save you $16.47","review":"Have short, to the point meetings, and have things decided at them.This book drones on and on with a truly rephrensible made-up example. It is diadic generally very poorly written. The advice is trite and quite frankly intuative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death by Bad Writing","review":"The premise of the meeting structure that the author proposes could be summed up in one page. Instead, the \\"fable\\" continues for over 200 pages. The meeting structure is interesting, though not a new idea at all. Read the executive summary and skip the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! The worst","review":"I have read all of Lencionni's other books and this one is a real disappointment. I didn't believe a single second of it. Please have the major character come to our company; he would be lynched in a minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unbelievable","review":"I agree with the other one-star reviews for this totally fabricated story. I mean, come on! This would simply never happen in the real corporate world, where new people are never listened to until they have \\"paid their dues\\" (and sometimes not even then!) The idea that meetings have some relationship to movies (if only) is just too precious for words, but some people apparently want to believe it can happen. I don't agree. I would love to see meetings improved in some meaningful way, but I don't think this book is going to make a substantive difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the feeble, er, fable","review":"The story lacks life and is poorly written. What could have been an engaging 20-page short story ended up as dozens of 3-5 page chapters in large type with wide margins. You'll find yourself skimming for substance which you won't find until at least half-way through. Read the executive summary, don't waste your time on the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I enjoyed this quick read. I found it paralleled some issues I was facing in my meetings. I can't wait to give these models a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death by Meeting","review":"This book is a must read for every CEO. After reading Death by Meeting, I decided to buy eight more copies and distributed them to each of my executive team. The initial reaction was the sense of giving a bad Christmas gift....\\"Thanks, but I don't have time to read\\", or \\"Wow, we got a bonus this year?\\" I asked them to read the first 50 pages by our next weekly meeting. The results were evident within a few days. The water cooler discussions were all about the book. Many had finished the book on the first day and were jokingly referring to their colleagues and their boss by the character's names. Still the majority waited until the night before our next meeting to even take it home and see what the hype was all about. Those that waited realized real quick how important the message of the book is to our culture. Although we still have many disfunction's, our meetings are no longer avoided, they are always very engaging, and most importantly they are no longer painfully boring!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Although not all the concepts apply to all teams, I believe everybody can get something valuable out of this book. As an important added value the book is very entertaining and has a great way of sharing the message."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dreaded \\"M\\" Word: A Potential Solution for a Perennial Problem","review":"Like many of Lencioni's books, the information in this book is played out through a realistic business scenario with a comprehensive review of the model at the end. This book tackles that perennial problem of how to make meetings more productive and begins with the premise that the purpose of any meeting is to extract the collective wisdom of a team or group of people. Lencioni suggests that the main problems with most meetings is that conflict is typically avoided and the structure of the meeting often does not match the purpose of the meeting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Lencioni is one of my favorites! He hits right where we live without it hurting too much. Healthy, mature conflict is essential to the success of any team or organization. Now I know that I have to go mining for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost no content","review":"I read the book hoping I would get something from it like \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\". I got nothing from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meetings will never be the same","review":"The fact that most executives hate meeting is truly ironic as they are THE central activity in business. This book cleverly points out that if you are having bad meeting, you are likely making bad decisions. Lencioni's vivid fiction reveals his simple but slightly contrarian view of meetings. I havealready started to use the meeting structure with my clients. Thanks again Mr. Lencioni."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting take on meetings","review":"Easy read with a new angle on a boring subject. Meetings are not my favorite pasttime but this \\"story\\" is easy to read and makes having meetings sound almost fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death by book","review":"Terrible. With so many good, REAL stories out there, how could there ever be a market for a 'fable'? I should have read the fine print. This is not a true story, but instead, a made-up mess. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as his earlier works","review":"Meetings are a problem, but Patrick could have used the analogies from 5 Temptations or Obsessions. The story and model are stretched thin and lack the umph of his earlier works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheating Death","review":"I was assigned this book as a reading for my graduate school level, organizational communication course. I was not looking forward to reading the book, but once I began, I could not put it down (I finished it that same day). Lencioni creatively tells a story which shows the pitfalls of meetings, exploring the emotional dynamics of meeting participants, and the ways in which the we can cheat \\"Death by Meeting.\\" This should be a staple reading for any manager. It is a smooth, light read, with a summary of the main points at the end - great for inside the classroom and the working world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highlights Good and Bad Meeting Practices","review":"Patrick Lencioni highlights both good and bad meeting practices in \\"Death by Meeting.\\" Meetings are a central component of the day-to-day operations at most modern businesses, and this book addresses the \\"practice\\" of meetings in a direct, head-on and meaningful fashion.Some of my take-aways from this book were...meetings can be run poorly in many ways and the downstream effects of bad meetings are potentially significant and many.Written in Lencioni's \\"fable and Model\\" style, I found the Model for good meetings to be, in large part, useful. Different teams/organizations will likely need to modify the Model as put forth in this book to be most effective, but I found the overall framework to be quite useful.I recommend this book to anyone who spends some of their time in meetings...if nothing else, the book offers a refreshing and unique viewpoint of meetings in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"A meeting fable worth the reading","review":"Meetings have become a common disease in the business environment ... but there is a way out there.The book identifies the two major elements that make them really productive: conflict and structure.1) A meeting needs conflit among partecipants to be involving and to allow deep discussion of the actually important matters.2) Different structures are needed for different goals; not all the meetings are born equal.So, the book explains how to build drama in a meeting and 4 main types of meetings: the daily check-in, the weekly tactical, the monthly strategic and the quaterly off-site review.A good book with a remark: the book it is not so captivating at the beginning; if you are like me, keep reading until Part Four \\"Action\\" when the action starts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Patrick Lencioni read","review":"This is my 2nd book by Patrick Lencioni. This book was a fast read and was a story based on characters/scenarios about identifying the different types of meetings (compared meetings to television/movies), how long/often they should be held, what the agenda should consist of, etc. The author pretty much broke it down into:Daily Check in (Daily Headline News - 5 minutes)Weekly Tactical (Weekly Sitcom/Crime Drama - 60 minutes)Monthly Strategic (Movie not more than 2 items of topic to discuss - 2 hours)Quarterly Off-Site Review (Mini Series - 6 hours or more depending on agenda to cover)Great analogy of how meetings should capture the group and audience's interest in the first 10 minutes (again, comparing meetings to a movie or television show). I just got book #3 of Patrick's to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"How a 2 hour Meeting can be more appealing than a 2 hour Movie","review":"This is one of the better business books I have read for a few reasons. 1) It is a quick read. 2) It is an enjoyable read. 3) It touches a subject that applies to almost all of us. 4) It gives easy and implementable suggestions.It doesn't provide a PH.D. degree in meetings, but no business books do. As all books are giving you a push in the right direction, I believe that Patrick M. Lencioni is a champion in pushing hard, if not tackling us in the right direction.Also read his other books in this series. They are all great \\"one-flight\\" reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save your meetings","review":"This is a good book to give you suggestions on how to conduct effective meetings. Very good ideas that will work for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"I found \\"Death by Meeting\\" an excellent read. In this leadership fable, Patrick Lencioni delivers the message of the importance of meetings to a company's success. Lencioni does it in such a way that it's like you're reading a novel. I found this book to be a real page-turner and an eye-opener for how effectively run meetings and different types of meetings can transform a company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for learning the basics of a meeting","review":"This gives a great layout of the many meetings that take place in work places. For those who have managed or lead people and organizations for more than a few years it will be a review.I recommend it for any new manager or leader. The movie analogies work well too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, good price","review":"I like this filter a lot. Only problem is that it makes a bit of noise, but I think that is unavoidable. It does a nice job cleaning the air, and 1 micron is about as good as you're going to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Pocket filter is way too much money to replace","review":"I love the air filter unit, but the 3 pocket filter that captures the 1 micron stuff fills fast (better than in my lungs I know) but it is expensive to replace. The electrostatic filter, if you need one, can be found elsewhere for 15 bucks and not $50 so shop around! My other complaint about the unit is that you have to do some rigging to make it hang from the joists but it can be done. Be careful not to bend up the box when doing so though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable construction","review":"I received the purifier in its original box. Upon closer inspection, I discovered that the control panel had a crack through it and that the case was slightly compressed. This made filter removal and replacement very difficult (understatement)! I notified Amazon and they were great about sending another one out right away. The second one arrived in a reasonably pristine box. No cracks this time, but I noticed that the fan seemed to be sitting at a wierd angle. The machine would not run. My UPS service is usually pretty good so I have to wonder how sturdy the product is. The other thing I learned is that the CFM rating published can be deceptive as it depends on whether the filters are in place for the testing. The Delta numbers looked extremely good against the comparable JDS product and I suspect this is because of the filter issue. So....I ordered a JDS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Buy","review":"I just bought this unit. It arrived in perfect condition (other reviews I read complained of dents in shipment?), and is now hanging up in my garage. So far, I am quite pleased with the unit. It works as advertised, and the remote control is a big plus. The unit also allows you to program the unit to continue to run after you leave the shop (for up to 4 hours). Only thing I would change/add is velcro for the back of handheld remote (so you could stick it to the wall). I would give this unit 5 stars, but have only had for ~10 days, and am still evaluating it's performance, but so far, very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice unit, works well","review":"So far this seems like a good unit. Moves a lot of air and should do a good job in my wood shop. I just mounted it and have not had a chance to use it much but am confident it will clean the air as expected. I did have one issue with the product as received and cost me about and hour to trouble shoot and figure out the problem. When plugged in for the first time the unit did not receive power. After a little investigative work I figured out that the switch in the power cord had a bad solder connection. I re-soldered the connection and it is now working fine. One other issue I discovered was that florescent lights affect the remote control. I had to shroud the receiver eye on the unit from direct light in order for the remote to function properly. I think this will be a good purchase. I let you know more in a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good unit, arrived perfectly","review":"This unit works as advertised and arrived on time in perfect condition. Lost 1 star because it gets noisy and a vibrates at max speed. Overall highly recommended.

The replacement process with amazon was very easy to do online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Control Problems","review":"The design and features of this air cleaner are the reason that I ordered this unit for my shop. The quality control needs some help though. The first unit I received had a broken circuit breaker, even though the packaging was not damaged. I sent this unit back for a replacement, which I received in just a few days. The second unit was bad also. The squirrel cage fan was bent so badly (about 1/2\\" to 3/4\\" lateral runout)the unit jumped up and down on the bench the first time I turned it on! I'm sending this one back also. I called the Amazon.com help line and talked to a person that I could barely understand and was told they wouldn't send me another replacement.

It started tripping the internal thermal breaker and I could clearly smell the burnt windings in the motor. I believe somone else also had a similar problem with it. Save yourself the aggrivation and buy the Jet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine, but...","review":"The squirrel-cage fan was bent in shipping, either due to incredibly light construction, insufficient packing, or over-stacking during shipping. This causes the unit to vibrate, and to rumble at high speeds. The customer service were quite helpful, and it's a simple enough repair to make at home. Otherwise, this machine works very well. The controls and remote are clear and simple, and it is nicely made. It will probably serve my small shop for decades. The filters come from a different company, are very expensive, and take forever to ship. The remote should come with a bit of velcro so it can be attached to the wall forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge this book by its cover","review":"I will admit right off that the beautiful cover of this book caught my eye. Then I read the back - Picasso like painter and his muse, Provence, the French Resistance, and a love story! It sounded fantastic. It wasn't. I don't know if it is because I find the letter format tiresome to read or the unrealistic nature of these letters (describing things that the intended receipient would already know) or if it was the ludicrous attempts at eroticism and lyrical writing, either way - I could barely finish this book (a rare thing for me). I found the characters unbelievable, the situation annoying, and the big secret revealed at the end a terrible anticlimax. I want to give it away to save other readers from having to wade through this but I won't... email me if you want to know why he left Louise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soppy, sloppy love story","review":"A very disappointing read. The first part (before Louise joins the resistance during World War II), is written as if by an adolescent fantasizing about being an adult. I understand the final chapters are more interesting, but I just couldn't go on. I'm giving the book one star (rather than none) as a token of faith in Sanchez...who, this book notwithstanding, is a wonderful writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Premise, Poor Execution","review":"The premise of this book was great; the execution of that premise was simply dreadful. I did manage to finish, but it was a real trial.I thought it very believable that someone deeply in love would write passionate letters and then never mail them, if not mailing them was for the best during politically turbulent times. What I didn't buy was the fact that had the letters been real, the writer of those letters was telling the recipient things both of them already knew, things that were for the reader's benefit only. Shame on the author for making this very basic literary mistake!I found the writing in the book to be over-the-top in a dreadful (there is no other word to use) sort of way. It turned what was supposed to be several tragedies, actually, into an almost-comedy. Only the dark subject matter kept me from laughing out loud.I could write more, but let's just say this is one of the worst books I have ever read and let it go at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I am going to be honest about this book. I couldn't get past page 29. Oh, I tried, believe me, but it is just so laborious and contrived. I suggest that the reader look carefully at all reviews before opening this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An incredible disappointment.","review":"As a tremendous fan of Sanchez's previous books (\\"Mile Zero\\" is one of the best novels I've ever read), I was stunned by how bad this book is. This novel is incredibly overwrought and overwritten; at some points you feel like the author may be trying to parody the historical romance genre. While the plot is a strong one (there are some similarities to \\"Corelli's Mandolin) and the idea of a Picasso-like painter and his mistress seems as if it would work well, Sanchez can't pull it off (despite trying hard... painfully so). Perhaps this was his attempt to write something that might become an \\"English Patient\\" type film... as someone who really admires the author's previous work, I can only hope that \\"Day of the Bees\\" is an aberration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Day of the Bees","review":"I must admit I only read 1/3 of the book. I simply couldn't go on. The premise alone that someone would write these long, involved letters and never post them--not to mention that they went undetected following her death until the narrator happens along, was just too insulting to the reader. It brought to mind The Bridges of Madison County--another overly romanticized and maudlin tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Historical Book...","review":"This book is a nice historical reference, but some of the information is old or out-of-date.

When I received it I felt a little disappointed, because the book wasn't exactly what it seemed to be. Maybe it can have a value as an historical document, being the reprint of past Jane's editions (of wartime); but as such it cannot have what I instead expected to find, such as data about the war losses, the war construction (some navies are almost complete, some other expecially the Axis ones are not), and so on. It seems to be more an editorial operation than a true historical book about the argument; surely below the usual standard of the other Jane's books.

Jane's was formerly published by the English Fred T. Jane on an annual basis and as an annual was only as accurate as its contributing editors from each nation could be, i. e. they depended on official data released by the individual countries which tried to cover up as much as possible. Even in 1947, little was published on YAMATO and accurate information on the Axis navies was still rare. The author fails in his attempt to produce a compendium of WWII naval strength.

This means that you can only successfully use it to scoop right off the top of the litter (if you don't mind loosing some clean litter too). It scrapes the bottom of the box well, but again, is too shallow to scoop up (and out of the pile of litter) the clump that you scraped up.This scoop was cheap and might work better for someone else, but I think that my plastic scoops work better and were just as cheap...

No. Did she indulge in some elements of trite plot elements, earning her the judgment of some reviewers that this book was targeted at the young adult market? Yes. Did I really care? Nope.

There were enough familiar fantasy elements to keep the reader comfortable and enough new elements to entertain. I particularly enjoyed the eccentric Berry sisters and their world within a world.Though many of the elements were familiar they were woven into the story in such a way that they seemed to belong to the world. Except for her use of the Elves. Britain seemed to rely heavily on the Tolkienesque idea of Elves while at the same time creating a sharp deviation from the Tolkien myth. I believe the story would have been better served if she had recreated the race and made it more fully her own.However, in all I enjoyed the book. If you are looking for some light entertainment to while away an evening I would recommend this book.

You wont be able to put it down and when your supposed to be doing homework your going to be wanting to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading - no surprises.","review":"I liked the Green Rider very much - so much in fact that I read it several times. It is a fast \\"ride\\" through a standard fantasy story-line with lots of adventure, fights, and valor. There are many distinct characters, each with well done development. However, to the annoyance of some, the good characters are GOOD and the bad characters are BAD. I classify this book as \\"entertainment\\" (not terribly thought provoking) and as PG13."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT BAD AT ALL, FOR THE FIRST TIME OUT!","review":"Not as meatie as I'd like but definately an enjoyable read. The door is wide open for what could be a great saga. Having read Jordan, Eddings and Kerr, it's very hard to find a series to meet my expectations. Green Rider has definately peeked my interest. Here's hoping Britain takes the charactors to their full potential in the sequal. Too often we're let down in the second and/or third books. I'm keeping my figures crossed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you Start be prepared NOT to stop","review":"This was such a good book. It has been a LONG while since a book had \\"captured\\" my attention as this one had.

If I had to choose between reading this book and sitting in an empty windowless room staring at nothing for 12 hours, I would choose the book (but barely). I enjoyed this book very slightly but it wasn't anything special.The heroine had to keep getting rescued by completely random and poorly-prepared characters. She had to be saved 7 times through nothing of her own doing, it was pathetically funny. Everytime she got saved by someone else, I had to stop reading a distract myself from how random the rescue was.I did enjoy the basic plot though, so I gave this book 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Rating: Higher Than it Deserves","review":"I honestly can't understand how this book got such a high rating. That's not to say it's a bad book, It's not. Maybe it even deserves 3 stars. I'll admit the story was fast paced and somewhat enjoyable. But overall the plot was predictable and too simple. I can barely remember any of the characters (besides the main one) since there wasn't anything special about them, they were just there. Perhaps the people who enjoyed this book so much like a simple story, I prefer something a little more complex, something that will make me think..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happenstance","review":"I recommend this book only to pre-teens. It's not really bad - it would be an exciting read for a young girl. But it is being marketed as an adult book, and it is not. Many of the events are derivative of other youth classics - especially the Taran Wanderer/High King series of Lloyd Alexander and the Companions of Lackey. The plot moves only by strange things happening out of nowhere. Almost like the author said, \\"Gee. My heroine is stuck. Let's have a kindy person help her out.\\" This happens at least 5 or 6 times - by the end of the novel I was bored stiff and not too impressed by the heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are people thinking?","review":"I bought this book with the hope that it would be a great fantasy novel. One that would go on my shelf beside some of the best books of all time. Boy, was I wrong. This book was given such praise and recognition and I can only ask, \\"Why?\\" I found it boring, unoriginal, forgettable and a comlete and utter mess. The plot was dull and the storyline was slow. There were parts in the book that were so insignificant and boring that I literally had to tell to myself, \\"Keep reading, it will get better.\\" Wrong, again. It never improved! I only read it about two months ago and I can't even remember the main character or half of what happened. And believe me, I am a walking encyclipedia for books-good books! This book rightfuly deserves its one star. And a kick under the couch in my opinion. Save yourselves and read something where you don't have to strap the book to your face to keep your eyes on the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the good reviews!","review":"This is perhaps one of the worst fantasy books ever written and that's no small feat!The story is full of fantasy cliches and since the stories heroine and author are both involved in an undertaking in which they are ill equipped to handle the use of deus ex machina is used very liberally to rescue them both from the boring mess in which they find themselves.Skip if you are over 16 years of age or under but a kid with an IQ over 100"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Trite, clich'ed, utterly worthless.

I am highly anticipating the continuation of this series/epic/story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning read, despite the awful cover","review":"The publisher of \\"Green Rider\\" came up with a mawkish cover, suggesting a bodice-ripping story of Mills & Boon sentimentality...I am glad I managed to jump this hurdle. \\"Green Rider\\" is a stunning tale of fantasy which propelled me into a world of wondrous make-believe which I thought I had lost in my distant childhood.I could not put this book down. I have spent a week reading it, and the daily infusion of Kristen Britain's writing made it a truly joyous time. I slowed down my reading during the last third of the book to saviour the experience a little longer.It is a most suitable book for readers from 15-90."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you title a review?","review":"How do you title a review? There's nothing that hasn't been used before: 'great'- 'wonderful'- 'wow'-anyway, onto my review. I finished this book in 2 days- what a page turner! the only thing about it that I regretted was that it left so much hanging at the end; fortunately, the sequel cured that! Currently I can't get my hands on a copy of the sequel, and I have so many questions, like, What's going on with Karrigan and Alton? What's up with Zachary- does he love Karrigan? What's going on with Stevic and Laren? Will Karrigan be a Rider or not? (of course we all know what the answer to that will be.) But an author who doesn't leave anything hanging when the book has a sequel will not keep their audience captive. Gotta provide MOTIVATION for those lazy readers out there. Like me.FIVE STARS!!! This was an incredible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book to re-read many times","review":"I thought this book was fabulous! The characters were intrgueing, and the style of writing was smooth. I read it in one sitting, and i would recommend it to anyone who likes a fantasy story with finesse. Furthermore, it is left open ended.... maybe there will be a sequel! I hope so.... the basic events that occur in the story are the following: Karigan runs into a dying Green Rider(people who work for the king by carrying messages) and agrees to take his message to the king. As she rides along, she runs into all sorts of problems, from black magic to debauched old men. READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has it all!","review":"This book is similar to 'king of thrones' series by George RR Martin(one of my other favorites).

I rarely put it down & look forward to the next book in this fantastic series.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing book!","review":"This book made u feel as if u couldn't breath, holding your breath, wondering what was coming next. I wish it had gone on forever. I hope that there is a sequal coming that is just as exciting and just as long, because it would be so dissapointing if it was short. You feel for the characters, and u want to be that rider! Every name just seems to fit, everything is so complete that u want to go to this amazing place! Someone please tell me if there is a sequal!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriging","review":"This was altogether a very good book. The characters were well drawn and the plot was solid. Its the sort of book that makes you want to run out and take fencing lessons and what not. Ms. Britain does a very good job at bringing Karigan to life so you almost feel as if you are Karigan. I feel like I've been to the Green Cloak, Sacor City and Selium. The ending though I thought was odd. Almost nonconformist, and while I can understand that, I WANT MORE!!! I enjoyed this book very much and I want a sequel to tie up the loose ends because I am rapidly going insane. Not to say it incomplete, it's just I now feel like I know these characters and something is left to be desired. So I will now try to keep my sanity while waiting for another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, the only problem was it ended too soon.","review":"This was a great book, I couldn't put it down.

YOU WON'T REGRET IT !!!! I wish she would make a sequel.....Also check out David Eddings The Belgaraid and Mallorean (they are series) and you read the series belgaraid first then the mallorean.....also Piers Anthony's Xanth books, and Tamora Pierces series Lioness Rampant and The Immortals, read the Lioness series first....and Mercedes Lackeys Valdemar books, which include MANY series, and there is a timeline in EVERY book that tells you the first ones.....they are all worth the time...........TRUST ME !!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New author off to a great start","review":"I first read this book when I was in the 7th grade. It got me to start reading fantasy books. The main character Karigan, is a determined young girl with a passion for justice. that only wants to get home. She gets expelled from her school for winning a swordfight with a lord. She gets caught up with Green Riders, personal messengers of the king. This starts an adventure that captures you right from the start. Read this and join me in thinking that this the best book ever written by an author in the fantasy genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Debut Novel","review":"I think Kristen Britain did a great job with this novel. There were some predictable elements but overall a strong fantasy story. I was particularly enjoyed the fact Britain did not have Karigan find her one, true love in the story. That has gotten so old. The characters are strongly written and the writing action filled."},{"rating":"2","title":"love those swords","review":"My nine year old loved this book. She especially loved that the lead character is female. There is one part where Kerigan,(The lead), is attacked by a man who wants to do bad things to her. I edited that as I read. Nothing untoward does happen to Karigan though because Kerigan triumphs again. She does that a lot. The story was filled with action. We loved it. -johnson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable and it's not a comedy","review":"If you must buy another fanatasy book I would not suggest this one. Despite the praising reviews I thought it was a very uncreative book. Many of her ideas are a slightly changed version of those in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. For example, a brooch vs. a ring that turns the wearer invisible, horses with other wordly qualities, a race of beautiful people that are not human and who are known for their spellbinding singing, wounds that will never heal, a dark lord, and the list goes on. The author does have some original ideas, but they are clouded over by the many changed from Tolkien's trilogy. All in all I would not waste my money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This book had an interesting premise, but the writing is not very good, and the characterizations are sort of flat. I fell victim to the Locus ads that praised this as the most acclaimed fantasy debut of the year. What nonsense.

I will not read the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN OLDIE BUT A GOODIE!","review":"I love long fantasy books, and found this one to be quite entertaining.

It's not the worst I've ever read, but it is very rough and the writing clunks. The plot is not bad, and it is written in the same breathless style as Terry Goodkind's books, but without whatever it is the makes his stuff passable. Personally I prefer fantasy with more brain and less cliche [The Gray One, etc.] It would be nice to have a realism test when one buys a book--Marion Zimmer Bradley has crowned so many authors \\"the new Tolkien\\" and so many books \\"classics\\" that to me that is a sure sign that I will be disappointed. If it was more appropriately portrayed--\\"a good first offering by a new writer\\" or something like that, it would not cause so much eye rolling later on. Ad departments, take note--you oversold this one by a LOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immensely disappointing, formulaic, waste of time and money.","review":"While I admire the fact that Ms. Britain astually hammered out a complete novel, I am appalled at the amateurish, throw-away execution. Everything from the author's \\"voice,\\" to the dissonant dialogue, to the ugly sounds of most character and place names scream out that this book represents the nadir of fantasy writing in the modern age. Not everyone can be a Kay or Martin or Jordan, but it shocks me that this book was even published. I wish I could get my money back. Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very substantial","review":"Let me get this straight- this book is not so much bad as extremely unoriginal. I agree with all the points of a previous reviewer. This book is ok but only if you dont mind reading regurtitated versions of a whole bunch of other good fantasy novels. This book is clique after clique- no new ground is made and neither the characters or the places were interesting for me to really care about. This book is really your run of the mill, average overcliqued shelf filler. I suggest you avoid this one- you're not missing out on very much and read so truly excellent fantasy such as Sarah Ash's Tears of Artamon series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I bought the HC.","review":"This was the very first time I'd bought the HC of an unknown, and new author. It will be the last time that I do so. This author may or may not turn out to be someone you want to spend your money on, but right now she's not worth it. I'm surprised that the book was even published, but given the poor editing job no one looked that closely at the manuscript any way. She had a pretty good idea but that's about it. Her writing is hackneyed and cliched, there are no surprises here, the bad guys are obviously bad and the good guys are obviously justified in their dislike of them. I can't believe that this is the start of a series, there's nothing that makes me want to continue to follow the characters into another novel. If you want to try some newer authors that did a better job right out of the gate, try JV Jones, or Elizabeth Hayden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tosh","review":"This is a by the numbers fantasy written to a plot that has worked a hundred times.

It balances out to make a wonderful and very satisfying read. Karigan the heroine of this story is running off from school (after being expelled for winning a fight) and runs into the dying and soon dead green rider F'ryan Coblebay who after making sure of her loyalty passes his life or death message onto her. He warns her about the shadow man with his last breath and dies, but that's not the last we here of him; he follows Karigan afterwards as her ghostly protector and through thick and thin along with The Horse and other lovable characters (and even hateable ones) they make it to the king, but were they soon enough?

Unfortunately it is not the ideal book. Its flaws: (1.)the illustrations are too few and too damn small: you need a magnifying glass to see some of them!

Since Vaya Con Dios is European, many in the US have never had the opportunity to experience their unexpectedly uplifting, and yet completely captivating style of jazz/blues swing. Salted liberally with smokin' horns, Dani Klein's uniquely talented vocals, and great material, this CD flat rocks, and brings with it a very satisfying taste of something at least once removed from the usual musical fare found on radio these days...sample the cut title cut \\"Night Owls\\" if you like your swing a little on the hard side, or \\"What's A Woman\\" for a real lowdown wailin' blues lament.

Alas, the print was far from pristine and there seems to have been no effort to restore it. Also, aside from some trailers, there are no extras. They didn't even bother to add subtitles for people with hearing impairment--that's just wrong. I could understand this from a company that puts out cheap DVDs, but not from Kino.That being said, this is still a terrific, funny film and this is likely the best it will look. Don't let my disappointment with the Blu-ray put you off from seeing this classic. Carole Lombard is at the top of her game as a comedic actress and Frederic March works wonderfully with her.

Kelli Ali (Dayton) is awesome, and an (the??) essential component of my thorough enjoyment of Becoming X (which is nearly PERFECT [Spin Spin Sugar is the WORST of the album] and has remained in my personal top ten for a full ten years). Splinter left me feeling cold, empty and disappointed by comparison. I wasn't even aware that Kelli had been asked to leave the band when I purchased Splinter. You can only imagine my remorse when I inserted the newly purchased CD in my player. I suppose they were afraid they sounded too much like Portishead, etc., but they were much to be preferred, IMHO. I'm going to spare you the details of my personal opinion of Chris as a 'vocalist'.

While whatever her name was may have been a good singer, but it wasn't the worst thing in the world for her to leave the band by listening to this cd. I couldn't imagine this cd with the last singer. I am very impressed with the effects and instrument sound quality they had on this cd. The violin on this cd is real coo. The instruments they used sounds very diverse or heavily modified.

Upon receipt of this cream, I saw the ingredients included triethanolamine (TEA) and methyl- and propyl-parabens, easily investigated on the web by Googling the names. These ingredients have been identified in research as potential carcinogens. The TEA mimics estrogen, and thus, may also be a teratogen and mess up developing (embryonic) systems. Furthermore, mineral oil is one of the major ingredients of this rather expensive cream. So, back it goes! Mothers and grandmothers may have thought well of this cream, but they did not have the science then as we do now. I feel that the manufacturer's lack of disclosing the ingredients on the website is an attempt to deceive unaware buyers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried this one prior to Neutrogena....not happy about it..","review":"Eb5 cost a lot more and I did not see any difference in my skin.

It is extreemly well writen and is worth reading more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to understand","review":"I admit it: I bought this book for its beautiful cover. But when I started reading I found the contents to be quite tough.Gould's Book of Fish tells the story of Billy Gould, a convicted criminal in the penal colony Sarah Island in Tasmania. He is quite a decent painter and therefore is allowed to paint fish for the doctor instead of doing tough manual labour. Billy Gould tells the story of life in the penal colony: the megalomanic commander, the scientifically obsessed doctor, the sadistic guard and in particular the enormous sufferings that the prisoners have to go through and the way in which the white people treat the indigenous population.This is not a book for the fainthearted and the impression the book left on me was that the main character becomes more and more crazy as the book progresses. At the end I had completely lost track, but maybe this is a book that should be read in one go as opposed to the several days it took me to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative writing at its best","review":"This book was described to me by a friend as 'terribly sad' so I was a little tentative in buying it. Very quickly i found myself immersed in a wonderfully imaginative work with the added bonus of being set in Australian convict history.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to anyone that loves a more prosaic writing style and a creative twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Tedious","review":"I'm reading this book for one of my book clubs and am about 70 pages in so far. It's been a dreadful experience thus far and I'm thoroughly discouraged by the other reviews I've read here that loved the first 100 pages and thought it got boring after that. If I wasn't reading it for a club, I would have put it down long ago and I never do that.Flanagan just rambles along, perhaps trying to get the reader to understand the state of mind of the obviously insane narrator, but I find it merely tedious. I am not a fan of writers who are more interested in style than story. That is not to say a novel has to be written in a straightforward manner, but it should not be complicated just for the sake of being complicated. Read \\"Naked Lunch\\" by William S. Burroughs if you feel the need to read a complex, convoluted book in which the use of an awkward style complements the story.I will be surprised if anyone in my book club actually finishes this horrid book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZzzzzzzz.....","review":"I have not even read 100 pages and am about to put it down for good.

Artists are, not so slowly, ripping our civilisation to pieces to replace it with a defiled, sad, empty, nothingness.The psychophantic, cliche ridden, picture of Aboriginals is almost 'de rigour' for modern artists and is the only uplifting picture in the book. Everything else points downwards and the glowing reviews from all the major papers points to a general demise.It does what a lot of modern literature does to me, it hangs a lead weight on my soul.Another bright brother in the gutter who's mind has never looked up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING","review":"A book clearly not about fish, Flanagan explores the theme of the defined rarely do the defining. The story line is that of a forger sentenced to a prison island. From there the reader is then taken through a laberynth of deceptions. The tale is engaging, but far more to the point you begin to see your own world more clearly. How do you get your news, your history, your facts....?

This book should be titled, \\"Ghosts of WEST 42nd Street\\" because it just about completely ignores 42nd Street east of 6th Avenue.That said, Anthony Bianco's \\"Ghosts of 42nd Street: A History of America's Most Infamous Block\\" is a welcome departure from the spate of books about 42nd Street that seem to come out at a rate of one a month. Mr. Bianco's approach is all-encompassing, not just focusing on the crime or the theater, the squalor or the glamour. There is an encyclopedic amount of information here, as he spans the decades. And yet, the book is very compressed and easy to get through. Mr. Bianco's writing is very fluid.The cast of characters is familiar, as are many of the anecdotes. However, there are plenty of tales that will surprise the reader, even one that is very familiar with the history of this piece of midtown real estate.

You can hear *eek* *eek* *eek* from the floor nearby.We replace it about every 3-4 months when the stuffing starts dribbling out and the fur gets all nasty.

I have Homer, which from what I can tell, is the same as Harvey.I have the deluxe edition, which is very big. I like Kyjen's line of toys because they're cute and fun. My six month old labrador pup loves his Ginormous Gator and his tail-bait toy made by Kyjen so I decided to find more toys for him.The noise this toy makes is unbelievably funny. It's a low-toned squeal that sounds very hedgehog-esque. It's also shakeable for a rattle sound effect. However, beware that if your puppy is a tough chewer, he/she will chew through this cute toy in a few hours. My puppy began pulling out Homer's fur coat. This cute toy is almost bald thanks to the misbehavior of my rough puppy.Anyways, overall good toy but not very durable. This is definitely for older dogs who aren't still teething and know when not to be too rough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dog toy EVER!","review":"My large dog absolutely LOVES this toy.

Its big and different from my Golden's other toys and it makes a really unusual sound, not a squeak but a honk, if you will.The problem came when my Golden took to destroying it and eventually ripped out the honker.

It's a cute toy that makes multiple noises and you can tell that was particularly incensing to the dog and made him love to chew on it even more. But seriously, 30 minutes is all it took before I had to throw the thing out. I have an English Bulldog and he has very strong jaws, so if you have an animal that loves to chew and is strong don't buy this toy. It will not stand up to it. May be fine for a Chihuahua."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as sturdy as other Kyjen toys","review":"We buy Kyjen toys almost exclusively because they last longer and are much better made than most other dog toys. We have a small dog and although he does like to chew on his toys, he is not a crazy chew machine, and Kyjen toys normally last at least three months before he is able to destuff them. We purchased Homer to replace another Kyjen hedgehog that we had purchased at PetCo (the previous one was two shades of gray, and not as brown as Homer, and also had no grunter). The other hedgehog lasted a super long time. Our dog ripped Homer open at a weak seam within 10 minutes, and pulled out the grunter and the rattle. We stitched him back together, and expect him to last a little longer, but we were VERY disappointed in the quality of this particular Kyjen product.Maybe we just got a lemon, but we will be much more likely to purchase Kyjen toys in the store instead of on Amazon so that we can check the seams first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for extreme chewers","review":"The description of this toy was a bit misleading; it's listed as a large toy, but it's actually quite small.

It's sad that people didn't give this a chance. I actually prefer the American version over the West End one.

He is a struggling actor and loses his job... along the way he meets a pretty girl in an ice cream shop who sleeps with him and and another woman who likes some album he liked.Thats the whole damn plot... it sounds as boring as it really is. I think I laughed, or should say, kinda lightly chuckles maybe 2 or 3 times during the whole movie. And the ending of the whole thing is just terrible.

I found my answer in the director's commentary. The writer, director, star has alot of very good friends who acted in and contributed the funds to produce this film. Don't expect entertainment, romance or comedy. The story is largely autobiographical and depressing. Sarah Silverman's character seduces and then dumps the protagonist. She was just curious because she had 'never made it with a fat guy'. I enjoyed the commentary much more than the film. There are many familiar faces among the cast and the acting is good.

Since we are currently doomed to deal with this phenomenon 3 times a year, it pays to brush up on the meaning of Mercury Retrogrades and find as many positive ways to deal with it as possible. I think astrologers will find Chrissie's book particularly handy because it has tables in the back for quick reference and it tells each Sun Sign how to survive!

It is demanding work to write about Mercury Retrograde and I think Chrissie has done a great job!."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"I have to disagree with the last reviewer. I have also read Therese Francis' book on this complex subject, and liked it.

Blaze covers a lot more ground, such as practical ways to survive Mercury Retrograde for each of the Sun signs. I also have given this book as a gift to many people, as it is a really attractive looking book, rather than the Ms. Francis book, which is more of a booklet.

There's lots of dancing and somebody gets married in the end. Even though the story is familiar, the dialogue has more bite and authenticity than most American films of the same type, such as It Happened One Night. The music helps to build the drama to its finale in which the heroine suffers the depths of sadness and despair for having discovered a real love and lost it. But the entire production is worth it for the dance scene in the first half of the picture. There is nothing remotely like it in American movies. Words cannot describe it and the combination of instruments, voice, and movement become hypnotic before it is finished.

I love religious history, especially of the reformation. I love the stories of Wycliffe and Tyndale, and the books I have read about them I couldn't put down. This DVD lacks the intrigue and suspense of the story. I fell asleep about two-thirds of the way through it. The date says 2004, but it appears to be much older. I think that must be the date that the DVD was released, and probably it was actually filmed in the 80s (just my guess). The background music is very annoying. (An attempt, I think at using period music, but it doesn't work for setting the tone and emotional feel of the film.) Maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought this would be of the same caliber as the recent Luther DVD starring Fiennes.

Having had to read it for my International Economics class I found it fascinating and it really opened my eyes to some of the shocking realities around me. Having grown up in the 90's when the economy was chugging along, I never expected it to stop. I grew up in a microcosm of excess. Never would I wince at dropping $80 for a pair a jeans I had in several other finishes. I attended a pretigious university at the tune of $30,000 per year without hesitation, thinking the drop in the economy was surely short term and I would be in no tough spot to find a high paying job upon my graduation. Now I have begun to understand that may not be the case, and the economy really never was as great as everyone thought. I think this book is an excellent piece for my generation to examine."},{"rating":"1","title":"The content of the book is OK but not suprising!","review":"This is one of many books that Krugman has written for many years.Although,it is a good book,but the issues has a long gone.What he suggested on overcoming Asian Crises is not a new thougt.But for people who interested on Keynesian type of analysis,this book can be added as your reference.Have an enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printing money causes inflation","review":"I read the excerpt.

His style is insufferable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant Nonsense","review":"This book is an example of what happens when high intelligence is mixed with blind emotion and ideology. Krugman is a political hack with \\"an ax to grind\\" against market capitalism. He offers no valid statistical analysis to support his wild theory that government spending and regulation can save the U.S. economy. All past experience shows, unequivocally, the opposite to be true. In fact, Krugman is waging a war on reality, rejecting financial facts and human nature. Government intervention harms economies and leads to stagnation and costly bureaucracy that grows uncontrollably like a cancer, until the \\"patient\\" dies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will He Give Back The Money To Defrauded Enron Investors?","review":"Krugman served on the advisory board at Enron in 1999 during the Clinton Administration. During that period, Enron was getting many Ex Im bank loans rubber stamped. Enron became a regular on the Ron Brown Commerce Department flights to drum up business overseas. The flights were obviously a pay for play deal. During this period, Enron was also shoveling $3 billion or more into the Dabhol power plant in India. Enron owned 65% of the plant but it became a black hole and was one of the straws that finally broke Enron's back.If we are headed towards a depression as Mr. Krugman opines then it may have a lot to due with corrupt crony capitalism and fraud. Mr. Krugman should have given us more information on what he actually did at Enron. He wrote a lot of articles about the Enron fraud but he always left out how he was on an advisory board at the company."},{"rating":"2","title":"There was way to few of these books studying at the University!","review":"Absolutely brilliant!

I read extensively in many different subjects, but I especially enjoy historically based non-fiction and fiction. This book was excellent and provided a personal view of a very tragic event. I am also from Idaho and find it interesting how the state's agrarian and mining histories continue to provide a rich background for Idaho which remains true to its old west roots. Reading this book while having already been deployed to Iraq for 8 months provided me with a wonderful mental trip home to a state that I love. Gregg Olsen must have done extensive research because he captured the flavor of the state and its people with expert percision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"\\"Boring\\" is a difficult word to apply to a tale of disaster of this order of magnitude, however, I could not and cannot think of a more appropriate one. This is a story that could have properly been condensed to a nice 8-10 page magazine article but instead was stretched out interminably. The only element of \\"mystery\\" about the whole affair pertained to the cause of the fire under the unlikely circumstances of occurring in a hard rock mine. By the time the \\"mystery\\" was revealed it was difficult to restrain a \\"so what\\" attitude. The pace and course of the narrative, in spite of dating and timing each chapter was erratic and stacatto. I finished the book with difficulty only because I live in the area and had paid for it.

After that I looked for something more modern and metal. I was quite impressed by Mean Machine! Eight of the ten songs made it onto my I-pod.

The ending sounds like he's moving through glue. We're talking about the Apocolyptic symphony here, you know horses, fire, brimstone....Celibidache kills any sense of urgency with his tempo choices (as a side note Haitnik's attempt with the Concertbouw is ENTIRELY too fast). Somewhere right down the middle is better, urgent but not rushed. Look to Maazel/Berlin, Bohm/Vienna, or Wand/Berlin for reference recordings of this.

Winds in particular are snaggly, the percussion sometimes inaccurate...the same problems Knappertsbusch had to deal with years earlier in recording Bruckner with the MPO.We can be glad though that Celibidache at least got this orchestra--if he'd have had to do this in Italy with one of the atrociously overworked RAI orchestras, which are contemporary music specialists to boot, the results would probably have been more uneven.All told, though, this is a worthwhile release, highly enjoyable, and a dynamic testament for the interpretative insight of a wonderful conductor."},{"rating":"1","title":"S....L....O....W.","review":"I've listened to plenty of recordings of this symphony. For me the Karajan VPO recording might be the favorite. This performance drags so severely, especially in the last two movements, that the music loses all forward momentum. The sound and playing are agreeable enough, but the interpretation is truly eccentric. The remainder of the recordings in this Celibidache/Munich series are slower than the norm, but not to this extreme degree, and do deserve repeated listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but has problems","review":"I gave these as a gift for my father.

A movie in which women are real, sexual people who are kind to each other, and in which men are really vapid - there was no such representation in culture in 1963. It was a \\"Mad Men\\" world.On the other hand, I notice than a man wrote the movie, and that no women have reviewed the film yet.

This was our second coleman air mattress we have purchased. Very dissatisfied and will never buy another coleman air mattress. We were so excited when we found this air mattress because coleman said the air mattress was guaranteed not to leak. But we have learned otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"coleman raised airbed","review":"I was so excited to try this airbed on our camping trip. But......it was a total disaster. Who ever designed this obviously didn't try sleeping on it. There are not enough separate cells in this mattress so it is one mass of air. Since my husband weighs more than me: he sank into the mattress and I was on a higher bump. After one night of sliding to the low side, my husband slept on the tent floor after that. I threw the mattress away when i got home,Its a great idea, to bad it wasn't designed more carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissatisfied customer","review":"On June 7, 2012 I ordered and received the Coleman Double-High Queen mattress. We had one for many years and were more than satisfied with its performance. We needed a new one and found it on this site. We did not unroll the mattress until we needed it while on vacation last week. It has a huge hole in the middle of the mattress! I cannot believe the poor, unacceptable quality control of the Coleman company! This had to be inspected at some point! To say that I am dissatisfied is putting it mildly! I would NOT recommend this product to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I had a Coleman air mattress that was 6 years old and never leaked. Since it was getting old, I decided to buy a new one. This one would not hold air no matter what. We used it for a week of camping and would fill it before going to bed. By the time we woke up it would have lost a significant amount of air. This happened every night. They sure don't make them like they used to. I would not recommend this item to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe this didn't leak!","review":"I purchased this for a house guest, and after the initial fill of air, we did need to add a bit more the next day. The directions explained this was normal and doesn't mean it is leaking it is just the initial stretch of the plastic. And boy were they right we did not have to add any more air the rest of the week. The valve was amazing. I'm used to the kind that leak a little before you put the cap back on, but this on you just push in so it eliminates the air from escaping. I can't wait to camp with this bed!Update 8/23/2012 .... Ok so it has been almost 9 months and this bed is going strong! It is great!! We have taken it camping quite a few times and after the first night we do need to add a bit more air, but still no leaks!

Now I'm using it until I can afford to get a new \\"real\\" bed. It's really comfortable! It is adjustable as far as firmness - plenty firm for me. I have sciatica and this has not aggravated it. And unlike my last Coleman inflatable double high queen, the sheets actually STAY PUT ON THE BED and don't slip off! The old model has 4 clips that are supposed to hold the sheets on, but I could never figure out how to work them, so my sheets came off at the corners every night. I think that is why it deflated, I think the cat got feisty in just the right spot. Hoping she doesn't pierce this one... I put 2 mattress pads on it, hoping that helps prevent cat damage. It inflated very quickly with the pump, and deflated just as well when we moved it from room to room. My sheets fit very nicely on it, no issues there. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable Durable Bed","review":"We bought this air mattress for our guests and it is very comfortable.

I think this mattress is a lot more comfortable for a single sleeper vs 2 people. There's a bit of a waterbed feel to it - say if the other sleeper moves, you do get jostled. It's a heck of a lot easier to get out of though, vs the single height mattress. Note: it eats up the battery of my rechargeable pump...and it was difficult to get all the air out on that charge. I did not find that the mattress deflated at all (we've now camped a total of five nights with it.) In fact, I have had to deflate it a bit before going to sleep because I felt it had too much air in it. Despite the downfalls, I will continue to use this mattress and would purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!!","review":"I've used this several times now and it has been really great! I purchased the Coleman quickpump to go with it, and it will air up or deflate in about 3 minutes. It's very easy to set up or roll away, and it's very comfortable to sleep on!

Both failed after about 1 month of nightly use with only one person sleeping on the bed. I tried to patch the beds, but the patchs failed after a few days. Neither bed was abused in any way. In light of the first failure, I was especially careful with the second bed, but it failed the same way in about the same length of time as did the first bed. The seam split where the oval sections are attached to the top. All the air leaked out quickly.

Unfortunately, it also lacks a 1/8\\" headphone port that the Micport Pro and X2U have (including volume control for the headphones) which means there is no way to monitor input real time without using your PC's headphone port and its associated latency. Some would consider a real time headphone port essential, including me. The ART also requires AC adapter power, unlike the previously mentioned USB devices powered through the USB port. This and its size makes the ART a little cumbersome if you have to record \\"on the go\\" (away from studio/home). On the plus side, it does \\"warm\\" the finished product for voice recording and is very easy to use. I'd have given it five stars if it had had a headphone port and volume control.

The fit is extremely loose, to the point that you will need to do something to ensure the cables remain plugged.

The main character is a Swiss pastor who seems to know everything, and his wife and three boys. When their boat is terribly shipwrecked, they build rafts and set their course for a nearby island. The story is about their adventures on the island. Never of less, the youngest boy is very charming and in no part in the story is it sad.

However, it has a few weak points. These include the family eating some things that do not taste good and cause problems (for example: acorns, which tasted like \\"chestnuts\\") and them being able to shoot just about anything and kill it. In reality, if you shot a lion with a slow moving lead ball, it would cause lots of damage, but the lion would still be able to run a little ways and attack or charge. The good points are numerous too. The character developments throughout the book are excellent and the fact that there were pirates in the region is accurate.

What a mistake. The callous slaughter of animals is really sad. The combination of plants and animals from around the world is ridiculous. The story line is weak. And I can recall of only one time where \\"the mother\\" is referred to by her given name. This is the only book that we've read that did not have my children begging for \\"just one more chapter, please!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not like Survivor","review":"The movies that have been made based on this story were much more interesting and fun. Most of this book is about the shipwrecked father and sons finding and killing animals, fish, reptiles and anything that appears. The wife is always referred to as \\"my wife\\" or \\"the mother\\" and never mentioned by name. Her purpose is to prepare all the food that is brought to her, grow a garden, sew, and not much else. The father seems to be an encyclopedia of knowledge. Every thing they find, he seems to know what it is. They lack for nothing on this island. There is very little adversity in the story to make it interesting. If you want to be more entertained, watch Survivor. It is much more fascinating than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning!","review":"I want anyone else who is considering ordering this book toknowthat this version is severely abridged. All references to the family's faith in God are removed, as well as other description. This may or may not be what you are looking for, but it does completely change the character of the story.

If you are going to advertise a classic, you should publish the original unabridged version. Otherwise what's the point. I got taken in because I figured the series would respect the books. It was beautifully produced and a quality product for a mere physical object, but I felt totally ripped off when I opened it to see that it was NOT the original book.

Go out and buy the unabridged version right away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to our expectations.","review":"This reading of The Swiss Family Robinson was not a true representation of the book. It was abridged down so far that it became more of an overview. Several of the basic facts from the book were switched around for no apparent reason and the general theme of faith in God and strong values brought out in the book are all but ignored in this rendition. The other complaint we had was the actual reading of this abridged version. For an actor we found him extremely lacking in zeal and extremely monotone. It was almost comical how he could read the exciting bits with so little inflection. The musical interludes and background were good. It was a good overview in general, even if the facts were messed up. I would only recommend this to someone, however, if the integrity of the original manuscript means nothing to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"What are the Robinson's going to kill tonight?\\"","review":"I read this with my 8 year old daughter.

Where in the world can you find Kangaroos, Antelope, Grizzly bears and condors without being in the St. Louis Zoo? This became stupidly funny and neither of us could take any of the book seriously. We finished it just to see how it ended. Even without the killing and impossible aminals it would have been dry and boring from the never ending descriptions of plants discovered and rigging gadgets from stuff they found, which is why Disney added Pirates to their version.

They had me eating 1,069 calories a day. I can eat however I want and lose weight on that amount. A person has a basic set of calorie needs just to live. You add on top of that your caloric needs for your activity level. Then you either exercise alot or cut back no more than 200 calories a day. This book is a joke. I suggest that you research this and go with the PR Bar company. Its a 40-30-30 plan also but they detail it to your weight, height and activity level.

She recounts back stage happenings, and let's you in on little known facts about these great musicals. She takes a more personal look at Bob Fosse, but at times can get lost in a dreamy yearning for yester year.(But who wouldn't!) I recommend this book to anyone who has a career in theatre or dance, as it is a truthful look at a successful gypsy's life. I have had the pleasure of working with the author in a touring show when she was writing this book, and have watched it's progress. Margery has done the theatre communtiy a tremendous favor by preserving this up-close and personal look at Bob Fosse, and his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I am sad to say that the LOVELY MARGE BEDDOW..passed away this afternoon....read her wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space-Saver!","review":"These sleeves look quite flimsy but theyr eally hold up nicely.

Now THAT'S economic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD sleeves!","review":"For the price, I was expecting to receive those flimsy soft plastic sleeves (like you see in CD carrying albums). I was pleasantly suprised to find that these are much higher quality. They are made of a flexible, firm plastic with a black felt-paper insert in the middle so that you can place two separate CDs in each sleeve with each CD being protected. They seem very durable, much more so than the hard plastic CD cases that come with regular CDs (which crack at the slightest drop). These are also much lighter and thinner than regular CD cases. I am able to fit two sleeves (4 CDs) in the same space on my CD tower as one single regular case.I burn CDs regularly. Using the Adaptec Easy CD Jewel Case creator, I can print a \\"front cover insert\\" and it fits perfectly inside the sleeve with the CD itself.I think these are a great value, and an excellent add-on when buying a CD-R spindle (like from Memorex)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Dance Album you'll need!","review":"I love this album!

While I have been a Christian for many years, there were parts of the good news that were obscured for me by our cultural biases and some of the teachings I grew up with. Dallas goes to the heart of the message that Jesus taught about the Kingdom of Heaven and explains it in a way that makes sense. Since reading this book, I have been able to relax into God's plan for my life. God used this book to talk to me directly. My advice to every Christian is to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Read . . . Ever","review":"Willard's style is not for the faint of heart. He is a philosophy professor, after all. That makes for a very precise, every-word-counts style. So prepare to take some time to work through this. But here's the deal: You will be MASSIVELY rewarded.'The Divine Conspiracy' is quite simply the richest book on the spiritual life I've ever read. Willard walks through the Sermon on the Mount in a way that makes it absolutely come alive. After reading this, you realize Jesus was, indeed, 'the smartest man who ever lived.'This book changed the way I look at life and the way I live my life. It would be incredibly difficult for me to string together enough superlatives to do this book justice; so I won't even try. Just know that a careful reading of this book is likely to transform you in incredibly significant ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not hype but real discipleship","review":"The Divine Conspiracy, along with Dr. Willard's other books, is one that every Christian should read at least once, and refer to zillions of times. It's not entertainment or hype,as some reviewers, apparently, would have liked. Neither is Dr. Willard trying to win some kind of popularity contest. What he does so faithfully and eloquently, is show the reader what discipleship looks like by examining the words of Jesus. He compels us to walk with the living Christ, learning from Him how to walk, talk, think--how to live. Dr. Willard causes us to re-examine our understanding of what it means to be \\"saved\\", to be a follower of Jesus, and to be a Christian. I approach Dr. Willard's books knowing that he will provide pearls of wisdom and I am so very grateful and encouraged to him for his work and his example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way above my reading comprehension level","review":"When I came across this book I couldn't wait to get it and read it b/c it addressed a lot of things I have always wanted to understand better about the character of God.

I still hope to finish reading this book someday (or get the abridged audio version) because I think it's a brilliant piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!!","review":"I've only read up through chapter 3, and I am astounded by the truths that I've found. This book has implications of the most profound sort regarding how Christians view their world and live their lives.And in response to an earlier reader who said the book contained \\"life-giving pearls of wisdom found in 100 other books,\\" the author himself said in his preface that there is nothing \\"new\\" in his book. It contains insights that others have written about for centuries. However, I have personally never read a book that has taken all of those insights and woven them together in a such as thought-provoking, life-changing, convincing whole as this book has. I unreservedly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"This book gives you so much to think about that it must be read at least twice to get the full measure of what the author is explaining.

I have already started re-reading the last two chapters where Willard gives the best advice I've ever come across on how we are to \\"live in the Kingdom.\\" You will be challenged by The Divine Conspiracy - it is not an easy read. However, it is also generous, gracious and quite possibly life transforming. It has been a blessing to me and is now my number one recommended book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely and Theologically Sound","review":"I was impressed with this book because it answered so many questions regarding society today and how our ways-of-life fit in with the old \\"do and do-nots,\\" especially the attitude on divorce, which is frowned upon in Paul's letters. The author's perspective is that the Lord would not want persons to stay in abusive marriages, particularly where the partner and children are being physically or psychologically hurt. The author still stands for the \\"make marriage work\\" ethic, yet recognizes that sometimes there is no other alternative. There are other instances that flash a modern light on some of the old statements; interpretations that help us to continue to be strong Christians in this modern age. I think it is a wonderful book, and one I can share with those who aren't sure if they really fit in with a Christian traditional church. This books makes it clear that they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable, Powerful, Important","review":"The divine conspiracy is destined to become a classic for thoseseeking to understand the nature and heart of God. The book ismasterfully written, combining humour, theology, and philosophy seamlessly into a tapestry that leaves the soul breathless.

DON'T MISS IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Willard cuts through religious speak to Jesus' easy yoke!","review":"The easy yoke, OH! That's what You meant! Duh! What can you say when you have been a \\"Christian\\" since you were thirteen, studied at one of the country's best \\"evangelical\\" universities, challenge and question everything along the way and wake-up at 42 realizing how little you really UNDERSTAND (but you've got a lot of the \\"right\\" answers)? Willard so gently, yet so precisely, retools thinking about things muddled by years of warring, doctrinal-headed Christianity. Bible passages that made no sense, particularly words spoken by Jesus, now do--Jesus was a really brilliant guy. Here, Jesus rises afresh. And that Jesus compels me to come, follow Him in ways I either ignorantly missed these years, never heard, or wasn't ready for, likely all three. From one poor hungry beggar to another, this is the Good News, food for the savagely hungry soul. Eat. Enjoy.

It's one of the few Christian books that I can honestly say has left me thirstier for Him than I was before. It's a \\"hearty stew\\" of a book that fills you up with the goodness of God, alerts you to the knowledge of the depravity of man, and sets us firmly on the utter reality of the present hope of Christ. Don't try to read this book fast. Let it sink in...it might actually take you months to finish it. But it's worth it, and is a satisfying accompaniment as you live your life...because that's what Jesus is really concerned about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"The Divine Conspiracy: Rediscovering Our Hidden Life In God by Dallas Willard is a book that teaches you how to live as a true disciple of Christ.

The plot is a little slow getting started but picks up very well. My problem is not with the story but rather the lack of Kindle proof reading. I did not have a problem with the fact that initally the hero was a Captain and later said he was a Major. My problem comes from the fact that in many cases people's names started in lower case, not once but throughout the book. The other thing I noticed was the number of time I became 1.

A marvelous CD, beautifully performed and recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I did not feel that this recording gave any flavor of a good production of Anything Goes. The one section that bothered me the most was the shortened \\"I want to row on the crew\\" jammed together with a short section of \\"Sailor's Chantey\\". Why did they do this? Also I was not impressed with the rendition of Blow, Gabriel, Blow. Perhaps I would have appreciated this CD more had I seen the revival from which it was taken, but as a stand alone it is lacking. The new Roundabout theater revival with Sutton Foster and Joel Gray pleases me more; but then I saw the show three times so perhaps I am biased. The liner notes for the Lincoln Center production do provide the lyrics to the songs and a plot summary, which is nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Oldie","review":"Music from the great Cole Porter still packs a wollop.

First, they are VERY hard to squirt. I have a hard time filling them with water and squirting them; needless to say, my preschooler can't do it. Second, they don't float well. The one of Dora on a seahorse just falls over to the side and sometimes is upside down. Because of these, my son (who is a rabid Dora fan) doesn't seem to enjoy them or even play with them.

I picked up a volume that had fallen to the floor, read a few pages, and fell in love. Her writing is concise, vivid, and full of powerful imagery, while her language is still accessible to the average reader. It does help to know a little Irish history: e.g., you can't fully appreciate the Granuaille poems without some background on their heroine (go to any Ireland guidebook and look up \\"Grace O'Malley\\"), but, if you know the story behind them, they're immensely moving.

Forget the predictable criticism that this band wears their influences on their sleeves; I dare anyone to find a more sweet, wistful, utterly listenable album from 1995, or from any year in the past decade. Favorite tracks are the sublime \\"High Tide,\\" the peppy \\"Tidal Wave,\\" the dreamy \\"Pine Away,\\" and most importantly \\"She's Just Like Me\\" which is one of the truly beautiful songs of our era. Highly, highly, highly recommended. If great bands like this can come out of Denver who knows what other geniuses lurk between the overhyped coasts?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for temporary weight loss","review":"Works great if you need to lose a temporary 10lbs really fast, prefect if you are trying to make weight for an event.

But take one listen to the album and then listen to the radio and you'll see they are one of the only remedies. They are one of the best unknown powerpop acts the US has produced. With well-written, fun songs and excellent musicianship Poole truly aims to please. This album is a must buy for anyone who enjoys great power packed pop songs with clever lyrics and a sense of humor. They are also some of the nicest guys in the biz (one of the few bands I know of who will answer their e-mails and keep in contact after they answer your question)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"No matter what kind of music you like, this is one CD that will satisfy you. You can't help but to be put in a good mood with the upbeat tempo and catchy hooks on Alaska Days. This CD should be the standard to which all future indie power pop should measure itself against. Start to finish (with maybe the exception of \\"Snowsicle\\") this is one CD that never has any tracks skipped over on my CD player. Personal favorites are \\"Supermerica\\", \\"Strawberry Kool-Aid Smile\\", \\"Si\\" and \\"Mary Shakes Her Hair\\". Also, as said before in a previous review, Poole also puts on a great live show. Lotsa fun - especially if Harry is in a good mood (which he usually is). If they're still doing it, try to request their cover of The Housemartins \\"Me And The Farmer\\".

Norvex 7 is a professor of Earth studies on a planet known for its cosmic fabulosity, and he travels to Earth accompanied by one of the most famous hairdressers in the galaxy. He and his friends are stunned by America's bland fashion sense, and eventually come to San Francisco, where they find some relief. Norvex crosses paths with Chester, a gay goth teen with poor self-image but excellent fashion sense, and the two spark a galactic incident with their torrid affair. Like all excellent camp, this is delightfully sprinkled with smart and sassy observations on culture and life. I had some trouble at first getting into it, but it certainly drew me in as I went deeper into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but...","review":"...for the same amount of money you can get the Columbia Enclyclopedia, twice as many pages.

Most of them are only 50 to 100 words in length. And rather than pick and choose some topics to explore in more depth, the editors decided to give everything shallow coverage.Worse, they don't even use those few words per entry wisely. Instead of giving the essential facts, they go for obscure details that will only mean something to people who are already familiar with the subject. This defeats the purpose of a general-use encyclopedia -- to introduce a subject and give the reader some basic understanding. Even my paperback New American Desk Encyclopedia surpasses this work by that standard, though it has less entries.I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Clannad","review":"This was my first Clannad album and I think it makes an excellent introduction to both the band and celtic music.

It may be fascinating for those \\"in the know\\" concerning his association with the Violet Quill, but for the the 99.99% of us... who cares?

I loved \\"Like People in History\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, with some caveats","review":"I found this book totally absorbing; stayed up all night to finish it. Some reviewers think it's a roman a clef, but the inside stuff is lost on us Philistines. I thought the book was put together well and the ending is a stunner! However, Mr. Picano should know that he is poorly served by his publisher. The book is filled with typos (possessive it's; O'Henry for O. Henry, etc.) and was so poorly copy-edited that readers are unnecessarily slowed down. He's a good enough writer to deserve one of the major publishers, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much maligned novel","review":"Forgive us for not respecting history, Mr Picano. At least reading the other reviews of THE BOOK OF LIES would indicate that this tome of thinly disguised literary history would seem to indicate that Picano has failed to meet his own high standard. Read this book again, as an insight into why the Violet Quill Club remains important in American genre writing, accept the sometimes repetitious meanderings of his folk and their adventures. Once past the quibbling about the content, sit back and revel in the sheer beauty of Picano's prose. He is a wordsmith who can talk about most any subject and make it better than many others can even suppose. Again, go back again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thick web of intrigue","review":"Ross Ohrenstedt finds himself playing literary detective when he finds an unknown document among those by famous author Damon Von Slyke, one of the Purple Circle. As he sifts through the information to find the author of the unknown piece, he finds himself in an ever-tightening web of mystery that threatens to snap before he can find out whether an unknown writer heavily influenced the major works of the Purple Circle. Drawing from his history with the Violet Quill, Picano has woven a clever and amazing book that soars as much as it bewilders the reader. The mesmerizing plot drew me further and further into the book, and yet the ending seemed out of place, leaving me unfulfilled. I love the parts about the fictional authors and history especially. This book is most recommended to anyone interested in gay literature's history (even though it's not non-fiction), but be warned that the title is \\"The Book of Lies\\", and it lives up to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"I'm so grateful that I found this video.

To the skeptics, I wish to say this: I am convinced that Castaneda has accurately described the world as it is today, in a way that our society cannot accept, but which is actually more practical and holistic than our steadfast denial of the existence of \\"forces which shape and control our lives.\\" There is more to life than we know, and society is responsible for our blindness.To the true believers and self-styled shamans who love to converse about this stuff as if they were experts, I say: Learn to spell and your credibility will be greatly enhanced.Thank you for your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"the eagles gift - how to dream your way to freedom.","review":"The eagle's gift is the first of the casteneda series that dives the reader into the world of dreaming. Casteneda has evolved from the shaman's apprentice to being the one in charge of the party of sorcerers. His evolution leads him to dreaming practices that build upon the basic abstract cores that are outlined in his earlier books. The dreaming is actually an advanced way to further the apprentices understanding of awareness... always with the purpose of strengthening one's connecting link with intent and building a concentration on the spirit. The connecting link with intent becomes unbending intent which eventually serves as the way to total freedom. The goal is to gain the totality of one's self by nurturing one's awareness through dreaming. The fixation of attention on a solid object in quick gazes ie. to the object and away from the object is one of the preliminary techniques introduced in the eagle's gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential reading","review":"If you get 2 books by Carlos Castaneda Get - Journey to Ixtlan - and - The eagles giftMay I add - I share the same opinions as the reader from germany"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Do Many Tricks!","review":"yo you can't do many tricks. this game is very hard.

That mood is very compatible with the traditional African society Mma Ramotswe is part of. That same pacing and charm is used to advantage in \\"44 Scotland Street\\" as well. It's engaging to have a Bridget Jones-like character's tale told in such a detached, avuncular way.McCall Smith brings that gentility to these short stories about three German professors. The professors live an insular, old-fashioned existence and these stories describe their awkward encounter with the world. Although the professors experience physical injury (for example, in a duel where the unfortunate bookish student has never held a sword before) we aren't asked to empathize, but merely to feel bemused.If you don't expect too much from these stories, you can enjoy them one by one before nodding off. But they are light, and didn't really leave me craving for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not #1 Lady's Detective Agency","review":"I purchased all of this series and now think I was a little rash.This series for me held little of the enjoyment I found with Mma Ramotswe ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pompous ass makes a splash","review":"Portugese Irregular Verbs, as you may have guessed from the title, is about a very superficially self-satisfied college professor, with a VERY limited field of study. He and his colleges bore each other to tears at their exclusive conferences. Our protagonist is delightfully stuffy and he finds himself in a number of amusing corners. This is a smile to yourself book, not a laugh out loud book. If you have ever known a college professor, you must read it. Don't, however, read it if you love Precious from the #1 Ladies Detective Agency and you are looking for a similar character. You will be greatly disappointed. This book actually pleased me because it demonstrated the great flexablilty of Alexander McCall Smith and his ability to write more than one character with skill. It's very short- it will only take and hour or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh-out-loud funny","review":"Rarely do books make me laugh out loud but these satiric tales of a German philologist and his misadventures had me rolling on the floor.

There is one very funny line and premise, but it could have been delivered in a 3 page short story.

I thought for one chapter that von Iglefeld could grow on me, but it never happened. Some of the characters get interesting, but you don't get enough time with them. The overall story is more of a hair than a thread, but that wouldn't be a problem if there were some heart in this book.

After the first couple jabs at these pompous doctors, it got tiring. I read every single book in the Ladies Detective series and couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the next Precious Ramotswe story.

But the rest is magnificent. All the singers are great and the album features some of Jim's best songs ever.

Okay, I thought I could still use it by moving it away from the kitchen and swapping it with one like all the others in the house. Wrong... 1am, alarms go off, ok.. where's the fire. Oh, it's the stupid alarm going off for no apparent reason. So, I happen to have a spare (model i12060.. these are great!).. replaced it in 5 minutes thanks to Kidde's generally good designs, and I'm back off to bed, thankfully without having a fire to deal with.

I didn't realize it couldn't be hushed until it went off yesterday -- big minus. We're not getting false alarms so much now when cooking, but at least with the other one we could silence it with the touch of a button. Now it's a real headache. Also this one's not as easy to fit into the mounting ring as the others, doesn't have a front battery door, and generally feels cheaper.

These should only be interconnected to Kidde or FireX devices with the red wire. Was very easy to change the connection wire which was included in the box. You just remove the wire nuts and twist the wire nuts back on. No cutting or stripping required. I recommend watching a tutorial on youtube on how to use wire nuts. Luckily the wiring was done by a licensed electrician in 1995. I never owned the Kidde PE120. I don't know why people are posting bad reviews for the Kidde PE120 on the new Kidde P12040 page.

It gave me more information than I expected, providing real time information from over 50 sensors as well as providing the both present and history fault codes with their descriptive information. I agree with other reviewers that the supplied OBD II cable was too short and the screen was difficult to read.

They become friends and reminisce together. The kelpie gives the woman a necklace of pearls from the bottom of the kelpie's lake. When a greedy wanderer finds out about the pearls, trouble begins. Included in the tale are the loch ness monster, an abused boy who loves nature, tourists, scientists looking for the l-n monster, magic, and a description of the peace which comes to the old woman riding away on the kelpie (transformed into the death horse) as she is returned to her youth and beauty. The words and phrasing made me try to imitate a Scottish accent, for they were too beautiful to read in my midwest voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pom Pom Streamers","review":"My daughter loves these Pom Pom Streamers.

This album is as good now as it ever was. I can't believe I've gone without this for so many years. \\"5:45\\" is such an amazing song I've listened to it about a hundred times in the car, and it seems as much about the world today as it did about the world back then. Nobody at the time sounded like this. Now I know the record company people thought they were doing us a favor by adding bonus tracks, but this is one of those albums that is perfect the way it is, like Wire's \\"Pink Flag,\\" and I could have done without the extra stuff.

I have the \\"A Brief History of the Twentieth Century\\" release and was hesitant to purchase the \\"Entertainment!\\" re-release because I'd only be gaining a few tracks (plus the \\"bonus tracks\\" only two of which are very interesting to me--the alt tracks). Anyway, you can hear the much improved sound quality on any stereo: computer speakers; car stereo; hi-fi. It's awesome.Naturally, this is a classic release... but I already knew this. You'll see the other reviews comment on this fact. (Though, I find it amusing when folks say how Gang of Four was such a big influence for this year's flavor-of-the-month band--Gang of Four is a big influence for lots of rock!)

Obviously GoF had a big influence on the noise-rock movement of the late 80s/early 90s but that gets their accolades only so far. If you want the GoF sound done right just buy any Fugazi album and avoid this piece of Novelty Muzak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Honestly, I really dissapointed because I never got my cd until today since I ordered the cd over a month ago.

So, I bought it recently expecting it to be some fantastic testament like Sgt. Pepper or some other ground breaking album. But, I just cannot seem to understand why Entertainment! is repeatedly ranked as a masterpiece. The music sounds sparse and empty. Actually, this album is just plain boring. I know I would have appreciated it more had I grown up with it, but it just seems not that great and certainly overrated. Perhaps this is why there are so many used copies available...If you already are a Gang of Four fan, you will not be disappointed with this continuation of Rhino's fantastic attention to detail with this reissue. But, if you are just testing the waters for the first time, you may be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too negative.....","review":"Despite their obvious talent, I can't approve of this album. It is full of negative songs with bad feelings like pessimism and anger. It's not the sort of music that we need as a society. The music on this album is very jarring and harsh- in other words, it isn't melodic enough. The songs on this album are very dissonant and deal with unsettling topics, but never see the brighter side of things. Music is supposed to reassure us, not make us upset. I prefer Billy Joel as an artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"What many seem to miss when assessing the Gang of Four's seminal \\"Entertainment!\\"is that beyond all its influence and overt politics at its heart there's a very entertaining piece of rock n'roll and not a lumpen record to revere from the distance without playing regularly.\\"Entertainment!\\"is simply as exciting as rock gets and one blast of it could galvanize a zombie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most influential records ever","review":"Just read the quotes on the liners from people who admire this album: everyone from Michael Stipe to Flea of the Chili Peppers. You can hear little droplets of influence in a lot of bands that followed (whether they knew it or not!). Really a classic record and one that sounds just as fresh today. Essential post-punk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not really familiar with them.","review":"I'm not really familiar with Gang of Four.I really like the song I love a man in Uniform.I would like to hear more songs like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raging anger that is sonically beautiful","review":"Entertainment by Gang of Four is one of my favorite albums of all time. While it would seem at first as if there was nothing subtle about the music, what with the guitars and vocals screaming in rage, the funky backbeat helps to dampen down the fury enough to allow the listener to get into a very mellow groove. The 8 bonus tracks provide added value. Essential punk funk."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this - seriously.","review":"Straight up, this is one of the best rock albums you will ever hear. This band has influenced just about everybody in your record collection. If you're curious about GOF, YOU MUST START WITH THIS RECORD! But, for the most part, if you don't know this band....wake up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainy Days make for a Dreary Read","review":"I usually can't put a Ruth Rendall novel down once I start it but it was not the case here. The beginning of the novel starts out with a strange religious ritual of some type leaving you wondering what is about to occur. It isn't until much later that you discover the purpose of it which I found very confusing. I also didn't like the side story about Inspector Wexford's daughter which seemed to be a filler since the story was so weak about the missing baby sitter and the two children she was watching who suddenly disappear without a trace. Also, the constant rain and flooding was a strange backdrop which again seemed like words to fill up the pages without a real purpose to the story.As always, her characters are always very unusual with some type of dark background. This was the only strong part to me. The babysitter and her cougarish ways was the most interesting part of the story. Overall, I recommend staying away from the book. YOu will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Inspector returns","review":"Among the handful of mystery characters we always look forward to welcoming again is Insp. Wexford, and Rendell has brought him back in fine form in a plot that is startling and fresh. The charaters are so peculiar and rich and Rendell offers such psychological insights (as well as the pathologies of many) that this tale could easily have come from Barbara Vine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Matters.","review":"Rendell does a masterful job of spinning together the twin threads of crime and family in this novel. In _Babes in the Woods_ the crime is not what you think, families are not what you think, and you find that when the floods recede, most appearances can be deceiving.One of the better Wexford mysteries, and well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absorbing read","review":"Chief Inspector Wexfords' home is surrounded by rising floodwaters, as are the homes of everyone in his town of Kingsmarkam. A distraught and hysterical woman contacts the local police, convinced that her two teenaged children and their babysitter have drowned in the floodwaters, even though there is no reason to place them anywhere near the dangerous area.M/s Rendell introduces many fascinating-albeit nasty- characters into the story...a weird religous cult who is trying to control the mind of the missing teenaged boy, and the inner workings of the boys seemingly normal family, who are dominated by an aggressive and robustly rude father.Wexford and his wife Dora are horrified when their daughter Sylvia introduces her latest lover, an abusive man who exerts an unhealthy influence over her to the extent that she disregards her experience with abused women, feeling that it is different in her case.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to other readers of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soggy","review":"Sub-par Rendell, with characters who are difficult to distinguish from each other, a meandering plot, little narrative drive and no memorable writing. Wexford's daughter Sylvia has yet more man trouble in her life as a sub-plot. There's also some sort of odd Christian Druid cult that was not particularly convincing. Is there anything really like this in Britain? What one mainly remembers about this tale is that it rained a great deal during the investigation and everyone got wet. Much inferior to her earlier Wexfords and even 2007's Not in the Flesh, something of a rebound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"This was a present for my boyfriend who collects NIN music. When I got it, it was in a flimsy, aftermarket looking case and the artwork did not appear to be original. I doubt this is the way this single was originally sold. If I hadn't had to wait so long to get this to my boyfriend, I would have tried to send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bag of (mixed) tricks","review":"When the Chieftains do their traditional thing, they're matchless. Even some of their more experimental tracks are riveting, such as Matt Molloy's spooky arrangement of \\"The Strayaway Child\\" and Van Morrison's lively \\"Boffyflow and Spike.\\" The Nanci Griffith solo is less effective, mainly because the recording accentuates the piercing quality of her voice (on the average boom box, this track is downright painful to listen to!). The \\"Millennium Celtic Suite\\" leaves me cold because it doesn't show off any of the participants well; I guess you had to have been there. In general, this is an interesting album, but the overall quality isn't as high as on many of their others."},{"rating":"1","title":"i agree 100%-this is not a calamity jane soundtrack!!!","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed to finally discover a cd w/tracks from the foot-stomping, whip-smacking, grand old musical, Calamity Jane, starring the one and only Doris Day.

I'm 16 years old and can appreciate this, so I'm sure you will too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tin Sound Ruins Great Soundtrack","review":"I bought this recording as I loved the film version of the Pajama Game. However, the sound is often too 'tinny' or too brassy sounding. Also, for some reason, the order of the songs on the cd is out of sync with the order in the film. The \\"Finale\\" was put before \\"Hey There\\" , \\"Steam Heat\\", and \\"71/2 Cents\\"..so for those of you who think the songs were omitted, double-check your cd!! Of course, it's possible they were dropped by mistake by the company..I bought mine a few years ago. I wonder if the newly remasterd version, released last year, sounds any better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pajama Game Soundtrack","review":"The CD of Pajama Game's soundtrack is missing one of it's major songs -\\"HEY THERE\\".

When running the check mail feature, it would slowlyeat up virtual memory until the swap file was >1GB andI had to kill the process.. This could, of course, be a configuration issuerather than a problem with the product but the real problem started when I tried to get help. Barring paying their supportline to get their product to work, the only recourse appears to be a chat line. I spent an hour on the chat line performing steps which it was obvious to me weren't the problem. The mostannoying part was that some of these steps required a reboot and thus reconnect to the chat and when I did that, I was told the person I spoke to a minute earlier was \\"gone for the day\\". This happened twice in an hour forcing me to start all over and describe the problem and what had been tried,etc. until I finally gave up on them and the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No time to figure it out!!!","review":"Installed the software and it completely reconfigured my Outlook Express, while not helping immediately with the spam. Filters were for individual messages so each new message would have it's own filter - why bother? Probably a good program but I don't have the time to put into it. A program like this should run seamlessly! It also installed Mcaffe security center which constantly pestered me and couldn't be turned off or uninstalled without uninstalling Spamkiller!! I have uninstalled everything and will put up with the spam until they get it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly Effective In Reducing SPAM","review":"No program is going to be 100% effective in eliminating SPAM as spammers are continually coming up with ways to get around filters and the like. That being said, this is a fairly good product. After a few days of tweaking, it's been over 75% effective in reducing the amount of SPAM in my inbox. I agree with the previous reviewer in that the main drawbacks are that it doesn't integrate with your email program (I use Outlook Express) and that it defaults to viewing the killed email rather than the live email upon launching the program. So far it has been 100% effective in getting rid of the sex related SPAM and its filters have effectively removed SPAM that I know I could not have filtered myself using the message rules in Outlook Express. Overall, I am happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"This would make good freeware","review":"This is the type of product that makes you scratch your head wondering whether it was worth the purchase or not. It really doesn't add much beyond the normal filtering capabilities of MS Outlook or Outlook Express. You have to invest the time to set up rules for filtering in order to make it halfway decent. There's nothing to distinguish it from the plethora of other anti-spam software out there.McAfee recently purchased the rights to a competing anti-spam product, which many feel is a superior product (Spam Assassin). Hopefully they will use the technology to improve on Spamkiller in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked properly","review":"I wasted over eight hours trying to get this software to work properly. It frezzes up on certain spam, typically large emails. I sent an email to McAfee which was unanswered. It is MUCH easier to manually delete my own spam. I removed this software from my system and use Outlook filters only.

Purchased my chest for $156.00 with no shipping (no tax added; you must pay that yourself as is the case with all Internet purchases that do not collect tax). The only drawback with such a large chest is that once filled, it is very heavy. The chest alone has heft. The handles are not particularly comfortable for lifting. If the handles were fully rounded, that would be better. I guess this chest, once filled, is best left in place and not carried about. This is important if you intend to store the chest in a place where you must \\"get it down\\" when you intend to use the flatware.

If you are thinking \\"Pretty Woman\\", you couldn't be more off. \\"The Center of the World\\" is more reminiscent of \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" with a hint of \\"Exotica\\", \\"Last Tango in Paris\\" and even some \\"In the Mood for Love\\". This movie starts off slowly and frequent flashback scenes are more than a little annoying at first, but it gets more and more interesting (and disturbing) as the story progresses. The cast is superb and the director Wayne Wang does his best Wong Kar-Wai imitation (and falls short, but hey, there is only one Wong Kar-Wai). The soundtrack is also excellent.For those of you who are concerned about the film's \\"unrated\\" status: yes, it contains a lot of sexually explicit scenes, but it's nothing you haven't seen before, and it's all done quite tastefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"intense sexy drama with leads in great performances","review":"Peter Sarsgaard(The Salton Sea, Empire) is in love with Molly Parker(Bliss1997, Sunshine) who is a hooker& a stripper and so Sarsgaard brings Parker to Vegas for 3 days where then things start to unfold. Sarsgaard's passion for Parker breaks down a wall and she might like him too. Great performances by the leads with some intense, sexual moments, some of which Parker shows some skin, nice..adult drama about obsession.

The characters were well done by the actors, but predictable. Also, the one scene that earned it an unrated listing (lollipop) could have been deleted without removing from the overall message of the movie. It is almost like Wang just wanted to see if he could make the first porn movie with a plot and had to sneak something in the movie that would push it past a standard R rating. I have seen worse films, but my time is too precious to have wasted it on this 88 minute snooze fest. It was too slow and depressing for me. But maybe that is what the lives of a \\"computer geek\\" and a \\"lonely stripper\\" are all about: a few minutes of excitement interspersed with hours of boredom and self-loathing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential not fully developed","review":"Center of the world certainly has a good premise. However the movie seems to favor explicit \\"eroticsm\\" over character development. when the film ended I kinda wished it was longer. I guess that's a good thing. But the reason why is that I didn't get to know these people. WHy is the guy such a social [misfit]? He being a computer whizz doesn't fully explain it. I thought some of the cutesy moments like her being a southern belle talking dirty in the bar, was a little forced. But over all I felt the film mainly wanted to titilate, with some sheens of artistry here and there.

For instance, it is difficult to even compare the NJ version of I'm Still Here, with the wildly emotional Carol Burnett rendition. In the same likeness, Mandy Patinkin delivers his performance with such energy and emotion, that's it's impossible NOT to fall in love with his unique voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good recording.","review":"The original is my perferred version, even though it is very watered down. Here, all the songs are complete, but it comes out uneven somehow. The really great performers here are Carol Burnett and Barbra Cook. They really shine. The rest do mediocre performances.

I think a real standout performance on this recording is Carol Burnett's version of \\"I'm Still Here\\". It's amazingly heart-felt and gives me goosebumps *every* time. The gradual build-up and release at the end is just amazing. She's fabulous.And what is there to say about Barbara Cook that hasn't already been said? I just saw her perform live recently, and I can't believe that her voice is apparently ageless. She's a national treasure.I usually like Mandy Patinkin, but I found his performance somewhat grating. I found myself wishing they had done what the original cast recording had done and used a woman to play Margie instead of his manic impersonation.In spite of that, though, I highly suggest this CD.

The classic collection is still Perry's 1958 album \\"Como's Golden Records\\" which was released on CD a few years after this one. To call this set Perry's \\"All Time Greatest Hits\\" is certainly a misnomer but no less foolish than other attempts to do the same thing. BMG should focus on a theme and do it well, the 40s, the 50s, the 60s etc., or even the 70s from which one out of context song is included here. Perry's fans cover a wide range and the selection here is random at best and disjointed at the worst. The technical quality of these recordings is OK but nothing special and nothing rare!

I've tried every suggestion from other reviewers and the static is unbearable. I commute to Detroit weekly and tried it out on the long drive today and it turned itself off after about 20 minutes. I reset the station again and about 5 minutes later it completely cut out again and went to pure static.

I have the iPhone 5 now and I have to turn the volume up high on my phone and my car stereo to hear the music. I agree with another review that it sounds like the music is coming from a distant radio. It does seem to come in a little better and clearer with my daughters i-touch 4. I have tried several different stations to see if reception improved, but to no avail, it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap price, Cheap device","review":"You definitely get you pay for.

I bought this to watch TV/movies on ipod in car. The device will repeatedly shutoff unless you are playing music. Like every minute. The dialogue is insufficient to keep it on. Probably a problem for audiobooks as well.Beware. If you are doing it for music - it seems the same as every other fm transmitter I've ever had - adequate, not great, very dependent on surrounding signals."},{"rating":"1","title":"No signal strength !","review":"Not worth purchasing.

In the Detroit area it is difficult to find free frequency that will stay free. This means as you drive through other communities you have to retune the device. It may be nice if the device had some presets but then you are still huntin around for a free frequency while driving.So this product should not be used in lare metropolitan areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a keeper","review":"This was a complete waste of money.

There is a screeching noise I hear in the background as I accelerate, or decelerate while driving. I heard background feedback while the song is being played. It is sometimes unbearable and I can't even listen and enjoy the song I am playing. More often than not I find myself turning my Ipod off and trying to find something worthwhile on the radio. Also, there is a port for a USB in the device but I have been unable to figure out how this will play my music media files through my car's stereo. In hindsight I shouldn't have bought a FM adapter and spent more money on a device that connects directly to the ipod and AC port."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I had high expectations of this receiver. I am terribly disappointed.1. The sound is terrible. There is a lot of static and humming.

I set it on 87.9 but after 2-3 minutes it drifts to 88.1 or such and I have to push the preset button to bring it back to 87.9. (I have all preset to 87.9) It continues to drift every 2-3 minutes.

I've only tried it in and around Pittsburgh. Have gone through all available stations including the international ones such as 87.7 and 87.9, but the sound quality is not acceptable.

The idea of using a frequency just below the standard FM range (where no interference would get in the way) is a great theory if it worked. With this device it does not. The signal was 30% static and wavered in and out just sitting in my garage. I live in an very rural area where receiving commercial radio is difficult so I thought I should be a good candidate for this kind of solution. No solution here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This transmitter is horrible. I did change it to international mode like other reviews said however it still sounded like crap.

I finally found that it could play my old hippy folk songs perfectly....but when you add a bass guitar to the song...it fuzzes up and pretty much gives you a static sound.

The connector did not fit the lighter properly, which seemed to create excessive static; it was completely useless. After several emails to IPodAccs, they agreed to send me an upgrade once I provided payment to cover the upgrade difference. The upgrade works okay, but is not close to the quality of the previous transmitter that I lost recently. If I had to do it again, I would pay the extra money to receive the best quality possible; you get what you pay for when it comes to this type of product. I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed that they were initially unwilling to resolve the problem, however, after a litte persistence, they conceded. With that said, I didn't have to involve Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"ipod transmitter","review":"This product does work. I am able to hook my ipod up and have it play through my car speakers which is good. When you loose the currrent frequency or get static during a song its not so good.

It doesn't work even with the international setting that another reviewer said worked great. The static from this device is overwhelming despite trying to find every unused FM station on the digital dial. It's a piece of junk and not worth the $18 I paid for it. I would not recommend buying anything from ShopCell their return policy is only for 30 days and it's terrible. I would also be very careful when buying anthing from Amazon Marketplace it is usually items that are cheap and defective. Buyer beware!!!

There is a loud audible whine coming from my car's acceleration that I have never heard in other transmitters. Also, even when I have it tuned to the least used station in the county, I still get static on the bass beats. Occassionally the static goes away, but rarely for more than 30 seconds which makes it all the more noticeable when it comes back. I'd rather listen to my music than listen for the static to come back all the time. Also my product shipped with a slightly damaged LCD screen (couple blank spots).I recommend the monster version, even though it doesnt have the charging capability of this model. I'll probably keep this but hack off the tuner just for the USB charger on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for the buy","review":"Although not quite perfect, the signal strength and sound quality of this item are probably the best of any fm transmitter I've used.And for the price, this thing is a steal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I bought one of these about two years ago for my job, which was transportation, and our company vehicle didn't have a cd player. Here are the two biggest problems with this product:1. The sound came out mono, so it was like only listening to half of the band play.2. The device would shut off every five to ten minutes if the mp3 player was charging simultaneously.Overall, not totally crappy, but there are many many better options out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and inexpensive","review":"I just received this the other day and have used it several times with my laptop,mp3 player,and phone. I just plugged it in and it was set on 88.5,I turned my radio there and it worked perfectly. One thing is the sound on your device(laptop,mp3 player) may have to be turned down some. I found that if the volume is way up it distorts or you get static. Turning the device down does not hinder the volume coming through the radio,so it can still be turned up quite loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"good enough","review":"I'm using this transmitter with a creative zen mozaic and it works pretty much exactly how i expected it to. It's dead simple and the only real complaint i have with it is the fact that it seems to distort bass as the volume goes lower or higher, though i've found the sweet spot to be right aroun 3/4 volume and then just adjust the stereo volume. other than that it works perfectly. the usb vs. ipod specific is nice b/c it means i can charge anything which can be charged via usb. One thing i've noticed is when i do charge my zen mozaic it doesnt seem to recognize its being charged, but i believe this is an issue with creative products, not the transmitter. overall it works for what i wanted and it was relatively cheap so im happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusuable Product","review":"This product works by sending an FM broadcast to your stereo's antenna, where it's received by your car. In theory the signal broadcast should be strong enough to overpower ambient FM radio signals. In an urban or suburban environment, this is not the case. The sound quality is highly distorted at best, even when you set it on the FM station with the weakest broadcast signal in your area. My advice to you: unless you're living on the North Pole, do not purchase this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Item.","review":"This is a good item and this was the third one I got. Mainly cause of something I did to the previous ones. however this ones sound quality and connection kind of stunk and did not work.

So I suggest buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I got this after seeing mixed reviews and actually hearing how it worked because my friend had one... I am very satisfied with the product so far. The signal is pretty much always great, even in bad areas. The only small complaint I might have is that you have to turn down your iPod volume pretty low in order for it to not sound \\"scratchy\\". But that really hasn't caused any problems. Love it!! Great alternative when I don't have a cassette player or a direct aux plug in. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great item for your mp3 player","review":"My son told me to order this when I complained about not being able to listen to music in my cd player-less van.

This is all you need!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suited for iPhone (or anything else that matter)","review":"The product packaging when I purchased at a retail chain advertised that it \\"Works with iPhone.\\" Fundamentally it \\"works\\" with iPhone but only because it uses the same jack size as any generation iPod. However, technically, it does not \\"work as advertised\\" with an iPhone or in the presence of any cellular device period. Any cellular device coming within a foot of this thing's cable causes extreme interference. In the case of the iPhone the only way to prevent such interference is to turn on \\"Airplane Mode\\" within the phone's settings.Additionally the product fails to overpower other automotive transmitters and often gets drowned out by passing vehicles' transmitters.Overall I suggest you find a more powerful transmitter with better shielding from high-frequency signals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never change your radio station again","review":"All you need to know is that there is an international mode that allows this device to operate in completely empty frequencies in the 80s. To accomplish this, hold down the \\"preset\\" button until the US mode flashes. Change it to international. Then go down to 87.7 or 87.9 and enjoy a clear band.If you have the problem of the international mode power saving bug (the device shuts off automatically after one minute, no matter what volume you set your audio device to), just save the low frequencies to the memory, then switch back to US mode. Your transmitter will say that you are at 107.9FM, but it's actually at 87.7 or 87.9, and the power saving bug is not an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Device turns itself off every 50 seconds!","review":"This product has a \\"feature\\" that automatically turns the transmitter off after 50 seconds of no audio. Sounds like a convenient feature, right? The problem is that even at maximum volume on my Palm Pre, the device detects no audio and turns off every 50 seconds. On my iPod, it does detect audio while I'm listening to music, but if I listen to spoken word audio (such as an Audiobook or Podcast), it does not detect the audio and turns off every 50 seconds.In the rare circumstance that the transmitter isn't turning off, it worked great (after switching it to international mode and using 87.9 FM to avoid interference from local radio stations)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second time, NOT a Charm.","review":"This is the second iTrip I have bought. The first, bought three years ago, works much better and I paid about $30 for it. They appear to be the exact same unit, but the transmitter audio quality on this second one is very poor.

When those devices are used, you might get this message: \\"This accessory is not made to work the iPhone\\" or \\"This accessory is not supported by iPhone.\\" It will then give you the option of putting the iPhone into AirPort mode. But you can ignore that option, or you click yes.I didn't realize before ordering this charger that I could use the DLO charge and player that I have for my 5th generation iPod.

My main complaint is that it does not charge my shuffle, but since my pod is charged using a plug and not a USB, that may be why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice","review":"I bought two of these and they are both defective.

When actually receiving product, it took me a while to figure out how to effectively use it. At first, upon plugging in the device it had a great deal of static and I thought it didn't work. What the key to do is, play around w/the volume on both the MP3 device, Ipod or other, and also w/the car stereo to balance them. Another tip is to find radio stations that have nothing on them, preferrably 3 stations in a row and then choosing the one in the middle of the three. For example, if you find that 88.1, 88.3 and 88.5 are pretty clear, use 88.3."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORKS (minimally)","review":"As soon as i plugged in my iPod Touch and found a station, it worked perfectly. I was quite skeptical of the quality of the product, and was pleasantly surprised to hear \\"You Give Love a Bad Name\\" in almost crystal clarity. That was until the car began moving. At that point, static took over and there was no music to be heard. Since then, I have spent many car rides searching for viable channels, to no avail. At best, it is like listening to a cassette recorded from an old, scratched record. I even tried the international option, but I found that the stations deemed as the solution all had radio broadcasting loud and clear through them. I only payed $8 including shipping for this item retailed for $50 elsewhere, but it was still quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"just so so","review":"The frequency selected (such as 87.7) is not stable.

This one did not work well for me (04 Mustang, South NJ). Someone else I know had this one also, and it didn't work well in their Mazda Tribute or Toyota Camry. The signal was very static-y on every single frequency I tried. I eventually bought one by Monster and I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok sound but not enough power","review":"The sound is decent enough, although not great.

This actually works quite well. I was nervous when I first purchased it, but am very pleased with the product. A little adjusting the volume controls and it's perfect.

I replaced this with theXm Auto Cassette Adapterand haven't looked back."},{"rating":"1","title":"turns off constantly","review":"I like this product fine -- when it works. However, no matter what I do, it turns off after a minute of use. The instructions say that it's designed to shut off \\"after 50 seconds of silence\\", in order to save power. Apparently, its idea of silence is VERY skewed, because the only way I can get it to stay awake is to turn it up so loudly that the audio distorts (it's peaking/overloading). It's unusable, so I'm going to return it and go with a different brand.Iphone 3GS users beware: I got almost no GPS reception when this product was plugged into my phone's audio port."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Transmitter!","review":"I've had three radio transmitters before this one and none of them came close to the sound quality as this one.

By holding down the preset button you can setup Preset stations you want to use. You can setup 4 different channels I setup 87.8 and 87.9. By holding down the preset button longer you can change form LX to DX but I have no idea what that does. Finally by holding down the preset button for 15 seconds or so you get the US/Intl setting (mentioned in together reviews). This lets you set to international mode which then allows you to set a wide range of frequencies. I used the low end 87.8 and 87.9. I then plugged in my Droid Incredible fired up some music, plugged the droid charger into the Griffin USB port and done! Great music in my car easy as pie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk, stay away!","review":"Piece of junk, does not even work!

I put it into international mode so I could get it to use 87.7-9, and it had good enough sound quality for me.However with the shutting off issue I think I'm just going to spend the money to get a new deck for my car with an auxillery in.

This is an energy saving feature which turns the unit off when it doesn't sense a signal, which is all well and good, but it doesn't work!

Do yourself a favor and get something else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky residue; charger plug gets hot","review":"Right after opening the package, I was not impressed. When I removed the screen protector from the transmitter unit, it left a sticky residue behind. Maybe this is because of the humidity and temperature today, but they should use a different adhesive on the screen protector.The charger runs hot. Like another reviewer suggested, maybe it would be better to get a separate charger and transmitter.I initially tested it in my living room with my main stereo. I was not impressed with the audio quality of the transmitter. (I have a power supply with a cigarette jack that runs off 120 VAC.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!!","review":"After searching for days for the perfect FM transmitter, I settled with this one-- and it was a great choice! My boyfriend doesn't own an iPod and his car's cigarette lighter is actually located against the gear shifter by our thighs. This limited my options but this one works wonders! The mp3 player we have (Sansa) works easily with it, we can read the channel in the car because the digital readout is located further down on a wire instead of with the charger, and amazingly we found station 88.5 and it works for his regular trip between Orange County and the LA Sports Arena, a place with definitely heavy air traffic. Whats crazy is that in LA this station is actually in use! The transmitter is strong enough to block out the entire station! We don't hit static, the \\"s\\"s dont sound like stereo, and the entire setup is very tiny and easy to handle. I'm very happy with this product and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better option then a iPOD only version","review":"This device works well since it has almost full range of the FM dial (however it does not go down to 87.9 or what ever the lowest frequency our car's radio does). The USB port on the back makes it easy to charge the iPod (as long as you have the cable) or any other USB chargeable device (i.e. blackberry, etc...). This allows you to mange the battery on your iPod by not always having it plugged it; which will kill it faster then normal use.The only down side I have seen is cell phones interfere with it, and you can get noise if the unit is hit (this is not a big deal as normally it is not touched while listening to an audio book or netcast)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I was very disappointed when I plugged in the transmitter and only heard the music for a few minutes before I had to start scanning for stations. Living in a city poses problems- there are few open stations to tune into. I tried setting it to international stations as another reviewer suggested, but that did not help. Maybe if I lived in a rural area, I might have been able to tune in. But I cannot imagine having to keep changing channels when driving long distances. I returned the transmitter and bought a $6 adapter to plug into my car's stereo system."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"I won't dog it completely, but I will say that even out in the middle of the desert I still get static.

The Griffin iTrip works very well in my car ('00 Saturn, Pioneer CD deck, in South Central WI). I made the mistake of not getting a deck with an Aux jack when I purchased a new one in Fall 2005, but I didn't yet have an mp3 player at the time and had no intention of purchasing one.... little did I know!On the other hand, I had previously on 2 occasions bought one of the Belkin Tunecast models and they were both wretched, and were promptly returned both times. Yet, based on the reviews, they seem to work well for some people.The price on the Griffin seems to be coming down, so definately give it a try. And you can even charge your mp3 player on the go with your own USB cable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be great, if it worked","review":"The iTrip Auto Universal+ could be a great product, if it actually worked. The auto-off feature works so well that unless you have your MP3 player cranked and are listening to loud music it shuts off after a minute. It also has fairly weak output compared to similar products. The good features are it can broadcast on any station, has presets to remember the best frequencies to broadcast, and it can charge your MP3 or other devices through its built in USB power connector.

It has a strong signal and channel scan. Channel scan is good for long distance trips where you may pick up new frequencies and need to switch stations.

No channel works even when I leave the metro area and go out into the country.

The price was even better through Amazon, and the one I purchase works as well as the one it replaces. Be sure to buy a charging cable for your device (mine is an iPod touch, so it needs recharging if I am watching movies on long car trips).

I was wrong! This thing randomly shuts down during anything but very intense music. Works great for rock. Not compatible with anything remotely sparse, relaxed, ambient.Such a weird feature.This device will not work with any acoustic music except perhaps some frantic bluegrass. No Townes Van Zandt, Johnny Cash, Kevin Kinney, etc etc. This device will turn them off!!You've been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Griffin makes great FM transmitters","review":"This product offers great value for money. Simple to use, good transmission quality. I have had it for about a week now and have been quite satisfied. There is occasional background noise that requires the transmitter to be moved around a little and/or channel changed but that is true of all FM transmitters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't recommend Griffin iTrip Universal FM Transmitter","review":"Bought this item for my wife to use with our 2005 Honda Odyssey and her IPOD NANO. The sound quality varies with each song, the unit randomly powers itself off and the signal strength varies alot and has lots of interference. This has been primarily around town driving in a large city, haven't had an occasion to take on a longer trip yet.Some of the signal issues may be due to electrical interference, but the random turning off and variability in quality and volume are major irritants that make this barely worth using. Not sure if the one specifically for and iPod would be any better or not. Looking to purchase a different brand that works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your $","review":"This thing doesn't put out enough power to clearly play the song thru the radio. The music sounds like it's coming from a distant radio station with a constant static covering it up and fading in and out. Spend the extra money and get the Monster - I have one of those and it works OK. This one is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well but doesn't work long","review":"The product works really well, but after continual use, it just randomly stops working. You have to pull it out of the jack, and then plug it back in. The signal strength is really good, and its extremely easy to use, but it doesn't work consistently. I really like the sound quality, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Piece of Crap","review":"This device is utterly worthless. I bought one for the car and any music that I listened to with any thick textures was hardly recognizable. Lots of static, lots of noise, horrible. Also, the cigarette lighter plug would come unplugged after going over bumps in the road. It's amazing that I didn't kill myself or someone else between Boulder and Denver while trying to find a frequency that didn't make Modest Mouse sound like screaming zombies. This might work OK in the boonies where there aren't a lot of closely spaced radio stations, but if you plan on using this in the city buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THERE A BETTER WAY?","review":"I own one of these things. I live in Chicago, the big city. I cannot get crystal clear sound quality, using this thing. The \\"magic\\" wavelength that everyone talks about, is not on my FM band, nor is it on the iTRIP. There were no instructions. I think that if I lived out in the rural south somewhere, this thing would probably work perfectly. This is the ONLY reason, that I did not give it just one star. WHY ISN'T THERE A CONTRAPTION WHERE YOU CAN PLAY YOUR MP3 MUSIC THROUGH THE CD PLAYER, INSTEAD OF BEING AT THE MERCY OF FM RECEPTION? The performance of this transmitter has been very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAS REALLY RUDE WHEN THEY RESPONDED TO MY LAST EMAIL.","review":"\\"I RECEIVED THE ITEM BUT IT DID NOT WORK.

It was suppose to be an all in one device, i.e charger and player; but, after carefully reading the enclosed directions, I couldn't even get the device to charge or play the iphone. It may work on an mp3 player, but I'm not taking my chances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use as a last resort","review":"The Griffin iTrip Universal Transmitter and Charger does work once you find a station that doesn't get interference from radio broadcasts. I didn't realize when I purchased this that the sound quality would be so bad though. Reading about FM transmitters, this probably isn't any worse or better than any other FM transmitter. If you don't mind your music sounding like it is being played through a thin pillow, you really can't go wrong for the price of this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Griffin I-Trip","review":"This product does not work near as well as expected. Certain days it works well and then other days it does not work well at all. I would not purchase this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Features, Horrible Quality","review":"I bought this product for 60 bucks at radio shack so that I could charge my mp3 player in the car and listen to it without using all my open cigarette lighters. It features a USB charger, an FM transmitter, and a nice backlit lcd screen to change the station with. However, this device gets too much interference and I find myself constantly searching to find a clear radio station to try it on. even the smallest bit of static will garble this thing up. I ended up just throwing it in the trash and continued to use my old $10 transmitter I got at meijer. While this Transmitter struggles to overcome the tiniest bit of static, my cheapo one can operate with decent quality, and I don't even have to search for an unused station. Yes, the cheapo non-brand transmitter has enough strength to block any interfering signals out, while this one cannot. My advice, don't waste your money and go with somthing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but poor implementation","review":"I returned this item after 2 days of trying to get it to work. I live an hour away from a major city and I was still picking up interference on every channel. I have a Scosche FM Transmitter that get hardly any interference at all. I liked the design with the available USB plug to be able to power my device instead of having a 2 plug splitter, but the constant interference was horrible. I picked up a $15 no name brand item at K-Mart with the same USB plug and it gets less interference. Devices like this shouldn't get interference from weak end of the dial stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sound quality, turns off every 30 seconds","review":"When my ipod crapped out I bought a SanDisk Sansa and the Griffin itrip Universal FM transmitter because I wanted to listed to MP3s in the car. But the itrip turns off every 30 seconds or so, and you have to fiddle around with it to get it to turn back on (which is pretty dangerous when driving), to just have it turn off again 30 seconds later. And driving over 30mph the sound quality decreases dramatically, to the point of just static. My return window is over, so I'm not sure how I'm going to resolve this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"I had the griffen itrip for my ipod, it went on top of the ipod itself. That one was pretty hard to work but once you got it synced up with a radio station, it worked well. This one is not even worth it. When it syncs up to the station you can still hear static the whole time. I have tried every station possible and it doesn't matter. Pluse I have to place the zune in a certain spot in my car or the static is too terrible to listen to. The charger works well, but the part that plugs into the cigerette lighter gets really warm, almost hot. I believe you're better off buying these items separately. I don't even bother using the griffen part anymore, it is just too fusterating. I am just going to buy a radio with a direct mp3 imput."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only works on a few frequencies","review":"Mine only works on 10 or so of the lower frequencies. lots of static. kind of a pain not having a search function that finds an empty station for you. Not many options out there.

Unfortunately it took less than one minute for them to figure out that if they pulled the screen the elasticized top would move and allow them to jump into the front seat (and eat my lunch!). Perhaps this product would work for those whose animal(s) require only a visual barrier to deter or restrict their movement, but it was not at all effective for confining my two adventurers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't attach to car well - useless for me","review":"I have a Toyota 4Runner and the attachements that come with this net do not allow it to attach to the car. I have to hold it out of the car door and then close the car door on it for it to work. It will not attach to the roof rack or the door in any way.

Our Jeep has a metal tube-style dog barrier that has vertical posts that go from floor to ceiling, and movable crossbars. We hoped the net would not take up as much room, since the cargo area in the Fit is small. It was easy to attach the net to the car, but the elastic cords used to suspend it were too stretchy, even when they were tightly strung. Our dogs could paw the net down enough to clamber over. We were afraid the dogs would get their feet or heads caught in the net. We ended up modifying a metal-tube style blockade instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea- if only it worked...","review":"I intended to use this product for my cat on our 7 hour road trip, so he could have the whole back seat to himself without distracting me up front. It worked for about 3 hours, and then he figured out how to get around it... I can't imagine how this would ever work for a dog. The net is very easy to pull down, even when tightened.As you can see on the picture provided, there are gaps on the sides of, and above the seats that the cat can sneak through.Aside from that, the clips that came with it are pretty much impossible to use- i had to use safety pins.

Maybe I can use it to tie down cargo in the truck bed instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Installation?","review":"I'm not sure how well this product works because I can't install it. The thing keeps getting tangled up in itself for one thing. One of the hook clips has a piece of plastic melding it to itself, which looks like a manufacturer defect, and results in me not being able to attach the clip to anything. I can't figure out how to hook it up at the bottom, and the tighteners on the top and side in the picture are both right next to each other on the side on my net - huh? It also came with two plastic pieces that are mentioned nowhere in the instructions on the back of the box. I can usually figure things out, but after attempting to install this thing for an hour, I give up. I wish the instructions were clearer."},{"rating":"1","title":"great quality, not great for cats.","review":"I bought the rider net because it is very hard for my cats to remain in their crate on my 7 hour drive back home for school. Most other backseat car products are made for large dogs, so when I saw that this didn't have large holes in it and it went from floor to ceiling I was very hopeful. The product was very easy to install in my Honda Accord and for the first hour the cats remained in the back seat with no problem. After an hour though both of them figured out how to climb over and around the net, completely defeating its purpose. The next rest stop I ended up just taking the net down. The product is well made and easy to install, but unless you have calm and non curious animals it probably won't work for your needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"spider web","review":"We were happy with the net.

Now I want back the hours of my life I spent reading it.It's at least 100 pages too long. The idea for the plot is good, (Big Ed and Billy Clyde buy and manage an NFL expansion team) but between the wooden dialogue, the two-dimensional characters, the anti-PC fulminations that even I tired of, and the lines recycled from other novels, the finished product is awful.The only thing that saves this review from getting one star are the occasional original Jenkins-ism, like what he has Jim Tom Pinch say to the Golden Domer out in Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much here for fans of Dan Jenkins","review":"In this novel Dan Jenkins is as racist and raunchy and laugh-out-loud funny as ever.

In his other works the humor seemed to flow effortlessly--especially in \\"Semi Tough\\" and \\"Baja Oklahoma\\" and \\"Dead Solid Perfect.\\" This isn't to say that the current work isn't without its moments. It's merely that it isn't up to Jenkins' own high standards. That's the sad part of a book that is supposed to be funny. Ya gotta play hurt, Dan. Ya gotta take chances to be funny.
